I have a reputation with my friends for being willing to read any fic, any pairing, however lately I've had problems finding good ones. Can include slash, fem!slash, anything, just not common pairings (Harry/Hermione Drarry, Snarry, Jily, Dramione, etc.) And please no Ron centered fics. Please longer than 20,000 words. Also if they are completed even better. Thank you!!!

*** I'm reading Holly Potter first, but I'm not sure how far I'll get into it. The whole "Harry jumps into bed (or every other flat/hard surface) with random stranger" isn't exactly my vibe, but I'm reading along still. I'll definitely look into Equal and Opposite too once I'm done

**** Equal and Opposite is the superior fic probably. It's darker and more serious though. I'm not sure if that's a positive thing for you.

  Left bitter and angry when his female self leaves him, Harry decides he will do anything for revenge. Nobody will stand in his way. Because desperation and anger can turn even the most noblest of hearts into darkness... HarryFemHarry COMPLETE

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13125917/1/Trading-Places][Trading Places]]

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived. But with Voldemort intent on Harry's murder, their days at Hogwarts are numbered, and a showdown with Voldemort seems inevitable.

** Are you interested in unique pairings for the romance or for the smut? If the latter, may I suggest The Pendulum of Choice by Rushlight: [[http://slashcity.org/rushlight/hp/pendulum.htm]]

This is a slash fic that has an AU-hopping Harry who pairs up with numerous characters. There's some of the common pairings you mentioned like Drarry and Snarry. However, there's also Harry/Lucius, and the weirdest to me is Harry/AUHarry/Snape.

Also, it's hosted on a website I'd never seen before. Does anyone know anything about slashcity's origin and/or reputation? Besides, obviously, slash fiction.

**** The fic definitely has plot. Most of it is plot, in fact. It's just that the actual storyline has little to do with the unique pairings. So if you're looking for a fic centered on a unique romantic pairing, this isn't it.
