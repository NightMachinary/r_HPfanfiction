Hi, I love stories that tug on the heartstrings, so anything that features love triangles, heartbreak, etc., as long as it's not slash. My favorite fic is probably "The Ties That Bind" and you can see the rest of my favs on my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2912390/mnidl][profile]]; hopefully, that'll give you an idea of what I'm looking for. Recommend away!


** A couple of one-shots:

Cheddartrek's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8461800/1/The-Twine-Bracelet][The Twine Bracelet]] is quite good.

Also, while much of the story is played for comedy, the ending to Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]] is surprisingly sad.

*** Lovely little stories. Redditors really seem to enjoy one-shots (I love the epics)

I'm so conflicted.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5102870/1/The-Double-Agent][The Double Agent]] isn't as much a romantic heartbreak but is so worth the 15k word read for a tug at the strings.

*** Nicely written story that I hadn't come across before (which is no wonder given its genre tags) - thanks!

** Clarification: you seem to be looking specifically for romantic heartbreak, rather than something like a major character dying and another major character spending appreciable time thinking about this and dealing with it.

** [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=11833][The Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire]] has an amazingly heartbreaking scene in it. I'll often re-read just that scene over and over again.

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?sid=126789][The Meaning of One, Part Two: Chambers and Secrets]] has another one nearer to the beginning.

If you've never read them, skip the first chapter of Part One if you're not into that kind of stuff, I know I haven't finished it, and Part Two is still a W.I.P.

** Revealing that it's a heartache story may be a bit of a spoiler, but my favorite is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2056132/1/Heart-With-No-Companion][Heart With No Companion]]. It's SS/HG, so that may be off-putting for some people. Hermione is in a coma since the Last Battle after jumping in front of a curse meant for Snape. A year later, he's the only one who still visits her. Complete.
