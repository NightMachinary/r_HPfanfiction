Can still be doing something with potions. Or maybe mind healing, cursebreaking, with defence, etc. Just something else where he's not just a Professor

Anyone can be the MC/Any site/Any Length/Old or New

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc.


** Reboot by Kallanit Snape runs a apothecary/potion store with his mother. It's a response to Reptilia28's "Don't Fear the Reaper" challenge and features Harry, Hermione, and Snape returning to the past.

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

**** The story itself is way better than the summary. It's very well-written and incredibly interesting!
