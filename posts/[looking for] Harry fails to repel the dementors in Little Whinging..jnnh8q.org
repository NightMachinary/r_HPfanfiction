could result in he or Dudley (or both) loosing their souls, just looking for a fic dealing with the fall out of that. what would happen with the Ministry, the Order, , Voldy, Mrs. Figg (remember she comes across the boys immediately after Harry repels the dementors in canon). Any fic recs. including this change would be great. No plot/ship/length preferences, would like them complete, but will take what I can get.


** linkffn (The Merging) has just been finished, and starts with that idea.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** linkffn(The Kiss of Death by deathy-cool) isn't a story I'd necessarily recommend, but it's the only one I know that fits, and some people seem to like it. The Dementor's kiss is really just an excuse for fem!Harry to learn magic from dead people while her friends take over the mandatory OotP angsting duty.

  The Dementors Kiss, its history is vast and mostly unknown, information lost over time the true meaning of it, has long since been forgotten by the people of Europe. The kiss is now used as an execution method, but it once had a more meaningful task. FEM Harry, Girl Harry & Starts Summer before fifth year!

** This is stretching your parameters but I hope you enjoy it. Harry runs away from Pivet Drive after receiving his expulsion letter & lackluster response from the Order. Trust me this is like one of the only few good ones of this genre & the fallout is juicy! It appears Harry faked his death linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13316472/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Missing-Friend]])

  Isolating Harry over the summer before 5th year didn't work out like Dumbledore had hoped. Now, with her friend having run away, Hermione is left to pick up the pieces, trying to stand strong against the challenges in a school where racism and injustice are not only tolerated, but actively encouraged by some teachers. All she can do is wonder how Harry made it all look so easy!
