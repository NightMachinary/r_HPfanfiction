Hey guys,

we all know that Harry's (Trust-)Vault is more or less as large as it kind of needs to be (canon never specifies how much money is in his vault, just that it's probably a lot if Harry doesn't need the price money from the TWT and can give it away just like that...what we know however is that he isn't rich, at least compared to the Malfoys (who basically freaking own the minister for magic!)), so I'd like for you to give me fanfictions where Harry earns money at Hogwarts either by selling things (or making them himself) and information (he after all hears a lot of things, with his cloak and all) to other students (and buying things, too like say some student is great at potions and makes his own and sells some to Harry, who then uses them for himself or sell them to other interested parties again) or by doing some extra curricular work!

Bonus points if what he's selling isn't all above board (meaning that he is morally grey instead of white - an "if they kill themselves using this it's not my problem" attitude!)

At best Harry kind of has a sales-representative in each house (to corner the market) who takes a cut but over all sells stuff in Harry's name...kind of like the twins joke shop, but more serious and into buying and selling of everything he can get his hands on!

Hope there are fanfictions like this (I've recently read one where Harry sold potions outside of Hogwarts)

As always: No slash and only very very very well writen Harry/Ginny (I am burned out on this pairing...I started out reading those when I started reading HP-Fanfiction, but the older I got the less appealing it became!)

So, the stage ist yours - thank you in advance for your effort :)

greetings LAX


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11692854/2/Bolt-Fashion][Bolt Fashion]] has a Harry determined to earn money and be successful. It focuses on him doing fashion and jewelry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9894129/1/The-Price-is-Right][The Price is Right]] has a money conscious Harry who sells homework and then study guides.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113588][Business]] has Harry starting a Wizarding crime underground with casinos and bookies.

Last one I can think of is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12438117/1/The-Economic-Power-He-Knows-Not-Year-One][The Economic Power He Knows Not]] which has a money conscious Harry who also starts an art program at Hogwarts.

That last one is a rougher sell, but I tend to place it in the folder with all the other "fiscally responsible businessman Harry" stories I can find. Hard to find really.

linkffn(10507423) Harry starts a gambling ring and other things using the Weasley twins and Theodore Nott as his assistant that deals with Slytherin students. That being said, Harry is a 'Lord' with a lot of money.

  What if instead of locking Harry in his cupboard whenever they didn't want to look at him, the Dursley's had locked him out of the house instead? Maybe this. Self-Sufficient, Independent!Harry.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** okay, so he's not selling things but he is working at Hogwarts. It's not the main point of the story but the fic is funny and entertaining and worth reading. It's actually my favorite Slytherin!Harry. I really enjoyed reading it but sadly it's abandoned :(
