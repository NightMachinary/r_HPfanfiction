** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]] is probably the best Slytherin!Harry fic out there. I'm shocked no one else recced it first.

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/331576][Serpensortia]] trilogy is the only other Slytherin!Harry fic I've really liked.

*** Did you try [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/53590][Leo Inter Serpentes]]? It deviates /a lot/ from canon, but it's gradual and in a way that seems reasonable. Books 1-6 and the author is (slowly) writing the seventh.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8666085/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slytherin-Selection][Harry Potter and the Slytherin Selection.]] (and its sequels)

I actually have no clue why I don't see it recommended more, I really liked it. I also felt that they act like real teenagers in this one, instead of being all political. Harry is still overall a good guy in this one, maybe a bit more confident and cunning than in canon, but still nice.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux][Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux]] In this one he is manipulated and groomed by the horcrux inside of him. He ends up in Slytherin, he's very dark, but I believe he's still good at heart. There's also a sequel, but it's not finished yet.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] He's very dark in this one, but I believe the fic has a very good characterization and really emphasizes the more negative consequences of being a bad guy. The plot is weak, but the characterization is interesting.

*** I haven't read the Slytherin Selection yet because it looks abandoned. I really hate getting into a good story and it suddenly stopping. Is it abandoned? And is it worth reading anyway?

**** Sadly, it does look abandoned, but I think the story is worth reading anyway. I hope the author will pick it up again in the future.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin]]: a fun one overall. i particularly like that despite harry being quite cunning, he is fairly inexperienced, and in the company of true masters. also, characters do notice that he is more 'intelligent' than should be expected, and presumably this will be addressed logically at some point. (many slytherin harry stories are just "he's a manipulative/deductive genius 11 year old mary sue and everything works perfectly")

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]]: as the author describes, its enjoyable 'fuck yea' fun. crazy plots abound.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/766017][Armistice Series]]: sequel to The Changeling. Technically, this is a slytherin ginny story (and an excellent one at that), with harry being a gryffindor. but there's a lot more subtle characterization to explore here, with a more cautious and distrusting harry. Personally, I find this a more convincing version of what a real-life gryffindor/slytherin person would be like.

** I've read a million of them, but two spring to mind immediately.

There's the classic Slytherin Harry/Wrong Boy Who Lived series, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][The Sacrifices Arc]] by Lightning on the Wave, starting with Saving Connor. Seven books covering all seven years and long enough to make sure you don't sleep for weeks if you're prone to binge reading (like me). I liked it a lot, and it's become canon of sorts in my head, as far as dark wizards and dark magic go. I find myself missing a lot of this author's versions of characters that were barely mentioned in the original novels. There were a few annoying themes, however. For instance, if Draco ran in exclaiming, "This has got to STOP, Harry," one more time, I was going to slap something.

I am not really big on the Girl Harry stories, but I am currently addicted to a series featuring exactly that: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]] series by murkybluematter. She's on year four so far and updating monthly, lately. In this one, Voldemort is in charge and only purebloods can attend Hogwarts. Harriet Potter and her male pureblood cousin Archie Black switch identities so that he can go to a school of magical healing in America and she can study potions at Hogwarts under her idol, Severus Snape. It is meaty and exciting and very well written.

I'm also a fan of the WIP, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin already mentioned in the comments.

** Travel Secrets First by Em4j has a time travelling Harry that ends up in Slytherin. Lots of house politics, especially in Third.
