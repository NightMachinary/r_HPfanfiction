** If I ever need a villain, I'd look at Legend of Korras villains. They stand for honorable goals, Equality, Unity, Freedom and Order, but tread upon dark paths to achieve them.

Good villains live and die with their motivations.

** Characters can relatively easily be made interesting if they do something. A good villain needs an agenda. He or she needs to act in opposition to someone (most commonly the protagonist), that's why they're a villain in the first place.

I kinda sorta made up a villain for my HP fic. I took Mulciber, who is practically a blank slate in canon and gave him a backstory and a motivation for why does the things he does and, most importantly, an agenda outside of being a Death Eater. I'm not going to stare it here because the fic is a WIP, but he's become one of the more prominent characters in the story. The hero-villain dynamic has changed from Harry-Voldemort to Harry-Voldemort-Mulciber, where Mulciber serves as a stepping stone to Voldemort and as an enemy on his own.

** I think the best villain, or at least antagonist, would be Madara Uchiha. He countered all the bullshit everyone else was pulling with even more bullshit, and made it look amazing. Not to mention he genuinely thought his plan would help humanity, and that he was willingly dooming himself to a life all by himself.

The idea I had for a Harry Potter villain was a Ravenclaw who got a bit too into the whole knowledge bit. He winds up performing hundreds of rituals and experiments, wanting more knowledge for knowledge's sake. It gets to the point where he starts toying with the muggle study of genetics and DNA manipulation on magical creatures...and people.

** My idea of a good "villain" actually represents a character that isn't a villain at all. I don't think anyone is ever fully good or fully bad. At the end of the day, every character who connects with the reader and feels truly /human/ is made up of more than just their motivations fuelling the plot.

An antagonist that sits on his chair in a white suit, stroking his cat, muttering about world domination all day long--that's not a character, that's a caricature. I want to see that character at his weakest. I want to understand why he does things to oppose the protagonist and almost be able to side with him, so that when the final confrontation happens, the stakes feel that much higher.

I would prescribe A Song of Ice and Fire as an example of this. The first book identifies the Starks as the "good guys" and the Lannisters as the "bad guys". Then you read further into it--Starks do bad things and Lannisters do good things. The line is blurred. You end up in anticipation of what's going to happen, hoping for characters who are working against one another to succeed, even though not all of them can.

This is also why large scale, end-of-the-world type conflicts are so hard to pull off. There's not much room to humanize the characters.

** I tend to read Harry-Centric stories, so my Villain is going to be from his point of view. The most intimidating, fascinating villain is an older student with a grudge against Harry. Have it be something petty, like..... they were going to be the seeker until Harry showed up. Have there power be charisma, have them be nice. Have them hit Harry where it hurts.

Have the upperclassman befriend Hermione and Ron. A tutor for Hermione, a supportive brother/sister for Ron, someone they can go talk to. Have it be a ruse to remove Harry's friends from him.... but then have a friendship bloom. After a few months the antagonist still dislikes Harry, but has grown to enjoy Ron and Hermione. This slowly evolves over the years, they spend more time together, and Harry is left out more and more. By the time the 'Villain' graduates the Golden Trio will no longer be close, and awkward Harry will be a bit of a recluse, having no good friends, and cursing the bastard who took his friends away from him.

The story would likely end with Harry as an adult realizing that while he looks fondly on his friendships in his early school days, it wasn't a big deal that it ended. That is how life works, people move on, friendships end, and new ones will inevitably arise.

I just really like the idea of a story where Harry bitterly hates someone who after a while just really doesn't care about Harry.

** I've always been a fan of the Moriarty style villain. One who is rarely if ever actually seen but is pulling all the strings.

I feel the best way to fit this into the HP universe is to have a string of incidents building up tension between various factions in the wizarding world: Magical creature groups, the goblins, the ministry, Hogwarts the ICW etc. Clearly leading up to some planned all out magical war.

And at the final confrontation we discover that the villain is a muggle, and that the goal was to simultaneously eliminate most of the magical world and irreversibly shatter the statute of secrecy.

** Dennis Creevy as a villain. Someone who was close enough to HP while he was growing up to see the man behind the curtain, and someone who was there and watched HP kill a Dark Lord with an Expelliarmus. And then HP just... becomes another worthless cog in the machine, naming his children after the people that ruined his life and working for the authority that had nearly snapped his wand and later executed him as a child. So Dennis starts killing off the purebloods in an attempt to save the wizarding world, and learns and uses more advanced and complex magics in an attempt to make Harry do the same, finally growing into the hero he was born/destined to be.

*** Is this a thing? It goes along the lines of how I'd write a villain.\\
1. Knows Harry behind the mask, knows his fears and weaknesses, knows how to harness Harry's strengths to betray him as well (Sirius' death was brilliant, so Voldemort in canon doesn't make a ton of sense after that. Perfect bait.)\\
2. Realises that Harry is grounded by the people around him (R,Hr,G,Teddy).\\
3. Umbridge got under his skin quite easily. Learn from this. So did Snape.\\

** I can't say I like "villains" in the traditional sense. Whether it's Hannibal Lecter, Lord Voldemort or Bane, no matter how cool or interesting you make them, they eventually come off as strawmen without any real reason or rhyme to their actions other than getting the hero to have adventures, and somehow win against the odds.

I prefer antagonists who are human, and have all the ordinary flaws that make humans so terrible - pride, greed, pettiness, hatred, etc. They ALWAYS come off as both more compelling and more scary.

If we're talking GoT/ASOIAF, I think the High Sparrow serves as a pretty compelling "villain", in the sense that whether he is "smart, classy, charming, interesting, methodical, skilled, brutal, manipulative", he doesn't show it - he acts like the nicest guy you ever meet, just and simple, disheveled, stuttering and limping, and says he only wants to help you - even when you know he's full of shit. He is truly scary because most commoners can't even /imagine/ him as a villain, as a bad guy, despite all the terrible things he does. People truly believe him to be good, and that makes him much more powerful than any mustache twirling aristocrat or powerful dark wizard.

** First, I want that link to your fic!!! Come one that sounds like an amazing fic!

The best villain is a villain who the readers and the hero dont know is a villain. You know, the only thing that destroyed the "Dumbledore as a villain" plot was the fact that how over used it was and how easy it was to see in most fics that he was a villain. If you want to see a good plot for this, watch the movie Batman : Under the Red Hood. Holy shit, that was something else to see.

Next, have you seen the new Captain America : Civil War?

Who destroyed the avengers, in the end, was just a guy with no super powers, just a cunning mind and a secret. Make a villain who destroys your hero. The villain doesn't need to be found too, let the next arc start without this person being dead or even in the plot. It stays on the readers and heros mind, but the villain is damn elusive and there are more immediate problems man.

****** Im a very open reader, and don't really have specific tastes regarding particular kind of actions. I love variety. So...

#+begin_quote
  Action is brutal and desperate, Harry is not a powerful wizard per se. He's more along the lines of a weathered soldier who uses tactics and time-proven methods to take down Dark Wizard/Lords that would make Voldemort look like a common thug.
#+end_quote

This would be amazing.

#+begin_quote
  You'd probably not like it though since my Harry dual wields a pistol and a wand, though in my defense this only puts him in a slight, combat advantage as, in my story, wizards can pretty much shield themselves against bullets and disarm anyone with a firearm. The gun, as well as the other magical and muggle equipment Harry carries, is only there to compensate Harry's above average magical abilities.
#+end_quote

This too probably, not read many fics in which fights are gritty, and have muggle weapons as well.

**** As for villains it all depends on the execution of it. Change the POVs with chapters man if you want to. Many good books have done that.

But whatever kind of your villain is, imo some good ones are that make the readers chew their nails off thinking "how the f*** is the hero gonna win?!"

If you want some good tactics, cheat. There are a LOT of good tactics in [[/r/askhistorians][r/askhistorians]]. Will link a thread about it. Some of that shit was scary to imagine.

** what makes the best villian? Orochimaru comes to mind... The sick twisted scientist who has no moral line, yet is capable of manipulation and leadership. Another that pops into my mind is Nagato. His motivation was to end all war....

I also really really like Shades from Eragon. Durza was so damn amazing... He just didnt give a fuck about anything other than making Eragon bleed...

I have an OC in mind for Harry to face... who kills and absorbs Voldemort's spirit becoming a Shade. He is a melee based wizard who at first cant use a wand, until after absorbing Voldemort. His motivation is simple. He lost everything to Wizards. His daughter was a witch,he and his wife was squibs, and during Grindlewald's war, The Dark Army raped, and killed them infront of him. So he travelled the world... and found the Shade ritual in a tomb in Madagascar. He wants to wipe out all wizards... so that noone suffers as he did. He dreams of a world where magic is nonexistant. His name... was Nathan Shure. Now... Now his name is Shiza.
