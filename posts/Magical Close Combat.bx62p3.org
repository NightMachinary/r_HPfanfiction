I'm looking for any fic where harry either prefers using wandless magic close combat style or cannot use ranged magic. E.g. Power punches with reducto. Wrapping protege around his hand to slap away spells. Bouncing around the air with propulso in his legs. Etc. Any help is welcome


** Most magical fights take place with the combatants at less than 20 metres away from each other. That's already extreme close range when you're using a ranged weapon.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
