And can the characters be in character?

Thanks!

*** Nicely written. Very sad though, Molly must be blind/naive if she still hasn't figured out Harry's home situation. Too bright to see the darkness..

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!
