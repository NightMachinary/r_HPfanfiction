** I don't get fanfic plots based on someone (usually one of the Trio) using a Time-Turner to go back to 1943 to "save" Tom Riddle from becoming dark.

By 5th year, he was petrifying Muggleborns and planning horcruxes. After 6th year, he'd killed his dad and framed his uncle. If there was any good time to save him, they should start when he's like 5 years old or something. It won't fix his congenital issues, but at least there's a reasonable chance of making him functional and not evil.

Was there ever word of god about him being a congenital psychopath? I've read fics which run with the idea that his conception was magically affected by amortentia, but I always assumed that was just an interesting fanon idea. The books only showed what Dumbledore was able to extrapolate from a few spotty memories, which leaves plenty of room for fanon to fill in the blanks with alternate explanations of why Riddle developed to be a hostile and vindictive preteen.

  JKR characterizes Voldemort as "a raging psychopath, devoid of the normal human responses to other people's suffering"
#+end_quote

[[http://www.accio-quote.org/themes/voldemort.htm][JKR interview from 2000. Source.]]

I believe the clinical definition of psychopathy is a congenital mental disorder, while sociopaths are formed from abuse or trauma. Tom Riddle's family genetics from the Gaunt side (said to have "a streak of instability and violence"), or being born from Amortentia could have affected him mentally, though JKR says that it didn't affect his ability to feel love. Fanon thinks him incapable of feeling love. He /can/ love, he just thinks it's worthless.

He also has enough of a bad/neglected childhood to be a sociopath too. But that's fixable, depending on if and when he is removed from the orphanage. The "psychopath" element, if he is one, is tougher, but not everyone who has a mental illness turns into a raging killer. I'd still say that trying to "fix" him at 16 is too late.

#+begin_quote
  The cause of psychopathy is different than the cause of sociopathy (1). It is believed that psychopathy is the largely the result of “nature” (genetics) while sociopathy is more likely the result of “nurture” (environment). Psychopathy is related to a physiological defect that results in the underdevelopment of the part of the brain responsible for impulse control and emotions. Sociopathy, on the other hand, is more likely the product of childhood trauma and physical/emotional abuse. Because sociopathy appears to be learned rather than innate, sociopaths are capable of empathy in certain limited circumstances but not in others, and with a few individuals but not others.

I've read fics in which Riddle is a psychopath and doesn't turn to murder simply because there are more practical alternatives to achieve his goals, and I've read ones where his issues arose from poor coping mechanisms developed during a childhood of abuse. I could see him not going the Voldemort route in either case if there's a well written arc of character growth.

I believe JKR has relaxed on her stance on calling Voldemort a psychopath these days, because it's a clinical term and not acceptable to throw diagnoses around on Twitter, even for fictional characters. She has recently done charity work in Eastern European orphanages and seen with her own eyes what kind of living standards the children have.

I personally believe that Tom Riddle has an antisocial personality disorder/mental illness that affects his potential for feeling empathy, but doesn't make him born evil (as some readers believe he is). He chose to do evil things in canon. In fanfic, if he chooses to /not/ be evil, he still has a personality disorder and that will affect his characterization and interactions with other people. I don't like fanfic Tom Riddles who turn into cuddly hippies after someone "saves" them via Time-Turner intervention.... it seems unrealistic to me.

Even child Tom Riddle should have difficulty feeling attachment, empathy, or remorse if I want to be sold on the character.

That's very interesting to hear. Sometimes I wonder at the way she portrayed two boys growing up in abusive environments, seemingly implying that one was born evil while the other was unaccountably good despite his circumstances. I wonder if anyone has discussed the topic with her and whether her take on the matter might have changed over time. The backstory of Credence in the movies has much greater nuance in comparison.

I agree with your take on Tom Riddle's personality. I can accept him being changed by plausible circumstance, but I prefer that he keep the cold aloofness from aspd, otherwise he becomes just a generic 'good person' (or 'ideal boyfriend' in many cases) for the fic author's wish fulfillment.

******** I don't think JKR has changed or will change her mind about Tom being evil. Even if she doesn't throw around words like "psychopath" or "sociopath" anymore, she'll still describe him on Twitter and in interviews as a killer, or devoid of humanity, or compare him to some contemporary political figure just to stir the pot. To top it off, Voldemort does not understand love, and by her standards that is the worse thing a person can probably be.

"Tom Riddle" and "ideal boyfriend" should not be in the same sentence, wtf!

Btw, I read the fic you recommended on an earlier thread, "Addendum, he is a liar". I think it's one of the best written child Tom's I've ever read in fanfic. I've seen a lot of Woobie Child Tom's before, where he is abused by the carers, bullied by the other orphans, and/or given forced exorcisms to cure him of magic, which makes Tom's hatred of Muggles justified. And that weakens his character, just like Fanon Voldemort becoming a Dark Lord because "Mother Magick willed it", instead of being driven by his own pride and ambition.

This one has Tom as the bully who likes making other kids cry... it's so perfect. Thanks for the rec!

For other people who want to read about a non-evil, well-written child Tom, linkffn(11562871) I'm picky about writing quality, and this one has very good prose!

*********** Why would you do that to yourself?! I get most of my fics from recs in this sub, and if the writing in the first couple of chapters bothers me, or the characters act OOC, I drop them.

I never finished "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus", a commonly rec'd fic, because the author didn't know what a comma was. I didn't finish "Eldritch", which was rec'd in this thread, because the characterization of the Present Timeline Dumbledore was OOC af --- Dumbledore (outside of a crackfic) would never let a parentless, underage child be arrested or experimented on by the Ministry, just look at all the slack he gave to Draco Malfoy the attempted murderer. Also that Tom was shading on Woobie!Tom, singing for his supper like a cockney chimneysweep, lol. (And also I dislike First Person PoV writing in HP fanfiction, it feels like it's better suited for the Animorphs fandom.)

I don't like Slytherin Sex God Tom Riddle either, and drop those fics when I see them. Many of them write him the same way as Fanon Draco is written, with everyone smirking, drawling, and raising their eyebrows all the damn time.

I will look at "Birds of a Feather" next. "Addendum" so far is like holy trinity when it comes good writing, good characterization, and an original plot... It's hard to imagine something else being similar.

************ I also stop reading a fic quickly when it has obvious issues. I stop if I see extremely bad grammar or run-on paragraphs (occasional missing commas isn't enough to turn me off a fic so long as the sentences are still inteligible and the grammar is otherwise good), unrealisic dialogue, a particularly shoddy job of the most common tropes, etc. Nineteen times out of twenty when I'm searching through FFN I drop a fic within a minute of starting the first chapter and proceed to the next. I skip over any fic with less than 40k words and/or less than 2k words per chapter.

It takes a long time, but I have free time to spare and I've found more favorites by being thorough than by looking at recs on this sub (which typically only recs well known fics with 700+ favorites).

At this point I'm pretty flexible about what characterizations I can tolerate, but Eldritch was definitely toeing the far edge of the line for what I'm able to accept for young Tom. I liked the unique writing of interaction with Aberforth enough to give it a chance.

************* My basic test is to skip to a random chapter and read a paragraph. If it's written in correct English, has character names spelled right (eg, "Harry" instead of "Hadrian"), and sounds good, I'll usually give it a go. But yeah, there are definitely specific nitpicks and pet peeves I can't pick up unless I sit down and read a chapter properly.

One of those is Woobie Tom. If Child Tom has nightmares and runs into his guardian's bedroom for nighttime cuddles, that's a sign of Woobieness. If he has an overly abusive backstory, worse than what canon already gave him, with beatings, starved and locked into the basement, religious exorcisms, or sexual abuse, that's more signs of Woobieness. It also applies to Woobie Harry who is abused by the Dursleys.

I pretty much have a checklist of pet peeves that make me immediately nope out of a Tom-centric fic:

- Bad dialogue: Tom uses modern day or internet slang when he is supposed to be born in the 1920's.

- Fluffy Tom. Some people like stories with domestic boyfriends, but I'm not drawn to them.

- BDSM Sex God Tom. He's written like a copy-pasted Draco Malfoy in these fics, and I just can't. I imagine that people who write Tom as this horndog sex god don't understand his character. They're also the type to think it's feasible for Voldemort to have had a kid in The Cursed Child.

- Cringey Tom. Appears in stories where the MC tries to redeem Tom with the power of love. Tom in "love" becomes a weird, possessive, abusive stalker straight out of Twilight.

- Villain Sue Tom. The smug, smirking anime antagonist with no personality or role in the story but to defeat the protagonist. The point of Voldemort's character is that he suffers from hubris. He's flawed, self-destructive, and overcompensates. He may look like an anime villain, but he's not one.

This is one of my favorite fics. It's marked as HP/TMR, but 37 chapters and 192k+ words into the fic the two characters are still just having a heartwarmingly platonic child-to-caregiver relationship.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.

** If you enjoyed "Rectifier" you might like the mentor relationship between young Tom Riddle and Albus Dumbledore in "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864054/1/Eldritch][Eldritch]]".

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]]" both fall into the "never goes dark in the first place" category due to a Harry Potter out of time forcefully opening Tom's eyes to the bigger picture beyond the absurd bigotry of an inbred elitist faction in a small isolationist nation.

** What Wicked Warthings has Tom be Chief Warlock as well as Harry's mentor. It's a HP/RWBY which only uses the setting details of RWBY, such as Grimm and trick wepoans, without the actual characters of RWBY. Summary: "Magic is a curious thing, capable of creating beings that are the embodiment of human emotion; the Boggarts who are Fear, the Dementors who are Despair...and the Grimm, shadowy creatures who feed on pandemonium and Turn those they kill. The Grindelwald Plan has spared us from annihilation, but this war will only end in one of two ways and I'm not one for dying." -Tom Marvolo Riddle
