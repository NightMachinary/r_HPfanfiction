  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Harry has issues. Fortunately, he also has friends. A Sixth Year story. Major spoilers for OOTP, GOF. This story is now COMPLETE. Enjoy.

** There's a mentally ill HP in Worthy of Magic linffn(12800980) But its not the quirky or wistful Luna Lovegood kinda mental illness... I think I only got to around part 4 and then NOPE'd out of it. May be your cup of tea...

** I found that most fanfiction writers who tackle such problems gloss over them or don't delve into any detail. Which is expected, I suppose, since talking about such issues is very difficult for the people who experienced them firsthand and most others just know about them second or even third hand, not from the perspective of the addict.

It's fanfiction after all. Also any fanfiction with such a heavy theme, if written accurately, would be depressing as hell.
