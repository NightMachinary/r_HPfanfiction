What is your favorite incomplete story? It must have been at least a year since the last update.

For me, it's Shopaholic1369's /The Son of Lord Voldemort/. While the writing at times was a bit clumsy grammatically, the plot and world-building is absolutely amazing, and the humorous moments with a certain redheaded Gryffindor were hysterical. It hasn't been updated since the spring of 2016.

It's really sad how many authors have so many personal or family issues, which is often why stories are left incomplete. I hope things get better for authors in such situations.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

/The/ Durmstrang!Harry fic and one of the most popular fics in the fandom. Respins canon magic with a Darker hue, but doesn't let it derail the plot. The setting and characters are original and fairly interesting. I always point to this when people say they don't read non-Harry-centric fics, because the protagonist is basically a complete OC in Harry Potter's skin.

linkffn(Magical Relations by evansentranced)

Another fairly popular fic. The best moments of this are right at the start, where it perfectly captures 11 yo Harry's simultaneous fear of Dudley and wonder at magic. Has some great moments later on as well (especially the last few chapters).

linkffn(Just Another Orphan)

Slytherin!Harry, without any of the Lordship nonsense or pureblood apologism (and Draco is still a twat). My favourite thing about it though, is that it starts right in fourth year. More fics need to do this. No 20 chapters of completely unnecessary life story! And we don't have to read about a bunch of little shits trying to /Wingardium Leviosa/ in the sneakiest way possible, or be political geniuses at age 11.

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** Easily Newcomb's linkffn(What You Leave Behind). I would put linkffn(The One He Feared) up there, but it stopped at the end of an arc, so the lack of update (and essentially abandonment) doesn't hurt as much.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.
