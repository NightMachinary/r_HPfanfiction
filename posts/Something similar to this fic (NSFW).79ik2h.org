First please don't recommend slash fics. Secondly please limit your recommendation to fics where Harry is the main character.They are not my cup of tea and I respect anyone who disagrees with my preferences.

I am not talking about the pairing when I say similar but the nature of the relationship.

P.S. : Read this fic. It's hot as hell.


** Check out Duality by the same author, has a similar tone. The smut isn't based around quite the same kinks, but it's still "hot as hell". linkffn(7145549)

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass
