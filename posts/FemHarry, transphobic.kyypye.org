First of all english isn't my first language so I hope my point of view will come across, i really want to hear y'all opinions I think most of FemHarry fics come from a sexist and/or homophobic place, most of the time only using it to make be with a man, but the most clear for me is the transphobic way most of these fics handle FemHarry. Treating gender only in a physical point of view, this is clearer in fics where Harry wakes up in "girls" body and magically starts feeling like a girl I think that there are a lot of more examples of how these fics tend to be either transphobic, misogynistic or homophobic, but I'd like to hear what y'all think, and if you think I'm wrong maybe you could link a fic that handles this issue well


** Or, people can write fem!harry for the same reason they write Hufflepuff!Harry or or OP!Harry or Drarry; they want to explore an AU element and experiment with their writing. "I think most FemHarry fics come from a sexist and/or homophobic place" is a gross generalization.

** Certainly, there have been many ways where the Fem!Harry trope was used in misogynistic, homophobic, and transphobic ways. But I think saying that /all/ written works that used the Fem!Harry trope are these negative things is greatly underestimating the diversity of fic out there.

On my end, I actually the Fem!Harry trope actually makes my fandom experience queerer. I love reading femslash, and in this case, Fem!Harry makes what was a heterosexual relationship gay. I've also read quite a few transgirl!Harry fics that were delicately and sensitively handled.

And since you issued out the challenge, here are some fem!Harry fics that made the fandom queerer, not less:

** I dont think making Harry female is transphobic.

Some writers just do it for the concept and how it changes the canon. And others, for example teenage girls, write and usually change the gender of the main character to put themselves into the story. Its a power fantasy because Harry is the most important character in the story, has a tragic past, a overfilled dramatic life and tons of secondary characters that the writers like and can ship with the main character.

Being trans is not an experience everyone will have or can relate to and many teenagers hardly think of making Harry a girl as a transition. Its just Harry was always a girl in their story so no transition ever happened or, if he transformed into a girl later, magic made the change easy.

** I can see what your trying to imply and I just want to give a second perspective.

I have read plenty of books from a males point of view and slash before, but from a writing stance I find myself feeling that my portrayal would do a disservice to the character or the community because I am basing from a frame of reference that is not my own.

I would only feel comfortable if I was consulting a bunch of other people and had done a lot of research to write a male Harry written fic where he is intimate with another man simply because I don't want to misrepresent the character or the relationship by using stereotypes to make up for a lack of understanding.

I know there are plenty of people that do not struggle with these points . Some great slash and male Harry's are written by women (such as JK Rowling, but she had an editor so...) but for some like me it's a way of getting your feet wet in writing a character and a ship that you like from a perspective you are more comfortable with.

I personally just write ocs because of this but that's an even greater sin.

Hope that makes sense.

*** To expand because I was reading through again:

I agreed with a lot of points made on this thread and I do think it is the responsibility of writers to step out of their comfort zone as they continue to write, but I think it's important to note that I believe this type of development should be coming with time and experience.

From my experience a lot of fem!Harry writers tend to be younger girls who are utilizing Harry more as a self-insert as he was the character they made the deepest connection to because we followed him in the story. In turn, I find a lot of these writers to be lacking in experience and these fics are often their first fic or towards the beginning of their writing experience. At least for the usual ones that lend towards ships that would typically be slash.

I think writing at all is out of their comfort zone at this point in time and for a first experience, this is understandable. It allows them to explore the relationship dynamics of the personality of cannon characters without adding the pressure of having Harry obviously out of character or dealing with themes they haven't experienced themselves in their personal lives to draw inspiration from. I don't think their rendition is necessarily discrediting the work of the slash renditions of the same relationships who I think are just providing another layer of to the relationship that makes them a bit more difficult to navigate.

In turn, I think it minimizes the blatant objectification to a degree because I feel when authors cannot relate to their characters especially in slash fics they will puppet and degrade them to far worse a degree because they are viewing their characters less so as people. They will rely on poorly formed stereotypes and will base all their characters' struggles around their sexual identity because it is the most central characteristic to the fic. There may be an element of internalized homophobia to that but I also think it is because they are viewing the characters as fictional moulds to be manipulated and the coloured, and not as a breathing extension of themselves, which is what I believe results in the most realistic and thought-provoking writing. Learning to manipulate yourself to mold a more diverse array of characters comes with time and research and I think it would create far more damage for everyone if writers are pushed too quick to step far out of there realm of experience when writing for fun.

As they grow as a writer it is true that they need to expand on the skills they acquired, but I personally think it is only fair to welcome inexperienced writers to express themselves in the community and hone their craft and this happens to be a very popular way to start doing so and I don't think it implies underlying homophobia in this scenario.

I mentioned above that I don't think I can personally write slash at least not as the premise or central to my story because I don't know what it's like to be a man who loves another man and no matter how much I research I fear I'm coming to rely on someone else's words which I am only reiterating and passing off as my own. I can't breathe life into these characters because I can't relate to this perspective and so I push myself out of my comfort zone in other ways. I explore world-building and power dynamics that I need to research and design. I implement gay characters that are still prevalent in my stories but are not the main perspective I am writing from so I can portray them fairly. I will explore an educated racial narrative that has a role in a story, however being a POC is typically more of a detail on my character that is mentioned in an occasional parroted discussion or as a comparative to the pureblood/mudblood wizarding narrative because the truth is no matter how hard I try I will never truly understand what it is like to be a minority I can only hope to imitate.

I think it's very black and white to color our tropes in fan fiction as one way or another and everyone has a right to their interests. Homophobia and transphobia though very real, can be very heavy terms and should be assigned when appropriate and never generalized lest the term be discredited when it is most needed.

Likewise, I read an amazing au which was presenting a multiverse concept and touches upon the concept of thousands of renditions of every character and in this dimension happened to be a Harry who was born a girl with Lily's features who was able to cross dimensions to raise a young Tom riddle in another dimension. It was one of my first serious reads of a fem!Harry fic which I had been shying away from because of the poor reception I'd heard from the trope and I absolutely loved it.

Ignorance is not an excuse, but I do believe that inexperience supports room for growth and it will come with time.

** The fem!Harry fic I'm most familiar with us The Pureblood Pretense, which draws on Alanna the Lioness and so the main character needs to be a girl impersonating a boy. So, nothing transphobic there.

(Incidentally, I really dislike using "phobic" to describe every kind of opposition or disagreement. A phobia is a paranoid irrational fear, which might be an accurate description in some cases but far from every case. Let's not perpetuate name-calling.)

#+end_quote

It's not all that weird. There definitely are and have been cases where people were so unfamiliar with the concept of eg same-sex attraction that they flipped out upon encountering it. There was even a "gay panic" defense where if someone of the same gender comes on to you, and you immediately kill them, you could claim reduced responsibility - it's not right, but that's the law for you. I'm pretty sure that doesn't exist as a defence any more.

So in cases like that, calling it a phobia makes a lot of sense. But not as a universal term.

** It depends on the context, I think. For example, if you're writing, say, a drarry fic and make one of the characters Fem! that can be taken as homophobic. You set out to write an originally slash pairing, but then you make it, for most intents and purposes, a straight pairing.

I've heard the argument that lots of people who write Fem! characters are experimenting with their gender, trying to see if they're trans or what. This is great, but I suggest you write a gen fic for that. I would kill to read a well written fic where a character I love is going on a journey of self-discovery.

But in most cases in which I encounter it, Fem! can be taken as homophobic and/or transphobic.

Another point is this, quite often(this is seen in Mpreg as well which can definitely be taken as transphobic/homophobic as well) their genitals magically morph into those of the opposite sex(ergo a male gets a vagina). Quite often, even if unintentionally, its implied that they like fucking a vagina better or something to that tune. This is /always/ homophobic and transphobic, no matter the circumstances.

** The thing is that while writers often have some level of implicit bias that colors their stories, in general, most often seen are just examples of "No, I don't want to write that." For example, many straight people don't feel comfortable writing LGBTQ relationships, so they don't. Wanted to write Drarry but don't feel you'll do a good job depicting a gay relationship? Or do you feel you're going to struggle with writing from a male perspective? The answer people will come to? Write fem!Harry/Draco. While I personally believe that people should try to branch out and write things they might not be comfortable with more often, I approve of the decision to shy away from a topic a writer isn't comfortable with.

Genderbending stories can often be attributed to this experiment: Assume every character is straight. Swap a gender, what new relationship pops out at you? This is a mirror to the idea of: Assume every character is gay, what ideas do you see?

Problems arise with the handling of your new female character, in most cases if people assume that the character was female the whole time, nothing changes in the story. If Harry was Holly nothing majorly plot-relevant would change. If you try to have them change overnight, then congratulations, you've given your character gender dysphoria. I have personally not seen any instance where the fem! character changes overnight and is instantly ok with it but I'll take your word for it.

LGBTQ issues do come up in fanfiction all the time

I do however have some issues with slash. Male-on-male in fiction can often become well... objectifying for the male characters. One needs to only look at the Omegaverse to see where the problem lies. A lot of these /elements/ can be seen in the fanfiction community as well. I find these much more damaging than genderbending.

However, none of this is to say that the issues which you pointed out don't exist in genderbending, I just don't think it's the majority of the community's motivations.

[[/u/cest_la_via][u/cest_la_via]] raised an interesting point about magical transitions for the purposes of mpreg! and the implications that they have seen in stories that included it. In the context she brought it up in, I agree that it is in fact /always/ homophobic. For a number of reasons. Though now I'm thinking about whether or not it could be used as a viable medical procedure in order to procure an egg so that you could have a child that's biologically your own to give to a surrogate. As in transition one member of the couple temporarily so a doctor can obtain an egg from them, then fertilize using the other partner and give to a surrogate. The transitioned person is turned back, and everyone lives happily ever after. I like Magic. It makes a weird thing like what I just said possible.

** I honestly don't think that's true for the most part. I think many people have a difficult time putting themselves into the shoes of a trans person for example. How they feel, how they tackle issues concerning their gender identification, etc.

And I also think you may simply be reading too much into things. I think people have gotten too soft, and this PC culture is getting out of hand.

Let's say I make a joke about a trans person, or a gay person. Does that make me transphobic, or homophobic? Does me making a joke about a black person, or an Asian, mean I am a racist?

No, it does not. I'm just making a joke. Understanding the intention behind a joke is just as important, as listening to the words. Seriously, if things keep going the way are, we're going to destroy humour.

I'm telling you, people get offended much too easily. And then there are the idiots who get offended on other people's behalf. Even when the supposed victim isn't even offended in the least...

*** Okay, to start, there's a lot I disagree with in this.

Racism and homophobia is everywhere. If you make a joke about a queer person or a trans person, then fuck yea you are being homophobic. Same thing for a POC. A joke is only a joke when it doesn't insult someone's very existence.

I'm gonna ask you something even though I probably already know the answer: are you white and/or straight?

If so, then you probably don't understand. People are killed and victimized everyday because of who they are. If someone is trans or openly gay, they are more likely to be fired or attacked for just living.

Look at the BLM movement. Even small stuff like making a rude joke or immediately blaming/accusing/suspecting someone who's a POC or queer is adding to racism and homophobia. People focus much to much on the big things, you don't bother to think of the little things. The things that feed the flame which sets off the bomb which is the big things.

We aren't getting offended by ever possible thing, we're getting offended because you just insulted our very identity. To be fair, everybody has a different rate of how much their sexuality or race impacts their life. Some view it has an important and vital part of their existence, other see it as just something that they are; sort of like what their favorite type of ice cream is.

And why do some people hate someone for being gay, or trans? It's none of their business. People should mind their own business. Often it's about religion, but that's a whole other point how I think humanity should do away with religion...

Look, just treat everyone the way you wish to be treated. Be respectful, that's all we need, really.

I do stand by my original point about the jokes, though. It's not quite the same thing, especially given what the minorities we're discussing here have gone through, and still are, but I'm a bit on the short side, and people tend to crack jokes about that. Do I scream at them, or report them to my boss? No, I do not. I just take it in the spirit it was intended, and rejoin with a quip of my own.

****** Religion is the the root of so much evil in the world, that the cost of keeping it around is too high, in my eyes. In almost any place where religion plays a massive role in society, there's just so much strife, hate and intolerance.

And there is no space for open minds or hearts in those places. And then, there are the things that people do in the name of their religion. Not to mention the fools that allow themselves to be brainwashed by those in power.

Priests get away with abusing children within the Catholic church, and simply get relocated, because what they do mustn't stain the church. And of course, they just keep up their disgusting habits in their new place.

Young girl's genitals are mutilated every day in some places, just so that they can't enjoy sexual intercourse, because if they did, then surely they would bring any man into their bed. I don't care that it's some kind of tradition. It vile and despicable.

And then, you have the Nordic countries. Up here, religion is pretty much an afterthought, and no laws are passed, based on religious beliefs. Our countries are some of the safest, least violent in the world. I don't think that's a coincidence.

Look, I understand that religion has, and does help alot of people through difficult times, pain, suffering and loss, and that's a good thing. However, I think the cost of keeping religion around is becoming too high for society to bear.

Having said all that, I suppose humanity would just find something else as an excuse to kill each other, so I suppose it doesn't matter, in the end.

****** Agreed. It's just that every gay person I know likes to make jokes about their sexuality. I was at a party a some time ago, and while I do not remember quite how it started, we started speaking about sausages, and a lesbian friend of mine mentioned she loves sausages. (She has two lovely kids) I, of course, could not resist, and pointed out to her that she obviously doesn't any more.

Everyone laughed at that, and my friend laughed the hardest. I guess my point is that people's experiences vary, and obviously that will dictate to some extent how we see things.

*** I won't care about the downvotes and say that you're right. People really have gone soft, just because you said a joke about something doesn't make you racist or homophobic. If someone says something to you that you don't like, just ignore it and move on.

This is one of the things in the fanfiction community that I don't like at all, for some people if someone doesn't do what they want or behave in a certain way it's offensive and should be banned.

Regarding your first point I agree with that too, when I read fanfiction I try to put myself in the position of the main character, try to feel like he feels, think like he thinks, etc, etc. But if the main character is either trans, homosexual I just won't read it because I can't identify with him. I don't mind people reading and writing about these kind of characters, I don't care what they do with their life. If you want to do it, do it. Just don't call others racist because they don't like these kinds of things.
