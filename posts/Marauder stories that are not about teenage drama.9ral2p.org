I find the overall concept of the marauder era (a shadow war waiting to erupt or the opening stage of a civil war) interesting yet most stories set in that time focus on pranks or James, Sirius or Snape trying to get laid and most of the plot results from misunderstandings or unresolved sexual tension. But there has to be more to fics set in that time (the first half of Delenda Est comes to mind).

Please nothing Snape-centric, Snape/Lily or m/m as the main pairing (I am fine with references to background characters or the occasional mention). Canon pairings are optional (I'd take Lily/Bellatrix if the story is good).


** Against the Moon is pretty good, a little long-winded though. linkffn(7305052)

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to discover there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

Not set in marauders era, but the marauders are the central characters. Basically how the war would have been fought if the prophecy hadn't leaked iirc. Been a while since I've read it, but it, and it's two direct sequels, are excellent. Some of the best fight scenes I've read in the fandom

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.

  January 1981. Sirius is a paranoiac, Peter is not a psychopath, James is a dad, Remus is super angry, and Regulus... Regulus is alive. No-one is more surprised than him. AU, sort of fix-it, but dark enough. Sirius/Remus, too (mostly in the past).

** This is a bit of a self-promo but I'm working on a Marauders story you might like, it's got some drama but the majority of the plot is driven by the approaching war. I also find the Marauders/First War era fascinating so I'm trying to do it justice. Fair warning, Snape is one of four POV characters (the others being James, Sirius and Lily), and it's a work in progress, but you might find it worth taking a look at. linkffn(12916773)

  "If there is a war," said Lily slowly, "which side do you think you'd find yourself on?" "Whichever side you're on, obviously." It's 1975, and Whoever-He-Is has turned his eyes towards Hogwarts. Lily Evans, James Potter, and Severus Snape are about to be tested in ways they cannot imagine. A canon-compliant account of the First Wizarding War and the teenagers who fought in it.

*** Oooh! I love following new Marauders stories. I read the first chapter and enjoyed it. I can't review right now because I logged out of my account and created a new, complicated password (due to the hacker problems), but I promise that I'm interested!

*** I've done the research for that time period (The Troubles, what wad going on back then, more detail on the Chosen date) and have an overall outline where things should go, but I'm stuck on Harry's reaction. Lily isn't that difficult since she'd have other things to worry about (The fact that she has four years unless things change, her fights with Petunia). But Harry's is just so far from anything I, or anyone really, has experienced. I'm sure he'd have a breakdown but it's extend and follow up reaction just don't feel right.
