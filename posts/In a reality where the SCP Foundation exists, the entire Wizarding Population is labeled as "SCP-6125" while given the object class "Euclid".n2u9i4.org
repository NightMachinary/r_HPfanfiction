** A nice way to work that into the plot of HP : The SCP foundation decides that the efforts of the wizarding world to contain themselves are enough and do not require additional measures, they still monitor it and act subtely against threats to this established order. As such, when Voldemort returned and took to hunting muggles for sport, it was decided to send a taskforce to help our dear heroes put an end to the containment breach.

It could be really fun to put magic against some of the foundation's toys such as dimensionnal anchors or even a few approved SCPs used on the field. And the ruthless nature of the Foundation if discovered by the wizard could be really interesting to explore.

*** lol, when Voldemort and his Death Eaters causes trouble in the Muggle World, the SCP Foundation decides to deploy Mobile Task Force Tau-5, also known as Samsara. Magical anomalies are one of the fields that Samsara specializes in containing or neutralizing, so it would be interesting to see them go up against Death Eaters.

** Wizards are definitely not euclid. Sure, they may be mostly self-containing and thus not require that much work currently, but if they chose not to, they'd be a extremely hard to contain. Additionally, the random births of new magic users can come from anyone, making containment even harder.

I think they'd be Keter or one of the esoteric classes (Cernunnos might fit but I feel like it still misses the intricacies of the “currently self-containing but easily could stop being so”).

If anything, they're probably closer to a GoI than an anomaly.

------

I think the Foundation would definitely work with the at least the higher levels of the wizarding governments in regards to maintaining containment/the statute of secrecy. They'd likely also employ a number of wizards since their abilities would be quite useful.

I could definitely see a (probably crack) fic where Arthur Weasley, as the head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office, works alongside some Foundation people in the containing of some anomalous artifacts.

*** I'm debating whether or nor Magical creatures should be labeled as "SCP-6125-A/1" or should be considered as different SCPs.

**** I'd say it depends on if magic is something unique when compared to all the other shit the foundation knows about. For the story to be fun it would almost have to be, because stories that go like "and then they brought in a reality anchor, the end" are shitty.

Magic being unique also removes some of the absolute counters the foundation possesses, like the aforementioned anchors or telekill, which prevents the story from being a total curbstomp.

If the story still had anchors and such affect magic in unique ways, but not neutralize it, the story would ascend from good to great.

Hell - maybe magic is the natural state of the world, but suppressed by the combined psionic potential of humanity and only capable of manifesting in some areas and people. In this case, bringing an anchor to a wizard would /strengthen/ them by an immeasurable amount.

***** So baseline realiry is like 0 humes, whilst the earth reads something like 2.8 humes, thus when a SRE pops it brings it down to an negative 10, (Very very normal), and any wizard in those conditions is either radiating wild magic, or for the top .01% of magical control, they get an exponential power boost.

** In a story I'm writing currently, the Department of Mysteries and the Unspeakables are the SCP Foundation.

An Immortal Harry used to work for them, studying the Veil and other Death related things, before they tried containing him. In this world, the Foundation is less than ethical, and care more about containing- /read imprisoning,/ than protecting. He escapes, and over the years he helps other's escape too.

He's Keter Class.

In the end, some idiot decides to mix time magic with the veil, it goes bad, and Harry gets sent back in time when they come crying to him for help.

Ironically, the SCP stuff is only referenced, and isn't a big part of the story. He's just name dropped as being Keter, and he says the disaster he's trying to stop is a Code Magenta.

I just love the idea of the Unspeakables being the SCP Foundation.

Also, in /any/ world the Foundation is incredibly unethical.
