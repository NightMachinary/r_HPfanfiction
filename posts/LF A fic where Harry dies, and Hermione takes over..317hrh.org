Heyo! Any suggestions? I know there have to be some out there, but I'm hoping that rather than me spending hours sifting through muck to find gold, someone here will know of a good one. It can ignore the prophecy or not, I don't really care. Preferably it isn't Hermione/Ron but I'll take what I can get.

Thanks in advance!


** Isn't Harry Potter Without Harry something along these lines?

Mind you, I haven't read it yet. Think it's more along the lines of he never existed than died though.

*** Kind of?

But it really uses a large cast of main characters: Hermione, Ron(plus other gryffindors around him) and Percy are the three that I remember the most.

It's around 50 chapters in but is still on the first or second year with Hermione not doing much other than studying on her own or advising the Hogwarts group.

** There's an HHR fic out there somewhere who's opening premise is that Harry faked his death after the Battle of Hogwarts. He offs Voldemort from the shadows while Hermione is dueling him so she ends up with credit for defeating him hyphenated nonsense and all. I forget the name of it, but the fic follows Harry's attempts to do random good deeds in secret and Hermione's unravelling of the various clues that he is still out there. Unfortunately I forget the name.
