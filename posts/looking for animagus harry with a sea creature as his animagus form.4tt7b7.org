Preferably his form plays a part in the story, it's not just mentioned once and never again


** I'd read that!

...

I'll have to write that, won't I?

  Harry messes up the animagus process and begins a new journey. New friends and old share his discovery of life. What is in store for The-Boy-Who-Lived? What dangers will he face? Find out inside! WARNINGS: Begins entirely in HP world, crossover starts later. Harry is bisexual. Rated M to be safe.

*** Lol that's a stretch, isn't it? I haven't read it in a long time, but if I remember correctly he's only partially transformed and it's a reptile, not a sea creature.

**** I suppose it could be. His form is basically a water panther, and he still has an animagus and anthro form. It came to mind when I saw the topic.

** Harry Potter and the Descent Into Darkness.

He used parselmagic to make himself a sea krait in a process similar to that of becoming an animagus.
