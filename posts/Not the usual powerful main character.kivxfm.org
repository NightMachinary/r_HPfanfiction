We all know the stories where Harry discovers <obscure magic> and immediately becomes super powerful with no explanation of why nobody else is doing the same thing.

I'm looking for something where someone becomes powerful through an unusual method. For example, inventing magic internet in the 90s, becoming rich and controlling the magical world's politics and public opinions through magic Facebook.
