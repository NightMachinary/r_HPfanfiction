Nice... deleting your previous reply of "Yep." and replacing it with this zinger about half an hour later. You'd think, with that much time, you could've imagined up something actually witty instead of... let's see... copy-pasting a trite joke that's been told a thousand times. Eerily similar to your thread-making activity in this sub.

I suppose your tactic is working. Keeping editing comments so +mommy+ we give you attention.

Your traffic analogy is apt. You are half the traffic here, and I keep getting stuck in it. Stop clogging this sub. No one asked you to "compensate".

** You people do know what a roast is, right? Sure, it involves people "tearing" into someone, but it's about love (at least, it should be). Haven't you ever, while joking around with your friends, made fun of them? Or they made fun of you? This isn't done to hurt, and you can tell, because the sensitive issues are avoided.

Fanfiction itself is a good example of this. I mean, we all love Harry Potter, but it has its flaws, and one of the ways we talk about flaws is through fanfictionâ€‹.

  Me calling you (for example) 'a brain dead babboon with the mental capacity of an average dead foetus' isn't criticism. Its roasting
#+end_quote

No it's not. That's just straight being mean.

(Good-natured) Roasting is supposed to be humorous to both the roaster and the person being roasted. If it's only one-sided then you're not roasting, you're just tearing down something someone's put their time and effort into.

That said, I agree that a roasting thread is probably not a good idea. It's pretty much guaranteed to devolve into just shitting on authors. Roasting is best when it's face-to-face, because then you can actually see if you're going too far or not.

***** You're right. You do have the right to call a story horrible. But don't try to pretend that its 'criticism'. Its flaming. Roasting. Internet harrassing. Criticism is something that tells the author what is wrong with their story and sometimes advice on how to fix it. Calling a story 'horrible' does none of that.
