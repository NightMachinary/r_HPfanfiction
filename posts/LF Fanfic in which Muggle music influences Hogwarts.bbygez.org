I don't remember much about this fic, other than the fact that even though the Pureblood populace of Hogwarts initially was angry at the spread of muggle music even Draco Malfoy soon began liking and listening to it in secret. There also was a scene where Fred and George started playing a song which unintentionally and eerily was able to describe lord Voldemort and that song was banned (I think)

  With adulthood comes the realization that parents can't fix all. That there are dangers that are too big.This is the story of a war and the people who didn't want to fight in it but did anyway.

  “I can't tell anyone”, he repeated over and over again.Hermione helplessly stroked his back a couple of times.“Then don't”, she said.He stared at her with a bewildered expression.“Don't say anything”, she repeated. “Just play. I will stay and listen, if you want me to.”This is a bit of an AU. I was always a bit disappointed by the almost complete lack of music in the Harry Potter books. In my world, music is such an important thing... so I decided I would deviate from canon and make this a possible thing. I'm trying to stay as close to the original as possible though. It's mostly set in the sixth year and it's going to be pretty short. I'm planning on about 6 chapters total.
