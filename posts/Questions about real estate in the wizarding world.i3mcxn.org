How do you think real estate and property is managed in the wizarding world?

- Do you think the Ministry has complete knowledge of the location of wizard houses, or just a general one (as in, knowing the Weasley family lives in Devon or Ottery St Catchpole, or a number for the exact lot, as IRL governments usually have?)
- If so, how do wizards remove this information from the Ministry if they want to have it concealed, like the Black family? (not that I can imagine they would file the correct ownership paperwork anyway)
- Or do you think real estate trade is done without the Ministry's knowledge and interference? And if so, how would they know where underage wizards and witches live? Because how else would they register underage magic, like Dobby's, which was mistaken as Harry's?
- Do you think there are real estate agents and agencies in such a small community, or would that service be performed by someone else (like a Ministry department or Gringotts)?
- Do you think property documents are saved and stored in a family's Gringotts vaults, and/or someplace else?

I know there's a lot of questions, and a lot that we don't really get a hint at in the books, so it's all down to interpretation and imagining. I'm just curious about what you think about this.


** I think unplottability means the ministry only has general knowledge of the location of some houses, though the majority of houses are not unplottable and thus registered. Cast the charms to make a house unplottable if you need to conceal a location.

Real estate is likely regulated by the ministry, yes.

There are probably one or two real estate services. My town has multiple realtors and only a population of around 30k.

They'd be stored where people generally store documents. Safes, banks, etc.

*** Unplottable just means you can't put it on a larger map, doesn't it? I mean, Hogwarts is technically unplottable and you can both give directions there/find it and map it specifically (The Marauder's Map), so you could still have a floorplan and a general description of where the place is. You just can't point it out on a map of the UK.

Probably, since Mrs Figgs was discounted as a witness for Harry's trial until she revealed herself to be a squib, because the Ministry had no record of a witch living there.

I think the ministry would do both of these things, since the Centaur liason office shows that they employ people even for things that are very rarely needed.

**** They didn't keep track of squibs, thats the point. The ministry wasn't aware of any other witch or wizard living there, so they thought there couldn't be a witness, then Mrs Figgs showed up saying she was there and she's not registered because she's a squib.

But it does show that if she was a witch the ministry would have been aware where she lived.

** My headcanon is that large real estate hidden from muggles is an expensive luxury.

Used to be the case that you could just cover hundreds of acres in muggle repelling charms, make the locals forget that it ever existed in the first place and use it to breed dragons.

Later on you also had to edit a few maps, which made things more expensive.

But now there's satellites taking pictures and hundreds of people in top secret government agencies looking over them for anything interesting, it's pretty much impossible to make land disappear unnoticed.

So if you want to build yourself a wizard tower, you either have to buy hidden land from someone whose ancestors made a very good investment or you would have to build it not hidden, deal with muggle authorities, convince them that what you're building is really structurally sound, won't collapse on the neighborhood and has enough emergency fire exits.

** Canon, in the order presented:

- I presume they do know certain things. Evidence for that e.g. in HBP, when the Ministry worker visits the Gaunts. If he didn't know where to go, that wouldn't work.

- Magic. If you cast a spell to make a plot of land harder or impossible to find, then that's that, and prior knowledge won't help you.

The rest is impossible to say, with the exception of Gringotts, because they are simply a large safe deposit vault, nothing more.

.

Personal preferences and speculation:

Starting with the problem of underage magic, I prefer to disregard DH. If you go by that, the answer is pretty clear: The trace is on a person, so they don't need to know where a house is, they simply will know where the person is, wherever he is.

Of course, this creates a ton of problems, because until then, the implied tacit understanding was that the Ministry tracked places, not people, hence why Harry can do magic and be around magic in Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, during his visit to Slughorn with Dumbledore etc., but not in Privet Drive. So I prefer that take, but naturally, as you say, that implies, unless they literally track all magic in Britain and Ireland, that the Ministry needs to know where e.g. Harry lives, so they can set up something.

I don't think that's an issue, however, because all this is saying is wizards have a way to avoid Ministry supervision, and perhaps even more pointedly, the Ministry only goes to Muggle houses in the first place with their monitors. Which sounds perfectly reasonable (not least, given that the point is preventing breaches of the Statute), and also (if you're writing FF) like a good point where conflict would arise.

As for how real estate transactions are handled, if you take the usual size of a small town for the wizarding world, then IRL that would mean two or three real estate agents with offices there. However, people would hardly move /within/ that town, so I don't think that's comparable. Assuming 100 people/year look for places to live, I don't see how that sustains any more than one person ... who maybe does it as a side job. So you might have someone who's good about knowing people and up-to-date on who might want to sell and buy, but perhaps it's not an official business.

Neither Gringotts nor the Ministry would have anything to do with that, but the Ministry might tax you -- I once calculated that simply taxing land would be enough for their budget, but maybe they also tax land transactions.

As for deeds, I like them to be there, because there can be meaning in the words written down, making it /yours/ in a magical sense. I dunno that I'd keep them in Gringotts, though. Maybe if they're really old and valuable, but otherwise, it seems like a hassle. A charmed box (or a charmed deed, for that matter) at home if you fear desasters does the job well enough.

*** My thinking was that underage magic is tracked everywhere, but they can't blame it on anyone unless it's near the residence of someone underage. It requires a bit of both; knowing underage residence location as well as the trace on the underage wizard or witch. According to this, Harry could in theory go to London and do magic, and no-one would be able to blame him.

Though I really liked your theory on having one person who deals with trade of property; it makes sense to me rather than having a firm (which I'd think wouldn't quite fit with the feel of such an old-fashioned society)

***** Seems to make sense to me. If something like the Taboo is effective enough that it could have snatchers on Harry's doorstep in minutes of saying Voldemort's name in the Forest of Dean, there's no way the Ministry can't figure out something.

After all, it was how long from Harry casting that patronus to the owl showing up telling him he'd been expelled? Minutes at best. That implies good detection.

#+end_quote

The Ministry probably know the precise location of most witches and wizards. This is due to 2 things :

1. The Trace. From what we know from canon, the Trace could be compared to some kind of radar (imagine a big map of Britain, where a dot appear every time magic is used near a magical children). We also know that the Trace is unable to discern who used magic, only that magic was used (which is why Dobby was able to frame Harry in CoS).\\
   With that in mind, the Ministry need to know where most witches and wizards live to be effective. Because they both need to know the location of the magical household, to ignore their alerts (in not, families like the Burrow would receive daily letters from them), and they also need to define a "territory" around each Muggle raised children, where every magic used would be attributed to them (like Harry with Little Whinging).
2. The Floo network. From what Arthur Weasley said in GoF, we know that the Floo Network is managed by the Ministry. Since they are the ones connecting each fireplace to the floo network, they must probably know the location of this fireplace, and therefore the location of the Magical household.

Of course, it doesn't mean that the Ministry know where every witches and wizard live. Considering the abilities of most wizards, it is not impossible for one live in autarky without the knowledge of the Ministry, as long as he doesn't use any Ministry service (mainly the floo), and doesn't have any children who would reveal his location with the Trace.
