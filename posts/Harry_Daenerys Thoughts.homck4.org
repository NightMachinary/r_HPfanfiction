** Daenerys is female Malfoy. She likes to burn people that dont want to serve her and talk about the blood of old Valyria.

*** She didn't start out ambitious or cruel. She was made that way over time by circumstances. Also, it matters if we're talking about the books or the show here (the show's ending was so forced and out of left-field in multiple ways that the Imperius Curse would make as good an explanation as any).

She's also anti-slavery, which Malfoy is not.

I'm not sure either she or Harry would be interested in each other, though, if they're in-character. Harry seems to want normalcy, and someone he can relate to (I suppose he could relate to Danny being a "chosen one", but that's not a part of himself he seems comfortable embracing). And if he has a type, its sports players (Ginny, Cho), not aristocratic women. Danny... I'm not sure. She seems to like warrior types, which Harry isn't really, unless you count magical combat, and only then by necessity.

Harry might empathize with her, maybe even like her depending on when they meet, and she'd probably see him as a potentially useful ally. But he would disagree with some of her more brutal tactics, she'd think him naive and ultimately untrustworthy, their values would end up clashing, and they'd probably end up at odds a lot. Harry/Danny would probably end much like Jon/Danny, except he'd take her alive instead of stabbing her.

*** Malfoy was rich spoilt crudl racist thug, never knew pain. His parents provided him everything he wanted on a silver tray. Remember second year? He bought his way in to quidditch team by bribing 6 top of the line brooms.

Danaerys started as a naive girl who was terrified of her brother, she was sold, captured, raped and betrayed almost every person she encountered. She sacrificed her army for killing greater threat. But, she was betrayed by same people she fought to protect. She stood strong till end.

D&D decided to give disney ending to Stark family made her OOC in last season.

Never compare Dany with weakling like Malfoy.

** I like that pairing. It was my favorite pairing in crossovers. Both of them are somewhat similar, abused by family, ready to help others, Gryffindor tendencies ..etc.

But Harry had trusted friends who had his back, but Dany was surrounded by vultures and betrayed too many times and suffered too much cruelty of others.

I think Harry's friendship would've done great for her. But, he should meet her before 2nd book or 3rd one. Later, she started to develop arrogance and I don't think Harry would like that.

But, Harry magic is too over-powered on Westeros. You've to nullify it someway. Otherwise he could simply gift her Iron Throne in a week.

*** I mostly agree, but I would disagree that Harry's magic is that powerful. Oh, compared to some charging knight, sure. But...

Harry is limited by his own values. He will likely be reluctant, initially, to use magic publicly, even though the SoS doesn't apply in this world. He won't kill. His mobility will also be limited, as apparition has limited range. And if anything happens to his broom, wand, etc, there's no way to buy a new one (logistics, people always forget the logistics).

But bottom line, Harry isn't willing to use his magical abilities in the ways he'd have to to take a kingdom, unless its a very OOC Harry. Namely mass-mind control plus AKing anyone strong-willed enough to resist.

Also, there are things that can threaten him:

-A dragon. Short of AKing it, its questionable whether any spell he knows can reliably bring one down before it can burn him to death, especially if these dragons have the same magic resistance as Potter ones.

-A Faceless Man could kill him by ambush. Ditto Melisandre's shadow baby. For that matter, a random archer could, if he got off a shot before Harry knew he was there.

-Enough wights could, especially with surprise/in close quarters. They're basically inferi except better.

-The Three Eyed Raven/Crow. Scary time traveling body snatcher. It can potentially see what Harry's going to do before he does it, go back and alter his past, and oh yeah, possess him (Harry might be able to resist, though is record on countering mental assaults is mixed).
