I am trying to find/ remember the name of a fic. It was set during year 4 and the Triwizard Tournament. It is a Harry/Hermione pairing. Viktor Krum asked Hermione to the Yule Ball, but Harry had already asked her. Viktor demands to know who asked her so that he can duel them "for the honor of taking her to the ball." Harry beats the crap out of Viktor hand-to-hand. When the Hogwarts staff try to take Hermione to put her in the lake for the second task, Harry refuses to allow them to. Eventually, a squad of Aurors (trainees, I think) led by Dawlish arrive at Hogwarts to force Harry and Hermione to comply. Harry manages to only brutally maim some of the Aurors, somehow not killing any despite hitting one in the neck with a piercing spell.

Hopefully that is enough detail for someone to recognize. Thanks in advance for any help.
