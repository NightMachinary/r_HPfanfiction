I was reading a Pottermore article about the Hogwarts Head teachers when it hit me. Professor Pomona Sprout's name is the only one of the four that doesn't alliterate. Is there any significant meaning to that? Or just an odd coincidence that never occurred to me?

*** Apparently, according to every fic I've ever read, the wizards worship the Greek gods. Apparently it was Hecate who gifted then magic. That would explain the names, if it's true to keep with the Greek theme.

** I figure that the names are generally alliteration or references to their lot in life, for the most part.

I mean a guy named Newt who writes about animals, Gilderoy Lockhart has all sorts of character traits packed into his name. A guy named Jigger wrote one of the textbooks on brewing potions.

Then there's Remus Lupin, who has a weirdly appropriate name for a werewolf, considering he wasn't born one

*** None of whom were Head teachers, except for Slughorn before Snape came into the picture and in The Deathly Hallows.

**** Oh, you mean heads of house. Yeah, pretty much all of them are. There's one more the wiki lists, Tobias Stump. I thought Dumbledore was too, but he wasn't listed.
