I'm looking for a fic similar to linkao3(Space Haven by esama)

I mean this in the sense of them in a completely different place and trying to survive.

70k+ words please!

  Harry won a battle only to see that the war still continued. Now trapped inside Hogwarts with no way out, he and the others search for a place to make their final stand in. Thankfully they receive a little help from thousand years ago.

** You've probably read these already (and they're shorter than you want...) but I recommend Island of Fire also from esama. Same elements of world building and also a crossover (with Temeraire). It's basically a bunch of young wizards surviving on a small deserted island. It is shorter though - around 43k words at the moment. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025]] Wizards IN SPACE also by esama (she's amazing) is similar with young wizards learning to work/live in a Ancient spaceship (kind of a Stargate crossover) - 49k\\
[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/530818]] Life in Binary - Similar but it's just Harry so not quite what you're looking for. It's good but unfinished, with little chance of being updated... it's over 80k words though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7859147/1/Life-in-Binary]]

There are many HP crossovers of Harry trying to fit in and grow in a different universe (Naruto, LotR...) but they're not quite world/civilization building works like Space Haven. Good luck finding what you're looking for. <3
