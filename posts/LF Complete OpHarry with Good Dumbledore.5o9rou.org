He doesn't have to work with Dumbledore, just as long as the Prof isn't evil or senile like I see in many fics.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4753440/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Four-Founders]])

It's a Harem fic with Hermione, Luna, Susan Bones, Daphne Greengrass, and Ginny Weasley, but it's got a good Dumbledore, and a very OP Harry.

It's also fuckin' hilarious for a while before it breaks into the sads.

It's on Ao3 as well, but that one has lemon every other chapter once his harem is up and running.

It's got a couple of sequels as well, the next in the series is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5402371/1/The-Forever-Mage]]) , a HP+Star Trek TTG crossover, with a different Harem, whose names I don't remember. (I skipped this one, as I haven't watched TTG.)

The final in the trilogy is, linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6859254/1/The-Lord-of-Light]]) a HP+Star Wars fic that starts just before the events of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and changes it almost to the point that the story is unrecognizable.

His Harem in this one includes, Mara Jade, Maris Brood, Winter, Princess Leia Organa, and Celeste Morne.

I don't really like how he ends it, but it takes OP Harry, and the power of Love to the extreme.

Harry gets pretty powerful pretty quickly in this one and his relationship with Dumbledore, who is not only good but also proactive, is well written.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

***** Yeah, you'd expect better for someone who've just finished a 300k word story before starting with that one. Still, it's the third HP/BL time travel story I've come across at least...

Maybe they should consider getting a beta...

** Magicks of the Arcane linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/Magicks-of-the-Arcane]]) is pretty close - Harry doesn't start out super OP, but he grows quickly in power under Dumbledore's direct tutelage. I also just really enjoyed the Dumbledore in this fic.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
