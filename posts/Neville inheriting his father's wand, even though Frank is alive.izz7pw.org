When we first read about Neville inheriting his father's wand, it doesn't stand out that much because we as readers a left to believe that his parents are dead. But it turns out that they aren't. So Neville actually "inherits" a wand from a living person. And presumably, Neville didn't win its allegiance before Hogwarts. We know that the wand isn't really suited for him, but maybe that's more because the wand's owner is actually alive, not because it's inherently unsuitable for Neville.

This keeps striking me with every new fanfic I read that addresses Neville using his dad's wand. I'm actually kind of surprised that Augusta would give Neville that wand considering that her son isn't dead. That speaks to me of a super unhealthy need to see Neville fill Frank's shoes.

I totally agree with that one. I mean: People give Sirius a hard time for seeing to much of James in Harry. But that is nothing in comparison to what Augusta Longbottom (or really, the whole Longbottom family) did to Neville. Between throwing him out of a window, forcing him to a wand that doesn't fit at all and never accepting his accomplishments other than him nearly dying in the ministry I would say Neville had nearly as hard of a childhood as Harry.

*** There is a reason he was the other possible child of prophecy. He like Harry had a lot of things that easily could have made him the chosen one except for Voldie choosing to mark Harry instead, and that is addressed in the books.

But yeah. You have to feel sorry for Neville, he had it rough. Glad he came into his own later on.

*** I wouldn't say nearly as hard, I mean he didn't get shut in a cupboard for days or starved as WELL as the emotional neglect, but his grandmother really needed to look at her priorities.

**** No, they didn't starve Neville. But his uncle threw him out of a window for f* sake. Previous to this, there were various attempts to make him show signs of magic, including dropping him off Blackpool pier, where he nearly drowned.

** Saw one where Neville was having his usual fanon problems with the wand. Then Harry, Hermione and Neville end up fighting fake!Moody and Barty gets ahold of Neville's wand, and uses it perfectly. Turns out Barty Jr won it from Frank all those years ago. When Olivander explains the situation, Agusta's reaction is, "Burn it." linkffn(13596628)

*Just to point out, the fanon idea that Neville is gimped with Frank's wand isn't really true. Neville's problems were confidence and focus. The Azkaban breakout, notably Bellatrix, lit a fire under his ass and he made great progress in the DA. During the Battle of the Ministry, Harry and Neville were the last ones standing before the Order arrived.

*** Gonna need a citation on 'Neville is gimped with Frank's wand isn't really true' bit because Ollivander claims, '/...And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard's wand./'

Now sure, Garrick has a financial incentive to make people believe that each wand is bespoke, but one this I think we can trust that he's telling the truth.

That being said, you make a good point and fanon is almost always overstated!

**** Thing is though, we've seen other characters using a mismatched wand - like Ron until the end of CoS. Neville is the only one that's severely behind where he should be.

**** In case what I said really made that little sense. I'm saying that to say that someone is alive just cause their body isn't dead in my eyes isn't correct. They are vegetables they can't fell and think anymore cause their mind is shattered this also means their soul is shattered. The soul at least to my understanding is what allows you to feel and extreme pain and whatnot can cause it to tear and break apart. Also the condition of the soul plays no part in a wands response. If it did Voldemort would t be able to use his original wand seeing how the guy tore his soul as much he did. Hell he tore his soul enough times that he physically started to change. Also the soul can't exist without a body unless you have a horcrux which means the soul can't pass on and assume a spectral form or someone has so much emotional baggage they simply can't cause as far as we know these are the only two ways for the spirit to remain after a physical death.

** I actually once read a fanfic where his Uncle Algie was trying to kill him all over his childhood in order to inherit the Longbottom riches. He obliviated Neville always afterwards, because he used Magic to save himself, so everyone believed he was a squib.

Algie then manipulated Neville into using his fathers wand, while Augusta didn't have clue that the wand didn't choose him.

Everything comes out when Neville gets the Remembrall, which glows red when memories where obliviated and is able to restore them somehow. They are quite popular in that universe.

Like this, some stories are able to explain the issue quite well.

**** That has been my assumption for Charlie's wand and how I'm writing it. Basically all of the Weasley have heirloom wands. Fred and George have the Gideon and Fabian Prewetts old wands while Percy, Bill, and Charlie also start with heirloom wands.
