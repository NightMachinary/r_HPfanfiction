I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I still listen to the audiobooks to fall asleep and I will challenge anyone to Harry Potter trivia. Like, seriously, come at me, bro. I take all sorts of Harry Potter-themed quizzes, but I have one chief complaint. I was a journalism major. I don't want to do math. Just because you've worked out that Harry was a first year in 1991, doesn't mean all of us have.

And questions like, "What year did Hermione brew the Polyjuice Potion in the bathroom?" are the worst. Especially going back to the Founders-era. I don't know when Helga Hufflepuff died. And do you know why? It. Wasn't. In. The. Book. Nope. I want straight trivia questions where you don't have to make inferences and it's solely based on your knowledge of the text. So that's what I'm asking for, what fun trivia questions do you have for me? CANON ONLY!


** What is Lucius Malfoy's wand wood?

Which Death Eater did Kingsley identify as his hood fell off during Harry's extraction in DH?

Which Order member triggered the Taboo on Voldemort's name as was forced to escape?

Who were the Aurors stationed in Hogwarts during HPB?

*** Elm.

I want to say Dolohov, but something just tells me Jugson or Macnair. I'll go with Macnair.

I'm stumped to be honest. Harry says it once, so the Snatchers find them, doesn't he? But he isn't an Order member.

Proudfoot, Savage and Tonks.

*** Florean Fortescue, his shop was broken into and he was abducted by Death Eaters. I don't recall what his eventual fate was or if it was actually revealed.

Dancing trolls in tutus, right? I remember there was a particular character named, maybe Barnabus the Weird (Or Barnabus the Barmy?) but I remember ballerina trolls being described. Been a few years since I read the book.
