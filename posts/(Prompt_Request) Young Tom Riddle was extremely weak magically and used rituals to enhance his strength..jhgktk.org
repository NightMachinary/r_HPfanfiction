This idea came to me while I was thinking wether or not rituals designed to enhance magical power (could) exist in the Potterverse or not. My initial thought was no, because if they did, Tom would have spammed them as much as he could and become truly invincible. But then it hit me, what if he did spam them as much as he could? What if orphanage and early Hogwarts Tom was a near squib and other then Parseltongue, he had almost no magic at all. I feel like this would force his mind to be even more sharp and calculating than canon. If wizard Tom was a master manipulator, then nearly squib Tom would have been the god of deceit. Is there any fic that explores a plot point such as that? And since we're on the subject, what are the best docs where the MC uses rituals to go full out transwizardist.


** I would read this, but the author would have to do a really good job of making Tom smart while not having other characters feel dumb.

*** And have him be smart in a preteen way, not in an adult way.
