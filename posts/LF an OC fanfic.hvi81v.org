:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Alright so I don't remember a ton from the fic but there was a female OC that went to school in Percy Weasley and Oliver Wood's year. I'm like 90% sure that they were friends. I know I'm being super vague and I'm really sorry but if you know anything like this it would help out a ton. Thanks!


** Do you remember what site it's on?

*** I hate to sound so clueless, but I don't. I very vaguely remember reading this and don't recall many of the details.

**** No worries, someone I used to go to school with wrote one on wattpad with a female oc in that year, but it's focused more on the OC/Percy relationship and I don't remember Oliver wood being mentioned. It's Princess | Percy Weasley by bluntwhiskers if you want to check it :)
