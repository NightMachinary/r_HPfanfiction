So, I know they normally follow along the lines of Harry having a twin, and he's declared the Boy Who Lived. Somehow James and Lily survive and they neglect Harry who is the real Boy Who Lived. Blah, blah, blah. Right, I get that.

My question is: how is there even a “Boy Who Lived” without Lily's sacrifice?

Harry only survived because (1) Voldemort was willing to spare Lily and (2) Lily died protecting Harry.

Or am I wrong?

It doesn't make sense to me at all. (I'm not trying to be mean to anyone who likes these fics. I'm just confused.)


** Canonically, you are completely correct. Some WBWL fics do keep to that premise, but change who died for the kids. I've seen grandparents, babysitters, house elves, Sirius, Remus, and maybe a few others take Lily's place. James' parents and Sirius are at least purebloods, so it's conceivable that Voldemort might give them the opportunity to join him, so the sacrifice could work like in canon. It's harder to believe that Voldemort wouldn't just kill a house elf that was in his way, but maybe he thought Snape really needed someone to do his laundry.

But most fics just toss the sacrifice out completely and come up for some other reason for Harry and Twin to survive. Usually it's something along the lines of "Harry is just so powerful that he killed Voldemort all by himself."

*** I could /maybe/ see another sacrifice working. Although, I do think it's more special for it to be his mother. Special probably isn't the right word. More like significant. A mother's love is supposed to be one of the strongest things in the world. That's why it makes sense for me.

Yes, Harry was too powerful as a 15 month year old baby... I could never take that seriously.

Edit: Thanks for the explanation, by the way.

**** It's true that a mother's love is typically seen as being particularly significant, and magic could reflect that. But that's getting into headcanon territory. I think a grandparent's or godparent's love could be justified in working just as well, if an author wanted to take that path.

Accidental magic can do a lot, but killing Voldemort as a baby does seem like like too much. But most of those fics take the OP!Harry route in one form or another anyway.

**** I doubt anyone who read beyond the Boy-Who-Lived propaganda thought it was Harry. (Of course, the way Rita Skeeter and Fudge led everyone by the nose implies less than stellar things about an entire population.) Two incredibly bright students marry and spend months in hiding waiting to be attacked. That's the motivation and means to create some then-unknown protection magic. If it truly was a mother's sacrifice alone, what makes it different than all the other mothers who die for their kids?

Which also brings in my next favorite reason why Voldemort died: he wasn't trying to kill Harry, he thought turning the prophecy child into a horcrux would be a lark and made a mistake converting the process to work on living subjects. Lily's sacrifice created some protection, which then absorbed all the protection spells Voldemort used to prepare the vessel. Or his soul was too cheesegratered and it exploded him when he removed another chunk (which is WHY nobody made multiple horcruxes to that degree). Or he simply bungled part of the ritual, stuck the ENTIRE rest of his soul in Harry, and the shade we see came from another horcrux. Why else would it appear in Albania, then do nothing for ten years? Quirrel was looking into some weird magical effect that just so happened to contain the horcrux.

*** I've read one where it was the prophecy that did it. Voldemort tried to thwart a prophecy and got "punished" for it. Dumbledore tried to control the prophecy so his punishment was that everything he did backfired.

It was an interesting concept, since it delved into Divination. But I ultimately dropped it since I couldn't decide which was worse between the atrocious grammar and what felt like EVERY cliche ever.

** The sacrifice-protection is Dumbledore's opinion which is never directly confirmed in canon, and we know Dumbledore is capable of, at best, highly misleading answers, like his explanation of Snape's hatred for James (‘He saved his life.').

WBWL usually have Dumbledore as an antagonist so it's plausible for him to be lying or mistaken.

Also in DH while searching for Gregorovitch Voldemort murders a women who's trying to protect her children without triggering any special effect.

*** Well Voldemort didn't offer that woman a chance to live if she stepped away and let Voldemort kill her children. So I guess that's canonical support for Dumbledore's theory.

Dumbledore pumped his fists into the air in triumph, "ten points for Dumbledore!"

** The most believable WBWL fics I've read have still had Lily die leaving the magical sacrifice the same with only James surviving. In The Secret Rune the Potter's still died, but the Dursleys could only take in 1 kid and the GWL needed the blood wards more than her sister.

Most alternatives I've seen to Lily dying are based on either:

a) Voldemort asked the person to move aside for some reason and they didn't creating a willing sacrifice. The most interesting version I've seen of this was in The Archeologist where Pettigrew asked Voldemort to spare his goddaughter, who then refused to move aside and was killed, thus protecting her brother.

b) They completely throw out the sacrifice and use something else to explain the phenomenon like an entity, a soulbond, a bloodline ability, or they completely ignore it. In some, which twin was attacked wouldn't have mattered while in others only the true BWL would have survived.

I enjoy the WBWL trope a lot, although most of them are poorly written and often include a lot of bashing. Still, I think it's an interesting approach to nature vs nurture and can be very well done.

** Some WBWL, like Den of Snakes, have Lily still die. James was away at the time and came home to an explosion. Sometimese someone else dies to protect Harry & twin. Quite often it's Sirius or Remus, as Harry's/twin's godfather. Several times I've seen an older sibling, 2-3 years old, die. As far as Voldemort being willing to spare Lily but not the substitute, that's rarely addressed. I think I've seen it twice or thrice as "there's no need for pure blood to spilt, step away from the half blood brat."

I have also read fics where it's the power of prophecy that explodes Voldemort. Either something additional after Snape was thrown out, or a completely different prophecy and Dumbledore obliviates Snape to believe he heard the canon version. So the "true" prophecy is something like "The Dark Lord will be invincible as long as he doesn't personally kill someone related to him, else his family magics will turn on him as a traitor" and Dumbledore sends Snape off with the fake bait.

** Wait. This is just an idea but would this work? Say Lily potter had triplets but one died and Harry absorbed his or her soul so Harry has twin souls instead of just one. When Voldemort casted the killing curse at him, his dead triplet's soul died instead of harry's. That's y he becomes the bwl

**** There are cases where an embryo is absorbed into another one in the womb, quite often requiring removal at some point due to the cancer risk. But if you trying to argue that it gave Harry a spare soul, that ends up sounding like an anti abortion argument.

** You are right by cannon. Thing is, the whole thing was always kind of confusing (was Lily the first person to take an Ak for their children? Cause the spell seems kinda common place for criminals) so many authors decide to create their own mechanisms and reasons to explain it (and some ignore it and just say outright that the baby survived because of his plot-armor) I... can't really blame them. I mean, cannon was too vague on the matter and the explanation had many holes and, well, part of world building /is/ tweaking the systems so everything fits.

*** Yes, yes, I am aware fanfiction is fanfiction.

I prefer my fanfiction to logically make sense, and the idea didn't make sense to me.

I simply asked someone to explain how writers of said fanfiction made the concept of the WBWL make sense. I, however, did not ask for you to state the obvious.

The kind people ahead of you have already explained the different ways in which these authors write this trope. Although I appreciate your very literal reply, it was a bit unnecessary.

Have a wonderful evening. ;)
