Basically a feel-good prompt.

Possibly with the exception of the twins, simply because professional Quidditch isn't their career plan. Here's what I'm thinking. Harry's interest in an Auror career is strictly down to the fact that he seems destined (actually was destined, by a prophecy no less) to fight Voldemort until one or both of them died (again, prophecy at work). What if, instead, Harry refused to let that maniac dictate what he was interested in? Look at Viktor Krum; no one says that a professional Quidditch player can't also be a beast on the battlefield.

Looking at it from a Slytherin perspective, as well, Harry also has a lot more chances for the happiness and, though he would never admit it even under torture, hopes for prosperity as a Quidditch player than as a glorified cop/soldier for a barely functional government. Again, this doesn't mean Harry won't stand up against injustice like he does in canon, but he will consider his own happiness more than he does otherwise.

But Harry still doesn't want to get by on what he sees as his unearned and completely undesirable laurels. Even if he couldn't fly in a straight line, what Quidditch team would turn down the PR opportunity? Having Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, wearing THEIR uniform, endorsing THEIR products, adorning THEIR team posters and shirts and mugs and... you get the idea. Even with the MoM's smear campaign going on, Harry will still be an attractive prize for team managers with galleon signs in their eyes. Harry would rather beg on a Muggle street than be used like that.

The obvious solution to all of this? Start his own team, drawing from a pool of not-insignificant talent that he knows, trusts, has lived, practiced and played together with for years. Ladies and Gentlemen, the Hogsmeade Chargers (mascot; a charging boar with massive, viciously curved tusks).

** I love this idea! To be perfectly honest, I think Harry should have gone pro like Ginny in canon. Not that he wouldn't be a great Auror, but he spent his childhood fighting dark wizards. One would have thought he got tired of it. I know most people argue that his dislike of publicity would stop him from becoming a Quidditch player, but the fact is, most athletes become pro not because of publicity, but because they love the sport. There are plenty of real-world athletes who dislike media attention.

Sorry for the rant

*** This! I will forever mourn his sudden “I only ever really considered being an Auror”. Pro Quidditch player Harry would have been amazing. Imagine how their kids would've had to deal with it. “Yeah, my mum and dad are Quidditch players...yes, THE Ginny Potter, THE Harry Potter...”

This is such a wonderful idea.
