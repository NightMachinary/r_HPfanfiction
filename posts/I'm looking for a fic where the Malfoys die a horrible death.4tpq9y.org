The Malfoys are terrible people and I want to read them dying terrible deaths. In canon they were spared and now I want to read them die. Hell feel free to write little prompts in the comments of their horrible deaths. The more graphic the better. I'm feeling pretty hateful rn and some grisly, gorey and graphic deaths of these bastards would not be amiss.


** I can't really recommend a fic without spoiling, but...

- Generally, Malfoys tend not to fare well in Starfox5's fics (available on FF.net).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder]] has James & Co. go after the Malfoys, IIRC.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** If you are talking about horrific death for Lucius, *Spectrum*, linkffn(9561455), tops the list.

Draco had it very rough in *Screams Part Two: The Smiling Man*, linkffn(3568551).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4577618/Brennus][Brennus]] kills off the Malfoys in every one of his fics, too.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11761312/1/Heart-and-Soul][Philosophize]]'s *Heart and Soul*, linkffn(11761312), the Malfoys are not dead yet, but they are being used by Voldemort as spell practice dummies for repeated failures.

If you like killing Lucius in an 'innovative' way, *Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always*, linkffn(4101650), is the fic to read.

Narcissa was a serious bad guy in *Unspeakable Things*, linkffn(6473434), and thus died horribly. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] generally doesn't spare the Malfoys, and all of them suffered ugly deaths in *The Bonds of Blood*, linkffn(5435295).

Finally, Draco's death in *Emperor*, linkffn(5904185), is the most interesting one: [[/spoiler][it was a highly political assassination with the goal of sowing distrusts between Dumbledore and the Ministry. Harry framed Neville for the murder, but broke Neville out of Azkaban and into his service.]]
