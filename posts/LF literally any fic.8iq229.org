Imagine that it's 3 am. You've exhausted your supply of fics in your favourites list. You've trawled through the denizens of [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]. You can't fall asleep, but you can't stand fics bashing "Ginerva Wesley". Your body wants sleep but not really, and your spirit wants more fanfics to read. WDYD?

But actually just recommend me your favourite stories insomnia is a bitch please please please


** Hmm...literally any, you say? Time to root around in the favorites folder. Haven't read some of these in ages but they're there for a reason...I assume...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] is pretty good to my memory. Harry wishes on a star and things snowball from there.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5924716/chapters/13626331][The Many Faces of Harry Potter]] : Harry meets a bunch of interdimensional copies of himself in a magic clubhouse setup by him from another timeline.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9095290/chapters/20677411][The King of Oak]] : Fantastic Beasts fic, with old-time Fae involved. Also some slash but not graphic stuff iirc.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8770888/chapters/20104951][Mother May I]] : Another Fantastic Beasts one; Newt can recognize an Obscurial on sight and there's a rescue operation. IIRC.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1374466/chapters/2875192][Inevitable]] : Anita Blake/Harry Potter crossover, very well written, Harry gets clawed by a werewolf in chapter 1 and that's apparently how weres in that franchise spread their curse so yeah! I've never read Anita Blake but enjoyed this a lot.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10632669][Unresting]] : Turns out Regulus wasn't dead, he just owned a bookshop, and Sirius pops by after escaping Azkaban.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6177703][House Proud]] : Sentient wizarding houses and the Fae, plus Draco/Harry though nothing explicit.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/400813][The Inner Lands]] : Weird esoteric dimension traveling, the threat of the Fae invading, Draco/Harry, Draco is one of the Fae. One of my favorites.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/821338/chapters/1556522][Butterflies and Chaos]] : Ginny casts an accidental Unforgivable and gets shuffled off to her grandma Cedrella Black to be raised as a Dark witch.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2816397/1/Bloody-Skies][Bloody Skies]] is pretty cool; the disclaimer at the front is comically overblown, to my recollection. I enjoyed the story quite a bit. Necromancer!Harry, weird school in another dimension staffed by vampires and demons, possession by Egyptian gods, brainwashing...

And some self-promotion, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13348167][Initiation]] : Harry pays a visit to the Dursleys after signing on with the Dark Lord.

**** It's been a while. I can't precisely recall. It's long so I don't want to go read through it again to check, but...I don't remember if there was an actual relationship? Harry's definitely gay, though, it's there in the story description...

Call it a surprise, I guess. Shrug.

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know. Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group...WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  The first thing Percival Graves does after being released back into the world is buy a new wand. He's at Greymalkin's for ten minutes and the only wand that works for him is raw aspen, whiter than bone and so rough that Graves gives himself a splinter conjuring a storm of birds. The wand---dragon heartstring, a most unusual wand for an American wizard, according to a flustered Greymalkin---feels wild, and Graves empties half his wallet on the counter and keeps his hand on his new wand all the way home. The second thing he does is quit his job, because honestly. ("Grindelwald did his research before he put on your face," Seraphina says reasonably. "And it's not like you're open with your personal life. He has us all fooled." "He wore scorpion stickpins!" Graves shoots back, somewhat less reasonably. Seraphina looks at Graves, his pressed creases, his immaculate shirt, the red ruby cufflinks he's wearing to hide the starved brittleness of his wrists. "I'm sorry," she says. It is not enough to make him stay.) The third thing he does is get jumped by Credence Barebone in an alley.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?
