I welcome discussion on this topic as well as fic links.

Obviously, in canon, we see the inner workings of Gryffindor and how the Housemates relate to each other. I've read enough of Character-in-Slytherin fics to see how fanon thinks that House operates.

What about Ravenclaw & Hufflepuff? I'd love to read some fics that show daily life as a Hufflepuff or a Ravenclaw. I don't have a preference on who the protagonist(s) is/are. Show me anything! (Though I do prefer complete fics.)
