I remember reading a fic maybe more than a decade ago that featured adult Remus and Sirius sharing a house (I think Sirius was newly released from Azkaban and still recovering) and Snape apparating there periodically to provide potions while still pretending to be a Death Eater. I know this is a very vague description, but I'd appreciate if anyone might recall a story along those lines.

In any case, I'd also love to hear about any other decent stories featuring adult Snape grudgingly having to work with Remus and Sirius, as I think it's an interesting dynamic. Thanks so much!


** Linkffn(The-Never-ending-Road) has this dynamic. It does however have a Fem!Harry/Snape romance, but it takes several books of build up for anything even remotely /romancy/ to happen.

Be warned though, it slavishly ad hears to canon in all other regards.

They writing quality is also very high in general.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. OotP - DH will continue in a separate installment. Future Snape/Harriet.

** Of the top of my head, I feel like A Different Professor and Escape work pretty well. Escape handles this especially well imo.
