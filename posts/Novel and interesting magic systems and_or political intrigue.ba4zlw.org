Stories focused on the magic system and maybe magical politics, but avoiding the extremely common tropes in those areas and doing something new and interesting. Internal self-consistence and logic are critical.

Scientific study of magic in /some/ form would be nice, but is not a necessity. However, the understanding of magic should be important - and it should be /possible/ to understand, and logical in some way.

The main character doesn't have to be a super-genius instantly more capable than every other wizard ever or something ridiculous like that, and in fact, it would be preferable if they were not.

Preferably ongoing but that's not necessary. Ideally with a reasonable update schedule, and ideally from an author who can be depended upon to complete the story.

** The Black Queen series was recently completed, and there are some very good chapters that go in depth into ritual magic and how certain steps in the ritual process are required for certain effects.

The magic in this one is more spiritual than scientific but still a good read. It's complete, but keep in mind that the first five chapters are very difficult to get through. It never gets worse than that and the worst characters get what is coming to them in the end. This one is also full of political intrigue so you might give it a try.

Rated M for brutal depictions of violence. No lemons. Some femslash.

** Not sure if you've read HPMOR already as it is occasionally recommended but generally reviled in this sub. The magic system, particularly transfiguration, is well developed, consistent, and logical. There is political intrigue, but it's not the focus of the story. Yes, Harry is a super-genius (and doesn't let you forget it!), but if you can get over that (and the rather dull first chapter) it's a fairly enjoyable fic, with well above average writing quality.

*** Oh, I've read HPMOR. It was my first fanfic. It's... well, I thought it was absolutely brilliant when I read it at first, but I've noticed its flaws more over time.

It has loads of interesting concepts, and I liked the 'death is not inevitable' theme, but some of the other stuff in it put a cloud over those.

**** Oh it's far from perfect, but I still find myself rereading certain sections of it from time to time. Of course it could just be because it holds a special place for me as it was my first fanfic too.

Interestingly enough I think the 'death is not inevitable' themes was one of my biggest gripes with it my first read through. But yeah especially on subsequent readings there are other some other aspects in that work that popped up which made me really uncomfortable too.
