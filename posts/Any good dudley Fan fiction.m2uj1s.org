Only Dudley because I like the idea of him standing up for Harry or taking care of him like a big brother. And maybe they run off together? (That doesn't have to happen) but I do like the idea for them to have a good strong relationship.


** So this isn't quite what you asked for, but this is a "what if dudley went to hogwarts and they figured out to get along" fic that is not quite finished sadly. More of a butterfly effect thing.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

** Well, I have “Recall Alice When She Was Just Small” by Harmonic Friction linkffn(3493409) and “Go Ask Alice When She's Ten Feet Tall” linkffn(3451695), where Dudley is far from being a good boy, but perhaps not.

Otherwise, all good-Dudleys I know about are post-war or at least post-Dementors (especially, “Dudley's Memories” by Paganaidd linkao3(601542) and very weird “Dudley Dursley and the Bee Hive by Jmso” linkao3(14869065)). I like Dudley in stories by [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?uid=143134][Mrs_Granger]] (Summer is before Winter).

And then there is [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/cizi/Dudley_Dursley_and_the_New_Normal.epub][Dudley Dursley and New Normal]] (recovered from some fanfiction dump, reformatted by me; it was removed from FFnet).

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  This is the story of the Dursley familys perspective of things. After a small chapter of the Order planning for the Dursleys safehouse, it starts off with Petunia Evans´s childhood and what happened to her back then that made her behave so unreasonably strict towards Harry Potter. The main story however, tells us what happens to the Dursley family after they left no 4 Privet Drive to hide from Lord Voldemort. They were leaving with a witch and a wizard and something were bound to happpen between them.The story mainly reveals where the Dursleys went and who they met. How they would endure to be surrounded with magic, and what they did on a day to day basis. It contains a bit of magic, just enough to intrigue some family members and scare another. Some known names from the Potter books are mentioned, together with a couple of new introductions I made up. The story includes the Dursleys dealing with magic, oversized bumble bees, a murder, and a battle amongst other things.
