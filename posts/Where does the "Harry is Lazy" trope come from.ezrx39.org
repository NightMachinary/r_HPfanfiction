I mean, [[https://en.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ezqfpu/harry_potter_is_raised_by_a_tiger_mom/fgoxsd9/][here is the most recent example]] I've seen, but there's also (for example) these threads:

- [[https://en.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e1rnn6/fic_request_harry_applies_himself/][Fic Request: Harry Applies Himself]]
- [[https://en.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ers2i7/anyone_else_find_it_annoying_harry_didnt_seem_to/][anyone else find it annoying Harry didnt seem to want to learn magic?]]

And I've seen a couple more. But canon Harry isn't close to lazy, in PS, next to his school work, he researches Nicholas Flamel, help Hagrid, figures out Fluffy, ...

In CoS, he has the whole "the school hates him" thing going on, yet he also helps brewing a potion in his free time. In PoA, there's the whole buckbeak thing, where they read through tons of legal documents. (As an aside: have you ever done that? That's exhausting af). In GoF, he prepares for the tournament, also while the school hates him. In OotP, he starts a club where he actually teaches magic, ...

Harry does apply himself, he isn't lazy -- he just doesn't focus all of it on academia, but tries to make a difference in other ways. That's quite the achievement, in my opinion, and more than 95% of high-school students I've met do.

And yes, out of subjects that don't inherently interest him, he choses the easy ones. Which is also natural, why work unneccessarily hard for something you don't care much for?

Sooo yeah, please don't characterize Harry as lazy, it hurts me a little. Thanks!


** Because people don't think he's as academically driven as they think he should be. Couple that with the whole "you've just been introduced to a world with many wondrous things. Why wouldn't you want to study and know everything?"

Don't even get me started on that. He didn't even do anything on that front. NOTHING! He accepted the breadcrumbs he was fed and did nothing else.

I've seen a fic where Harry wants to know more, so he writes owls to a bunch of people. Three of the owls went to Sirius, Remus, and Peter. Sirius' came back with a stamp saying "prisoners don't get mail", Remus' came back with a response. And Peter's owl attacked Ron. I see this as something someone who was genuinely interested in their parents would do.

This happened in the Cupboard series btw.

************ Yeah, that's kind of where the "Harry is lazy" trope comes from. Most of us at age 11 maybe wouldn't have given a lot of effort into the theory of magic, but we would have attempted to at least be good on the practicals and learn some of the laws and traditions. Hell, I would have half-assed, if even participated, in HoM and Divination (assuming I took that as an elective third year and up) but I would have actually cared about the other classes because the theory would have assisted me in the practical side of things. Hell, I would have loved Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures as they seem to be almost exclusively hands-on courses, which I love.

***** Why I'm not convinced of that argument is that he doesn't really take an interest in magic even outside of school. Sure, he may not like schoolwork, but there's plenty of fun things to play around with outside of it. Or even if he's lazy, most lazy people will still do things to make their lives easier. He's like apathetic lazy, the worst kind of laziness. If he were any other kind of lazy he'd probably at least do some research to see what can be done to make life easier for him, even if he decides to not go with it in the end. Not to mention that he barely does enough work to learn to save his life. Harry spends a lot of time being lazy and apathetic to magic when really he should at least be playing around with it.

********* I don't fault him for wanting to slack off. It's just highly unrealistic that the slacking off doesn't involve lots of magic. Harry's not really a follower, and if he were to actually be realistic he'd have curiosity about magic even if he doesn't like the schoolwork. Realistically his friends would play along, especially if they were realistic too. Ron is somehow so unmotivated and unfascinated by magic despite being so unknowledgeable about it. I don't buy arguments where they say that just because magic is commonplace those who are used to it find no fascination. Magic is far too broad and far too easy to use for people to just regularly accept it in their lives and move on. It's one of the things I find major fault in the world building. Even more egregious is how Hermione is apparently able to find time to study and learn spells and make stuff up, but isn't able to really ever convince Harry to learn stuff or experiment. It's like Rowling took this absolutely fascinating set up, and decided that people should treat it so mundanely that even characters who should be fascinated by it do relatively nothing.

***** The argument that going to Hogwarts is essentially the same thing as going to a real/muggle school is, to me at least, the most unrealistic thing I saw proposed in this fandom.

To quote some SI fic I read a while ago, /dude, we can do magic!/ No, no matter how hard it is tried, you can't just unironically tell me that flicking your wrist and altering the very fabric of reality is the same as going through a Quantum Physics major. Or that learning to Transfigure your surroundings into literally anything you can imagine (with a few exceptions) is like learning Math, or Literature. This argument severely downplays so many things. The fascinations with magic/superpowers/fantasy we have in real life, the fact that these (Muggleborn) kids walk into a magical world at a highly impressionable age, the fact that Potterverse magic is so OP and makes you more or less a god. Not to mention Harry's unique circumstances, which would push him even more into studying magic.

I always imagined a much more curious Harry who connected with ghosts and professors willing to share their memory of his parents, the first war, and magical culture.

The Harry I saw in the beginning of PS was estatic at leaving the durselys and finding a part of his heritage. Hagrid, Mcgonagall, Dumbeldore, Nearly Headless Nick, and etc. Along with books either about him, the war, and fascinating bits of magical culture/theory/lore would have, at least, interested him.

*** I think this the the nuance, he is not objectively lazy, but the has the potential to be so much more. Fanfics make him more proactive because it is more interesting to read/write than a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PinballProtagonist][pinball protagonist]], and allows a greater exploration of the magical world. Also note the only activities Hogwarts seems to support are studying, chess and Quidditch, (played by 28 people per year only).

If you look at other canon characters, this becomes even more jarring. There are a whole bunch of character, Bill, Crouch etc had x many outstandings in OWLs and so on. Lily is remembered by her teachers over a decade later as a progidy student, especially Slughorn. Snape wrote down enough in doodles in his textbook to make Harry look the same, as well as inventing spells and knowing enough occlumency to fool Voldemort not long after. The Marauders were self taught animagi, created the map, something so advanced nobody ever attempted anything similar again, and conducted 'pranks' similar to Fred and George. Ethics of them aside they must have required an excellent understanding of magic and imagination to create. Even the twins leave school after OWLs and immediately set up a joke shop whose competitors have decades of R&D advantage.

Even small things, Fleur chaming a dragon to sleep, Krum transforming himself into part shark. This is without Hermione, who is basically Mary Sue in knowing everything the plot demands.

Learning the patronus in 3rd year and beating the third task (btw thanks to a bootcamp Hermione designs and runs) shows that Harry could achieve this sort of thing, but instead has a repetoire of a dozen spells.

TL/DR In context, Harry achieves less than everyone else.

** In the early books Harry was special. In the first book Hermione says there is more to magic than books and cleverness. We can all agree that academics make a good witch or wizard but there is a special something that makes a great one, like Dumbledore or Voldemort. Harry is shown to have some of that. He is special, he masters the patronus at 13, he is triwizard champion at 14 and has a few more deeds to his name.

Harry then appears to leave 'special' behind and increasingly seems normal or slightly above average. It's a shift in direction from JKR. In a way it makes sense, Voldemort was a prodigy and has years of experience. Harry shouldn't be able to beat him in a fair fight even if Harry studies hard, what JKR's direction did do however, was force the use of a deus ex machina. Deus ex machinas tend to feel a bit unrewarding. Harry didn't beat Voldemort because he overcame Voldemort. Harry beat Voldemort through several obscure things like wandlore.

Some people wanted to watch Harry grow, take on the mantle of hero and rise to the occasion. What we got was Harry stepping back and winning through a technicality. I think it was done in an interesting and creative way and really the Harry Potter books aren't about fights but about growing up. That being said fights can be exciting and engaging. People wanted to see Harry vs Voldemort in the level of Voldemort vs Dumbledore in the Ministry, people wanted Anakin vs Obi-Wan on Mustafar. What people got was JKR acting as a referee and awarding the fight to Harry.

Is Harry lazy? No. Does Harry live up to the expectations and promise of the first few books? Also no.

**** Point of fact - Voldemort could've kept on hitting him with Killing Curses till the end of time, they wouldn't stick because canonically, him using Harry's blood and internalizing Lily's sacrifice prevented Voldemort from ever being able to kill Harry. If he had the elder wands true loyalty however, the Battle would have seen a lot more casualties I expect.

Regardless I do agree that it was a very “meh” final “fight”.

** Because Harry is our viewpoint character, so we see ourselves in Harry's place. And if we discovered magic we'd want to learn to actually use it and be powerful, and that would play into our fantasies of having superpowers.

The story didn't do as great a job of showing just how much hard work it was to learn magic, how much practice and drudgery there is.

We also want Harry to be special and have a natural affinity for magic and be Dumbledore Junior, and that really doesn't happen.

So we feel like some potential was squandered. "If /I/ was there, I'd have studied like crazy and been amazing at magic!"

Except in real life I didn't study gymnastics like crazy and become and amazing Cirque du Soleil acrobat. I sat on my ass and read books and watched TV and wished I could do backflips like Spider-Man but I never put in the work.

But I expect more of Harry, even though he's 11/12/13 and so on, and I myself was a complete dumbass at that age. I put my older self into the books and smugly say "I would have done it better" forgetting how easy that is to say after having already read how the books end.

That's why fixfic is so popular.

Anyway, even if it doesn't make sense, the fact is that the story was written in such a way as to make many readers /unsatisfied/ with Harry's magical prowess.

Realism doesn't matter, and is not a defense of the writing. The fact is that even knowing all of this, I am still a bit unsatisfied that Harry didn't work harder at magic and become more skilled, especially once it's clear that he's not going to have a normal life - he's going to get into dangerous situations again and again.

** Because Harry /is/ lazy in canon. He puts off homework and things like the egg in GoF, normally doesn't put all that much effort into all of his coursework and new spells, relies on Hermione for note taking, etc. We also have a person who is far more studious to compare him to, in Hermione.

Is he /abnormally/ lazy? No, not at all. It's completely *normal* for a guy his age to want to have some fun with their friends, not focus entirely on school and academics, and just generally have some free time. It's /Hermione/ who isn't the nrom, in being so dedicated/studious.

Why do people use that trope? Because, for the example where Harry applies himself, they'd like to see what would happen if Harry were to stay as driven about magic/improving his abilities as he is for things like the Patronus, learning magic in preparation for the tasks in GoF (eg, Accio or all the ones for the last task), or the DA. In addition, we look at Hogwarts and the Wizarding World as a fantasy world, with amazing things that are possible - literal /magic/! We dream about being able to do all those things in that world, and picture ourselves, if put in that situation, studiously focusing on magic in order to do all those things. So it's only natural to feel like Harry is lazy for not doing that.

I think the other thing is just comparing him to other people his age. I saw it posted beautifully on an authors page, though I forget which. Basically they said something like... At 16 Voldemort was making horcruxes, the Marauders were animangi and had created the Marauders map. Snape was inventing the spells Harry was using. Even Draco freaking Malfoy was learning to repair magical artifacts. What was Harry doing? Cheating and playing quidditch.

** Because of a few reasons.

- People wanted to see him truly become great and beat Voldemort without a technicality. Rowling did not want Harry to beat a prodigy who had fifty years on him in a fair fight. She could have done it in a different way by showing us how a fight cannot be won by simply learning some spells as Harry said in OOTP but instant of exploring it she simply had him teach others spells. The fact that others were able to cast a patronus in less than half the time it took him reduced his achievement and people prefer this is due to him being lazy rather than not talented. Basically power creep. In third year it was one of the most difficult speels to cast; in fifth year a bunch of 14 to 17 years are shown casting the spell and in the seventh it is literally used as a messenger.
- They constantly compare him to Hermione and find him lacking. They want him to be able to at least match Hermione so they say that if he worked harder he would be able to. I think that this is ridiculous. Most people don't take the time to compare what Hermione accomplishes to real word. I will give a few things that Hermione has done compared to real life students to put in perspective.

  - I was a 10 pointer student but I honestly don't think that I could have actually learned a year's worth of study material in a month and a half on my own and without the guidance of a teacher. She practically learned all the study material and additional books before entering Hogwarts. And she actually learned it completely. Harry had also read all of his books and he was not able to answer questions at the drop of the hat in potions while Hermione knew all the answers. If not a genius then she would have to have an extremely good long term memory. I could without anyone's help; maybe learn a year's worth of Mathematics in that amount of time but even that is a stretch because I am going to hit parts I would struggle with. And it's my best subject.
  - She brew the polyjuice potion in 2nd year. She must have been really talented to have made a NEWT level potion on her first try after only one year of study. Or she could have been genius to have studied at least five years worth of potions in one year.
  - Then there is third year in which she took four electives on top of all the core subjects, and also researched the wizarding world's legal framework on her own without anyone with knowledge of the law to help her. I am studying business law and it is incredibly frustrating with some of the examples for a particular section contradicting what other sections say. It is really hard to navigate without someone to help. And she still did as a fourteen year old. Given she had a time turner but still.
  - Fifth year she helped run the DA and the SPEW, was a prefect and still managed to get 9 O's and 1 E in DADA. In fact the only person we know to have outperformed her in her year is Harry who got O in DADA 5 E's and 1 A, P and D. Ron's result was same as Harry but he got an E in DADA. Compare this with the rest of the world and A is considered good enough and average, EE is wow you are really good and O is OMG you are awesome. Augusta Longbottom was not even able to get an A in charms and she is considered a superb and formidable witch.

- Another thing is they want him to be an unfeeling machine who constantly keeps working. They do not usually think what kind of affect his life and environment have on him. He is just a kid who deified and vilified in turn at the drop of a hat. They say that he should have done this or that without thinking about the sort of stress he has constantly under should have burned anyone else out and yet he keeps going.

The difficulty with the Patronus is not with casting it, but doing so in the presence of a Dementor. Also it's obviously more of an achievement when it's done by a third year than by an older person.

**** Thank you for the reply.

I personally think that is the case too. It is what I meant when I said that knowing spells isn't enough. But this is what people who say he is lazy argue so I wrote that point.

I thought this to be one of his best showings. A boy who was knocked unconscious by a mere boggart dementor at start ended up being the last one standing when surrounded by a 100 dementors. Not only did he stay conscious he managed to somehow conjure enough positive emotions despite his parents murders playing out in his head to conjure Patronus mist.

People say it was plot armor that allowed him to drive the Dementors away; I say it was the distance that allowed the effect of Dementor's aura of despair to lessen enough for him to conjure the Corporeal Patronus.

Harry seems to be a generally middling student for everything except DADA. Hermione takes notes for the boys, he procrastinates with homework even in life-threatening situations like the egg in GoF, and I'm pretty sure there are instances of the boys getting Hermione to do their homework for them but I'd have to double-check to be positive.

That is not correct. JKR just never informed us about their study habits much. There are all those months skipped in novels, where they were just being in the school, and we really don't know much about their school work after the first or the second year. Yes, they were probably less swots than Hermione was, but that's probably the universal situation of humankind.

****** ...you're technically agreeing with me there? We don't see it because Rowling doesn't tell us about it. The only time we see Harry put effort into schoolwork or excelling in something academic is the Patronus lessons. It has been awhile since I've read the books, so if you have any other examples, do tell. I'm certainly curious.

But yeah, the difference in our arguments is that you assume that the non-present months that get time-skipped have Harry being relatively able in academics because he gets good grades, while I assume they don't because we never see Harry being smart in any other context and being dumb quite often (see my examples from my first comment).

I am curious - what makes you think Harry is smart beyond his grades? Is there any evidence for that in canon?

But you're right that they're both less swotty than Hermione, and that being wholly unsurprising. My real disbelief comes from the self-defence side of things. Harry is literally thrown into life-or-death situations on a yearly basis, and that doesn't seem to motivate him to do anything. Most victims of assault go get therapy, defence lessons, or just buy a weapon. ie. Learn more magic to better defend himself and the people he purportedly cares about. He just puts off his homework and goes to play quidditch. Dude is totally the dumb jock stereotype from American High School movies.

******* So weird to think of Harry as a jock for riding a broomstick. Wizard are weird. He is a sort of bland everyman (albeit one with a good heart) in a way. I think that was kinda JKR's point maybe? That you don't have to be some kind of magical badass genius to triumph over evil? You just have to have the grit to press on and be a good person. I guess in a way she really dodged the trope of good working towards the ultimate power that let's them defeat the unstoppable evil. Not sure what you'd call that trope but....

******** It's not just that he rides a broomstick - for my definition, anyway. My British perception of that very American Trope is that Jock is as much a mindset as an activity list. You're not just a jock for playing sports, you're a jock for living, breathing, and eating that sport. Half of Harry's attitude is "Yeah, yeah, Voldemort Schmoldemort, Imma trounce the Slytherins in some Quidditch." (and the other half is pure angst).

Oh, it's definitely her point. She just went way too far over the line in making him generic and everyman-ish and made him kind of empty and listless, IMO. It's just not to my preference, really. And probably a really good explanation/answer to the OP's question, come to think of it. Harry is headcanon'ed as lazy because it's an easy thing to overcome so the Author can make him special where he ultimately isn't. He's just a guy in the wrong place at the wrong time and there's absolutely nothing notable about him beside the fact that everyone in the country knows he exists and loves/hates him and his irrational obsessiveness with being unnoticed (interesting sidenote: possible effect of him having the Invisibility Cloak Hallow since first year? Hiding from death and all that).

I also disagree that she dodged the trope, but it's a very Doylist disagreement because the ultimate power is authorial fiat and plot-armour. :D Kid stayed stubborn and got lucky until he didn't die, then won because he got lucky and the other guy fucked up in a set of bizarre coincidences.

** its less that we want to see him succeed academically it's that outside of something like quidditch he isn't show to really put any effort into things

this is especially true third year onward. First and second years can be put off as flukes that he was in danger and is new to the magical world and all that but third year after he is told that sirius is after him and that he actually made it to the gryffindor tower he should have started to train himself if only for protection

then comes the tournament, the dragons are a copout maybe he coudldn't find any spells that would have helped him overcome the dragons or maybe he wasn't good enough to use them then and ended up flying but the fact that he put off working on the egg after being shown that the dangers of the tournament was where he was lazy

the way he prepped for the last task is how he should have been working the last year and a half. then comes the next 2 years 5th year he had the DA which was only teaching others what he already knew rather than preparing himself to fight Tom. his experiences in the graveyard should have shown him how out matched he was.

Sixth year was a disappointment rather than focusing on preparing himself he focuses on quidditch and ginny (said with disgust) especially after finding out that dumbledore was only going over memories with him rather than magic.

If the Death Eaters hadn't been kids-book-incompetent, then Harry's strategies would never have worked. Especially if he wasn't ever going to hurt anyone aside from angry attempts at the Cruciatus, then having more variety in his spellwork would better equip him. He could chain them up, freeze them in place, make them dance, or distract them with birds before stunning them, etc.

And well, assuming you're right and disarming is the OP spell - you cast it, they lose their wand, then what? You're a bunch of kids standing in front of genocidally-murderous and bigoted adults who, if you don't know anything other than expelliarmus, can strangle you to death or just punch you and take their wands back.

I only really got the liking, real liking in HP universe after starting writing stories on my own and truly analysing culture in many forms. Because then I understood the innocent good victory in the end.

However, that is not what many fanfic readers like. Maybe they are edgy, maybe cynical, maybe they believe in efficent good, at the cost of innocence. These things for sure push readers and writers into a different perspective than Rowling.

And being against leading character supposed or real laziness gives a great opportunity to do something with that. But possibly the most important thing in bashing the laziness is that it allows a lot of Wonder in both the plot and the worldbuilding.
