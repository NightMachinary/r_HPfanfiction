:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There was a fic a read a year or two ago where it starts with Harry being kidnapped and tortured at what i believe was the malfoy manor, the fic doesn't actually focus on the torture much as I think he escaped after only a chapter or two.

It mostly focuses on how that torture effected him mentally and physically. After he escapes he apparates to the Burrow which triggers an alarm to the order, who are at headquarters, so they apparate back to the burrow to find him in a very bad shape.

One key thing I remember is Umbridge going to trial for using a blood quill and getting charged as guilty, in her anger she turns around and attempts to use crucio on Harry but to everyone's surprise it doesn't effect him since he built up a tolerance.

Some minor details I remember is Harry pulling a knife on dumbledore because he came up behind him and it made him panic. Also I remember Draco taunting Harry at Hogwarts saying that he remembers his screams of pain coming from the basement.

I haven't been able to find the fic at all so I would appreciate any help!
