It is probable that many here do not share my point of view about this character who, by the way, would be the most hated of the whole saga if it were not for the existence of Dolores "Evil Incarnate" Umbridge or the Dursleys. But for me it is convenient to share them with you.

Throughout all this time I have realized how Peter is treated in all the fanfics that revolve around the story of the Marauders, or plots derived from it. He is the only one in this quartet who is not really taken seriously, and I can understand that, at least to some extent, as we know what he was responsible for, but that does not mean that he was always the worst of all Gryffindor. I think that, like James, Sirius and Remus, Peter deserves better treatment, at least in his time as a Marauder, I understand what he would be capable of later on and that is something that really anyone would disapprove of, including me, but like it or not, Peter was a Marauder, and at least for me, without him, the group would be incomplete. The first point I want to make is that a parenthesis could be established between the young Peter, student at Hogwarts, part of the Marauders, and the Death Eater Peter, I always get the idea that both are two very different facets of the character, maybe he was not always the detestable character he would become some time later. Probably, like James and Sirius, Peter has formed a perhaps more remarkable bond of friendship with someone, if you ask me, with Remus. But there was something, not necessarily the old reliable "coward" that is always handled, that drove Peter to make the worst decisions of his life, something that he detonated to his credit as Death Eater. Even, dare I say it, it may be that all his life the remorse of having given up his friends has affected him considerably.

Now, as a character, let's say, antagonist of the saga, Peter is really very underestimated. People always turn to see Death Eaters as Bellatrix, Lucius, even Barty Jr. or the Lestrange brothers, imposing Death Eaters or who earned their place among Voldemort's herd by their exploits, but no one ever turns to see Peter's "exploits" as one of them. People always say "The hat was wrong to be placed on Gryffindor" or things like "Severus deserved Peter's place on Gryffindor", but I think that's too bad, I really think Peter exposes, at least in the twisted sense, the values of his house. It was the Death Eater who sought out Voldemort even when he seemed to be finished. He could have been exiled from England if he wanted to escape either magical justice or the same dark wizards who served his master or other threats, but no, he preferred to stay there and even take the risky task of bringing his master back to life. If that is not Gryffindor enough, even in a dark sense, I do not know what is.

My conclusion is that, in the end, Peter could be handled as a character with an interesting background, we were not offered many details about his life beyond the mention of some relatives (like his mother for example), and that makes him even more interesting than the rest, he is also a grey character who can teach us many things. I clarify that I don't admire him for what he did, but for what he can offer us as a character. That's all.


** I imagine Peter at eleven years old was very much like Neville at the same age.

It's just that Neville repeatedly decided that loyalty was unquestionably more important than fear, whereas Peter became driven by his fears to the point of being willing to do anything to protect his own neck. Divergent character development, similar starting points.

Sorting is about what you're looking for, not who you are. Nobody's much of a paragon of anything at eleven.

*** I agree, as you say, Neville's loyalty to his closest friends and loved ones was unquestionable. Peter's mistake was to succumb to his fears and insecurities and in the end watch over him alone, forgetting about his friends and even his family. I also find parallels in the sense that both characters had talents for certain fields of magic. Neville, on the one hand, excelled in herbology, Peter, on the other, in transformations, making it clear in his facet as an animagus, which also speaks volumes about his ability as a wizard.

** He's a follower. He followed the Marauders when they ruled the school, and Voldemort when it looked like he would rule England. I think the overemphasis is on his supposedly cowardly nature. I like to say, Peter is very brave, he's just shameless.

Cowardly people cutting off his own hand and finger? Nah son.

He was thwarted by a baby when he delivered his masterstroke against the light. Then immediately changes up when he knows it has gone south and is able to frame his friend. Bad ass. Shameless, despicable, badass.

A coward would flee the country. He STICKS around to hide as a rat in a Wizarding family who are strongly on the side he JUST betrayed. Meaning he knows the Dark Lord will be back, and is in a position of having information all that time! If it weren't for Sirius unprecedentedly breaking out of Azkaban because of a stray newspaper, he could have been taken into Grimauld Place! (or however it's spelled)

It would have been a huge opportunity to betray them to Voldemort, he would have once again almost single handedly taken the light down!

Peter has whatever anti-plot armor is! Total bullcrap how his plans failed. And it took steel to make and act them out.

Well, if Sirius hadn't broken out of Azkaban, the Order wouldnt have been using Grimmauld Place because Sirius wouldn't be there to let them in...

If Peter was still Ron's pet by book 5, there would be no need for anyone to be in Headquarters - even if that HQ was a different place to Grimmauld - because Voldemort wouldn't have risen again and the Order wouldn't have reconvened.

This though. This is true. Peter thinks on his feet and makes the best of any situation. Really up until about Book Six he's doing ok, and then once Bellatrix and the other terrifying DEs are a factor, he's in too deep. But yeah, you're absolutely right. He's a survivor, and he has balls of steel to cut off parts of his body on more than one occasion. I don't think I could cut off my own limb, but then I've never had to choose between "cut off hand or be killed by mad wizard" so what would I know 🤣

**** Just one defense of my statement there. I didn't mean specifically Grimauld. I just meant, he had the idea that Voldemort would be back, and he would be in a position to scope their hideout, wherever it would have been. Not claiming he knew that he would be outed and eventually raise Voldemort himself. That only happened because the first thing was thwarted.

He would wait until another supporter, or Voldemort himself, resurrected. And then exchange his way back through giving away the Weasleys or whatever he was privy to through them. Just because canon events don't happen doesn't mean other events wouldn't. Even if Peter hadn't appeared, Voldemort would still be trying to ressurect.

#+end_quote

But who would have helped him? Of all his supporters left on the outside I don't think a single one would (Snape truly had no desire to by that stage, Karakoff is too cowardly, Lucius enjoys his comfortable life on the outside, Crabbe and Goyle Snr do nothing that Lucius hasn't endorsed...) other than Barty Crouch Jr. /But/ Barty Jr could only break free of his father's Imperius with help from Voldemort - and Voldemort only knew where to find Barty Jr /because Pettigrew brought Bertha Jorkins to him and she had the info./

Voldemort couldn't resurrect himself. He was incorporeal. He also couldn't have done the Bone of the Father potion if he'd possessed someone, eg as he did with Quirrell, because the Flesh of the Servant must be /willingly given./

So, without Pettigrew being scared out of hiding by Sirius, the chances of Voldemort rising again are absolutely minimal. The whole chain of events from Book 4 onwards, or indeed anything similar, couldn't have happened if Peter was still living as a rat. He was the only one of Voldemort's servants who was put in a position where it was prudent or achievable to seek the Dark Lord out.

It's likely Barty Jr would have eventually sought Voldemort out, as the Imperius would have failed once Barty Snr died. But Barty Snr was only in his sixties or seventies when murdered, and if he'd aged normally, well we know wizards live into their hundreds and by that time, Peter would have been an old man (old rat) and probably beyond giving a fuck as he has a nice comfortable life. He only stopped living as Scabbers because he was forced to. If he'd genuinely been laying in wait for an opportunity to barter his way back to Voldie, why didnt he kidnap Harry from the dorm prior to the events of POA? Nah, Peter would never have exposed himself if his hand hadn't been forced, he was far too happy living the life of a pampered pet. His return to Voldemort was pure necessity because his deception had been exposed.

TL;Dr if Sirius hadn't wanted to do the crossword, Voldemort would still be a spirit.

****** I think you are underestimating magic and its breadth. You're basically arguing canon events were necessary instead of just sufficient conditions for Voldemort's ressurection. The first book was the first attempt, which failed. I think it at least demonstrates that Voldemort would keep at it and find a magic. You don't have to believe in canon events happening, only that Voldemort is motivated to bring himself back.

******* No, I'm arguing that, as is proven by Voldemort's need to have flesh and blood servants, that incorporeal spirits can't do the required magic to get a body. So without help - such as how he needed Quirrell to drink the unicorn blood and attempt to take the stone, and he needed Peter to make the potion and provide the flesh - he can't come back.

It's canon that Voldemort as a spirit is basically useless, because it's shown that the only attempts he makes to come back to life are made when he has a fully human servant. He can be as motivated as he likes, but it's clearly fact that he can't do it alone with the methods he's aware of.

Which brings me back to my point - until Pettigrew is spooked out of hiding and left with no other choice, who is actually willing to be that servant? The fact that Quirrell was the only person he managed to recruit as a new follower in 13 years doesn't say much about his abilities whilst a spirit, and as I've previously pointed out, until 93-94 none of his original DEs who aren't in Azkaban are able or motivated to help him.

** Great post, OP. I think a big thing about Peter's portrayal in fic that really bothers me is the amount of times he is shown as someone who was just tagging along. That James and Sirius and even Remus never really liked him, he was just /there by default./ He was a yes man, a useful cheerleader and scapegoat. And that makes his betrayal into /something James and Sirius caused,/ not the absolutely devastating act that came out of nowhere it was supposed to be.

And, I just don't think that's quite the case from the information we get in canon.

The very fact that Peter is chosen to be the secret keeper shows that James held him in high regard. Fic often paints it as an insult, assumes Sirius was saying "who's gonna suspect Peter he's so dumb and weak." That absolutely wasn't the point. The point was everyone would assume it was Sirius, because everyone in the wizarding world from Voldemort down to the man who cleans the toilets in Gringotts apparently knew how ride or die James and Sirius were. It wasn't saying "no one would suspect this weak ass rat," it was saying "hmm, maybe let's not go for the super obvious choice of Sirius just to be safe." I mean, if anyone should be offended by The Swap, it's Remus as apparently he was the only Marauder not trusted enough to be a part of it.

Now, I think the reason this misinterpretation of their friendship happens is down to two things stated in canon.

1. In POA Madame Rosemerta refers to Peter as the one "always tagging along after James and Sirius." But that is an /adult woman's view of the friendship between teenage boys./ Adults don't understand teenagers for a start, and Rosemerta saw them, what, once every six weeks for a couple of hours. What would she actually know about the bonds of friendship between them? Sure, faced with such strong characters as James and Sirius it's probably hard to see anyone else as anything other than a sidekick. But that's the interpretation of an outsider, and therefore not a valid comment on the Marauders friendship.

2. Also in POA, Sirius refers to Peter as always hanging out with the people who could protect him - and how it used to be the Marauders and then he realised James wasn't the biggest bully in the playground any more, that was Voldemort. OK, this is more valid than anything Rosemerta says, because it comes from an actual Marauder. But we also have to take into account that Sirius has been sat in a cell, alone but for creatures who zap your best memories, for twelve years. He's been specifically obsessing about Peter's betrayal for those twelve years. Is there any wonder he views their entire friendship in a negative light? I mean, with the hindsight available to him when examining those memories, especially in such a negative environment as Azkaban, it was nigh on impossible I would imagine for him to remember anything good about Peter. The man Peter became ruined his life, and that colours his memories of the boy Peter was and their friendship.

The other issue with understanding Peter's betrayal is threefold, although this time it's a lack of information.

1. We don't know /when/ his defection took place. Was he secretly chumming up to the Junior DE whilst in school? Doubtful, because let's assume if that was the case Snape would not be able to risk rubbing it in James's face, thus either exposing Peter or scaring him enough that he goes back to the Light Side. Logically, it must have happened some time when they were between the ages of 18-21, but we just don't know.

2. We don't know /why/ his defection took place. He briefly says something in POA about being afraid Voldemort would kill him if he didn't - but why was he in a position to be directly threatened by Voldemort anyway? What were his actual reasons? Did they threaten his mother? Did they torture him? We just don't know.

3. We don't know /how/ his defection took place. Did he go voluntarily after receiving threats? Was he kidnapped and forced to take the Mark? If the latter, why not go to Dumbledore for help?

That lack of information is really unhelpful, as the picture painted by canon is really that he woke up one morning and thought "fuck this I really want to give being evil a go."

Now, if Peter was, as fanon portrays, someone who was never really liked by his friends and by the age of 21 had ten years of resentments against James and Sirius, maybe it makes sense that one day he snapped and decided to get nuclear style revenge for a decade of what he perceives as bullying. But I think, if you read between the lines of canon, by 1981 the outsider in the Marauders wasn't Peter. It was Remus. So what excuse does Peter have? The truth is he has none, and that's what makes his behaviour so devastating. I know the scene in POA film where Harry is all "hE wAs ThEiR fRiEnD" is the height of bad acting, and at the time he thinks the friend who betrayed them is Sirius, but the point is correct - the fact James and Lily were betrayed by a friend makes it so much worse. And the fact that so much fanon work /gives Peter an excuse/ actually, for me, takes away a good part of the sting of his betrayal.

*** All your points are really very accurate and that pleases me, the main problem lies, unfortunately, in much of both the canon and the fanon of the saga, really do not offer clear details about what led Peter to commit such decisions, in my scenario, for example, could have been something that involved his potential forced incorporation into the Death Eater and a threat to his family, we know nothing of a father of Peter, could he have been the first victim in the family circle of Peter? Probably, the next on the list would be his mother, and Peter, I believe, was very attached to her and would do whatever was necessary to protect her, as any son would do, even if it led him to make mistakes that he would regret later, and now, as far as his incorporation into the Death Eaters with the Dark Mark, I want to get used to the idea that he was forced, maybe he just wanted, initially, to serve as a spy and nothing else, in exchange for protecting his mother, without having anything more to do with them, and at the moment of truth, the Death Eaters, with the presence of Voldemort himself, put the mark on him. I clarify that that is the scenario I devised for such a situation, nothing is clear, but that for me could be a potential answer.

**** See, if he was a spy (and I like the idea that he could have been, and Voldemort actually got the location of the Potters from him with legilimacy) that sadly doesn't explain him framing Sirius. If he was a spy - Dumbledore will have known. All he had to do was go to him and say "I should have told you I was the secret keeper and he got the location out of my head"). Then it's an accident, everyone is satisfied with the explanation, Sirius and Remus actually think he was really brave and so on. (Tempted to write this one).

But the fact he framed Sirius in 1981 and then in 1993-4 went to rejoin Voldemort when, let's be honest, he could have just gone and lived as a pet rat with a Muggle family who wouldn't have had a clue and no one from the wizarding world would ever have found him again, shows that by at least the age of 21 he is committed to Voldemort and his cause.

Are there any fics out there that actually explore how and why he got to that position without falling back on the cliche of "James and Sirius used to forget Peter existed unless they needed a scapegoat," which just isn't an acceptable or realistic reason imo?

** I don't think Pettigrew was driven to Voldemort's side as purely by fear as some portray. When one looks at the graveyard scene, he has /no/ trouble or hesitation throwing a Killing Curse at a random teenager, which suggests some real talent/experience with a spell that supposedly requires intense hatred to cast. Later, the first thing he does with his new silver hand is test how much strength it has by crushing a twig to powder. To me, that comes across as less "sniveling cowardice" and more "power-hungry amorality".

If I were going to write the Marauders, I'd probably depict Pettigrew and Sirius as the group's collective id: Both would, albeit for different reasons, push towards crueler or more dangerous pranks - Sirius because he's even worse at considering the consequences of his actions than most teenagers and really hates anyone that's too similar to his family, Pettigrew because he doesn't care if people get hurt as long as he's safe and on top. Remus would be the halfhearted voice of reason and James the instigator and charismatic leader.

** I'd never really considered including a backstory for Peter in the fics I'm working on, but reading this made me have some ideas.

I agree with you, and I don't like the retcon job that JKR has done with the Sorting Hat "oh, it puts you in the house with values you admire...". I also don't like the way Peter is consistently written off as being someone that James, Sirius and Remus merely tolerated. He was part of their secret club, their inner circle, the "Marauders". They helped him become an animagus, he was definitely one of the fold.

So, my hastily created theory goes like this. Peter's sorting wasn't a fluke or a mistake, he has plenty of Gryffindor traits, including /wanting to be the centre of attention/. But in a cohort that included James and Sirius, Peter was overshadowed.

He wants to be the hero, and not be the weakest member of the group. Maybe he learns that Snape is now spy for the Order, and decides if /Snivellus/ can be a mysterious and dangerous double-agent, it would obviously be possible for Peter himself, so he gives it a go. Maybe he's hoping he'll even expose Snape as actually being a double-agent /agaunst/ Dumbledore. But then Peter gets made secret-keeper for Lily and James, so he hatches a plan. He can send Voldemort right to them, but then swoop in and save the day himself. He gets to be the hero, even better if he's actually the one who saves James, and he gets his 15m of fame.

Only the plan goes wrong as James doesn't hold Voldemort off long enough for Peter to arrive, and by the time he gets there, the Potters are all dead, Sirius is baying for blood, and Pettigrew has to vanish.

But by ensuring Sirius is painted as the villain of the piece, Pettigrew can still salvage something he wanted - he gets to be the hero, even if he has to fake his death and live with "posthumous" respect and regard.

** I do think Peter is generally underestimated in fanfic. He was friends with the other three Marauders for a reason. James trusted him with his life. Sirius claimed that he would have died for him. Remus was forever grateful that Peter became an animagus.

Peter was clever enough to become an animagus (with help but he did manage it). He was clever enough to frame Sirius for his crimes. He was clever enough to be instrumental in resurrecting Voldemort.

That said, GOOD Marauder fanfic takes this stuff into consideration. Let me drag out my standard list of Marauder recs:

/The Outcast,/ a short story, by Gilipin shows everyone as well-intentioned. Peter is clever, but a lot of his pain stems from not being the cleverest in the room.

linkffn(3706927)

In Marauder Lover's /White Flags/, a teenage Peter has already turned but it's clear that his suspicious behavior gets handwaved not out of contempt, but out of longtime friendship.

linkffn(9233100)

In Divine Comedian's constantly-recommended /They're Hiding Inside Me,/ Peter is part of the group decoding what happened to Sirius. I love his first entrance into Remus' mother's kitchen; the automatic comfort he brings Remus, the casual knowledge that Remus' mother bakes on full moons.

linkffn(12704985)

Stoplight Delight's unfinished epic /Against the Moon/ shows Peter struggling academically in comparison to his friends. It also shows how his insecurities stem from his family of origin. His father is in prison and his sister is a squib, which to me is a great headcanon.

linkffn(7305052)

Star of the North's /Story of Four Friends/ has Peter as a fully-fledged member of the team, too.

linkffn(1769213)

And I always ends with Hyphen's classic comedy /The Speculum Curse./ The titular curse emphasizes everyone's strengths by emphasizing their weaknesses.

linkffn(60352)

Good writing of Peter can be done and has been done.

  It's the summer after fifth year, and Sirius has made himself scarce as usual. But then Remus catches a glimpse of him in Witch Weekly's special on the Black-Malfoy wedding. Something about that photo is very, very off... Turns out this is the summer Sirius runs away. Or tries to. Because the Blacks are not giving up on their heir without a fight. (Light Remus/Sirius.)

** Honestly, I've always believed that the sorting isn't about what traits you have but what you hold in most esteem. It would help explain why certain people get put into certain houses as it's obvious that some people don't fit their houses traits.

I haven't read the actual books in a while, only fanfiction so I might be forgetting some things.

Percy, I believe, would have been in Slytherin however his families influence and the war prevented him from having a good view of it. Perhaps even the twins as they seem to have a single-minded desire to run a joke shop.

Hermione probably could have gone into Ravenclaw however heard about Gryffindor and how everyone favoured it and was influenced by this.

This then helps explain how whole family lines get put Into the same house as they've been brought up that way with the idea that a certain one is better.

Therefore this could help with how Pettigreww was put into Gryffindor. He values bravery while not always showing it.

** I couldn't agree more, Peter was their friend, they liked him and trusted him for a reason. And that's what made his betrayal so painful. I think you might enjoy my WIP. I've had a lot of compliments on my portrayal of Peter along the lines of 'I keep forgetting I hate him.' 😂😂 (although it does focus more on wolfstar 🤷‍♀️)

  The epic tale of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, from their first meeting until their happily ever after.A young werewolf who hasn't experienced human touch for six years meets a young pure-blood who's never known how it feels to be loved. The story follows Remus and Sirius through Hogwarts and beyond. Slightly AU in the beginning (mainly Remus believing he can infect people through skin contact), but goes major AU after the events of Halloween 1981.

** One thing you should consider is that many Marauder fics are light-hearted. Some writers want to portray the best friends angle or wolfstar/jily fluff and don't concern themselves with sticking to canon too much (as ambiguous as Marauder era canon is). From that perspective, you can see why Peter gets the short end of the stick.

The other thing working against Peter is that JK Rowling dismissed him in her interviews. Her answers about Peter only resurrecting Voldy because he was afraid of him/of his active followers don't really make sense with the rest of story. We're shown that Peter is instrumental in Voldemort's return. I can't imagine how Voldemort would have returned without Peter. So Peter has this big role in PoA and GoF because of plot purposes, but then he's doesn't do anything interesting in the last 3 books. Wasted potential if you ask me. If the author of the books botched Peter's character, you can hardly expect the average fan writer to do much better.

Something I haven't seen explored in fan fiction is the possibility that three Marauders became better people as they got older but Peter didn't. There could be some qualities of teenage Peter that hint towards the future he chose without making Peter the odd man out. I see many fans who will admit James was a bully but "James changed/the Marauders grew up," yet no one really explores the possibility that James could have been a bully who matured while Peter could have been a bully who didn't. There is more to the Marauders than being bullies, like their friendship, becoming Animagi and joining the Order, but if you gloss over the bullying completely, you lose the angle that these friends are changing as people at different rates. They're only 21 when the Secret Keeper switch happens. It's tricky to keep that balance in a fic where Peter might be very flawed, but he isn't being bashed and still has nuance as a character.

** When people make him a tagalong it takes away from how much of a piece of shit he really is. He didn't just betray some guy he hung out with in high school. These people loved him like family. They trusted him with their lives and they would've died for him. It would be like Ron or Hermione betraying Harry.
