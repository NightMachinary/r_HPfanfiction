Take the most ridiculous combination of characters you can think of (two or more) and lock them in a room. For some reason or other, they cannot escape for some undetermined amount of time and either wind up interacting with each other out of sheer boredom, or are forced to work with each other for whatever reason.

Example: Fred and Bellatrix are trapped in a waiting room in the afterlife. Due to some administrative issues in the Higher Ups' offices, they have to wait their turn to be processed. (Who knows how long that will take? Not them, that's for sure.) And, because of all the traffic piling up, those in the qeue have been forced to share rooms. What insanity could possibly transpire from here?


** Malfoy and ron stuck in a room with a chess board

after several hours of just staring at each other they decide to play chess and realise they are both pretty good at it and its nice to have a challenge

after they get out they go their own seperate ways and still play chess secretly using owl mail and their own chess boards.

the owl chess games even start include conversations about other topics, and the two bond slowly.

During sixth year draco, eventually ends up breaking down and telling ron about his mission and how scared and terrifed he is

and then ron is like come on bud, lets get you out of this.

** There's an amazing chapter (113) in Prince of Slytherin that's essentially this. Slytherin Harry has enough of his two father figures not getting along and locks Snape and Sirius into a room, gives them plenty of firewhiskey and won't let them out for a while. The chapter barely mentions the rest of the plot of the fic so it can be read like a oneshot.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius sat up in bed and snarled at the other man. "Well if you didn't think Remus was a werewolf, then WHY THE HELL DID YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY HE WENT TO THE SHRIEKING SHACK EVERY FULL MOON?!"

  "BECAUSE, YOU IMBECILE, I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHERE YOU MARAUDERS WENT TO BREW THAT ILLEGAL HOMEMADE FIREWHISKY THAT YOU'D BEEN SELLING TO THE LOWER YEARS! I KNOW IT HAS A MONTHLY BREWING CYCLE! THAT WAS WHAT I PLANNED TO USE TO GET YOU MARAUDERS INTO TROUBLE AND HOPEFULLY EXPELLED!"

  "DON'T BE SO STUPID! WE BREWED THE FIREWHISKY IN A BROOM CLOSET IN GRYFFINDOR TOWER!"

** For the sake of laughter (this is the most ridiculous thing I can think of right now)

During a side along apparition lesson, professors McGonagall and Snape have a mishap. They end up at Burning Man cannot get out of the tent they are in.

*** Others at the festival can come and go in their tent and they see the craziest Muggle hippies imaginable. Maybe Dumbledore put a spell on them to take them there so that they would both stop being so stuffy all of the time, so that they could learn to laugh more? Let's say that Dumbledore might have an end of summer party coming up and he does not want their constant bickering, unwillingness to work together, and stuffy air to ruin it for him.

**** Snape: Madam, those combination of colours - absolute absurdity.

Malkin: Oh, come now Snape, this is one of my most popular items. It deserves advertising.

Snape: Unfortunately, it does nothing for your complexion, reminiscent of a shrivlefig. You need something darker, to brighten yourself up.

Malkin: And end up the “Bat of Hogwarts?” I don't think so.

Snape: I choose to look intimidating, to keep my students in line. If I had the interest, I am perfectly capable of dressing myself if need be.

Malkin: I'll see it when I believe it.

Snape: No.

** A few months back I wrote a short fic aptly named This Most Absurd Predicament as a Christmas present for a friend in which Sirius and his father end up locked in a freezer room after a Death Eater chase and end up having to hug for warmth.

....It's very niche but you might enjoy it? xD

**** To be honest I don't have solid plans for a third chapter as this was only ever meant to be a one-shot, but I added a second chapter due to popular demand for a follow-up Walburga scene. However that may well change if inspiration strikes. I'll be sure to post if I write one :)

** I know this is a prompt but I've read a fic like this. The trio and Ginny plan to get to Riddle Manor and Snape ends up tagging along. They plus Voldemort and a few Death Eaters (just the male Malfoys I think then Bellatrix too later on) end up trapped there and play truth or dare. There's Snape/Hermione though.
