Howdy folks, as the title says, i'm looking for any and all fics where some action gets going between Tonks and Harry. Cute, badass, dark. Whatever ya got. Thanks in advance.


** These were recommended to me by [[/u/SemiKindaFunctional]]

For Harry/Tonks

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4714715/1/Renegade-Cause][Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor]] is probably one of the best fanfics in the fandom. Kind of strange, but fantastic writing and world building.

- Anything by the author ChelseyB. They're far more romance focused. Unfortunately they were deleted from FFnet, fortunately they're available to [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwfE6l6RtZAsN2ZmLThIYWJYUVU][here]]. Half Blood Auror and The Rebel And The Chosen are the best long form fics she wrote for H/T.

Agree on this one. One of my favorite premises. And story in general, plus or minus "minx" and some fairly Harlequin-y writing.
