Hello! I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for nearly the past decade, but I've only recently gotten into the larger community aspect of it since subscribing here a few months ago; before I stuck to the very small community of my OTP. It's clear that there are some very popular fics that nearly everyone has read. I was wondering if anyone had a list, or could direct me to a list, of 'must-read' stories that are significant in the fandom and worth a read.


** Take a look at these two threads:

- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2szm4v/as_a_fairly_new_reader/][... what are some classics that you'd recommend?]]
- [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2t0gud/what_would_you_consider_the_new_classics_of_hp/][... What are some fics that you think will become or already are "classics?"]]

*** Thank you! I hate to be a repost, but I was struggling to find things like that.

** Most authors have a favorites list, and the best authors are picky as hell. Go to the search page on FFnet and sort by reviews, favs, or follows. Then, instead of reading those stories, go to the authors pages and look at their favorite stories and authors. Most of the older authors have favorites as far back as 2002, things you'll never see in a regular search.

Further, non-writers such as [[https://fanfiction.net/%7Earedhair][ARedHair]] or [[https://fanfiction.net/%7Enedryos][myself]] also have large faves lists. If you can't find stuff you like on those pages, follow the links further back, and look at the faves of those fav'd authors.

If playing 6 Degrees of Northumbrian isn't enough, take a look at the communities. While some are long dead, several are still maintained with love and care, especially the bigger ones like DLP 5*.

If that's still not enough, head on over to the Teachers Lounge community on FFnet and get their help to get started writing, especially the challenges and plot bunnies threads.

Since you will be reading some rather obscure stories by following links so far back, I would recommend keeping a word file or Gmail doc of all the stories you've read with their titles and a link, and if you're really ambitious, some of your own tags/a review for them so you can look through and find them later. After having read thousands if fics of widely varying lengths and qualities, I desperately wish I had done this, if only so I could come into threads like this and say the X number of fics are my absolute top favorites and must reads.

** The TVTropes Harry Potter [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HARRYPOTTER][Fanfic Rec]] page is a pretty good place to start. There's where I first got into the community, and it kept me busy for about a year and a half. It's divided into categories as well, and most of the more notable stories have comments about why they're good and worthwhile.

There are a few people who also maintain their own "best of" lists, like [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkGVr2UUmX3AkexY8P9GZkQFMVfLsxVHckcwW2FzDSA/edit][Taure]], and, well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Elaneanasazi][me.]]

*** The TVTropes page is not very good, it's filled with authors plugging their own works and bad stories with shipping being recommended over genuinely good stories.

I'd recommend it after you've run out of other recommendations, though, there are some gems in there.

** You'll probably find a lot of repeats from this on the pages linked, but I thought I'd post my top 5 must reads. These are the ones that even years after they haven't updated or have been finished, I go back occasionally and read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies#]] My absolute favorite of the Time Travel Genre. Finished, but the sequel has been either abandoned or put on hiatus. Despite the HP-TMR character label, there is no slash.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power]] My favorite in the HP/FD pairing. This is actually a repost of the original fic, after the author deleted it and stopped writing. There is both a rabid fanbase, and a rabid horde of nay sayers regarding this work. Harry is a bit of a Gary Stu, and the fic isn't completed. Regardless, something about it really appeals to me.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Nightmares-of-Futures-Past]] Recently updated, and though I haven't read that (mainly because I've forgotten what exactly was happening in the latest chapters) I remember this story being very good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]] One of the few Cracky/pure comedy fics I enjoyed. Gen.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time]] One of the most superb pieces of original work on the site. The writing is a bit heavy.... so heavy in fact that I haven't finished it, cause I have to stop and read something lighter. Still...In terms of originality, this can't be beat.
