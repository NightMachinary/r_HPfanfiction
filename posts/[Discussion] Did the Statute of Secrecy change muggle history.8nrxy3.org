I have been wondering about this for a while. On the one hand figures such as Merlin, Circe, and Morgana are known to muggles, though assumed to either be exaggerations or mythical. Considering muggles were aware of the existence of magic prior to the SoS being established, and this likely affected there history in significant ways, did magicals have to go and alter all the muggle texts and references as well? Did they have to remove all serious references from ancient ruins and settlements?

Another interesting thought: some people in history may have been changed from magical to non-magical since they were too important to leave out entirely (like removing Alexander, Ghengis Khan, or Julius Caesar). Can anybody come up with good examples of people who were changed to non-magical in history?

1692, and yes, that does tie neatly to science starting its rise. Although it's not cause and effect, as the likes of Robert Boyle had been notable for doing actual science for thirty or more years at that point. It's the period when Isaac Newton (TOTALLY a wizard) was keeping his alchemy on the down-low and publishing only his mundane science and mathematics. One suspects he was one of those figures who had to choose which world to remain in when the Statute passed, the fact of his magic being part of why the historical record of the man is so decidedly /odd/.

And yes, Egypt up to the end of the Ptolemaic period was definitely run by wizards. The magic that the kings of Egypt were required to practise is recorded on papyri, monuments and temple walls - they couldn't erase it all, not least because quite a lot of it was buried - and the best they could hope for would be it being put down to myth.

(Which suggests that the Nile Valley is to magic as the Zone Rouge is to the First World War. Absolutely /lousy/ with contamination and unexploded ordnance such that the projected clean-up time measured in centuries. Which is what the Gringotts teams are actually doing there, the recovered treasure just being a bonus.)

There are also a lot of old stories about Christian clergy being able to work magic, some of them as late as the 9th century. In our universe, just myth-making. In the Potterverse, the fragments of real history that made it through the editing process.

*** in 1692 gunpowder with cannons and arkebuse were already a mainstay in battlefields, so I suspect the magical Community saw what the 30 years war did to them and it might have taken the Last old wizards to die so that they were able to Pass the statute internationally

*** If I had to guess, Rowling picked 1692 because its the date of the famous Salem Witch Trials. Its somewhat ironic since, while horrible and definitely not a high point for Magical/Muggle relations, it pales in comparison to events like the Spanish inquisiton. Hell, Hammurabi laid out a procedure for dealing with magical or magically affected people that is more or less in line with the Puritans' methods, and that was 3500 years beforehand.

To speculate, the magical societies of the world were probably debating this decision for decades or even centuries. Possibly, it was already being instituted in certain regions where more trouble had already occurred (I can see Italy getting in on this earlier). But now an entirely new land was discovered. And what happened? Two hundred years of direct and indirect genocide or subjugation of the population, often enforcing certain beliefs on both the invaders and invaded. Finally, the last straw. People fled to escape persecution (or perceived anyway) in Europe, and they still persecuted others for not following their beliefs or ideals.

Most big events in history are like this. A long creep towards a particular outcome, followed by a trigger that leads a sweeping change in the world.

**** Well, that might be Rowling's reason for picking that year, but it doesn't make a lot of sense for the final outcome of a leglislative/political process, no matter how long debated. My own view is that it's the outbreak of the Nine Years War, 1689, one of the first wars to really go global. Most of the magicals who were politically prominent by that time would have been children or young adults at the end of the Thirty Years War - /notorious/ for the witchhunts that went on during the fighting, which was only the headline act for a century of utter mayhem - and it would be easy to use a sentiment of "Never again" to call an international summit and drive through the Treaty that's enacted in the constituent ministries as the International Statutes.

***** Thats right! I had forgotten the Thirty Years War happened just before that.

The thing is, I think you might be assuming a bit more unity in the magical world. Magical society appears to have remained stagnant with regard to most of the developments in the muggle world for the next three centuries. There are multiple possible reasons for why this is: ignorance of muggles in general due to their isolation, attempts to preserve a unique magical culture separate from the muggles, or simply a desire to not change the way things are.

In this regard, the wizarding world is almost like the Fallout-universe. Cultural development stagnated due to a large change in the circumstances, and was maintained through either by choice or happenstance. Nations were largely independent of one another at that time, with conflicts being where most people met or interacted with the peoples of other nations (this is generalization, not true of everyone, just like magicals). The magical world seems to have mostly kept the former governmental styles prior to the SoS. The nations of the magical world seem to largely stay out of each others issues, as one can deduce from the apparent lack of response by any other nation or force to either rise of Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Nations where magical societies formed after the SoS was passed probably ended up being more like the current governmental style of there muggle counterparts.

**** I think it's more Anglocentric than that: the statue was signed in 1689, the same year as the English Bill of Rights, and the Ministry of Magic was subsequently founded in 1707, the same year as the Acts of Union between England and Scotland.

JKR has stated in interview that she tries to have events in the Muggle and magical worlds mirror each other, and I think here she has attempted to have Muggle and magical moments of huge constitutional change coincide. It's simply an artefact of the books being set in Britain that the international statue mirrors domestic British politics.

I feel like there would be a connection there - with magic no longer being something you can point to as an explanation, other methods would be needed to fill the gap. Science didn't have to be the one to take over, but it did, and now muggles don't just live separate lives, a huge chunk of them imagine the universe according to totally different rules.

EDIT: Cleopatra was totally a witch, and it's likely that many Egyptian, Roman, and Greek nobles were as well. Probably dang near every pharaoh, a significant number of Hellenic kings, and I wouldn't be shocked to find out most senators were technically wizards.

Ballpark: India would make wizards their own jats, of course, and probably their own varna: the Bhramins. China would have been run by wizards until the Yuan dynasty at least - and the Ming might have all been closet wizards.

Second edit: 1692 is in the Qing dynasty - so that probably means basically all of the Chinese Empire had wizards near the top, and the inability to keep using magic to solve international problems may have been a big factor in the Century of Humiliation. Which leads to the question of how the PRC deals with wizards. I could see them going either way, really.

*** You sort of run into a tricky thing with Cleopatra: she was a descendant of the Ptolomaic dynasty that took over after Alexander kicked it (they were Macedonians). So she wouldn't be quite the same as the previous pharoahs during the Old/Middle/New Kingdom. Its kind of interesting to think she was a parselmouth though: she ordered the serpent to kill her to prevent humiliation by Octavion.

India is an interesting case, since the Vedas speak of so-called superhuman individuals that roamed the sub-continent. Its hard to identify any famous cases that might have been changed to fit muggle histories though.

WIth China I see them being something like the source of a large amount of the potioneering and alchemical theory, and this gave them a huge advantage over less advanced societies around them. You could preface this that the steppe nomads around them (like the Tatars or the Jurchin) attacked so they could get ahold of these secrets held by the imperial courts of the various dynasties. I can also see them somewhat elevating most if not all the talented magical practitioners to positions in the bureaucracy, in large part to control the available knowledge and secrets.

I had an interesting thought that William Shakespeare was a master of emotional magics and/or sound magics, and used these to identify the most moving phrases and stories for his plays.

Or the Globe had a transfigurationist on staff, so that "Exit, Pursued By A Bear" was a stage direction that /meant/ something...
