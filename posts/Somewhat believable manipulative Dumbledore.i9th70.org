Because of the Harry Potter books being for kids and the like, you can argue that in some instances Dumbledore could be manipulative.

But, a lot of the time the manipulation is so outlandish and over the top, that it makes me want to stop reading.

No Manipulative or bad/wrong doing Hermione and Ron please.

Maybe Harry finds out on his own, maybe Dumbledore tells him things, that he's done to Harry. Maybe Harry makes new alliances with Snape, Malfoy and the like. (Just an idea).

Note: If there are any manipulative Dumbledore this is relatively believable, where maybe even Harry ends up finding out stuff, and not forgiving him, but still working alongside him in some way, would be great.

None of this has to be 100% what I said, there can be differences to what I'm wanting.

Can be on any site, can be any length, can be a main thing or a minor thing in the story, can be old or new, completed or not.

If there are any pairings, though I'm not looking for any: Am fine with het/slash/femslash, threesomes and the like.


** linkao3(62948455) this story is interesting bc Dumbledore doesn't do anything different from canon but Harry feels betrayed for his role in his death (it's a pretty long time travel story, and the Dumbledore thing isn't the main plot).

linkao3(5418194) it's part of a series and you should check it out if that's your kind of story. basically Harry grows up in an Orphanage and things are different because of it. Harry doesn't really trust Dumbledore especially with his living situation (Dumbledore wants him back with the Dursleys) but they aren't enemies. There's also some light criticism of his actions regarding bringing the philosophy stone to Hogwarts.

linkao3(10066109) I haven't read this one (it's in my marked for later list). femslash Sirius/Remus, Sirius and Remus raising Harry.

linkao3(20049589) Dark!Harry - well written in my opinion. Re-sorting.

linkao3(16186133) Walburga gets Sirius out of Azkaban and Sirius feels betrayed by Dumbledore's inaction.

  The note pinned to his collar read 'Harry J Potter - please accept'. The Dursleys had left him with nothing else but a pillow sack with half a sleeve of McVities biscuits, a mealy apple, and ten pounds.

  "So you're telling me that you've not only lost Harry Potter, but that he's currently in the hands of a traitor and a deserter?""Sending Hagrid alone was an oversight, I admit."  AKA Yet Another Sirius and Remus Raise Harry AU only they're both women now bc fuck it(alternate title: sometimes the best offence is a good defence)

  In the summer before his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry is drawn to a room in Grimmauld Place. Like the Gryffindor he is, he enters the room without fear. The room is a library, and Harry is surprised to find that he's eager to learn. Then he gets the bad news: he's been accidentally expelled from Hogwarts, and he needs to be sorted again. Everyone is confident that he'll go straight back to Gryffindor, but with what he's been learning, Harry's not so sure.

  The portrait of Cygnus Black I that hung in the Ministry reported that her firstborn had been sent to Azkaban without any trial whatsoever. It made Walburga furious. Not on His behalf, of course, but because of the utter disrespect shown to a scion of the Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. How dare they? If she let them get away with it, then next time those filthy blood traitors might think it was perfectly fine to treat that way a worthy member of the House of Black. After all, it had set a precedent. A bad precedent. It mustn't be allowed. Or, Walburga Black saves Sirius from Azkaban, and it changes everything.

  What if Petunia wasn't so poisoned by jealousy her sister's magic, and when her orphaned nephew appeared on her doorstep chose to treat him as family rather than a burden? Sorted into Hufflepuff, how will the Wizarding World react when their saviour finally returns? And is being fair and loyal really as good as people say?
