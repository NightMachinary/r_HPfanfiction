** I don't have anxiety or depression and I use HP as an escape from the stress and pressure of everyday life and a highly demanding career, sometimes to my detriment. If I find a fic I really like I'll often stay up have the night reading and go to work exhausted the next morning.

Hell I've been using HP as an escape since I was in grade school.

That said, it's not a bad thing. Depending on how you define escape, anything that's not an obligation could be considered an escape, and that's perfectly healthy and normal to do.

Fan fiction isn't weird or taboo. The only unfortunate thing is that most people think of sex when you say fanfiction. Calmly correct them and they will accept it as any other hobby.

** I was diagnosed with depression about three years ago, and last year I really involved myself in writing HP fanfic and roleplaying on Tumblr, primarily as Harry and also as Lucius Malfoy.

In terms of experience, it really helped me to flesh out AUs the way I did - I wrote and RPed a completely non-canon Harry post-war, as I wasn't a big fan of the epilogue, and sinking myself into characters was a great distraction for me.

Part of depression's insidiously soul-crushing nature is in the way it saps away your passions, ambitions, and desires - feelings fade from full-colour to black and white, and it becomes hard to remember who you are as a person, how it feels to function, almost.

Sinking myself into Harry's character really helped, to be honest - I could temporarily detach myself from feeling nothing and feel vicariously, delighting in world-building and plotting and working.

I'm medicated now, so my depression's not a working weight on me, but I'm grateful for how writing in the HP universe with other HP writers shored me up, I won't lie.

I think when the world goes sepia like that, a splash of colour from anywhere is good to grab onto, and for me, HP was it.

IDK if that's the sort of experience you were looking for, but yeah.

** Mines not neccessarily in a good way. For a stretch of about 3 months all my life would consist of was doing drugs going to work and reading fanfiction. I'd get high and read fanfiction for hours, wake up get high go to work and read fanfiction for hours, come home get high read fanfiction for hours. My memory of the times are so hazy I can't even remember which ones I'd read. It wasn't a great time for me personally. However on the flipside reading fanfiction helped me get through withdrawrals as well. So every cloud I guess.

** About three years ago I realised that I'm transgender, after that my life basicly fell apart. I turned to fanfiction and grand strategy games as a form of escapism. At my peak of dysfunction I was reading about a half a million words a week and gaming for 40-60 hour on top of having a full time job. Fanfiction saved my life, on at least two occasions I managed to convince myself to kill myself after I'd finished the fic, by the time I'd finish the fic my dysphoria and anxiety would have receded.

I'm better now (mostly) but my love of fanfiction has remained.

** Definitely. 99% of fanfiction is popcorn. Easily consumable, don't have to think or expend energy. It's free. There's no commitment as it can be quickly binged.

I have no self control when it comes to reading. It's actually really limiting. I can't read while in school because I cannot control myself. If I start a book, I finish it. Then I think, just one more chapter in the sequel. And then I finish that one too. And I start in on the next book and finish that as well. And somehow it's 4:45 and I have to wake up in less than two hours.

So, fanfiction helps deal with my real world stress and also avoids adding in the stress that reading "real" books does.

** Yes I have. This is my story. Never has it been told anywhere near in full and right now I need to write. It is therefore much longer than strictly necessary to answer your question, for which I apologize; however, all stories need be begun.

My story begins, and hopefully ends, with escape. I was one of those exceptionally lucky kids who first experienced Harry's story when they were his age. I turned twelve a couple of months before the summer of 1999, which is the summer that my younger brother, idiot that he was, proceeded to break his leg falling off of a fence. My mother was already with a broken her leg from earlier that spring and so, in an attempt to free my father from the complications inherent to a pre-teen, I was bundled off on a vacation with my aunt and uncle. In one of those curious coincidences inevitable in chaotic environments, a book, originally intended as a gift to my brother for breaking his leg, ended up amongst our suitcases.

That book quickly found its way into my hands whereafter I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone nine times in a row. That is, as soon as the last page was finished I began anew on the first. Perhaps the anticipation of a Hogwarts letter is more magical; the hope that maybe magic does exist. But I didn't need hope, an owl, or a letter for I already was at Hogwarts. I adventured with Ron and learned with Hermione. Though my childhood did not resembled Harry's in the least, in that moment, with attention focused on my brother, I felt completely isolated. And like Harry, Hogwarts was my escape.

At the time I lacked the awareness, but looking back each book renewed that sense of escape. My interest piqued, I quite quickly found and consumed Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. A year later, I unintentionally borrowed my relatives newly purchased copy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire; later I learned that it hadn't been quite intended for being lent so quickly. My very first family-less travel happened to set off mere hours after the release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix; I barely managed to read the first two chapters and on that trip I decided to listen to those two chapters, and only those chapters, over and over again. In an attempt to savor Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows I promise to limit myself to a couple of chapters per day, which lasted only as long as the time I took to promise.

Throughout this, despite my tremendous enjoyment of the Harry Potter series, I never was involved in what would become the stereotypical social activities of Harry Potter fanatics. I never attended a book release party nor, later on, a film release. I spent little time in discussions about characters, future plot lines or magical theories. In fact, from perspectives external to that of my immediate family members there likely would be little evidence of Harry Potter's significance to me. For the beginning, Harry Potter was always an escape; it never connected me to the community.

After Deathly Hallows, I never anticipated that I could ever again truly escape with Harry. And then, five years ago, just before bed, I re-found him. He came in the form of a link to HPMOR posted by a random redditor on a random reddit thread. That year was my first year in graduate school and I was struggling a bit with all that entails. And here came Harry Potter, familiar and willing, to be my rescuer. I finished the first eighty or so chapters of HPMOR over a couple of days (and interestingly have never gone back). I found and read other stories but initially I retained a focus on school. But, as we all know, there is no end to fanfiction; there are always other stories. And similar to Deathly Hallows, I couldn't stop. Harry Potter fanfiction quite quickly became more than my escape from life; it became my life.

I started to read until two or three or four in the morning. Quite quickly my thoughts were totally focused on what had happened in my current story, when I could read again, or where I would find the next one. School fell by the wayside. I read eight to ten to twelve hours a day. I jumped from Snape's Chronicles to Backwards with a Purpose, from Timely Errors to Prince of a Dark Kingdom, from A Stranger in an Unholy Land to Promises Unbroken and on and on. I knew then that my behavior could get me into trouble but I managed passing grades in my classes. Fortunately, in a sense beyond the obvious, I had hope for some respite over the upcoming summer.

For my brother, whose broken leg first revealed Harry Potter to me, and I made plans to spend that summer traveling Europe. We were able to visit, however briefly, a number of beautiful and fascinating cities. From Dublin to Tangier and Venice to Oslo, we drank, explored, and had a couple of adventures. As we travelled, I managed to limit my consumption of Harry Potter fanfiction to a couple of hours here and there. I hoped that my experiences would stop the fanfiction binges.

When I returned, I picked up right where I had left my consumption of fanfiction. Initially, I attended my classes but, with my new apartment further from my department than the old, that quickly stopped. By the halfway point of the semester, only food, beer, and the single hour of problem sessions on Thursday nights required to "fulfill" my TA contract could pull me away from my apartment and my attention, however briefly, away from my phone.

Instead, I read fanfiction all day. What, in the previous semester, I spent eight to twelve hours of my day on became twelve to sixteen. As we are all aware, not enough good stories exist to fill all those hours. So, and this is no exaggeration, I literally trawled fanfiction.net. I picked a character, Lily was first, and went through the list of stories for which they were the chosen characters page by page. After finding a readable story, I would spiderweb into that author's other stories and onto their own favorite stories and authors. Sometimes I was led to tumblr or another fanfiction site and sometimes I found nothing. After I exhausted those strand, I would return to my previous spot on the list.

I did this for at least four characters. To put this in context, right now Lily is a labelled character in around twenty thousand stories; back then, I believe she was in around fourteen thousand. I probably read anywhere between twenty and thirty percent of those fourteen thousand stories not including stories that I found off site.

*** This was not sustainable. At first, whenever real life reared up I would buckled down by devoting more time to fanfiction. By December, I was probably reading eighteen to twenty hours a day. That left maybe five hours for sleep with some change for making food. In an average day, I might wake up at eight, read for sixteen to eighteen hours, fall asleep at two the next, wake up at four, read for a couple more hours, fall back asleep at six, and start again at eight.

One day, as I drove to the department to 'fulfill' my other TA responsibilities, I broke. I realized that there would be no escape; that there was little chance of me living through January.

For the first time in months, my unyielding focus on fanfiction fell away at time and was replace by thoughts of suicide. Turns out even Harry Potter couldn't help me escape that.

I can't tell you why I am certain that I would have killed myself. In the end, I never made an attempt. The real world finally broke through. It broke through in the form of a call a few days before Christmas from my brother. The brother whose broken leg originally led me to Harry Potter and whose companionship the previous summer had momentarily stalled my descent.

He had been diagnosed with Leukemia. I didn't believe him at first; I made him send me a picture of the bag of blood on his IV. And as quickly as the certainty of my impending suicide hit me, it went away. I was not better. I merely decided not to attempt suicide while my brother was in the hospital.

My parents ordered me home for Christmas. I'm sure that if had returned under normal conditions they would have immediately noticed that I was a mess but these were not normal conditions.

I don't remember much of the next month. I spent time with my brother in hospital room. I saw a couple of friends. I ended up borrowing another book from my brother: ASOIAF.

One distinct memory that I do remember is the last time I visited him in the hospital. I walked out of his room without saying goodbye, which is something I would normally do. I stopped in the lobby to wonder if I really wanted to leave without a goodbye. I don't remember what I decided.

I 'returned' to school at the end of January. Nothing real had changed; I still read Harry Potter fanfiction for sixteen to eighteen hours a day. I decided to hold off on any suicide attempts. Of course all bets were off when my brother's status resolved.

My brother successfully underwent a bone marrow transplant. After about two months in the hospital, he was released. Over the next couple months he appeared to progress; he travelled a little bit and seemed reasonably upbeat. Then, at the beginning of May, he crashed. Graft versus host disease. When I returned, he was already in a coma. He was tubes and machines and awful, flaky, weak-looking skin.

He never woke up. There a couple of weeks in which his condition might have been said to make some slight improvement, which, per my understanding of Doctor-speak, essentially meant that he was dead yet. My parents hoped those improvements were real. But he never woke up.

I had left in the interim. Staring at the tubes and listening to much parents was too much work. I came back for his funeral. His body looked constructed from paper mache. And I promised him or me or something that I would try. That I wouldn't give up.

I did. I weaned myself of off fanfiction. Somehow I was able to return to school. I got back into shape. A year later, I found an advisor.

Some times were worse than others. Bad days, bad weeks, and maybe a bad month. Times when I felt myself sinking again. Strangely, the worst part of the bad weeks are the highs. The lows certainly suck but the highs are worse. Like a roller coaster, it is during the highs that you see where your headed.

During those times I often wished it had been me. Or thought that maybe, if I had pulled the trigger early on in his illness some small thing would change and he would live. I am not stupid; I know I would have changed nothing. But I also know that the world would have been a better place if it had been me. Not in some grand global sense, I am not so egotistical. But the little corner of the world occupied by our family and friends would be better. He was a better son, a better friend, and a better brother than I ever could be.

I pushed through. Until about two months ago. Two months ago I finally hit the real warning sign: I started reading Harry Potter fanfiction again. Like five years ago. This last month, I have gotten back to reading eight or ten hours a day. I had planned on defending my thesis in July but every day when I sit down and try to write I feel awful. And fanfiction is just a click away to dull that pain.

This time is worse because I know where I'll end up (though I must my story selection has improved). The first time I focused on the good feeling. Now I can't help but recognize all the feelings and thoughts being pushed down.

I struggled against the pull a little more this time. And I hold hope that writing this will help. Maybe after finally saying things that I needed to say ages ago, even to internet strangers such as yourselves, my head will clear enough that I can pull myself through. Or maybe not. I kind of wish I was an indy!Harry that so many people write. Not because of his overpowered badassery but because they always seem to know the future, which sounds fantastic. The benefit of being the author's in-universe avatar I suppose.

I suppose I should actually answer your question. I have used Harry Potter fanfiction as an escape from depression and anxiety. I have realized it can also be a drug. And I suppose that by providing me a place I feel comfortable enough sharing, Harry Potter fanfiction can provide me a real escape.

**** I definitely recommend that you find someone to speak with whether a counselor or a trusted parent or mentor. My mention of advisor above was in the context of a research advisor; however, I have spoken with counselors in the past. The most recent, which corresponded with my improvement about 4 years ago, did help some.

If you are still in university, I would definitely recommend exploring the options they provide. They are generally inexpensive and have experience with many of the particular issues that students can face. It can be a bit of challenge to find one who works well with you; definitely search around.

** A little yes. I have had anxiety since I was two (26 years of this stuff has given me adequate time to learn about my needs when it hits). What I have learned is if I can find a way to get my mind off of the thought (mine is characterized by an OCD thought process - I fixate on my trigger) and off my routine, it helps me through the episode. Fanfiction in general helps me with this. Writing makes my mind focus on something other than my panic and my trigger thought so I get through it easier. If I can get out of my anxiety cycle, the subsequent depression can't set in as quickly.

HP fanfiction helps on a higher scale because there are many high quality writers and readers to compete with and satisfy so I have to put my whole mind and heart into it. When I write HP, I can't focus on my anxiety thoughts.

** Yes, I was unhappy socially as a younger teenager and later suffered from diagnosed depression. At times fanfic was a little too escapist, but since you can use practically anything as escapist, escaping into fanfic didn't have many side effects. I still love it and fanfic>trashy novels.

I just wish I'd gotten more involved in the community aspects or tried to unleash my own creativity more.

** yes, and it=s nice to know that i=m not the only one! I am re-writing a story that is therapeutic for me in a lot of ways, and it helps to explore, how another might have reacted in a similar situation, and to see how other characters react to it. Reading when i`m depressed helps, especially hurt-comfort fics. It lets me get engrossed in another character and detach myself for the anxiety or depression.

** I have bipolar disorder and anxiety. Reading in general has always been a very big part of my life. The Harry Potter universe is like a little anchor, something that's for the most part stable and not going away. And I can immerse myself in it however I like. So it's an escape at times, a way to vent without doing it myself, a release for emotions (nothing like a damn good angsty fic with the deaths of your favorite characters to make you cry like a baby). But it's safe.

Abusive relationships, death, harm, war, you name it. I can trick my head into 'experiencing' dangerous or harmful things without actually getting the urge to go do things I'll regret. Keeps my head busy.

I can't safely take the medications that I should because of unrelated health issues, so this is like a form of safe self medication.

** I definitely use it as a source of comfort and also to read angsty!Harry fics so I don't feel so alone when I'm in those darkest places. Glad to know I'm not the only one who does so.
