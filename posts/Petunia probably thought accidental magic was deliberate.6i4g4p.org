It occurred to me - the first memory we see of Petunia is her watching Lily perform magic intentionally. She even says how Lily isn't allowed to do it. Not only is everyone in the household aware of Lily's specialness, but they seem aware that she can control it. Lily does two deliberate, intentional acts of magic in that one memory. The next memory, Snape intentionally breaks a branch over Petunia's head in a fit of anger.

I can just see every time Harry did something, Petunia believing that he's doing it deliberately. Every time he protested that he had no idea what he did, she probably remembered Snape claiming he didn't hurt her.

Of course, having been raised to believe magic wasn't real, Harry truly didn't believe he did things. He certainly never practised it. I think the books said he had no idea how he was responsible for things like the hair growing back, the teacher's wig turning blue, or the glass disappearing, but his aunt and uncle blamed him anyway.

I feel it sort of makes me feel a little bit sorry for Vernon and Petunia. They probably thought everything Harry did he did deliberately and was laughing at them in his sleeve. And she probably was always aware of that time Snape hit her with a branch deliberately, and afraid that Harry could do anything at any time. She probably thought Harry kept his hair messy deliberately to be spiteful, given how she kept trying and trying to get it neat, and then he goes and grows it all back exactly how it was.

Of course, nothing excuses the way they raised both Harry and Dudley. But you can imagine their frustration when an entire pane of glass disappears, letting a large snake out, in the middle of a large crowd of people. And you believe it's deliberate.

*** She must've watched Lily fib about something she'd done more than once (and probably tattled on her) the way kids do. Of course I didn't take the cookies, how could I have? ? Cue big innocent green eyes. They're farrrr too high for me to reach! The pantry door was locked! I never set foot in kitchen!

** I agree that she probably could have thought something like this, because she's looking for reasons to hate Harry, but I don't think that it's a rational or reasonable belief.

You'll have to think that Harry is 1. an amazing actor for a child and at the same time 2. remarkably stupid to be so obvious about his intentional magic.

***** Occasionally I come across fics that make me feel sorry for them and make them sympathetic, but then I remember canon them and I can't really. Especially the ones where they're the same people but circumstances are different. If it's an AU where Lily happened to have a sister who was decent and married a decent man, that's one thing, but if it's a story where the only difference is they divorced, or one died, or Dumbledore threatened them, or they had a revelation of some kind - I sometimes have to remind myself that these are still terrible people.

******* Yeah, I can actually stand Dudley redemption fics, seeing as he was really brainwashed by his parents. He even seemed to have regretted the way he acted in canon.

This might be unrelated, by I also really love fics where the Durleys are not so much abusive as they are apathetic towards Harry. Like, they just let him do whatever as long as he doesn't bother him. He was basically forced onto them, so I can see this outcome being somewhat realistic if they didn't hate magic so much. I like it when Dudley forms something of a friendship with Harry of his own accord or something like that.
