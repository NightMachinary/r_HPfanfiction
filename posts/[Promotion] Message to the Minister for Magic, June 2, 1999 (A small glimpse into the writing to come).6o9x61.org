Dear Sir,

At the request of our director, I have written this letter to you in an attempt to explain the circumstances surrounding the storm that hit the country 3 days ago.

As you know, the storm that hit our country was determined to be of magical nature, despite the readings of tools used by ours and other departments. As to how the tools failed to pick up anything of note is still under investigation; they all seemed to be in perfect working order. the current theory in several of our departments is that the Magic in the storm was of otherworldly origin and thus did not register as any Magic of our world would. Of course there are other theories as well, but none that hold any water in the opinion of our director.

While we are still trying to acertain the exact nature of the storm, we have so far been able to catalog the damage and anomalies produced by it:

-Damage was expected since the storm behaved like any other natural storm would. The scale of the damage is comparable to that caused by a Category 4 Hurricane, and as I understand it you have been in contact with the Muggle Minister to expedite repair and recovery for the country. Damage to magical communities and Ministry buildings has been almost non-existent, and the Word from Hogwarts is that they survived damage free.

-There are currently no ghosts anywhere in the proximity of where the storm passed. Ghosts that have been around for centuries have disappeared without a trace. As far as we know, it is impossible for a ghost to pass on to the other side, and are stuck in limbo here. The disappearance of ghosts is far from strange, however. We have a running theory that we should see ghosts as old as wizards and witches have been around, but outside of a few rare occurances most ghosts don't date to anywhere older than 2000 years. Take that information as you will, but as of right now The UK is almost entirely ghost-free.

-The last measureable anomaly we have found is related to the incident at St. Mungo's. As of right now, roughly just over two dozen patients in the Dementor ward have shown signs of regaining a soul. There is no explanation for this that we know of. Furthermore, all but one seem to have regressed to the mentality of a baby, or perhaps someone gone mad. The one exception, an 11 year-old girl, does not speak but shows comprehension of someone her age. I cannot comment further as this matter is best left to the soul department, but needless to say we will be studying all of the patients closely.

I do hope that this has helped you so that you might better direct departments as well as assuage public concern in the aftermath of this storm. On the last point, we will keep you updated as to the progress of those from St. Mungo's.

Regards, Barnaby Nevin Secretary to Head of Department of Mysteries

PS: The director would like to apologize for going over your head and making use of the obliviators in regards to the incident with St. Mungo's. He assumed it would be better to keep that matter from public knowledge for now.

{{Tell me what you think! Does this pique your interest for more?}}

** Well, definitely sounds like you aren't doing a canon rehash. And I'm intrigued by stories that start with formal letters, I think.

*** I've been writing letters and notes in a small journal, as well as setting info to build the world up. This is just the first one I've written that isn't so much a rough draft, and more a combination of other things I wrote down.
