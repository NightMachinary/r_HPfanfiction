** Which aspect(s) of ABC are you looking for? The buddy-flick thing? ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6452481/1/Gryffindors-Never-Die][Gryffindors Never Die]]). Long, humorous time/dimension travel? ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]) Bawdy humor? (most all of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649528/nonjon][nonjon]]'s work, though [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2354771/1/Where-in-the-World-is-Harry-Potter][Where in the World is Harry Potter]] and its sequels in particular)

**** Oh God Not Again is really good at what it's supposed to do, making fun of time-travel tropes while still telling a pretty good story. Not very much romance either, but 2nd and 3rd year might take a while to get through.

*** Got anything else like GND? I'd prefer other harry + ron buddy style fics, though any pairing will do as long as it's non slash (the harry ron should also be non slash)

**** It's Ron-centric (and not really like GND in anything but the character interactions), but I really enjoyed jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]]. It had a balanced Ron/Harry dynamic.

** Someone linked to [[http://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/seventh-horcrux-thread-2-a-harry-situation.311264/][Seventh Horcrux]] on another reddit thread a while back. FYI, although there's a link to a FF.net version, most of the story isn't posted there.

A Black Comedy surprised me by being both funny and having an actual plot. Seventh Horcrux doesn't have as much in the way of plot, but it's very funny. Give it a shot =).
