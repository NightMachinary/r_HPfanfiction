Once upon a time, when the book series wasn't yet concluded, Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, and Harry/Luna were all seen as viable options, and there was a vibrant community of fic writers for all three ships. While the first two ships still remain popular (and even have their own subreddits), Harry/Luna seems to have become a more fringe pairing in recent years.

There are still /some/ very good authors currently writing H/L content; my personal recommendations would be [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Cheerful_Clatter/pseuds/Cheerful_Clatter][Cheerful_Clatter]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/TheKorpswomanOfKrieg/pseuds/TheKorpswomanOfKrieg][TheKorpswomanOfKrieg]] on AO3. However, recent trends have seemed to show this ship going away in favor of Harry/Daphne, Ginny/Luna, or - in instances where Harry and Luna still /are/ shipped together - polyamorous H/L ships that also include Hermione or Ginny (the so-called "Lunar Harmony" and "Lunar Hinny", respectively).

So what does everyone think is going on here? Do people stay away from writing Harry with Luna because it's a challenge to get their personalities to mesh the right way? Do they find it easier to write using a "blank slate" character like Daphne than they do to try and get inside Luna's head? Has it become too difficult for writers to see Luna as someone who would fit in a monogamous heterosexual relationship - hence the increased number of poly ships?

I'd just be curious to know why straight-up H/L seems to be fewer and farther between now, while the other ships are continuing to thrive. It's a puzzling situation.


** The fandom has grown up a bit. I might be completely off base here but I would guess the average age of writers in the fandom has gone up. As such Luna is being viewed less as tumblr memes incarnate, lulz random or some other unfunny shit but more as a conspiracy theorist oddball. Quirky and mostly well meaning but she's not exactly stable. IRL most people would avoid Luna, even if you were friends I imagine you would make excuses to leave after a few hours of her. More people are realising this when reflecting on the books as more adult like than when they first read the books.

The second reason is a bit of meta regarding FFN. A theory I have floated before is that the filtering through pairings/characters has lead to certain pairings being pigeonholed into certain plots. For example a political Harry story will be a Daphne pairing. A competent Ministry fic will use Susan Bones as a big chested device to get to her aunt. Gabrielle tends to have neglected or damaged Harry needing a fresh start away from everything. Fleur is edgelord powerwank pairing. The rockstar's trophy bimbo. Obviously it is not absolute but If you accept that premise then where does Luna fit in? The best I can think of is crack fics.

**** I've done a very quick look on FFN at the numbers. Hannah Abbot and Harry only share 120 ish stories, same with Harry and Katie Bell. Even these don't guarantee that it would be the main pairing. With those numbers I don't think the sample size is really enough to say. My guesses were based off a sample of what I have read/tried to read rather than pure guesses. As such I can't categorise them in the same way.

That being said, its a boring cop-out answer so I'll give some guesses of what I would expect.

- Pansy Parkinson, I would expect a post hogwarts story based around reconciliation. Bringing together the old and new. A jaded Harry who finds Pansy's caustic manner towards him refreshing when everyone else seems to worship the ground he walks on. I do really like the idea of Pansy/Dudley as a two bullies who both had their world view shaken up and are trying to become better people. They could have a lot in common but they come from such different places.

- Hannah Abbot. She's the blandest of the bland. As a child she was a bit pudgy and a bit of a gossip we don't really know much else. Still, she's a hufflepuff and she isn't Susan. Therefore, I would expect a fic in Hogwarts years where Harry's homelife becomes the centre of the fic. All the story is basically trying to make his life better. A rather boring story with conflict with Voldemort taking a backseat to making Harry feel loved.

- Katie Bell. A pairing that I've never understood why there isn't more of. Hogwarts era but Harry is more social than canon. In canon it has never made sense to me why Harry doesn't seem closer with the Quidditch team. I get that when flying they don't chat too much, still, I've always thought Harry should have spent more time with them. They were a team and that should mean something to Harry. I know a lot of sports teams that spend a lot of time together socially. With that in mind I would expect Voldemort to be a distant threat or to have really died back in 81, maybe Neville is really the Boy-who-lived, either way the fic would focus on Harry being a normal student with a normal girlfriend and a heavy quidditch spin to it. Most of the conflict centres on winning the Quidditch cup in any year.

- Cho Chang. Honestly as depressing as this is I wouldn't expect much from the average Cho story. I think it would be shitty weeb fics and harem fics that take the stereotype of the shy/submissive asian girl and ramp it to 11 with zero class or refinement. Average tier would be shit tier. Voldemort's importance pales in comparison to the size of Harry's dick.

- Padma and Parvati. I don't think the Ravenclaw angle of Padma changes much. Why use her over Luna/a Hermione in Ravenclaw/Cho/Any other named Ravenclaw? No what makes Padma special in the worst possible way is the twin angle and the ethnicity. You get the Harem style fics like Cho but a bit more focused on story and conflict with Voldemort. Less sterotypes too. Once again the average fic would make you want to jump into a woodchipper to escape it.

***** I also don't understand why there are no more Katie-centric stories. In the same moment, when Harry stood waiting for his first Quidditch match with his face a bit green, there was another just a year older girl standing next to him, with the similar colour of her face. That could be similar bonding experience to fighting the mountain troll, but apparently nobody caught on that.

****** The impolite part of me wonders if a lot of fanfiction authors aren't particularly sporty. As such they don't really understand how close a team can get. Quidditch itself is often mocked too, given how often I've seen people complain about sorting or houses as a thing I sometimes wonder if competition in general is frowned upon within the fandom. Katie Bell means embracing Quidditch and all that comes with it.

A more general point would be that a story that has it's conflict centred around quidditch is much much harder to write than good guy vs bad guy. Even turning good guy vs bad guy into goodish guy vs misguided formerly good guy or some other shade of grey is easier. The stakes just aren't that interesting by themselves without a good writer to make you care. Sports stories are very rarely about the sport but the people behind them and that is going to take some talent and originality. When every other story seems to be about stopping a genocide and/or the apocalypse, making me feel that Harry getting one up on Marcus Flint matters is hard.

I have absolutely no idea why I don't find Katie interesting. There have even been opportunities to use her as a foil in other fics I've written and I've just used other characters instead.

On the other hand, the others that have attempted to write quidditch fics and asked me to read them I almost always come away thinking they have no clue about sports. And when asked, almost none of them ever played at any level past the lowest youth levels. So your first point may be spot on.

******* Quidditch is just a really /bad/ sport, as written - and reading sports descriptions are not usually all that interesting (eg, I like watching a number of sports live, and reading a recap/analysis can be fun too. But reading a play by play is only interesting so many times).

Plus, in most fics that include them, the Quidditch portions are overly long and have no connection to the rest of the plot. Really, a fic that would make it interesting would really have to have its primary focus on Quidditch, and have to add in a /lot/ of tweaks to the rules and strategy to make it an interesting game.

****** Katie is a minor character that doesn't stand out all that much - at least in uniqueness, I'd put her as less intriguing than, say, Luna, Tonks, Fleur, etc.

It's certainly very natural, like you mention - but I think a lot of fanfiction isn't about what's a /natural/ fit/relationship, and instead is on what is interesting to the author. It's one of the reasons we don't see many temporary relationships - because once enough effort is put into building up a character pairing like that, it's hard to throw it away. Katie would fit pretty well in such a slot, but it's just hard to justify.

** In addition to what [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]] said, Luna as a character is very hard to write properly. Most people don't really like Seer!Luna, me included, as it's often completely overpowered and/or really weird because the author usually has her "see" their relationship, which calls into question free will and consent, making it rapey.

To write Luna properly, you have to capture her weirdness to just the right degree that it isn't tiring, but enough that she's still Luna, which is extremely hard to do. You also have to make her aware of the world despite her fantasies, which people often do wrong - they have her either completely lost in delusion, which once again calls into question consent, but this time from her end, or betray the character and turn her into an OC.

The perfect way to write her would be as a resilient character with a passion for animals that may or may not exist, as well as a hobby of conspiracy theories. Maybe she believes them, maybe they're just for fun, I don't know. She is offended when someone mocks her, but she isn't weak because of it. She's in Ravenclaw for a reason, so model her character according to that (likes to read, likes gaining knowledge), and she doesn't befriend easily, preferring to keep people an arms length away by dialling up the weirdness a bit. You can twist this into being a bit of a coping mechanism from the disaster that took her mother.

However, a lot of writers don't know how to be subtle, as seen with the copious amounts of Bashing and the dialled up tropes, so we'll continue to get Seer!Luna fics which betray the character more and more.

** I personally believe that the decrease of Harry/Luna mostly comes from the fact that she is more and more difficult to write the longer you reflect on her as a character.

You'll quickly realise that she isn't as easy to write while remaining the quality of character you may wish to have featuring in your story and have her as a compelling romance option.

She really is a strange character, which showed one of the more creative parts of Rowling's character selection and creation, making the character so distinctive that any form of too normal behaviour would seem OOC.

Luna is a special character, one that lives in her own world, who allows you to use her as a compelling plot device. Even a main character with Luna's qualities wouldn't be bad, but if you truly try to replicate a realistic Luna Lovegood, you simply won't find her as a suitable romantic option for your character.

There are only a few characters who would really fit as a partner to her, namely ones that are at least somewhat strange themselves. If you were to write a time-travel fic that throws the main character alongside Luna back in a pre-riddle current-Grindelwald scenario, I could really see Luna as a romantic option for a Newt Scamander. Other than that, Neville seems a usual, and fitting, pairing for Luna. But Luna and Harry contrast too much to be in a reasonable relationship.

** Luna is a difficult person to have as a major character in fan fiction because in canon she is essentially a caricature. She's funny and charming and she's one of my favorite characters, but I actually don't think she's a well-written character. She is usually a punchline or a foil for Hermione, sometimes an info dump (like with the thestrals) and in book 7 she becomes an object of pity, a source of drama with her kidnapping and her dad's betrayal, and a casualty of the war.

To write about her seriously, I think you need to fundamentally change her characterization from canon. That's a lot more work than just shipping Harry with Ginny or Hermione, and I think fic writers are scared of being accused of writing the major love interest as OOC. She's also not a "fun" person to write OOC like Draco is, because she doesn't need to be "redeemed" and there aren't as many fun/dramatic dynamics happening with Harry. She and Harry are friends and like each other. That's a good foundation for a relationship in real life, but not as exciting as most people want their ships to be in fics.

(I primarily consider myself a Luna writer, so I've done a lot of thinking about this! I'm one day going to try my hand at a Harry/Luna fic, so we'll see how it goes!)

** Luna is impossible to write as a convincing main character without taking away her Lunaness. I mean, she seriously believes in all those crazy conspiracy theories and her arguments along the lines of "prove that it does not exist" would be utterly infuriating to deal with IRL.

I mean, she's basically the magical equivalent of someone seriously believing "Chemtails", "Nazis on the Moon" and "Lizard people". And that works for a quirky background character who appears once in a while and can even be endearing in a "oh honey" way. But if you have such a character as the main one, you will have to write someone with a very wrapped sense of reality and try to somehow reconcile that with reality.

Or you take that away, for example by having her disillusioned with her father after the war, but then she would not really feel like her canon counterpart anymore.

** As a Harry/Luna shipper, I don't think the pairing was ever that popular (at least since getting into the fandom in 2013). I suppose it has declined in recent years, but I was disappointed with the offerings from the start.

I agree that Luna is hard to write. She's very quirky and easy to flanderize, and I'm not quite sure I've got her right myself. I tend to lean on her conversation with Harry at the end of OotP, where for all her weird beliefs, she intuitively understands Harry and his emotional needs better than anyone else seems to, as a key point of the ship one can build off of.

I also lean on JKR's statement that Luna eventually mellowed out and admitted that some of her creatures aren't realm to suggest that she would do well with a supportive partner who can gently curb her weirdest excesses. Granted, it's easier because I'm pairing her with a well-adjusted Harry, but I don't think that's a prerequisite.

So, I think it's a combination of Luna being hard to write and perhaps people thinking she's "too weird" for Harry that makes them pass her over.

** Is it? I don't know. I just wish romance would be more varied in the fandom. I remember when I first started reading fanfics, it was so awesome finding new pairings. Now, being more experienced, I'm so sick of every single fanfic having the same few pairings. Hermione or Ginny, and at a large difference, Fleur, Luna or Tonks. Anything else is so rare. There are quite a lot of options to go with, but they are almost never used.

​

Edit: How could I forget the Ice Queen?

** I like Harry/Luna.

I've only read one but I cant find it on ffn.

It was one were Harry was expelled in 5th year and Lunas dad died so they lived at Grimmuald place and she painted the walls.

Please does anyone know this fic??

I'm not a fan of the Harry/Ginny ship, but I can read it. It's not that bad.

But I can't read Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, or ANY Slash. Just can't. Not my thing. But to each their own.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

** Has Luna ever been a popular pairing? I love the pairing to death but the number of fics I've seen recommended on this subreddit might only be counted on two hands, while Hermione, Ginny, Daphne, Fleur, Tonks, and even Susan Bones seem to have more fics. It's always been hard to write Luna, and even as only a main character the number of Luna fics is much, much smaller than Ginny.

** My favorite Lunar ship, by far, is in Lord of Darkness by Angelslayer135 Linkao3(1418852). While it's a Harem!fic and has a /massively/ OP Harry it's still really good. Seer!Luna has the ability to see the future, but before Harry saves her from her own house she only sees the bleakness of insanity. While I don't want to give to much away, Harry finds her naked in a locked closet and with the opening of the closet door light floods her future brighter than the light of the hallway. So yeah. Seer!Luna, but not a seer who is omnipotent.

** I love Huna/Larry (any better names?), But the vast majority of luna-centred fics have her walking around like a total lunatic (pun not intended). All she does is walk around like a wood nymph, and the only things she talks about is spewed nonsense of her imaginary animals and for some reason or another harry finds it hot.

If someone made/suggested me a fic where Luna is still a human, but either some sort of Seer or just a broken girl which hides her pain behind happy animals only she can see, I'd be happy. If her speech was anything more than "hey Harry, me and my crumple-horned snorcack was talking to a Blibbering Humdinger when we heard a nargle talking about naught stuff. Let's have sex now.", I'd be happy.

** There doesn't need to be a balanced amount of fics covering every single topic or pairing. Fanfic is not an equilibrium. Majority of fanfic writers don't write to maintain the balance, they write what they like. If what they like doesn't happen to be Harry/Luna, you don't see many Harry/Luna fics. It is puzzling to me that you find this puzzling.

Personally, I never thought of Luna as someone who would get together with anyone. Not everyone's happy ending involves a stable relationship and I always thought Luna would be better off alone. That is why I never write Luna getting a partner unless I change her character.

If you feel like this pairing is being slighted by the community, be the change you want to see and write a fanfic involving Harry/Luna.

** I'm going to get hate for this but... because it's a bad pairing? I even prefer Harry/Ginny to Harry/Luna these days. And I despise Harry/Ginny....

I really liked Noodlehammer's Naruto stories, though i know a lot of people don't like OP characters, so when i saw they were doing an HP story i jumped at it... and immediately dropped it when Harry/Luna became apparent... I just lost any desire to read it.

If it's part of a poly-amorous I can usually deal with it, unless she is the "main" girl....

​

I'll admit my tastes are different than others, so while i don't like it, if you do great. I also kind of have to disagree that it's in decline.. at least where the good authors are concerned... I've had to pass on a lot of work recently because it's H/L....

Maybe for the het porn, but I'm sure that 90% of all slash is written by women. And there's a lot of slash around. And judging by the tags alone, it is just as anatomically incorrect and wish fulfilling as the Lord Potter harems.

Edit: Actually, the existence of all the Death Eater pairings makes it almost certain that women in fact also write most of the het porn. Big dick Potter is the male wish fulfilment, no need to get Snape, Malfoy or Voldemort involved.
