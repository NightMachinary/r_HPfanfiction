I've reread my faves and a few new ones but now I'm looking for recommendations of good Drarry stories any rating on ff or ao3, preferably post Hogwarts bc the last two I tried were 8th year stores that lost me quickly and as I'm writing one of those myself I'm trying to stay away from them.


** Check out authors Saras_girl and Blamebrampton. They're both on AO3. Both are primarily post-Hogwarts (not necessarily long post, mind you) though they've got some Hogwarts era stuff that's good too.

*** Thanks, I just finished Turn this morning which I think is why I was so disappointed in the next two stores I started.
