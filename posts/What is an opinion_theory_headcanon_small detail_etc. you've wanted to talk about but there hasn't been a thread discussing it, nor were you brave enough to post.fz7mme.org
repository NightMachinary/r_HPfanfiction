For me, probably the headcanon that Fleamont Potter and Horace Slughorn were in the same year, and old potions rivals, each being brilliant in his own right but Fleamont was just so much more charismatic and after inventing Sleakeazy, he was also more famous.

This would lead to a lasting grudge for years after graduation and would manifest into Slughorn creating the Slug Club for students who were bound to be famous, in his opinion. While Fleamont was famous, Slughorn was a man with great connections. Once he started teaching James Potter, he never let go of the grudge and ignored the boy until Fleamont died in early 1978. After he had married Lily, he just couldn't hate Fleamont's son, and bore no grudges anymore.

Slughorn also taught Eileen Prince, taking a liking to the passionate student, telling her all about his potions theories. In fact, most of Severus's foundations for his potions were from very old journals Eileen had kept after marring Tobias Snape. Before that, however, Eileen had started working with Fleamont Potter, and had developed some theories for him before she had gotten married. So while some of what she had been taught was from Slughorn, it had transferred to Fleamont Potter, and he felt almost exposed by his old rival and famous potioneer.

This was one of my earliest headcanons after reading the books, but I doubt that Slughorn was as old as Fleamont nowadays. I was 12 then and I am far older now, but this headcanon stuck to me so much, I don't know why.

** Wizards are really really hard to kill. Something I thought of when rereading the scene where Nearly Headless Nick invites Harry to his deathday party--he says it took 45 hits to the neck with a blunt axe to kill him. A muggle would have died long before that--magic must be able to somehow keep wizards alive through seemingly fatal injuries.

Lots of fanfics have a line about how there's hundreds of creative ways to kill a wizard without the killing curse, but I don't think that's true. Maybe that's why its considered an Unforgivable--there aren't many other spells that can instantly kill a wizard, because they're so resilient. Nobody's died at Hogwarts since Myrtle--if wizards were as fragile as muggles, a bludger to the head/stray spell/moving staircase probably would have killed a couple kids in that time.

Outside the books there are also other stuff that strongly suggest this, like Rowlings Pottermore articles talking about wizards being resistant to non-magical poisons or most Werewolves being wizards because they are more likely to survive the inflicted wounds than muggles, fantastic beasts even outright states that there are subtle differences in the physiology between wizards and muggles and Newt even gives Kowalski a helmet because he is a muggle and more likely to injure himself.

*** Well, executions involving beheadings were a messy thing historically - as were some deaths in general, actually (think the 23 stab wounds Caesar took, even if that may have been more of a symbolic one). Margaret Pole's beheading supposedly took 10 swings with a non-blunt axe, for instance.

I do agree that wizards are more durable, though - the way everyone treated what happened to Neville, combined with just Quidditch in general, makes that clear IMO.

** Draco is actually a good seeker. He's just not as brilliant as Harry and in matches with Gryffindor concentrated more on Harry then an actual game.

Some physical traits are always dominant in magical families thanks to, well, magic (like blonde hair for Malfoys; grey eyes for Blacks; red hair for Weasleys). That's the reason that in the past some families avoided marrying into others, so not to muddle their ‘familial looks'. If two people with the same dominant family characteristic (say, a Malfoy and a Weasley) marry, the child will have 50/50 chance of inheriting either one (50/50 chance of being blonde/redhead).

2. Grimmauld Place, Kreacher, and Sirius were all severely affected by the presence of the Locket in the house. Including the portrait of Mrs. Black.

3. Dementors can only “breed” when they have collectively consumed enough souls. They can “die” if cut off from their food source (good feelings/memories) which is why they've never just swarmed the planet at any point.

4. This one is arguably canon, depending on if you listen to JKR's “expanded lore” through tweets and interviews. Hogwarts is one of the premier schools of magic in the world, but it's not the only school of magic in the UK, nor are there only the 17 (or whatever number JKR quoted) schools in the world, they just aren't all as well known/respected as the big ones.

The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it.

"Light" and "Dark" magic are mostly about morals, with things that involve things like self harm, hurting others, etc, being classified as dark. But if one were to actually study the internals of the spells there really isn't a notable difference.

2. Cho Chang is possibly the most wasted character who could've been made into someone amazing. She got her boyfriend murdered out of nowhere, is dealing with the trauma, starts dating the person who was with him in the final moments, hopes they both will connect and understanding each other over being friends with Cedric, Harry doesn't know how to deal with emotions so he massively fails to calm her down, Hermione plays her jinx trick (mind you, she had no idea and had a real point that she shouldn't have tricked everyone) without telling anyone and that rips their relationship.

** I don't think there's been a new thread on it recently, but one headcanon I've always had is that Charlus, Dorea, and their son were ostracized purebloods due to not being blood purists, didn't live in Magical England, returned to England to fight against Voldemort, and were killed by Voldemort's followers during the First Wizarding War.

I think it would explain a lot of perceived "plotholes" (such as Harry not having family left, Sirus never mentioning them, etc.), and I think it could have some rich storytelling depending on where a writer decides to place them in continental Europe.

Though honestly, I think JK Rowling just included them as an easter egg and didn't realize how it could possibly break her pre-established canon until fans noticed it on the Black Family tree and started going wild with speculation so she had to explain it away in ancillary materials.

My headcanon for why they weren't blasted off the Black Family tree is more that they were "middle of the road" when it came to blood purity - like how the Greengrasses are portrayed in the fanon.

Like they weren't Bellatrix fanatical into purity, but more like aristocrat-y snooty about it. Think kind of like Victorian England times, with the whole people could change their "station" but would never really be "one of them" kind of vibe.

My mom herself married into a family that hated her and made the first ten years of her marriage miserable (my dad is a doormat when it comes to his mother and sisters). Only one of my aunts did ok in her choice of husband, and that's because they realized they were unsuited before they had kids and their divorce wasn't messy.

Parents shouldn't control their children's marriages, but they care about their children and can help them avoid making a bad choice.

I am still looking for that soul-bond fic (and I guess, that's where linkffn(9818387) run away, because he didn't know how to write it), which would conclude that a pre-arranged marriage without any pre-existing romantic love could be made working into something beautiful. However, I guess, it can be written only by authors from cultures where arranged marriages still exist as a living part of the culture. I am not saying that “parents always know better” is 100% better than our crazy idea that two hormonal teenagers/young adults without any knowledge of the world know the best, but it is certainly worthy of exploring.

But for that matter, there are a lot of times when Harry's invisibility cloak doesn't make him truly invisible. With Dumbledore and Moody, definitely, but also when Luna can see the "wrackspurts" around Harry's head in HBP, and like how the Marauder's Map can still recognize/place him. I honestly don't know what that means in the context of the effectiveness of death's cape tho. Maybe it has something to do with "auras" (although that's definitely fanon and not canon) but like some people (dumbledore, luna) have the power to see "auras" and some magical objects (moody's eye, the map) can detect auras too? And death can't? JKR never really explained exactly how the cloak is able to hide the user from death, because it's clear that spells and stuff can get through the cloak (like when dumbledore casts petrificus on Harry in HBP). agh sorry I'm rambling and I'm not even sure I had a point to make.

You probably remember I told you they were Germans originally from Reichenberg, that was a rich industrial city in Czechoslovakia. What I haven't told you most likely, was that they were Jewish, and although completely secularized and they always considered themselves Germans, they had enough sense when the threat of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia loomed over them, they sold their medical practice and moved to England and started again. Why I am telling this is that whenever they were telling us how incredibly difficult it was to start their career again when they were in their forties, they always emphasized that they were glad to do it. They had many friends and relatives who stayed back in Czechoslovakia and hoped they will somehow muddle through the situation. All of them ended in concentration camps.”

Soul magic would be things like making horcruxes, inferi, stuff that messes with not just someone's body but with someone's soul. You could definitely view soul magic as something completely separate from both dark and light magic (I think I do?), but I think it's pretty clear that soul magic is some awful stuff because of the sacrifices required and the consequences of whoever's had their soul messed with. So I would say that there is magic that is evil: soul magic.

So? I heard the argument about so called negative emotions before, and find it shaky at best. It's just a philosophy I dont subscribe to. If I'm in a life or death situation, I sure as hell won't be mourning the tragic life of my opponent, I will do my utmost to put him down, by any means necessary. There is nothing wrong with such emotions, on the contrary, they should be accepted and integrated as integral to the self. It's a different fandom, but I adore this quote from Darth Plagueis, /Remember why the Sith are more powerful than the Jedi, Sidious: because we are not afraid to feel. We embrace the spectrum of emotions, from the heights of transcendent joy to the depths of hatred and despair./

Not to mention, this only applies to curses, to whatever extent that it does apply. There are potions, rituals, enchantments and who knows how many other branches of /Dark Arts/ in which is really hard to quantify the emotional aspect.

I'm not talking about the morals of what a person may or may not go through in such a situation. In a life or death situation that you described, it is justified.

What I was talking about was, while a wizard can kill/maim/torture with regular daily spells - you can probably completely blind someone with a powerful enough lumos charm - the only intent behind those spells is the action itself. For the lumos charm, the only intent is producing light. For other regular spells, it is the same.

For Dark magic, though, the negative intent is pretty clear.

#+begin_quote
  There are potions, rituals, enchantments
#+end_quote

We do see one of each of these things, at least indirectly.

The potion that restores Voldemort's body is negative in every aspect.

The ritual that is used to create horcruxes, that requires murder. Again negative.

The enchantment that Voldemort places on the walls of the cave, the one that requires a blood sacrifice - negative again. Same with the enchantment that prevents Apparition or Portkeys - there is an intent to trap the people inside.

Intent is a very big factor in the canon magic system. All of the acts that are seen in series that are considered miraculous in nature, they are all heavily intent-based.

If everything moves half as fast then simoly overpowering your opponent with speed or strength want work because they can dodge easily despite also moving half the speed. This means the only way to win is to transfigure surrounding s and set traps to overwhelm your opponents to defeat them.

** All or most muggle governments have measures in place to ensure that the members of the government and important state officials are safe from magic. Most militaries probably also have magic-aware and/or magic sections. And there is probably a plan for the case of a wizarding uprising. The ministry probably isn't (fully) aware of this. Honestly it's just the obvious things to do.

----

Muggleborns and other un(der)trained wiches/wizards are probably the reason for magic getting a bad rep and the subsequent rise in witch hunts, due to their accidential magic having negative effects on others. So probably the more responsive, far reaching and capable the magical education system of a country, the less witch hunts.

----

Most of the (Central) European countries don't have their own larger schools because their wizarding societies are basically still sticking to the small Duchies, City-States, Kingdoms, etc. of the 17th century. They're not disorganised or anything, just very fractured. This one is kinda less likely but I find the idea entertaining.

----

Magic colonialism is probably one of the main reason the statute of security is acutally possible globally, and also that it is global in the first place. Like, it probably wasn't the muggles convincing every new tribe or nation or whatever the Eurasians came across that this is the reasonable thing to do, at least not initially. Edit: Especially when many of them probably don't really have a strong reason to agree and the explorers don't know magic exists to begin with. Plus, someone has to raign in and help out those "uncivilised" peoples and tribes who aren't organised in a way to pull that sort of thing off. And it pretty much has to be global to work at all, at least after a certain point.

----

Going off the above, the driving force for progress in the wizarding world is probably the keeping of the statute of secrecy. Like, that is one complicated and resource intensive effort if I've ever seen one. The fact that it's half way intact is honestly impressive and idicates that the only thing most wizarding are very good at is mind ereasing/changing.

----

During the first (and second) War against Voldemort, the people fighting him were a very small minority. Most people were likely indifferent or incapable/too scared to do anything for either side, with a fairly large number of passive and smaller but still large active Voldemort supporters, fewer passive and very few active anti-Voldy supporters. I`m reasonably sure this is canon or at least strongly implied by canon, though I could be wrong.

----

Edit: Also, some fanfic authors are way too quick to make not going for the kill out to be this stupid and naive idea, considering that this is a world where souls exist and some types of magic can potentially damage that soul. The Killing Curse/Killing people seems to be somehow included in that list from what I can tell/remember. We don't know exactly how souls/all of these things work, I don't think, but personally I feel being wary of actively trying to kill people, good reason or no, is a very sensible life choice with that in mind.
