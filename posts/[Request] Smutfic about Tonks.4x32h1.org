** There's a short vignette called "Penance" ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4942254/1/Penance]]) that involves this. It's quite well-written.

** I'm surprised there haven't been a lot more suggestions here. I wrote this for a challenge and it isn't exactly what you are looking for, but it is Tonks/Remus smut. linkao3(4073086)

  He finds temporary refuge in the isolation of a Scottish island, but she will find him, wherever he is hiding; and she won't let him say no to her again. Fluffy smut or smutty fluff; one or the other.

** [[http://www.hpfanficarchive.com/stories/viewstory.php?sid=37&textsize=0&chapter=1][Anyone You Want]] and [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600023065&chapter=1][Harry Potter and the Head of Black]]. I don't know if the first has a decent story or not, but the second doesn't.

Warning on the second: Tonks is Harry's slave and he treats her very poorly.
