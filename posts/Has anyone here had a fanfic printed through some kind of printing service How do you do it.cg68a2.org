** I did it with HPMOR for a friend who wanted to read it on sabbath afternoons (we don't use electronic devices between Friday sunset and Saturday nightfall) on lulu.com and it wound up running around $60 and needed to be split into six books. I also had abbreviate the names of the titles into HJPEV and the..... to avoid the plagiarism filter as when I first tried I didn't do that and lulu blocked that that email/account

*** Did the actual contents of the books trigger anything?

**** Only once they reviewed because of the title

Basically I tried printing "harry potter and the methods of rationality" and the other titles that it is broken up into on the hpmor website and when clicked "print" it said it was caught by the plagiarism filter and they were reviewing to see if it true, 2 weeks later that email/account were banned so I made a new account with another email and changed the titles to some less obvious stuff but left the contents alone and i was fine
