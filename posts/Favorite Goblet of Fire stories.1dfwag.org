As long as its GOF I couldn't care less, Even if its in a series. I prefer Completed stories to WIPs.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] by jbern. Trust me, it's awesome.

*** Only caveat is that the writing quality in the first couple of chapters is terrible. That's only in the first 2-3 chapters, then he stops treating it as a fic for a competition and starts taking it slowly.

Unrelated, but I had no idea he put up a new fic recently. I thought he had left fanfiction permanently to focus on his professional life.

***** The writing quality just isn't that good. The fic was originally for a small contest, and so the first couple of chapters were rushed out without much of a proper revision or beta. It's still passable, but it gets noticeably better around chapter 3 or 4.

**** My favorite thing in that story is probably the Hat. Haven't come across any other fic with such an awesome sidekick.

** Favorite is A Maruader's plan. WIP still updating so its good. Start off slow but gets good. Magicks of the Arcane is good too. Cold Blood, His Angel, A Curse of Truth are all good.\\
Shifting Winds is really really good except havent been updated for a while and not that long.

** Since GOF is my favorite of the series, I've enjoyed a handful of stories with different scenarios:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483280/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Champion-s-Champion][Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion]] - Idiot!Ron Bashing humor

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7222456/1/The-Fourth-Champion][The Fourth Champion]] - Harry who was in hiding/raised by Sirius is drawn as the 4th champion.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7392700/1/Banking-on-Her][Banking on Her]] - H/HR Love Story that starts in GOF.

I've also read Champion's New Hope and Lie I've Lived and enjoyed both of those as well.

** I don't think I've ever read a Goblet of Fire fic more entertaining than actual GoF. All the other books, yes. GoF, no.

*** Champion's Champion was funnier if you like Crack, but GOF was by far and away her best book in my opinion.

** I love GoF stories, but unfortunately I canÂ´t remember the names of most of the ones I've read.

However some really good are:

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's new hope]] A HP/DG story. Adventure

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8135514/1/His-Angel][His Angel]] A HP/FD. Romance/Hurt/Comfort. WIP but very long so it will take some time to catch up.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6091629/1/Triwizard-Tournament-Take-Two][Triwizard Tournament: Take Two]] Adventure/Romance. Very much WIP, but it an interesting premise. I have heard from the author that he is working on a new chapter but it has been a while since he has last updated.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7544355/18/When-a-Veela-Cries][When a Veela Cries]] starts at the third task, very different story. Not GoF but still in a way related to it. WIP

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3822327/1/A-Friend-Indeed][A Friend Indeed]] by kb0: "During Harry's fourth year, what if Ginny had asked Harry how he was feeling when her brother turned his back on Harry? What if she had tried to befriend him then? How would that have affected Harry and his other friends? To cover Harry's fourth year."

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]] by Rocag: "Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass."

*The following are slash:*

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6990881/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Alternative-Tournament][Harry Potter and the Alternative Tournament]], by twistyguru: An awesome crossover with Mary Poppins, of all things. "The Goblet of Fire creates a binding magical contract, not only on the student but the school...so what school is Harry representing? Harry gets a new Headmistress who's practically perfect, and the Tournament gets the Guru treatment! Xover, imp. Slash!"

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3010218/1/The-Boy-Who-Loved][The Boy Who Loved]] by Takeo: "A Goblet of Fire, with Cedric not dying. Otherwise I tried to keep within canon as much as possible. There are bits of both Comedy and Drama, and even a Plot. But mainly a Fluffy Romance between Harry and Cedric. Slash. Characters owned by J.K. Rowling."

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859556/1/A-Lack-of-Color][A Lack of Color]] by beakanoma: "Part 1 Complete. In his fourth year, Harry falls for fellow Hogwarts student and Triwizard champion, Cedric Diggory. Part 1 in The Love So Green Collection - SLASH, Harry/Cedric. M for some slight sexual content."
