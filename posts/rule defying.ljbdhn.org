:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey everyone! I'm looking for stories that have the following:

- Harry does not know the magic rules for one reason or another and thus does not follow them (for example: you can't conjure food, potions have to taste bad, etc)
- Harry has a rule breaking streak and that also applies to magical rules. (examples just like the first)
- Harry somehow doesn't get a magical education but develops his own magical talent. Creating his own ways of magic with their own rules (example: his magic can make permanent alterations to anything much like trasnsfiguration can do temporarily. However something else like the animagus process just doesn't work for him)

really any story where Harry goes against the rules of magic.

bonus points if hermione gets frustrated with harry (hermione bashing is allowed but not bonus points)


** The Secret Language of Plants series by Endrina meets this description, more or less. It's also one of the most beautiful fics I've ever read.

** linkffn (1202663)

It's a crackfic, but while it doesn't meet all of your points, it's still an interesting read.

  AU. Little Harry Potter knew from the moment he defied the laws of gravity and made a pebble accelerate at a freefall of 8.9 m/s 2, that he was going to have fun learning about the rules of all the known universe... and breaking every single one of them. WARNING: Sporadic Updates.

  Harry Potter is a geek, a nerd, a total dork whose favorite hobby is "transfiguring stuff." He doesn't understand what rules are, has no social skills, is barely sentient, and is very smart.

** Can't remember if it's[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/1__Surprise_Snog/][This Means War]] or [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Blue_Steel/Chapter_1/][Blue Steel]] where Harry can do things no one else can with magic because he's not aware they're supposed to be impossible and he's powerful enough to brute force it. Might be both honestly.

Linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) has Harry approach magic entirely differently from Hogwarts' education due to his Blindness and it leads to him being able to do things no one else can with magic.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
