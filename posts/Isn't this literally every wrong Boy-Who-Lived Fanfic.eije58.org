*** I think you could even make most of the HP tropes work as long as the Potters are dead. If they survive, no game because it would be too OOC for them to just abandon Harry (since they canonically died for him). Here is what I would call a short checklist for a decent one:

- A malicious Dumbledore to mastermind the abandonment would not take much work since he is responsible for 10 years of child abuse already.

- Give the WBWL some baddies as friends (eg Malfoy).

- Not sure what to do with Ron and Hermione, but I'd argue to keep them as uninvolved in the fic as possible to avoid bashing them since it is unlikely that Harry would befriend them if you changed so much already.

- Don't make Harry OP.

- Don't write Daphne, Cedric and/or Neville wank.

- No Gringotts scene

- No wizard nobility

**** Disagree strongly with that first point. Not that mastermind!Dumbdledore has to be bad, but it basically /always/ is.

There's no reason you couldn't just have something like: Harry is sent off to live with the Dursleys. They are his blood relatives, and as not-BWL, Harry doesn't matter enough to merit any special consideration. Dumbledore isn't abusive or manipulative or evil, he just doesn't pay any attention to little Harry for the same reason he doesn't pay attention to, for example, a five year old Ernie MacMillan.

He plops Harry with the Dursleys and considers that a solved problem. He then hides away the BWL, trying to both give him a normal upbringing but also tutoring him in magic to help make sure he survives long enough to finally defeat Voldemort. He arranges acceptable friends for the BWL - Neville or Weasleys or whatever. People he can trust.

The first Hogwarts letter is destroyed by the Dursleys. Because Harry is nobody special, no more letters arrive. Harry fails to arrive. The BWL has heard stories his whole life about his long-lost brother (who he can't ever meet due to security concerns) and the BWL throws a shit fit about Harry's absence. Dumbledore goes to retrieve Harry.

BWL desperately wants to be friends with Harry, and at first BWL and Harry hit it off. Harry's so desperate for validation that he takes to BWL's attention like a fish to water. They have one /amazing/ weekend together playing games, talking, etc. Then comes the moment of truth: Harry gets privately Sorted the following Monday morning and gets put in Slytherin.

Things sour, but it's not some childish, over the top bashing bullshit. BWL and Harry really do try to remain friends. But things are strained. Throughout the rest of the first year or two, BWL and Harry still are friends, but when Harry gets on the Quidditch team third year, the rivalry kicks up a notch. Then year four everything goes to hell when /Harry's/ name comes out of the goblet. Slytherins rally around their house hero in a show of house solidarity. BWL and the rest of the school rally around Cedric.

From there, you basically jump the canon rails entirely as Harry ends up leading his own faction that is opposed to Voldemort, Dumbledore, and the Ministry. He gets painted as some sort of rogue terrorist type when he and his friends are just trying to survive. If you want to get really dark with it, have BWL die in year 6, Dumbledore finally realize how badly he fucked up, and Harry die to kill Voldemort, but choose not to come back from the pre-death train station.

Basically you need to ditch idiotic fanon bashing, ditch Draco in Leather Pants tropes, and have the characters want to do the right thing, but just honestly disagreeing about what the right thing is.

That's because basically all writers make him incompetent on top of the malice. His incompetence is somewhat required otherwise he'd resolve canon in a few days. But a smart malicious Dumbledore would never "rush to confront Harry" for stepping out of line (I am sick of that scene). He would never tell Harry what he should do but rather manipulate Harry into doing that because Harry believes it to be the right choice (like Harry's suicide in canon).

And you could easily have such a Dumbledore in a WBWL fic. He arranges the Dursleys, and his "he must not be spoiled" plan for the "BWL" fails because, for example, Malfoy Sr interferes publically, forcing his hand. A good manipulative Dumbledore would not get much screentime but have a Palpatine-like arc where it is eventually revealed how well he played everyone.

****** Thanks! I wish I had the skill (or really, the patience) to make it a reality.

I've got a whole outline of a WBWL fic but I just don't have the time/skill/energy to turn it into a real story. The overall theme of thing is that Voldemort is basically a force of nature, not an actual, present human being.

The real conflict is less Harry v Voldemort, and more "man v man in the face of the zombie apocalypse" type thing where the actual action is driven by Dumbledore v Ministry v Harry, and nobody's really a "bad guy" it's more than they're flawed real people whose failures are a result of lack of trust, lack of communication, and tragic misunderstanding.

And given my fundamentally pessimistic worldview, in the end the good guys lose because /everybody/ loses. The last man standing is the battered corpse of British Wizarding society, traumatized and lost and unable to cope with the complete vacuum of leadership, Dark, light, governmental, or individualistic.

***** too much to quote but... assuming its not on of those "WBWL decoy" stories(i.e. Dumbles knows who the RBWL is and wants to hide it) then it wouldn't make sense. While he might care less about Harry, with the Potters dead it would be a similar thing with Harry in canon. The blood protection charm thing would need the BWL living with the Dursleys. Having a sibling shouldn't be enough to change Dumbles actions. The martyr plan(which may not exist at that point but the rest should) would just be put on the WBWL'd shoulders rather than Harry's....

Eh. There's a big difference between leaving Harry to 10 years of abuse because you think the alternative is death or worse, and maliciously leaving a normal kid who isn't even being hunted to pointless and unnecessary abuse.

It'd probably be best to go the canon route, have Dumbledore place the twins at the Dursleys out of fear that anywhere wouldn't work, then have the Dursleys abandon both kids somewhere, have the WBWL go to some shitty orphanage or get picked up by the Malfoys or whatever, and then do whatever with our Harry.

Given how the Death Eaters were just camping outside the wards in DH, it was a pretty pointless defence since Harry was not protected if he left the property. And the Tonks house has the same kind of defences without child abuse.

The only truly safe options all include keeping Harry locked up somewhere (eg under Dumbledore's own Fidelius or the blood wards), and at that point, you can simply lock Harry up somewhere without the abusive relatives.

We don't know that. Harry's left his property plenty of times before and was never attacked. Not during the fifth book, not during the sixth book, not any time before that. It's more likely that the DE could suddenly attack because the wards fell at that point. Petunia was gone and Harry just left the house for the last time and he knew it.

By the time they're in the air, 4 Privet Drive is no longer Harry's home, and therefore the blood wards are no longer in place.

#+end_quote

Locking Harry up permanently inside a home that gives a greater risk of Voldemort breaking in isn't much better.

The Fidelius Charm /just/ failed once before Dumbledore put Harry at the Dursleys. Why trust it again immediately after? Since you couldn't be your own Secret Keeper (not then, anyway, if ever), Dumbledore would have to trust someone to take care of Harry.

He would be too busy with being headmaster, as would McGonagall. Hagrid would be a dumb choice. And since Sirius Black turned out to be a DE, there'd be no reason to trust anyone else.

Dumbledore explicitly says Voldemort would have found a way through any other protections if he ever came back:

#+begin_quote
  *“I knew that Voldemort's knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive. I knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spells and charms were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power.*

Two immediate problems I see with this: this scares the Dursleys into simply moving and leaving Harry behind, or the blood wards don't work if you force Petunia to take Harry in by threat of death.

Honestly, all your supposed solutions, if they were possible, would mean every wizard who knows of Harry's situation is a complete retard. Dumbledore, the Order, Hermione, Harry, all of them.

If Dumbledore says the blood wards are the best he could do, and no one ever speaks up to disagree, presumably they /are/ the best.

Obviously Dumbledore is flawed and could be mistaken, but to be so mistaken as you're depicting him to be makes him and everybody around him to be complete morons with the intelligence of 5 year olds.

And that's just silly. Far more likely there are simply explanations that we don't hear.

The blood protection only protected Harry from Voldemort as far as i can understand. I'm pretty sure he has a few "flashbacks" early in the first book about random wizards who approached him. And as Voldemort could touch him after the graveyard its not unreasonable to assume blood protection charm at #4 was at least weakened.

Not to mention from what Dumbles says to Harry it only protects against Voldemort, and only AT #4.

#+begin_quote
  "/While you can still call home the place where your mother's blood dwells,/ */there/* /you cannot be touched or harmed/ */by Voldemort/*/. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge. You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home,/ */there he cannot hurt you/*/./ "- [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore][Dumbledore]] explaining how the charm works
#+end_quote

The only thing that protected Harry was security though obscurity and plot armor. If Tom and his bootlickers had really wanted him dead(and not have been handed the master idiot ball) they would have only had to catch him away from #4, like say at the park... To the best of my knoweldge they only find his location when Snape tells Tom about the stupidly convoluted escape plan(cause you know why polyjuice Harry into someone else and just let him take a cab, when you could have 7 Harry Potters, including the real one, rush the Death Eaters...).

**** I hate bad guy Dumbledore so much, it's such a crutch in fanfiction; it's ridiculous.

Harry's parents are dead, send him and his brother or sister to the Dursleys like in canon.

Dumbledore didn't want Harry around the Wizarding World for him to get a big head, and abuse the power of the whole Boy Who Lived power fame; there's no doubt he'd want the same for both, it'd go off just as in canon.

Harry and the sibling will probably be close; having each other as the only people to lean on and protect.

Letter comes as in canon, Vernon can go nuts again and tries the same thing as in canon, but once Harry and sibling ends up in Hogsmeade; that's where things could change.

How different is Harry and his sibling? How similar are they? Is Harry more ambitious, cunning/sneaky? Or is he more like a Hufflepuff? More hardworking, loyal? For those he loves? Or more like a Gryffindor?

What's Harry's sibling like? It's good to make them different enough, but still be able to lean on each other in their time of need.

Dumbledore doesn't need to be a big bad guy, things can happen similar as in canon, until Harry and his sibling ends up in the magical world for the first time in 11 years, and then things can start changing.

Does the sibling start asking questions more then Harry? Does the sibling talk to Draco? Is the sibling rude or nice to Draco or Hagrid?

Are the siblings clingy together? Do they want to not be as close and have friends with other people?

Does Harry or the sibling end up friends with Draco? Do they end up in different houses like the Patil twins or the same house, like the Weasley's?

There's so much more that you can do with the whole WBWL trope that doesn't get used, that's just the same old same old. It gets boring after a while, try different things with the idea, that's still believable enough.

****** Sorry, I thought we were trying to write a good story based on a WBWL-like trope, you certainly aren't going to do a good one using the most overused, cookie-cutter, and wrong trope in Harry Potter Fanfiction. (Evil!Dumbledore)

How about this: Everything is like canon up until Harry and his twin are left in Number 4 by Dumbledore.

The Dursleys never had Dudley so they initially treated them both nice-enough, over time there was clear favoritism towards the twin by the Dursleys, School staff, and classmates; Because he was smarter, more sociable and more charming than Harry. this leads harry to resent his twin brother and work harder to try to catch up. Harry never does and Twin's natural talent.

Come Hogwarts, Twin quickly sets the status quo making lots of friends and becoming popular and shit, he befriends Ron and Hermione while Harry is alone and friendless so he focuses on his studies while his twin is having the adventures canon!harry had.

Overtime Harry's hard work starts to pay off and he starts to catch up to his twin in skill and power, but wanting to surpass him he starts to turn to the dark arts.

Maybe Harry makes one or two true companions (Luna, Ginny, Draco maybe whatever) while twin is defeating Voldemort's plans and stuff Harry is working behind the scenes helping his twin without anyone knowing using his knowledge of Dark Magic

Ok, the idea would be that Twin isn't just a powerless asshole, but an actual competent wizard at least as much as canon!Harry was, Harry is feared and excluded because of his knowledge of dark magic and he has to walk the think line between being chaotic good and chaotic evil (think of temptation to the dark side on star wars)

This could end two ways, either Harry becomes accepted in the end as he is the one to finally put down Voldemort. or he defeats Voldemort's and becomes a traveling wizard with his true companions

******* If you're just going to give all of Harry's cannon friends, abilities, and adventures to his twin, you might as well just call the twin Harry and be done with it. Wouldn't it be more interesting to explore the differences between Harry and his twin by having the twin react differently to things? Maybe the twin genuinely likes gardening, bonds with Neville over it, and becomes best friends. Maybe he trusts teachers more and brings the big problems to them instead of always running off on his own. Maybe his best class is potions and he has a potion to help in just about every situation. Maybe in fights he's a Tank or a Healer or a Sniper instead of Harry's Skirmisher. The point is we should change it up a little instead of rehashing the same old story.

I mean, this is fanfiction, you can like whatever you like, but to say that Canon Dumbledore was evil or incompetent clearly show you have no idea of how storytelling works. Did dumbledore make mistakes? of course! but who doesn't? Would harry been happier anywhere else? yes of course! would have survived... who knows? And that was something dumbledore wasn't willing to risk.

If you actually read the books. and I mean; read them carefully you'll notice that Dumbledore is a flawed mentor character... and he even admits it! but you seem unable to see past the mistakes he made (which make him an interesting realistic and good character) because of some sense that he should be flawless and always take the "right" choice. This is the same reason there a bunch of crap Indi!Harry Op!Harry Marysue!Harry which, to be honest, are complete garbage in terms of storytelling and character development

The thing there is no real "right" choice in this case and that's 0interesting storytelling.

Look dude I'm not here to beat a dead horse into a pulp for the hundredth time. if you want to write Dumbledore as some evil mastermind that sent Harry to the Dursleys as some kind of sick torture or whatever, fine good on you. But to say that J.K. Rowling herself did the, it's just not true, is wrong and a total insult to her story.

********* The Dursleys were sick tortures. If they were guarding a prison with their methods, they'd be sued to hell and back for inhumane treatment and human rights violations. They kept a child in a cupboard while having two spare bedrooms. They watched as their own son hunted Harry for fun. They gave him rations which were less than half what was available in the bombed ruins of postwar Germany. It is implied that Vernon used physical force against both boys (he hits Dudley and Harry does not find that remarkable). Petunia almost killed Harry by trying to slam a frying pan against his head.

Also, I'm not just talking about the Dursleys. Dumbledore knew that Hagrid was innocent yet didn't try to prove that once in half a century. Not even when Hagrid was deported as a PR gag. Dumbledore did nothing about the magical WMD in his school when even the simple act of building a brick wall in front of Myrtle's toilet would have done the trick. He also didn't even try to save Sirius in PoA, instead telling a pair of children to break countless laws. He didn't stop Malfoy, even though he almost murdered two students and committed countless war crimes in the process. Heddidn't notice that his longtime friend and brother in arms was in fact a racially motivated terrorist carrying out a murder plot under his nose. He utterly failed in his role as headmaster.

*********** The fact that fanon exaggerates the abuse he did suffer in canon, which the link you provided acknowledges(and then tries to justify.. i.e. when sent to the cupboard and told "no-meals" its really ok, because after they went to bed he ignored them and sneaked into the kitchen to eat...or the cupboard /could/ be almost the size of a regular room which makes it ok) does not mean it can just be ignored.

Yes, i agree that Hellstrike is probably exaggerating. I say probably because while its not shown in canon, the actions we do see suggest that there could be more.

While Wizarding culture is different and thus we shouldn't completely view it through are modern standards, its hard to say, from what we have seen, that Dumbledore is a good headmaster(or person). Bringing something that you think a mass murderer is after into a school full of children is not a good thing. Placing it behind deadly traps in said school and the announcing the location to the students rather than say, a fidelius on the door, is not a good decision. Only using an age line to protect the Goblet and then trusting student's who don't want to compete not to enter other people's names(whose to say draco's name wasn't in there from bribing(or using daddys name against) someone of age to drop his name in),or you know just tossing the parchment from a distance, was not a good decision. Knowingly allowing Draco to continue on at Hogwarts after the first murder attempt affected one of the students was a HUGE mistake. And Snape...just thats more than enough.....

​

sorry got off track and forgot where i was going, so... just saying while not as bad as fanfiction sometimes portrays there WAS abuse, and thats never something you should knowingly send a kid into.

It was bad enough that Harry, who grew up with malnutrition, found it remarkably horrible.

This is why i mentioned modern standards... In a culture and "world" that still holds the values of the, at the very least, 1800's, and are not part of treaties, we can't hold them accountable to /those/ agreements. Am I saying that excuses his actions? Hell No. Just saying, point out the crimes he committed(multiple accounts of attempted murder) and his less than savory actions(pushing his bigoted views on others, bullying, malicious threats, and so forth) rather than what he did that breaks OUR modern morals and laws.

As for perfidy? He was never loyal to Dumbledore's side, thus you can't really say he was being disloyal. His only account of Perfidy i see is not being willing to complete his commands and kill Dumbles, but that was more cowardice. 6th year was more of a sabotage and assassination mission, which spy agency's the world over still hold in their arsenal.

I said exaggerating because i think that Harry's abuse was mostly /verbal and emotional./ Though physical would NOT surprise me, it's not actually shown except in his living arrangements(the cupboard), his no-meals punishments(even if he learned how to get around these), and second year. None of it excusable, but still not quiet as severe as fanon.

Yes Draco had a mission that would help his side of the civil war, but Dumbledore knew about it. He knew Draco was trying to murder him, and that his attempts were harming others. As the leader of at least one faction of the civil war(the order), and the one that was being targeted, he basically gave Draco permission to act as he did.

This wasn't even a false information campaign. He knew Draco was trying to kill him. I assume(i know not the best idea) he knew about the cabinet as well. His Plan(if he had one) was to let Draco make his attempts to show him that he didn't really want to kill. Ohh yeah, and for Snape to kill him to up his standing with Voldemort.

It was a bit hard to believe James would hide without ever contacting Sirius/Remus, but it could work if he thought they were after Lily and the only way to keep her safe after losing her son is to make the world think they were dead / live off the grid / live muggle.
