I remember finding a fanfic through Reddit sometime in the last yearish. I'm trying to show it to a friend, but after a ton of searching if can't find it on here or google. I'll make a list of what I think I remember and what I don't think it is after searching for it...

Length: Relatively short. I remember pretty much reading it in a single sitting.

Story beats I remember...

- Harry is logical, rational, and keeps trying to get as smart as possible.
- Harry is living alone at the Dursleys over the summer or something similar. The Dursleys have moved out or are gone.
- Harry sends Kreature (and maybe Dobby) to go get supplies so he doesn't have to leave.
- Harry tries to learn as much as possible, using memory charms, time magic, and dark arts to become as prepared and smart as possible.
- Harry uses magic so he doesn't have to eat or sleep.
- Harry makes a special suit of armor.
- In the end, Harry uses memory charms to go back to a normal life after beating Voldemort.
- The whole story is about Harry min/maxing his spells and gear to get as powerful as possible.

Things I don't think it is...

- "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"

  - I don't remember reading an entire novel
  - I don't remember there being many major characters outside of Harry.
  - Similar themes in logical and rational decision making

- There was no "shipping"
- no Hogwarts

Thank you in advance if you can try to point me in the right direction. I will add any edits if I think of more information.


** This fits a lot of what your ask for and if it isn't then you should give it a shot it's pretty fun for a short story. Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3427377/1]])
