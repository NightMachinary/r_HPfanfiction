** So, if you spin this a little further.. Bellatrix becomes Master of the Elder Wand after stabbing Dobby, being followed by Molly turning her into stone? Well then.. all hail Molly Weasley, the most powerful of witches!

**** Yes and no. The way I understand it, Harry beat Voldemort because the wand wouldn't allow itself to be used by a wizard who wasn't its master against its master. So if Harry wasn't his master, Voldemort's Avada Kedavra would have killed him.

Of course, Molly would immediately have retaliated in rage, and she would have won the same way Harry did in canon. So the outcome's the same in the big picture, just with Harry dead.

***** Yeah the Elder wand is said to 'never fail its master', so pretty much it was a normal wand for Voldemort bc he isn't the wand's master BUT the wand will not work against Harry (bc he is the master of the wand).

To me (maybe this is just headcanon) the wand only "works" as much as it did bc (1) Harry does not try to fight and (2) it serves Harry for the curse to fire so that it kills the horexcrux inside him.

***** The first time, he survived because Lily and James sacrificed their lives for his protection, and because the prophecy said that Voldemort would "mark him his equal".

The second time he survived because he was the wand's master, and because of the horcrux in his scar.

If voldemort was the master of the elder wand, then it would have killed him and the horcrux dead (like dumbledore planned), and if there wasn't a horcrux there and voldemort wasn't the master of the wand, it still would have killed him.

****** It's debatable whether being a Horcrux, being the wand's master or being the "master of death" had anything to do with his survival in the forest. IIRC, Dumbledore says something about how Harry survived because Voldemort used Harry's blood when he built his new body, in a pseudo-Horcrux sort of way, and this has always made the most sense to me.

In case you misunderstood: My earlier comment was referring to the showdown in the Great Hall, not the forest. Although, if your interpretation is correct and Harry died in the forest, Voldemort would STILL be defeated because Harry's sacrifice prevented Voldemort from permanently harming any of the good guys at Hogwarts.

**** Harry survived the killing curse in the forest because having (and being master of) all 3 artifacts made him the Master of Death.

In his subsequent final duel, Priori Incantatem was still in effect, since Harry didn't use the Elder Wand for it. Thus, Harry's Expeliarmus was able to reflect back Voldemort's Avada Kedavra, which under normal circumstances, would not have worked.

**** For most of the series the Elder Wand is owned by Dumbledore. Draco disarms him and takes over as the Elder Wands master until Harry disarms Draco at Malfoy Manor... Dobby would have to disarm Harry.

There is a window for Dobby to disarm Draco first but it would end in Dobby dying a few seconds later and Harry and Co. unsaved.

**** That's what I'm saying,the only way Dobby gets the wand is the grab it out of Draco's hand.... and Dobby would expose himself in a room with Snatchers and Death Eaters (Including Bellatrix!) with a stick he doesn't actually know how to use.

****** Well if it's fanfiction who's to say he doesn't transform into Legolas as soon as he grabs the wand,summons a bow and kills Voldemort with poison arrows?

Trying to stick to canon and not going to far into AU,Dobby is an elf who just 5 years previously couldn't act without his master's permission without trying to bash his own brains in so stealing a wizard's wand like that is extremely OOC and hard to write out and not end up a crack-fic.
