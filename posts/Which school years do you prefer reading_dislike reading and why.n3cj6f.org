I'm sick of reading fics that get stuck in the first two years of Hogwarts. You have to go through the same thing over and over and over, but with variations (ie Harry's first time in Diagon).

That being said, I prefer fics that take place in the last three years of Hogwarts or afterwards.


** I dont like first 2 years fics because authors in general don't know how to write 11 and 12 year old kids. They be acting like adults trying to save the world.

** If there's going to be school years in the fic, I like to see all of them. Not as an epic-length thing, where there's a series with a fic for each year, or there's 400k words in a single fic; rather, I tend to most enjoy long fic that covers all seven years of school with just one or two chapters per year, showing the development of the character as they age without getting bogged down in the details. This also often comes with post-school story, and that's my real answer: if I have a choice, I prefer no school at all.

** I like sixth/seventh year the best, but if it starts at 5th it's usually just as promising. I'd rather read the characters as close to adults because everything is just so much more interesting. The drama gets juicier (when relationships and feelings start to mix and shit hits the fan, hilarious), the knowledge and spells are more advanced rather than in first year where everyone tries to show off how much they can do with a Wingardium Leviosa. Also like the books, the theme is a bit darker which fits this age better.

Trying to write dark fics with 11 year olds just doesnt work. Many authors don't know how to write 11 year olds too so this doesn't help. Unless you have a year full of Tom Riddles, those little shits just care about their classes ending and what's for dessert and then what they can do for fun. For the ones that do capture the innocence and curiosity of 11 year olds well, I tend to find them boring. I don't really care what children are up to. And if they're saving the world usually it's unrealistic so my attention is gone already. If it is realistic 11 year olds AND they're saving the world, well then I've already read that. There's very little divergence from the books at these ages. I'm also sick of the first Diagon Alley trip, the first Hogwarts Express ride and meeting new friends, the first Sorting, the troll incident and all that. Whereas with years 5-7, there's usually a lot more divergence.

** Year 4 and up I love reading about. There is enough back history there to work with and often can either split completely from canon or merge with it with adjustments. I think it is easier to write as some struggle with wide eyed 11yr olds.

​

Plus most writers who start at that age and go yeah going to do years 1 - 7 usually wind up abandoning it end of year 2 so it is a struggle to feel enthused about those fics that start then.

** I like reading stories that take place in fourth and fifth year, most of the ones I read had magic and drama that was actually fun to read. I kinda dislike stories that start after hogwarts because some people's imagination is lacking or it's romance which isn't really my cup of tea.

** I tend to gravitate to fics that start in 5th and 6th year, especially 6th year. Mostly because I feel that if you start before then either you go full AU or make enough changes for it to not be just another canon rehash. I feel that 6th year is the perfect year to a start a brand new story because:

1. It's already the point of conflict in the main story. We've got DE in the loose and Voldemort is already a threat.

2. Harry has already experienced loss he's no longer the naive protagonist he was before.

3. It's already the teenager full of hormones phase and it's the perfect time to start pairing(I don't read H/G and H/Hr so I feel like this is the perfect time to add another love interest).

4. It's a good start for Harry to change without making it forced. As I said before, Harry has already experienced grief and this can manifest in different ways, so I can at least feel it beliveable that he would go full hero or go for more dubious tactics, like - I hate these terms but whatever - gray or dark.

All around, I don't mind earlier fics that much, but it certainly feels boring to read the troll fight for the 10th time and the same Triwizard tasks and Harry failing to save Sirius from the veil(I don't mind 5th year fics if they save Sirus, though).

** 5th year is my fav in canon. Pretty happy to read any thing in fanfic from epic fics that span all years or start anywhere in between. My only real requirement is that it is well thought out with good spelling and grammar.

Recently tried to read My Immortal as it's always referenced and I felt like it needed to be done. It didn't, I hate myself for even trying.

** I hate the first year. Both to write it and to read it. From there up -- absolutely no problems. Unless, of course, someone makes 12/13 year old kids act like adults. There I'll have some complains

And, I know it's not really the question, but I also love the AUs that happen because of something that took place in the early years of Hogwarts or even before that, but we don't know exactly what and just get thrown into like, Harry's fifth year where everything is slightly (or very) different from the canon and we find out what exactly changed and why as the plot goes on. I know some people dislike that format, but ah for me it's just <3

** I like diversions from canon that incorporate a similar tone as the books but with new characters/plots. From best to worst.

6th year - this year characters have to finalise what side they are on, change something up or add a twist. The Astronomy Tower is also a good scene to play out in the same way but with different characters/motivations.

3rd year - Has the easiest plot to sweep away and start over, but also some of the most interesting tools (time-turner, map, Hogsmeade, the Marauders). I'm the most satisfied with the canon books 1 and 2, but after 3 it gets away from itself so I like to see the differences from here.

4th year - This is a big transition year so it'd be interesting to see what can change. A lot focus on the Graveyard then move to 5th year so I don't want to count those.

1st year - I am less of a fan when it starts in '91 and is taking an unnatural leap, but if the premise is good I'll give it a try. Bigger Au's that start before then I am always happy to try. Currently on a Jily lives kick but I also like the Wolfstar raise Harry.

2nd year - IMO this canon book is the best constructed which is why so many fics keep it the same. If this is the jumping off point for a fic it is probably a really good premise cause the writers who'll phone it in will start at year 1.

7th year - a little late for big changes, and the canon plot is really clunky. Big gaps of nothing or specific scenes that link back to the previous books.

5th year - I feel like every story starts here and I've read so many "cleaning out Grimmauld Place" that I need a change (I usually search for Cedric or Sirius lives stories, even the latest Regulus lives story I read jumped back in here).

** What I would like to see more of is GoF with the Tri-Wizard Tournament completely reworked. We all love JKR, but I think she isn't the best at sporting events (we already know the problems with Quidditch). These problems also extend to the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

Here we get a chance to know the students and schools outside of Hogwarts as they compete in the Wizarding equivalent to a sort of Death-Match Olympics, and it just feels kind of squandered. Most of the events make terrible spectator sports. They're supposed to promote cooperation, but there are no teams. There are only 3 events over the course of an ENTIRE YEAR. What are the other schools doing at Hogwarts that entire time? Just waiting?

There are 3 schools worth of children with curiosity, hormones, and egos, but there are no other kinds of teams, competitive events, or knowledge swaps? We actually get an amazing opportunity to learn about the Wizarding World and culture outside of England, but we learn relatively little.

Read jbern's The Lie I've Lived. Even if you hate the pairing (Harry/Fleur), he does SO much more with the Tri-Wizard Tournament that it almost puts JKR's to shame. He uses two champions from each school who compete in at least 8 events, starting with a broom race that's absolutely fantastic. Plus, there are other events outside the core tournament.

There is so much competitiveness, cheating, posturing, and side wagering, it's amazing! And he makes Viktor Krum one of the bad guys. Viktor and his headmaster are such a**holes in that story that you just love to hate them.

The Tri-Wizard Tournament marks a time when Harry needs to grow up, so I think it's the best place to start. And after reading The Lie I've Lived, I realized just how much potential was there.

** It really depends on the story

The more variance the new version from the og the more I like seeing the details. If there is alot and causes alot of changes to overall plot/the future arcs then I wanna see all the years.

If its minimal changes till like year 4 and the only real difference is its a fem Harry or its a different friend group for Harry then I prefer like snippets to get the differences in the new set of characters from the og or understand the friend dynamics no need to re write all of canon just because Blaise Zambini would say different things than Ron Weasely while doing the same things.

But in general book 4 on are the years i like seeing more. Books 1 -3 i would like seeing more from pov of someone who not doing things with Harry Ron or Hermione that often

** I like ones when Harry's in first year but only on a certain site (potions and snitches) cos then Snapes involved and it's not hella boring most times

I also like fifth year but again where Snape is involved

Okay I think I just like fanfics where Snape is like Harry's mentor/father/etc

Oh and 8th year fics but only certain ones.

I don't like fourth year ones and then 7th year ones are boring to me

I've read too many first or fifth year ones I don't like the rest 😂
