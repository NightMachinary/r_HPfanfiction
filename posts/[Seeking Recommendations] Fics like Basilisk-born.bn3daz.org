I would like fics where the protagonist travels far into the past but eventually comes back either by the natural passage of time or by magic I don't care

I Don't read: -female MC -Slash


** Basilisk-born is the big one. The only other one of any quality that comes to mind has a female MC (A Long Journey Home, which I will only mention and not link due to your stated preference) and is also regrettably abandoned. That said, there are a couple of other oddballs floating around with similar premises that are abandoned too. linkffn(The Wizard from Earth) comes to mind.

​

The fic I'm working on right now (at a glacial pace, and it's only 1 and a half chapters in anyways) will have a similar premise, but it hasn't reached that point yet anyways, so I won't bother mentioning it either. When I have more than two chapters posted maybe I'll drop a Self Promotion post or something.

​

Anyways, I wish you luck on your search for long-period time travel fics that aren't abandoned and/or complete garbage. Cheers, Erebus out.

  Living for a century is an accomplishment, even for a wizard. Two is a rarity. Living them all? That is the territory of the gods. Harry Potter remembers a cat's glowing eyes, a strange old man with a wicked smile, and pain. It is the year 3050 B.C.E. and he has all of history as his future.
