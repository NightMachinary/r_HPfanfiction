I believe James gets hit by it and Dumbledore has Snape create a counter to it because otherwise James will die. on A03 IIRC.\\
In the same vein, does anyone know of a Fic where Snape has to be able to perform a patronus in order for Dumbledore to accept that he is infact a "Light" wizard despite the creation of Sectumsempra?


** Is it this?
