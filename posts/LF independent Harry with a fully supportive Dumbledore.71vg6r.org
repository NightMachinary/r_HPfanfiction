So the regular indy!Harry formula has the manipulative Dumbledore try very hard to keep Harry under his thumb, triggering Harry to give a speech in the middle of the Great Hall. Are there any where instead, Dumbledore is completely cool with Harry getting his 47 titles and 3 new middle names, or otherwise tries to accommodate an independent Harry?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Harry was adopted by Grangers, Dumbledore immediately put protections there and brought Tonks in touch with them. Harry came to Hogwarts already with a large support base, and further expanded it in the next few years. By Year 4, he was leading quite a group of adults and students, and Dumbledore was supportive throughout (although he still gambled with the PS thing).

*** I second any general recommendation of /Animagus/, but I don't think it really counts as an "independant Harry" story.

**** 'Independence' doesn't mean Harry had to do everything by himself and didn't listen to anyone, but always made the right decisions. That's 'powerwank' to me.

In this story, Harry utilized his supporters well, employed their suggestions, but ultimately made his own decisions. As I said before, he was leading them around by Year 4. Although Hermione edged him slightly in academics and duels, she didn't come close to his intuition and leadership skills. That's 'independence' for me.

***** Hm. For me the definiton of an Indy!Harry story was one where he distances himself from all his canon allies (Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron, etc.).
