As in Phineas and Ferb? Two kids, one summer, and a ludicrous number of gizmos and gadgets?

What happens if you take them back to the start of the 20th century and put the two of them in a magic school as Headmaster and Deputy?

What if the Flynn family, replacing the Black family, became well known not for dark magic and madness, but for invention and downright lunacy?

What if Sirius Flynn is still wrongly sent to Azkaban and still breaks out? What kind of zany scheme would he inflict on Hogwarts?

**** Pretty much. I used to read the Infinite Loops and now I keep thinking of 'what happens if we transplant that character into this setting?'.

** I'm linkffn(8682316) Ferb is a wizard and Phineas tags along to Hogwarts in his trunk.

I see how this could be awesome. And the marauders will be even more fun. Imagine all the high end pranks they would pool and Argus Finch could be the Doofensberg and Perry the Platipus could be the mascot of the Marauders.

** I have a thought here that basically involves Dr. Doofenshmirtz completely schooling Voldemort as he demonstrates The level of intellect necessary to keep affording all of his ridiculous crap even though he's constantly foiled by a platypus.

Just basically Doofenshmirtz taking offense to actual Evil.
