The bashing:

Mrs Weasley: Of course you will marry my Ginny Harry dear you were always meant for each other she loves you she will make you a good wife besides Dumbledore made a marriage contract between you both you have to marry her.

Lord Harry James Potter Black Slytherin Gryffindor Ravenclaw: My goblins friends have already voided the contract Dumbledore was never my magical guardian so the contract was illegal I will not marry Ginny I have never loved her like that and honestly I don't like her she reminds me of you to much Mrs Weasley besides I'm in love with Draco.

Mrs Weasley: screams like a banshee you will marry her Harry James Potter your mother would be ashamed by you she would want you to marry my Ginny *try's to pull Harry with her*

Lord Harry James Potter Black Slytherin Gryffindor Ravenclaw: "Eyes glow Avada Kedavra green" Unhand me Mrs Weasley you just assaulted the head of 5 different House's I could put you in Azkaban for what you just did stay away from me you and the red head weasel behind you

***** So I'm a huge harry potter fan, and therefore had all the prior knowledge required to read hp fic when I started, but I read fics from other fandoms without having seen canon. Generally, it starts with crossovers in fandoms that I do know, or self explanatory situations that make sense without much intro. For example, I got into miraculous ladybug fic because I really enjoy stupid secret identity drama, and that fandom is full of it. It's not hard to figure out the main love square there (it's actually just two characters with secret identities, and they're listed as both characters in the tags, soooo) and from that it's easy enough to understand what's going on. And sometimes fics are so au that the author has to explain everything (or most things) anyway. So it's definitely possible for a fic to be readable fandom blind without quoting canon directly. Will the reader miss references sometimes? Yes, probably, but it's still possible to enjoy the story

****** Indie!Harry's whole clique in indie fics is just bizzare tbh.

They turn Fred and George into actual bullies while having Harry throw tantrums about bullying.

They erase Neville's whole identity by pretty much saying that all he needed to do to improve was follow Harry.

They turn Luna into this... abberation that is a mix of "random and quirky" and "Sybil Trelawney"

And let's not forget his usual romantic interest, Daphne "Ice Queen" Greengrass who's typically the rudest, most arrogant person in the fic at the start. You know, at the moment Harry meets her, just after Harry literally cut his entire social circle out for having those traits.

I get that it's a story about magic where logic shouldn't apply too much, but some of this shit requires way too much suspension of disbelief. And that's before you get into the whole "untrained 14 y/o outmaneuvering literally everyone" trope.

Can`t we have some regular Romance without all the edgyness, how about them trying to dodge curfew to meet, or Harry being his reckless self and sitting down in the Slytherin table to eat with her and her friends once in a while?

******** That's one thing I'd love to see in fics. Characters having proper social interactions that fit their age. Harry having moments that remind you that he's a teenager. Stuff like dates that make sense (seriously, why does every relationship have to start with a ball?!) or even just casual interactions, having an actual interest in anything other then being the Good Guy(tm). Normal teenage stuff like Harry and Ron sneaking out of the Burrow to have some beers by the creek, then dodging around so Molly won't find out.

Hell, I feel like it'd raise most fics' quality by a shitload to just show the characters' vices. Swearing, smoking, irrational behaviour that isn't justified by the author. Not as a centerpoint, just included in normal fics. Just some natural behaviour that shows us that these characters are /human/.

And on the Daphne note, I don't get why she's the most rigid character in the fandom. In like 90% of the fics, it's ice queen. Even canon characters have more variance. The whole point of a named OC is that you can make them into whatever you want. Hell, the same authors make Harry into whatever they want. But then they turn around and copy-paste Daphne from another fic, sometimes literally.

*** It's almost impossible to come up with a reasonable AND non-malicious reason for a lot of things that Dumbledore did, especially as the series goes on. JKR was NOT a good planner, so things like Dumbledore riding a fucking BROOM from Scotland to London at the end of book 1, rather than flooing, apparating, or taking a portkey... well, you need something to fill that void. It wouldn't have been a void at all had JKR planned out her world rather than adding random elements book by book that negated large elements of prior plot. Evil or incompetent Dumbledore is not difficult to get to. Evil Ginny is tougher. Molly can be a bitch, and she's unthinkingly cruel at times, but she's no evil mastermind either. And Ron... well, he's kind of an asshole a LOT. He IS jealous quite regularly. He does betray his friendship with Harry at least twice in canon. So it's not a large jump to turn him worse. But the only one that almost has to be either bad or incompetent is Dumbledore. The rest are open to interpretation.

**** I'd like one where the goblins are more tricksterish. In my mind the blood test things are real and it will show up a lot of old names such as Gryffindor. But everyone is related to Gryffindor just due to the sheer amount of time the house has been around. Like Charlemagne really. Seeing as the vaults have been there for a very long time with no one using them they have accumulated some /slight/ fees.

People familiar with them know that this means you could essentially 'buy' the name by paying these off, but the unknowing may sign contracts to get the name thinking the relation means something and ending up in massive amounts of debt to the goblins.

The best part? I imagine the purebloods/upper class knowing this happens and finding it a sign of new money and turning their noses up at these 'lords'. The people doing it wanted prestige and riches and now they're a poor (possibly massively in debt) laughingstock.

But they both came back, people make mistakes and war is extremely stressful, like I get it. Percy probably never had a great relationship with his family so he likely didn't feel it was a huge betrayal to stick with the lawmakers rather than a vigilante group. He came back once he saw the true horrors Burge didn't want to break the law for his family. And Ron was a jealous 14 year old and then a 17 year old who had never gone hungry so when times got tough he left. He felt super guilty and returned but he did leave.
