The sorting hat tells Harry that Slytherin would help him on his way to glory, but how? What do you think Slytherin would have offered him that the other houses couldn't?


** One thing that comes to mind is that Harry would have been in a hostile environment, from day one. Adversity breeds Excellence and to survive in the house Harry, most likely, would have had to shine.

Be the best in classes earns respect. Learn and master curses early gains fear from his peers.

That is one way to look at it.

On the other hand, Harry could have been an... interesting presence in Slytherin. Another option, a different path, a way out to many children spending their formative years in the house that bred Voldemort and 99% of his Death Eaters.

That's what comes immediately to mind, in any case.

** It very much depends on what you think is "great". But if we do go by conventional standards, it's achieving something others can't, and for this you need the ambition to try and a certain ruthless, single-minded focus that (for good and ill) runs over everyone and everything that stands in the way.

Which sounds like something Slytherin could have taught him (in a "sink or swim" manner) -- he certainly didn't have it on his own.

Of course, Harry did achieve something (defeating Voldemort). But leaving aside that at the time, no one could guess this, do note that this is something that doesn't originate within him. From PS on, Harry feels responsible for the world; it's quite different from pursuing something you picked in a free decision. Harry in Slytherin might well have gotten into a hard choice of whether or not be the "Chosen One" -- and given that the prophecy is a state of mind, it's not like he would necessarily be forced to be.

*** Based on your definition, perhaps the "great" thing Harry would do in Slytherin is reform the House. In the books, Slytherins are supposed to be ambitious and cunning, but I don't think we see that...unless you count cheating as cunning and committing racist terrorism as ambitious.

Harry might, MIGHT have been able to provide a better example. Someone who succeeds where all the odds are stacked against him. And with such an example, maybe the upcoming generation would think "maybe Voldemort's path isn't the best one?"

This is speculation on my part but I thought I'd throw in my two bits.

**** Based on the definition, you are, of course, correct. And it's certainly something people have written in FF (or tried to, anyway). You'll find quite a few fans of that here.

Though, if you read my [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/i0qmvp/how_exactly_would_slytherin_have_helped_harry_be/fzum1pt/][other comment]], you see that I'm personally not the biggest fan of that story line. This has two reasons; for one, it's Canon that some of the more (as commonly understood) "nasty" traits belong to Slytherin, e.g. "using any means to achieve their ends" is just a more fancy way of saying "cheating"; and if you count Pottermore, then Slytherins are selfish and cowards. So "reforming" the House would be equal to discarding it; it wouldn't be Slytherin anymore.

More relevantly though, I find it boring as both a writer and reader. The interesting thing to explore with Slytherin, for me, is how a different view of morality turns the "bad" traits into "good" ones, and how this is what causes their continued existence (because obviously, no sane person likes to think of themselves as "bad").

Disregard for people turns to commendable ambition. Cowardice turns to commendable valuing your life. Cheating turns to commendable dedication to a goal. Selfishness turns to commendable clear-eyed realism.

In other words, like I said in the other post, the inside POV, and the contrast it yields to the Gryffindor POV, whose traits would be inverted as well (braveness becomes stupidity, nobility becomes highhanded arrogance, insistence on doing the "right thing" self-righteous preaching of those that know of no hard choices). So the only reason for me to stick a Harry with Gryffindor values into Slytherin would be to poke at this dark mirror of those values, and as that makes for a quaint reading for about one chapter, I usually just give him the Slytherin POV, and use some other Gryffindor for contrast.

** A few years ago there was this tumblr post about what could have happened if Cassius Warrington, a Slytherin, was chosen to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. It basically theorized that many Slytherins would be affected by his untimely death and mobilize secretly against Voldemort.

What came to mind is that Harry being in Slytherin could inspire many to side with him and change things in the war. He would eventually get to know his Housemates well enough and become another path instead of Voldemort.

Harry could also make friends with people in other Houses and unify the Houses against threats like Umbridge.

** imo houses are all about creating the right environment to hone the kids' potential strengths. It's not really decided by the kids' personality (I mean come on, they're at the age right before their personalities have a major change) but their potential and, most importantly, their own priorities and dreams in life. That's why the Hat takes into account the kid's choice, why whole families go to a single house, why many characters don't seem to fit their house's traits, etc.

So Slytherin is not a house /for/ cunning and ambitious kids, but a house which /creates/ cunning and ambitious young adults, in an environment that's competitive and unforgiving and whatever else. And that's what would have helped Harry be great, achieve glory, blah blah blah.

** I personally think that if Harry was in Slytherin that his competitiveness would've pushed him to earn respect and pushed him to be better. I think the mindset would've changed the way he acted in that he would've had to be calculated and also just being around the ones who's parents were death eaters would've given him insight and more information to make better decisions. He would've seen the best and worst from both sides. As well his friends, regardless if they were Hermione and Ron or a Slytherin would've probably given him tough love and motivated him that way and given him a competitive "I have to improve" instead of the "You need to be better" he felt from people in Gryffindor. The enviroment in the Slytherin house was probably survival of the fittest in essence and he would've had to learn to play his cards properly. The determination wouldn't have let him spend him mess around much and in my opinion he probably wouldn't have even thought about dating until it was all over. Another factor is how he would learn to watch his back. He would've been in the same dorm as at least a few of the boys he was openly enemies with from the start. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle. I'm sure threats would've been common and he would need to be careful if he wanted to keep his secrets and cloak.

** Slytherin is stuck in a self-fulfilling loop where because people view them as Junior Death Eaters, kids avoid the house if they aren't Pureblood supremacists, which ensures that the house becomes and stays full of Junior Death Eaters, who are the only people happy to bear such a reputation.

Having Harry be sorted there, an undeniable beacon of light and a hero to plenty of Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws would give him extra ability to reach Slytherins, while the fact he's the Boy Who Lived would prevent him from being ostracized just to Slytherin as other kids might be.

In place, he would be able to do two important things, and I think he'd intuitively do them as a result of his personality. First, he could reach out to any Slytherins who were even slightly sympathetic to the Light, pulling them further into the good side before Voldemort's return draws the battle line. Additionally, the raw cunning move for many Slytherins around his age at Hogwarts would likely be to ingratiate oneself to him, joining behind him as they do behind Malfoy or did Voldemort, due to his power and status. This might convince even the kids from some darker families to act more neutrally or pro-light purely from self interest. Secondly, helped along by progress in the first task, he would be able to begin rehabilitating Slytherin's image. Cunning and Ambition are not inherently evil and by having the Boy Who Lived providing a human example of this for other Slytherins and potential Slytherins to respect and aspire to, as well as for the other houses to understand. This should ease the connection between the 4 houses, allowing for a more diverse DA, a more diverse resistance against Voldemort and the Death Eaters, and in the best case maybe even the ability for Harry to turn a former Death Eater to the Order by their child's loyalty to him.

Plenty of stories have shown something like this, and for Malfoy as an example I think it can work well. Malfoy initially wants to befriend Harry, likely on his father's instructions and had it not been for Hagrid and Ron's offhand remarks about evil plus Draco's rudeness to Ron he would likely have maintained that goal and approach rather than becoming antagonistic. At 11 years old and too young to remember the War or Voldemort first hand, he is still pliable and naive, so Harry acting as a positive influence on him could well turn the friendship real. From there, it's not till Year 4 that Harry has a direct run in with Voldemort that is kinda expected - Year 1 he expected Snape and would otherwise have expected Quirrel, Year 2 he didn't know who it would be, Year 3 was Sirius - and so Draco could easily be dragged along on the adventures till this point without even having to renounce Blood Purism except to be less loud about it in Harry's earshot. If he is genuinely friends with Harry by now and has had a hand in defeating Voldemort's plans multiple times he is a lot more likely to side with Harry after the Graveyard or equivalent. From there, you have to ask what Lucius and Narcissa would do and for Narcissa at least I think the answer is clear. She'd turn for Draco, as she does later in canon anyway. Lucius would likely be inclined towards this too, if Harry could work with Dumbledore and the Order to provide safety and reward, and if Snape (who would presumably see more of Lily in a Slytherin Slytherin Harry who respects him as Head of his House) is willing to help recruit them, I think that could work.

From there, using Malfoy's influence to spread a similar offer to the rest of the DE's, especially if you could get this started pre-resurrection when some still think he's dead for good and they have nothing to lose by swapping sides, may well turn the tide when Voldemort does return.

How far you think this would go, and how large scale the butterfly effects are from Harry's sorting is up to you of course, but there's a clear path if you want to go for maximum fix-it, and that would certainly qualify as greatness.

"The adventures" are the epitome of Gryffindor. From the point of view of Slytherin, they are nightmares, and Draco would thank you very much not to get involved with this. Actually, a Harry that was a Slytherin wouldn't be involved, not unless he was a Gryffindor-in-Slytherin, which ... well, kinda defeats the point. A Gryffindor-in-Slytherin!Harry might well do what you say; but it's moot argument: No such thing will exist, if the Sorting and Houses mean anything at all.

An actual Harry in Slytherin might work the following way:

- Year 1: Draco destroys Neville's remembrall. Troll kills Hermione. Dragon burns down Hagrid's hut. Quirrell steals the stone.
- Year 2: The Basilisk kills a student. Hogwarts gets closed. And off you are to AU territory.

The reason why it happens (exemplarily) like this is because Harry does not get involved in the Canon situations. As a Slytherin, he knows the value of his own life, and asks two very important questions: (1) "Why should I", (2) "What's in it for me". Both of which lead to him staying far away from deadly beasts, schemes by Headmasters and Death Eaters, insane professors and suicidal situations. Because the very premise in any of those is a feeling of responsibility for the world at age 11, which is fundamentally incompatible with Slytherin, so a Harry correctly sorted into Slytherin does not possess such a thing.

This is also why I don't like those kinds of stories; as you say, there are a lot of them, and they never make sense to me. I always like to think the author himself would be a Gryffindor, and is so boxed-in in his POV that he doesn't even realise the issue. One memorable instance in a story declared -- *unironically* -- that "not all Slytherins are bad, some are noble and brave". Which would be a hilarious joke ("not all Slytherins are bad, some are Gryffindors"), except the author was serious.

Writing Slytherin like that -- in effect, sending Harry there to Gryffindorise it -- does a great disservice to House system, I think. Slytherins /are/ selfish. They /do/ consider their own gains first. *And the point here is that this is only bad as measured by the standards of a Gryffindor.* You don't need to fix this, indeed you musn't. Slytherins don't consider /themselves/ "evil" or bad persons. That's an outside POV. The whole point (in my eyes) in writing a Slytherin story is to cover the inside POV, i.e. a set of beliefs that considers themselves as perfectly good.

And to return to the OP, such a set of ideals is one building block to achieve more than the average person (or what often is called "great"), because the focus is on the self, as the drive make it work, and the belief of being better than others is the reason to try.

** Well, if we go off of canon, he'd be dealing with either respect from those who thought he was a dark wizard or hatred from Voldemort supporting families. The adversity would push him to prove himself, though in a different manner from how he tries to go about it in 5th year. The difference with 5th and AU 1st year would be that Harry would be proving he isn't a dark wizard whereas 5th year he gets called a liar. He'd also have to go about it differently instead of yelling at everyone because remember, he's straight from an abusive home and likely less outspoken. So with his new freedom he probably works his best to do well academically and physically, to be the ‚Äúgood‚Äù slytherin to prove his housemates wrong. In 5th year he's been in gryffindor he's developed different traits which make him more outspoken and loud, whereas Slytherin would breed sneakier traits and work as a juxtaposition. He would retain what makes him Harry, but with a less upfront way of doing things and likely more of a determination to show people up. Though it's been a while since I've read canon, so I might be off.

** Well, if Slytherin was as it was supposed to be (ambitious and cunning), it could have been good. Those are both good traits to have, though honestly all of the house traits are good. Canon mostly treats the house as pureblood bigots. The house had to have known that. It certainly is aware of things that happen outside of it, after all, and in any case the last few generations almost certainly were bigots as far as we know. I'm not sure how that was supposed to help him in any way.

** He would be in a sink or swim situation, many in the House would be recalcitrant, he would have to prove himself in a semi-hostile environment. He would have to either develop the people skills to make friends, or isolate himself and seek friendship in other Houses.

He would learn to work hard, to focus, he wouldn't have the distractions he had in Gryffindor.

Snape would be in one hell of a quandary, if he exaggerated too much in the punishing, Albus would intervene. If he hurt Harry he would be going against his vow to protect him.

I could see a Harry that merely doesn't want to deal with this shit just asking to be transferred to another school after first year. He wouldn't have the friends to anchor him.

Maybe he would find fewer but very loyal friends, maybe he would become more charismatic and swing the house's loyalty towards him, much more competent than Malfoy, and more pleasant to be around. Maybe he would be swayed to a darker, ruthless philosophy(not support Voldemort just being more brutal and self-centered), without Hermione, Ron and Dumbledore(among others) to help guide him towards good.

The hat does say in Slytherin you find your true friends(this can be interpreted in a myriad of ways).

I could totally see him being influenced by the friendships and environment there(like any child) and being quite different from canon Harry by the third year.

Second Year would be very interesting.

OR Maybe he finds out the Slytherins are misunderstood traditionalists, who only want to be free to study more magic. He does that while forming real friendships and finding true love in the arms of a rich pureblooded heiress who teaches him politics and how to walk with grace and greet people "properly".

** Assuming that Harry being in Slytherin wouldn't make Snape any less hostile and hateful, Harry would've been forced to mature and learn fast. Since Snape hates him, he'd probably make Harry hated by his fellow Slytherins. That and Draco being annoying whenever he succeeds would force Harry to be the best. His social skills were developed more because of Ron and Hermione showing him true friendship and family. without those, Harry would be a lot darker (maybe new dark lord? prob not but its an interesting thought) and probably a more well rounded wizard. Harry is cunning in canon but if he was in Slytherin, he'd be a lot more manipulative because of his peers also being manipulative.

No respect whatsoever for canon!Harry. He has no respect for the sacrifices people made for him. He deserved to be nothing more than what he was - a brainless lapdog, fulfilling Dumbledore's postmortem wishes like the obedient pet he was.

Except of course for getting rid of the person responsible for their deaths. It's beyond me how one can think that the way he did that would somehow be disrespectful to their sacrifices. The end result is exactly the same, only without the usage of a curse that warps the user's mind.

I don't recall Dumbledore telling Harry to use a Disarming Charm against Voldemort. In fact, if Harry was brainlessly following Dumbledore, he would have used a far more lethal curse, as Dumbledore did during their duel.

** I always thought the pitch about greatness was less the Sorting Hat knowing it would make Harry great, and more it testing him, to see how he reacted to the most basic ambition-bait. It was saying any House would work, until Harry brought up Slytherin himself and then it focused on it and poked to see why/why not.

Ultimately, I feel Harry in Slytherin would have fostered his "thirst to prove himself", and he would have been rather like Hermione - studying harder to learn as much as he could to prove he deserved to be there, especially with Malfoy and Snape looking down on him throughout.

** As in magically and perhaps politically powerful. He would face severe pressure from Draco and Snape because of their shared dislike of him, and he'd have to excel if he's to survive. As for politics, Harry largely remains away from utilising his fame in canon because he doesn't like attention, but I think Slytherin could teach him to compromise for the greater good and use his celebrity status for benefits.

** I think it's more to do with how the houses are. While Harry was treated as a celebrity by the Gryffindor and had a lot of pull with them from the beginning, he would have had to work a lot to achieve that kind of a system in Slytherin. That would have surely changed him from the person he became.

It would've honestly, changed how he approached a problem. Maybe being cunning for once rather than charging head first into a problem like he does throughout the canon.

** Snape wouldn't be so hard on him and maybe Harry would be really good at potions because of it? he did cook for the Dursleys. I think potions is one of the talents Harry could have in canon if JK didn't go for the "power of love" nonsense. lost potential that is.

he wouldn't be ostracized by his house in second book, because Slytherin would think how cool it is to be the heir, nor in fourth year, because Slytherins would think him very Slytherin for managing to fool the goblet. I'm sure they would love to have a Slytherin champion, and they wouldn't be sore about it like Gryffindors were. in fifth, the Slytherins might choose to stay with him instead of siding with Umbridge and they would definitely notify Snape if they notice the blood quill writing (or do something sneaky against it). and if not that, they could moan to their Slytherin parents sitting in the ministry so Umbridge could be out sooner. and let's be honest, McGonnagall wasn't a very good head of house. granted, we don't actually see any other head of house in action so it might be all of them. I think the main thing would be, at least some of the Slytherins would rather follow Harry instead of Tom. be it either by being his friends, or Harry being able to manipulate/talk people out of it.

Harry would become the minister or maybe headmaster. both are better, much greater, jobs than an auror.

I don't think he would be hated in there. the only one making problems would be Draco with his bodyguards, and Pansy, but he could be friends with Blaise. actually other Slytherins weren't really his enemies in canon. maybe except quidditch matches and that's sport.

(He could be the one practicing dancing with Snape before yule ball!!!)

** Per JKR, the hat just sensed the horcrux and that was why it thought Harry would do well in Slytherin. Harry himself would not, in fact, have fit in there. Which really is kinda plainly obvious from having the barest understanding of his canonical character.

#+begin_quote
  MA: After we got back from Carnegie Hall, we brought back your message of how Harry is kind of not really a Horcrux. And I won't dwell too long on Horcruxes, but, I'd love to hear you talking about how he is or isn't, or wasn't.

  JKR: Well, I tell you-- You know what, this will not end the discussion. I know that, and you know that. But here is the thing. For convenience, I had Dumbledore say to Harry, "You were the Horcrux he never meant to make." But I think, by definition, a Horcrux has to be made intentionally. So, because Voldemort never went through the grotesque process that I imagined creates a Horcrux, with Harry, it was just that he had destabilized his soul so much that it split when he was hit by the back-firing curse. And so this part of it flies off and attaches to the only living thing in the room. A part of it flees in the very close-to-death limbo state that Voldemort then goes on and exists in. I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux. But Harry was not-- did not become an evil object. He wasn't-- he didn't have curses upon him that the other Horcruxes had. He himself was not contaminated by carrying this bit of parasitic soul. The only time he ever felt it stirring and moving was in "Order of the Phoenix", when he himself goes through a very dark time. And there's a moment where he's looking at Dumbledore and he feels something rear like a snake inside him. And of course at those times, it's because the piece of soul inside him is feeding off his emotions. He's going through a dark time and that piece of soul is enjoying it and making its presence felt. But he doesn't know what he's feeling, of course. Also I always imagined the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on. Because it was strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin. So that's how I see it. Now, I know that won't end the debate, but I do think that the strict definition of Horcrux, once I write The Scottish Book, will have to be given and that the definition will be: the receptacle is prepared by dark magic to become the receptacle of a fragmented piece of soul and that that piece of soul deliberately detached from the Master Soul to act as a future safeguard or anchor to life and to safeguard against death. So that doesn't clear anything up but it elucidates what I believe. But I don't think it's necessarily going to convince people who have a strong feeling, one way or the other, on the matter. You know what, that's been the case with most of "Harry Potter". I gave my explanation and it just fuels more debate.

** He would've become evil.

That passage was a callback: remember how Ollivander said "great things - terrible, yes, but great". So Harry would have become great... and terrible. Slytherin would have hammered anti-muggle sentiment into his malleable child-brain, and to survive among the children of the men whose master he killed, he would have to become ruthless. Remember that dark magic is seductive in canon, too. It promises quick power, seemingly for free. Just the right lure. You won't notice its corruptive effect until you're too deep in already.

**** I was speaking about canon, and its binary morale undertones. You're either good or you're evil, and a Harry in Slytherin in Canon would have been evil just like the rest of them.

This situation really only works in Fanon, cause JK operates on a very black-and-white system in her books.

Of course, a Fanon Slytherin Harry likely wouldn't be evil, just like the majority of his classmates. But I doubt also that he would find an "in" with the 'old crowd' as is so often the case, or that he would actually study dark magic in-depth.
