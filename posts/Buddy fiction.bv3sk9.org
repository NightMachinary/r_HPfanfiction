What would you say the best HP buddy fic stories are? My favourite is Griffindors Never Die, until it jumps shark at the end of fourth year and does the friend of the goblins thing.

Its a genre that I can't seem to find many stories in, in HP fanfiction, which is odd, since HP canon seems to be a massive buddy fic between Harry and Ron.

Recs can be any pair of mates.


** linkffn(9121877) is a Ron & Harry buddy cop fic.

  After the fall of Voldemort, Harry makes a dumb career choice and Ron tags along. Hermione, sensibly, doesn't. Seven years later, a very different trio are drawn into an international web of intrigue by a little girl and an old relic. Lesson to be learned: stay in school, kids. Post-DH; Slightly AU. Rated M for language and violence. Not slash.
