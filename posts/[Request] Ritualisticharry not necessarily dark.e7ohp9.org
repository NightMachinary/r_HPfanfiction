So the book has the cool bone of the father ritual I would like a story with bunches of rituals with cool "visuals"

It can be good/evil/or just dark harry I do not really care.

Things like killing a dragon in direct combat with a sword and eating the heart gives (insert powerup) is cool to. Maybe he then eats the basilisks heart to see whats up you know.

I do not just want forcibly taken and willingly given knockoffs either.


** Prince of the dark kingdom is a classic example. Lots of ritual magic

** I've recommended both of those recently, but why not do it again. The first one is unfinished, but fun- Harry's grandmother was in a coma, but she gets better and forms a coven of witches to protect Harry and Sirius and hunt horcruxes and stuff. In the second one Harry is darker, but there are more rituals and it's complete.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** The description of rituals in linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14281440/chapters/32942874]]) remains my favorite and I'll reread the middle one of the trilogy if I ever want to come up with rituals in my own writing.

It's Hermione, not Harry, though. He does participate in a few but Hermione runs the show.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort.
