why do all wrong boy who lived have Harry's sibling. ...

I'm looking for a fic where everything is canon, Harry is the boy who lived, raised by the Dursley's, but at one point in the story it is found out somehow that it was actually Neville the prophecy was about.

Dumbledore: oh no, I raised the wrong soldier.

Harry: whoohoo!

Neville: ...

Snape: we are all going to die.

**** I will never not laugh at that image. Just imagine ol voldy moldy being all threatening while approaching his victim, his wand is raised, the words "avada kadevra" on his lips.... and then he releases a shriek worthy of a five year old boy and promptly flops to the floor with the grace of a dead fish.
