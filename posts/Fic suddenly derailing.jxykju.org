So, I was /planning/ a light, fluffy piece, involving Remus getting his period and being comforted by his friends, and actually feeling better until it's night. Now it turned into 'Sirius being supportive of him but utterly /furious/ at him lying about it, and James agreeing, and Remus running away because its easier than acknowledging lying to your friends is wrong and still hiding you're a werewolf.' How TH do I go from that to fluff again?? Or should I abandon all fluff and then what? Jeez, this was meant to be a breather chapter....


** Hehe.... welcome to my world. Fluff always ends in either angst or smut.

I'm sorry, I can't help you, but know you're not alone â™¡

*** Thanks, that helps somewhat! I probably shouldn't have read those depressive! ADHD! Remus Lupin headcanon beforehand (whole gang had various sorts of ADHD, Sirius has anger issues on top of it, and a thing about lying, so he kinda snaps HARD at discovering that, while he had told Remus everything, Remus had callously lied to him each month), so I sort of went 'well, they would all try to comfort him at first, but something has to be done about that conflict, otherwise it'll never get resolved.' Also helps that it provides a solid motivation for thinking their best friend is a spy, if he is known for being a terrific liar who has lied to them before, while Sirius hadn't.

** At first I really enjoyed "Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce"... it was a really feel-good comfy story about friendship and getting over the house barriers through cooking. Then all of a sudden the author wants to make a political statement or something and all the characters are gay, bi or trans and their whole identity revolves around that.

*** And... what does that have to do with me, exactly? I mean, yeah, in my story Remus is trans. He's also a conflict avoiding prankster, who has plenty of identity outside of that (brilliant at planning pranks, lying , and chess, to name just a few things). This was meant to be just a fluffy flashback, while current! Remus has his own adventures.

***** Oh, I am sorry! I didn't realize. The bit of a part of their identity becoming their whole identity felt a bit like a ... I am sorry, I got a bit defensive. I didn't mean to be rude!
