I would like fics with a Voldemort that has a consistent capability throughout his whole life.

So, if your fic works on the assumption that Voldemort has held the Wizarding World in a grip of terror before he was beaten by Harry, then he cannot be a dumb shit after his ressurrection. Or completely insane, without any coherent goals except for torturing people (as I do not see someone like that getting any followers in the first place).

Good!Voldemort is accepted, but it should be written well. If he holds the Wizarding World in a grip of terror at some point, then it should be explained why and explained well (so not "because Evil!Dumbledore")

For bonus points: A consistent Dumb!Voldemort.

Preferably no fics where Voldemorts role is almost not there at all, like most OP!Harry or Inheritance!Harry fics. He should have a significant role if possible.


** Out of curiosity, would you also accept a Voldemort going from smart to dumb, with an acknowledged in-fic explanation?

e.g. His long-term use of dark magic and/or the damage to his soul via horcruxes is distorting his emotions and/or long-term planning ability?

Or that the homunculus body created for him at the end of Goblet of Fire has an imperfect brain leading to reduced learning ability and/or memory storage?

Or that Harry's blood, imbued with Lily's protection, is fighting from within his body and occasionally succeeds in influencing the Dark Lord into making impetuous decisions?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11540013/1/Benefits-of-old-laws][Benefits of old laws]] actually has something like this to explain Voldemort turning 'good-ish'; when the Diary in 2nd year was destroyed, the soul piece from it reunited with Voldemort once he got a new body, restoring a sizeable chunk of his sanity.

And [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4818951/1/Fair-Trade][Fair Trade]], as I recall, has Harry explicitly pointing out to Voldemort that the latter's gone insane due to all his soul breakage.

...That one makes me wonder, actually; if Voldemort, with a servant's help, could create a homunculus and later a complete body in the space of a year or so, why didn't he do so with Quirrel's help? Perhaps he didn't know the required magic at the time?

*** Hmm. Going from smart to dumb is not very consistent, but I'll think I'll accept it under two conditions:

1. It's very well explained (I think the fics you want to link have this already)

2. There is a way for Voldemort to reverse the effects of Horcruxes or Dark Magic, and he (voluntarily or involuntarily) uses it. I've once seen it done with a potion for Dark Magic (in a good fic I cannot remember).

So I think at least Benefits of the Old Laws will be looked at.

Hmm...I saw one recently where Harry and Voldemort accidentally swapped bodies when Voldemort's possession went wrong at the end of Order of the Phoenix.

It had Voldemort thinking clearer than ever before, and using his time as Harry to learn about the Order and Harry's friends and such, while Harry (and Snape) struggled with Voldemort's body being loaded to the brim with dark magic, corrupting his emotions to the point that he killed Bellatrix Lestrange almost immediately (not that that takes much corruption) and killed a house-elf to cast a very special torture spell on Lucius Malfoy...[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5118649/1/Becoming][Oh, yeah, I think it's this one.]]

****** ...Mm, another thing; a while back I came up with the concept of a goodish Tom Marvolo Riddle coming back in time to destroy muggles, on account of their destroying magic in the future.

In that concept, 'Voldemort' is actually a powerful demon summoned by this Riddle to destroy the muggles before they can destroy wizardkind; the Horcruxes are still Riddle's soul shards, but they serve to anchor the demon in the mortal world via its summoner's soul rather than extending Riddle's own life.

So yeah, you could have something like that; an inconsistent Voldemort who's inconsistent, because they literally aren't the same person. If a regular Voldemort summoned a demon, but was replaced by it, that could explain a dramatic change in behavior.

** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Voldemort is very consistent in this fic. He is not a faceless evil villain like in canon and remains a cunning, smart (although still an amoral psycopath) leader/revolutionary throughout the story. He makes decisions that make sense and doesn't torture people needlessly for no reason (at least most of the time). Harry and him share a sort of friendship/mentor-reluctant student relationship while Harry is still technically entirely good and Voldemort is still more or less evil.

linkffn(9268425) has a competent Voldemort and competent (and intriguingly evil) Dumbledore, with some of the crazy stuff Voldemort did (or is said to have done) revealed as misinformation (according to Voldemort, at least). I don't remember if it explains away his actions in PS pre-resurrection, as it starts in the graveyard in GoF.
