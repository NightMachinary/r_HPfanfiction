A fic with Ginny stuck talking in snek and Harry has to translate for her


** That sounds actually extremely interesting, damn!

I wonder if she'd be able to write or if it would come out as parselscript? That would make things interesting. (I know it's fanon and I have a justification on why it exists in my head, so don't hurt me thanks)

*** I always wondered what people imagine parsEl script to look like. All I can picture is a snake dipped in ink instead of a quill. Seems a bit cruel and unusual to use a living writing instrument but wizards.

**** I imagine how a snake can write hehe, If parseltongue is the language spoken by snakes, then script should be language written by snakes.

Unless there's some magic on words written by that make them show up only to other humans who can speak parseltongue.

***** My justification basically boils down to "magic".

Words in the HP universe have might. Magic understands and interprets them. /Magic/ knows that "Sectumsempra" cuts a body open, Harry didn't know when he cast it - only Snape did.

Magic and language are deeply intertwined. In my mind it is thus able to manipulate the understanding of words. It's also able to interpret what's writen.

Basically whenever you convey /meaning/ in the form of language, and you invoke the "parselmagic" your magic automagically "translates" it. And so if you'd write it's actually magical, charmed text.

This is why you can't "learn" parseltongue, it's magic.

I think if I applied my canon to this, Ginny would probably be able to convey "yes" / "no", point at stuff and communicate non-verbally. However, spelling wouldn't work. Writing neither, because Magic would "helpfully" translate for her.
