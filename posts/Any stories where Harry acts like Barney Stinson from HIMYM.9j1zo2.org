I am not asking for just "Harry is awesome because he gets all the girls".

I am looking for elaborate and ridiculous plans, random diagrams (like the hot/crazy graph), jokes about well-made clothing (robe up!) or funny magical gadgets (eg a self-refilling cauldron filled with lube on Harry's nightstand).

Obviously no slash, please.

*** I wrote obviously because Barney is as straight as it gets. NPH is not Barney, even if both are awesome. I'm against slash in Harry Potter fics because I don't find the other male characters interesting.

**** I am also generally against slash, Harry does not seem at all inclined towards the same sex to me, and we lived inside his head. Other characters don't bother me as much, but I totally see what you mean about uninteresting male characters as far as Pairing goes.

***** I mean, there are the Weasleys, but they just feel very trope-y to me. Each has one quality, but other than that... Neville is the Mary Sue of Fanfics, and we've just run out of male characters.

Sure, you could go with a random background character, but there is even less on them than on the "second rate" women (Tonks, Fleur, Bellatrix, Luna, (Ginny)).
