When Lily potter died that night she used ancient magics long since lost to this world to save Harry she used the magic of the soul and sacrificed her humanity to save him. But in doing so she subjected herself to a fate many would argue is worse than death that of the chosen undead.

That's right she wakes up in a cell in the undead asylum hollowed and disoriented, but then remembers her life and most importantly Harry. So the story would follow her through the world of dark souls as she learns new magics and more uses of the magic she already knows before finally maybe 20-30 chapters in breaking the curse of the world and freeing the souls from the cycle and in doing so manages to be sent back to her original world as thanks from the gods of that world.

However upon arriving back home though centuries passed in the day world only a little more than a decade has passed in this one. She arrives during the summer between books 3-4 and sets things straight about Sirius and tears Dumbledore a new one before raising Harry and teaching him the magic she learned in the day world a.k.a. 'The power he knows not'.


** Or just imagine the protection manifests in the form of branding the poor boy with a Dark Sign or by giving him a shard of the Dark Soul.

1 yo and cursed to never be able to die already.
