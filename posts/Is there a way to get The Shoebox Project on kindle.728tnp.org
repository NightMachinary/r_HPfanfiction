I normally download my fics as mobi files (and sometimes pdfs if that doesn't work) but I haven't been able to find a way to do this with The Shoebox Project, any suggestions?

The original PDFs messed up some formatting whenever I downloaded them and the epubs available on the site were terrible (inline pictures are not idea for ebooks) so I sorted out an epub for myself that reads smoothly. It was easy enough to convert to Kindle format. I did actually have a tidied up PDF, too, but I seem to have misplaced that; will have to sort out a new one.

*** Damn, thanks a lot for this. I've been putting off reading this because it looked like a crap pile on my Kindle and I hadn't gotten around to fixing the formatting myself.

** Calibre. It's a free ebook converter. It has a couple annoying quirks but it does work pretty well.

** So what is this this fic about. Do post a short summary (spoil a bit too to get the point across).
