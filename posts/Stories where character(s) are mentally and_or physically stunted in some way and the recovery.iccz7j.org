And they recover, slowly over time. I'm a huge fan of hurt/comfort and/or angsty stories, I'm not overly a fan of character bashing, though.

I've been reading My Dark Protector by DebsTheSlytherinSnapefan and really enjoy how Albus Dumbledore and Severus Snape was written (not done with it, yet, though). The mental and physical abuse that a character goes through is brutal and not for the faint of heart, reading it has been difficult, but I've been enjoying the recovery aspect of it. That's the main thing I want, recovery of a character or characters after certain mental and/or physical problems has happened.

I've also been reading The Long Road by SinisterMe. It also has mental and physical issues of a person gaining slow recovery.

I love slow burns, stories that build up characters and the fighting of inner demons, and other similar issues/problems that authors tend to shy away from. As well as they write them interestingly or believably in some kind of aspects, instead of just pure shock (though you can argue some of those are just pure shock value).

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash/Threesomes and the like (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

Can be on any site, can be any length, can be older or newer, can be as canon or as AU as possible.

As I said, I would rather not have character bashings, if at all possible. Characters disliking certain things characters do in the story is one thing, but an author going out of their way to make the character evil when they aren't, is a no go.


** I am currently reading a fix that fits what you want perfectly. It's more of a mental recovery, but at the beginning it's physical.

  What's a girl to do when somewhere out there, there's a boy and every scar he gets appears on her body? When he's being abused? Hermione Granger, for one, is determined to find him and save him. Fourth Year. There's a big event at Hogwarts this year. The DOM is interested in the bonded. Darkness looms, old enemies return to haunt them and new foes make life more difficult.

#+begin_quote
  Harry rescues Draco from Azkaban, where he has been imprisoned for three years. Draco is not as Harry remembers: with no memory of who he was or how he came to be in Harry's care, Draco needs Harry's help if he is to have any hope of making a full recovery. But Harry has his own demons to fight and together with saving Draco, Harry must also discover a way to find himself.
