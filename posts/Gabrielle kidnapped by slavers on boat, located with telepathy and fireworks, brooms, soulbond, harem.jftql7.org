:END:
Harry gets a telepatic soul-bond with several girls - certainly Fleur and Gabrielle, possibly with Hermione, possibly with Tonks, possibly with others. Harry is the central hub of the bond.

I've forgotten many details and don't want to accidentally confuse with other fics.

Scene, just a small part of much longer fic:

Fleur is targeted during a shopping trip, but manages to resist. Gabrielle is however kidnapped and drugged. She wakes up on a boat. Kidnappers tells her veelas are very popular for brothels &c. Throgh the link Gabrielle tells Harry she's on a boat. Gabrielle hears fireworks, which helps identify harbour - possibly after one of Harry's girls suggest setting off fireworks in different harbours. Harry and Tonks use brooms and a sirene spell to identify the boat. Harry kicks ass. The boat with Gabrielle was in France.

It's possible Harry was also kidnapped and wakes up on different boat on his way to Voldemort. Nobody "hears" Gabrielle before he wakes.

  Harry helps Fleur in the second task of GOF and pays the price. HP/Fleur/Gabrielle/Hermione. A Veela bonding fic based on love. T Rated and it will stay that way. Thirteen year old Almost fourteen Gabrielle to start the story. Good Dumbledore.

***** Same actually. I was against it my first read through cause it just felt like fleur and gabrielle were just fodder to get harry and Hermione together. But while that is a little true it's still a good fic
