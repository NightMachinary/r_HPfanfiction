*** The only thing I can possibly interpret this as is Ginny dating other people while she is in love with Harry. It's not even a bad thing, but I really don't see anything else she did that could be considered questionable.

*** I was talking about the way she treated Fleur, Ron, Hermione and Zachariah Smith.

**** There was a fic... "A Difference in the Family: the Snape Chronicles" where Snape calls her out for smashing into Zacharias Smith at the end of the first Quidditch match saying that she could have really hurt him and complaining that Gryffindors tend to be such brutes. McGonagall is willing to let it go since Zacharias Smith was making nasty comments during the game but then all the other heads of the houses take Snape's side by saying that Lee Jordan used to do the same to the other teams during his time as a commentator. McGonagall then is forced to give Ginny detention afterwards. However it's a very small and insignificant scene in a very long fic.
