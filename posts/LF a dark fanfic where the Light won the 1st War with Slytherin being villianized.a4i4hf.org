So this fanfic has people saying that Slytherin people would be taken away. I remember that Draco was being sorted into Slytherin and then taken away because of his sorting. I think Harry was begging "not Slytherin"because of what happened to Draci but the hat put him there anyway. If anybody could find this fic, I'd be grateful.

  ONESHOT. AU. How could have Harry's sorting ceremony looked like if the first war against Voldemort went down a bit differently. Dark and disturbing.
