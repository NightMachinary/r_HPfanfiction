What the title says, preferably over 50k words.


** Personally I prefer to read slashfics. They are not only porn as many (main-)het-readers seem to think but most of the ones I read don't focus on the lgbt aspect (Harry simply is bi/gay and it's no big thing in those fics) but I think if you ask in [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]] you might find a few ppl who can help you to find more serious fics.

** There was a great ao3 fic with many lgbt and poc characters that were well written but I can't find it, think it was written by Maiasaura/Dinostuck. Can anyone find it?

** It is sad, but with all the amount of slash/femslah there is around, all that is I am afraid just for the smut reasons. I know about only one story which seems genuinely from somebody who actually knows what he/she is talking about, linkffn(12507814).
