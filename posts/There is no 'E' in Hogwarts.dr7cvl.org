*There is no E in Hogwarts.*

/or, What I did with my Sunday afternoon/

“I didn't think You Know Who would try this kind of thing,” said Harry, mournfully. “it's a bit lowly for him, don't you think?”

“No! It's bloody awful,” shot back Ron, “It's ground-on for thirty days and I'm hating it all. It was a horrid thing to inflict on Hogwarts. Flitwick works non-stop to halt it but so far to no avail; it's all a fiasco! Nothing will stop this attack on our school.”

For almost a month, thanks to You Know Who's vicious jinx, nobody in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry could apply a most common glyph to any oral communication. To pupils and staff, all magically bound to falling back on involuntary circumlocution, this was his most irritating act so far. Rupturing Salizar's old Basalisk cavity was nothing to this!

“You Know Who's jinx constrains us to only talk in /lipograms/.” This was from bushy-hair, Miss Know-it-All. “A lipogram is a writing drill. It's a form of unnatural phrasing. in which all utilization of a common part of articulation is forsworn. But it's not all bad, Ron! I think it's wrought an outstanding growth in your vocabulary and diction.”

“That's right, it's not all bad,” affirms Harry. “Our Potions instructor must now say /Harry/, which is brilliant as it obviously annoys him. Ron and I can still talk about Quidditch and can talk about it until doomsday. Staff can still say /Gryffindor/ and allot us two, four or six points, whilst Draco Malfoy must say /crypt occupants/ or /orphidians/ to talk about his lot. And his two oafish companions can hardly grunt now.”

“Nobody will spot any switch, not from that pair of gorillas.” said Ron.

“But that foul git Malfoy's autonym still has worth; anybody can still call him by it,” said Ron and Harry's brainy chum, grumblingly. “This jinx puts both my first and my last strictly off-limits. Now, nobody can call yours truly /anything/.”

“Parvati Patil still calls you things.” said Ron, in words almost too low to catch.

“But what is You-Know-Who trying to do?” said Harry, trying to stop a row from flaring up by shifting to a variant topic of discussion.

Actually, this conundrum had had Harry's mind in a fog for days. “It's purgatory for us. But what will it gain for him?”

“Dunno,” said Ron. “But you can't strictly call You-Know-Who a /rational/ individual, now can you? Any allusions in /Hogwarts a History/ to a historical situation similar to this?”

“You'd know if you look at it occasionally.”

“Why would I? Harry and I can just ask you.”

Harry was wishing Madam Hooch hadn't to put a stop to all Quidditch until You-Know-Who's jinx was bust. Any distraction from this squabbling pair was now vital for him

“Naturally any man is happy at a satisfactory culmination of his plans; You-Know-Who is not inimical to that” sang out Harry and Ron's bookish companion.

“Why did you sing that?” said Ron, quizzically.

“I must! Look at a list of synonyms for said. Out of a myriad, that horrid illicit sign is in all almost all; only about four don't contain it.”

Ron swaps looks with Harry, and sighs; it's all so awkward now.

“McGonagal and Flitwick must find a way to stop Tom's jinx soon,” thinks Harry. “I won't stand it if this is drawn-out for an additional month.”

*Postliminary addition:* /Thank you so much for both awards, unknown, kind individuals./

*Additional modification* Thank you again, kind anonymous individual.


** Brilliant. Totally Amazing. I cannot find words to impugn this work of art. Nor a particular glyph...

**** (Enjoyed the one-shot extremely! Write more!)

Meanwhile, the extraordinary Voldemort, emanating the excessive anger leaving cowering Death Eaters behind, exited the pearly estate, deeply troubled. 

The exemplary Voldemort expected some effects after stealing the necessary 'E' energy he wanted; even the exhausting process ensuring enough 'E's were infused each few syllables; yet even more extremely angering, the curse seemingly made even he, the elegant Voldemort, even inside the strongest Occlumency shields the globe's ever seen, feel compelled; maneuvered even when speculating, speaking extremely immature abberations each time he wished even speak the moniker he'd chosen. 

The Evil Voldemort expected the process ensuring the return (even when he somewhere, even yet, felt unnecessary) the tenuously termed state the parchment referred "sane". 

He expected something more concrete, needed even more when the measuring between Unforgivables he sent each minute/Death Eater seemed defunct, after he left the pearly estate, ensuring unnecessary deaths be lessened lest he get overly temperamental. 

The esteemed Voldemort grew less concerned the more he pondered, leaving the confined house after the state anger forced inside the extremely deadly caster seemed enough progress, yes?

***** Oh no, I already know how to do it. Just, why waste time staring at a thersaurus when you can just have a more efficient way of doing it.

I don't think everyone has a wide vocab as maybe hermione does. And no one really wants to bother reading a thearsaurus. So just think of a creative solution! There isn't really a point of doing this to hogwarts as there are far too many ways out of it. There's already a taboo on voldemort, no need to do that, and also, voldemort -> Voldamort!

** Harry can no longer cast a particular climactic foil to thwart his most assiduous of assailants! Just think: what if this Villainous Mr. Tom R. was flung backward from that famous hour of his final fight to a day at which point Harry (and company) was still a pupil of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry? To alacritously lob upon this particular boy - and, in addition, all in his vicinity similarly pursuant of graduation - a jinx which would instantly put a halt to a magical incantation which is famously utilized in tripping up homicidal maniacs by forcibly avulsing such criminals of a wand?

Post-script: Cannot compatriots of apt miss Gryffindor H.G. call this poor girl 'Maya'? Strict laws of pronunciation would affirm that 'Maya' is a sound which occurs smack-dab at midpoint in this Witch's four-portion autonym.

Maybe even invent a new sound to replace e,, and whenever they refer to e just refer to it as @ or something
