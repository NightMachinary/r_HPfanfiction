So, I'm basically looking for stories with Molly and Arthur, Fabian and Gideon, Albus and Gellert times, Bill, Charlie, Tonks or just anything like that, doesn't have to be those characters.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

It can also be way into the future, after the Next Gen as well.


** Starnlicht By Marquis Carabas is set in 1590's but has a tendency to name drop the ancestors of people you might know in the modern era.

#+begin_quote
  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12588405/1/]] is set in the far future and is good. It really doesn't get the attention it deserves.
