**** WBWL and Indy!Harry fics typically has worse opinions on James than on Lily. Usually she doesn't really feature in the fic at all, but that'd probably be your best bet if looking for strictly James bashing as a non-Snily fan.

(Note that there does exist a couple of WBWL Snily, but just avoid those).

As I actually like the ship, I'm unable to give you any recommendations for specific fics. Sorry.

** linkffn(Harry Potter Chosen of Darkness) James and the WBWL are bashed, Lily would have been smashed in another chapter or two. It's a bit deranged.

linkao3(Prince of Slytherin) Lily is okay; James is kind of an asshat.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harem and Wrong Boy-Who-Got-Lucky-And-Lived. Abandoned by his own flesh and blood in an abusive home, Harry will forsake the light and delve into the warm and protecting embrace of Darkness. Warnings inside, though there will be lots of bashing and many OCs.

** Yup. There's some serious bashing of James in the one I'm gonna recommend. It's a really good one which truly develops and fleshes out known characters from the books (aka Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, Frank Longbottom, Alice Longbottom, and Peter Pettigrew. They also give Regulus Black a really good redemption). Make sure to read "Forgive Me" first.

  For Severus Snape, it is the Afterlife. He reflects on his life, corrects false assumptions, and comments on his regret over calling Lily Evans a Mudblood. This is the prologue to my next project, but this story also stands as a ONESHOT. Post DH.

** In linkffn(The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin356), they both come under fire, but Lily is portrayed as a more sympathetic character than James.

I also remember reading a story in which Lily was upset because James was more-or-less giving the Potter fortune to Dumbledore to fund the Order of the Phoenix. I don't remember if she left him, or the title of the story, unfortunately.

  AU from year five onwards. At the end of year six Harry finds himself once again isolated and prisoned at the Dursleys. The end of Book six never happened in this tale. Dumbledore has plans that include Harry, but not the way Harry thinks.

** You'll find these sometimes in the WBWL trope. One of these is the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/863648][Sarcasm and Slytherin series]] by sunmoonandstars (now orphaned/abandoned halfway through the 5th year fic), in which Lily isn't bashed because she didn't survive the attack.

Also often found in time-travel fics, because school-age James is canonically a jerk. One I read recently was The Scars of Time ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7007114/1/][Les Cicatrices du Temps]]) by ellana-san. I will warn you that it was written in French, and Google Translate is absolutely *horrid,* especially when it comes to male vs female pronouns.
