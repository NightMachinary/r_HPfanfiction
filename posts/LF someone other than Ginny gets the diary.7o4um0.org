Inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/7o3du5/lucius_isnt_able_to_give_tom_riddles_diary_to][this]] post at [[/r/harrypotter]], are there any fics you'd recommend where Draco or someone else gets the diary?

I'm okay with most pairings except child character/adult character (ex: Hermione/Snape). Slash is fine, though a gen, no pairings story is even better.


** Luna also gets the diary in this one, however it is centered entirely around her conversations with Diary Tom. linkffn(12407442)

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly looses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
