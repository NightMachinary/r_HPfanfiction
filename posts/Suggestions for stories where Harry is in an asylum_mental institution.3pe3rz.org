Just finished Oscillate Wildly and found it to be great. Any others in that genre / setting?


** There was one where he "woke up" and discovered that his entire experience at Hogwarts was a delusion created due to the extreme abuse he suffered as a child. Hermione Granger was his doctor and Ronald Weasley was a janitor - two people he saw in reality on a daily basis and ended up incorporating into his delusion.

The saddest thing was probably the fact that once having woken up, he was facing entering society as an adult with no real education or skills, just memories of a fantasy his mind created to escape reality.

**** I'm sorry, but I honestly can't find it - and I've done dozens of searches with all kinds of different combinations of words. Even if I'm misremembering some of the details, Ron as a kindly janitor and Hermione as the doctor who was treating him (I think she actually did her training on him, starting as an intern, which meant that she worked with him for a long time) are things I'm certain of.

I'm rather hoping that someone else recognizes the plot and can remember the name.

  This is a series of oneshots that involve Harry believing that everyone in the 'magical' world is insane. Starts with Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall getting Harry, instead of Hagrid, and goes from there. Involves much sarcasm from Harry. Books 1-7 - Year 7 starts

** One that I really enjoy is linkffn(2196609)

It's called An Aunt's Love and portrays a Harry that isn't crazy but needs help dealing with the trauma of attending Hogwarts. Petunia is portrayed in a better light than usual in this one.
