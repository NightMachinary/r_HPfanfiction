I remember that it was an one-shot where Harry and Voldemort were the only living beings and both were immortal, it kind of said it was the muggle's fault. They reconstruct Hogwarts as an enormous library and while Voldemort tries to find a way of travel to another planet Harry works on creating a way to travel back in time. I would also welcome any other story's with this basic plot-line but longer if you know any.


** I don't have the link rn, but Full Circle is a great read (and fairly popular) and falls under a vaguely similar premise

** Appears to be abandoned but linkffn(I'm Still Here) has Harry and Voldemort as the last two standing before Volde does a ritual to leave the dying world and Harry follows him.

#+begin_quote
  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.
