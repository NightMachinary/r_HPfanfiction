I'm not sure if that's the plural for hiatus, but whatever.

The author of linkffn(A Cadmean Victory) just apologized for having a two day hiatus in his/her otherwise nearly perfect /every day/ posting schedule. It made me think of some of the more agonizing ones I've had to sit through, or the ones that simply never end, and just laughed my ass off.

That's not even considering the waits in other mediums (Venture Brothers anyone?) or even actual novels (Game of Thrones is a joke at this point).

So never fear DarknessEnthroned, I'll forgive your two day hiatus....this time.

** Hiatuses are part of why it's extremely rare for me to intentionally read something that's in progress. I follow a couple of my favorite authors on Tumblr, one of whom has like three stories in progress. But she lets us know what hey plans are regarding updates, and if she needs time to cool off. I love that, I wish more authors had that kind of communication with their readers. I like knowing what's going on and knowing that the author whose work I'm enjoying isn't like dead or something.

** Never understood the obsession with completed fics, myself. All my favourite fics are incomplete. Most fanfiction isn't about telling a story in the normal sense, it's more about exploring and playing with ideas (aka plot bunnies). Very few fanfics have any real /plot/ such that a lack of an ending leaves you unsatisfied.

*** Then I'm afraid your definition of a good fanfiction differs considerably with most people's. I have read two incomplete fics, and those only by accident because I was new to FF and didn't even know of the "Complete" tag, and by the time I learnt about it I was too far into Nightmares Past to give it up.

Some fanfiction is about experimenting with plot, going "Oh this would be cool", but by far the fanfiction I enjoy most goes the whole way. Those who claim it's about the journey still end up at their destination, I've found. I wouldn't ever recommend an incomplete fanfic without putting intense stress on the "incomplete" part.

Some of the greatest travesties of the fanfiction world are otherwise brilliant stories abandoned near the point of their climax by their authors. It's a horrible feeling, to me, leaving something unfinished.

**** I honestly can't think of a single complete, novel-length, good HP fanfic that had a satisfying ending.

Most of them end with a puff rather than a bang, just announcing a conclusion that had been forgone since much earlier in the story (often right from the start).

Others take the "rocks fall, everyone dies" approach.

Others just fall a bit flat, with the drama of the conclusion not matching the level of build up.

The closest is probably the ending to the Denarian Trilogy, but even that left me feeling a bit "meh". By the time we got to the final fight, Harry had been through so many villains who were each advertised as the most epicly dangerous villain since sliced bread that the power inflation was eye-roll inducing.

Timely Errors, perhaps? I remember being vaguely happy with it, but I actually can't remember much about it at all, which doesn't bode well.

Black Comedy is a contender, but is probably too crackish to be satisfying. Same with Seventh Horcrux. If the story is too silly you can't invest emotionally, which means no real catharsis.

Stranger in an Unholy Land would have been a satisfying ending, but the sequel undermined a lot of the achievements of the first volume, retroactively souring the ending.

*********** Yes, and /very much so/. The thing is, even if they haven't been finished, they're no less /enjoyable/ to read. I would say some of those incomplete fics are some of the most intriguing and best fics I have ever read. When I read a fic, the pleasure does not come from finishing it - rather, it comes from reading what is happening /right now/, regardless of if it's been completed or not.

Edit: I think linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2740505/1/Wit-of-the-Raven]]) is a /perfect/ example for this.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding.

***** While a lot of my favorite fic are indeed incomplete I have to say that a story by its definition has an ending and when a story is a good one the ending is just the wrapping around the package.\\
On top of my head I can think of "Unatoned" by SeriousScribble, the ending of the story brought a kind of twisted poetic justice that made me cackle in glee.

It's probably a matter of taste, but I think all of Inverarity's work would be an exception, as would Voice of the Nephilim's. Your own /Alexandra Potter/ story ends well. For its genre (Harry/Ginny action/fluff) sib's /Awakening Power/ ends decently. Also enembee's /Conlaod's Song/.

****** I can think of at least a handful of self contained fics with satisafctory ending. The fics that aim to have epic scopes generally underwhelm at the end.

Two exceptions would be /After the End/ and /Hogwarts Houses Divided/, both of which end with amazingly written battle scenes. After the End, especially, had been built up for 600k+ and the ending delivered magnificently.

Backwards With Purpose I ends on a somewhat satisfactory note, even if it leaves many questions unanswered for the sequel.

Mattsilver's /Incorruptible/, maybe? It's been a while since I read it, but I think I was satisfied with the ending.

Cygnus Crux's Existence after Life ended ok-ishly.

Among the more self contained works, The Unforgiving Minute has an excellent ending. Unatoned ends just as well as could have expected. A Call to Arms, Fool Me Twice, Magic Within Magic Without, Back to the Garden, The Golden Age, Seventh Horcrux (which [[/u/Taure]] mentioned) -- all of them end rather well.

But, yeah. Satisfactory endings are the exception rather than the rule.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.
