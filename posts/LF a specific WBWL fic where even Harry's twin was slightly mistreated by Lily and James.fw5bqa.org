:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
the fic pointed out that often Lily and James were too busy for even the twin and he had to spend a lot of time with the Weasleys, I think Molly Weasley was yelling at the Potter parents about it at some point. It's not Sarcasm and Slytherins, Antithesis, or POS, although I thought it might be one of those three. I'm not sure if it was a oneshot or a multichapter fic.

Edit: thanks everybody! I'm pretty sure the fic is “You Get What You Give” (linked below), turns out i got the gender of the twins wrong ...

** I know of one where both twins are girls, and the WGWL was spoiled and emotionally manipulated by Lily and James? She also hung out at the Weasley's, and eventually managed to get custody transferred from her parents to Molly.
