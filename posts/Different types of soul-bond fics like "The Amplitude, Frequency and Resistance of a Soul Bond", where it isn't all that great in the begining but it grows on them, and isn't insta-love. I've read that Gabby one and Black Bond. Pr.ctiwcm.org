The Bonds of Blood - Harry/Ginny fic that definitely has the "not all that great in the beginning but it grows on them"

linkffn(5435295)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dimensions of the Soul - is another H/G soul bond fic. Though it's been a long while since I've read this one so I don't remember anything about it.

linkffn(12380101)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Soul Scars - is definitely a unique take on a soul bond.

linkffn(Soul Scars by Rtnwriter)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Accidental Bond - Not exactly a soul bond, and it does include Hr, but it is an interesting idea none the less.

**** I really wanted to like Soul Scars, but damn, that author has a thing for only women being in relationships together. It's pretty obvious Harry is in that story just to have a reason for the three girls to be intimate together. He referrences multiple times that they don't want to do anything(the girls) without Harry, because they feel like that's cheating, and then they all spend the next 20 chapters getting more and more intimate without him. There was even a whole arc about Daphne being sold by her dad if Harry didn't send a contract for her, when the Goblins pointed out multiple times that he was (by magic and law) already betrothed to all three of them.

** One of the oldest complete ones, started back in 2006.

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=11833][Meaning of One, Part One: Stone and Fire]]

And it's Sequel started in 2007.

[[http://siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=126789][Meaning of One, Part Two: Chambers and Secrets]]

The premise is that Harry and Ginny were deliberately created by an outside force to be lesser as individuals, but once their souls come together, are greater than any living person could survive. They essentially become one person in two bodies. After their souls merge, they still have individual personalities by virtue of their experiences prior to the merging, but afterwards any experience is shared; and if the duo encounters something that one of them has experienced, they will have the bias that the experienced one has.

The greatest part of this series was not any sort of power fantasy, but two pre-teens trying to find their place among their peers and Ginny's family when they are fundamentally different from them. Where most of the conflict is not by magic duels, but by trying to get their elders to accept that Harry/Ginny are who they are.

Honestly, it's my favorite soul-bond fanfiction of all time(among all fanfiction).

Unfortunately, despite the author's initial desire to go through the entire series, their motivation petered out in 2010, until they finally pushed through finishing Part two in 2013.

Part Two ended on a moderately satisfying conclusion, but the series is currently on indefinite hiatus.
