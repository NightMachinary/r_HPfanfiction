So, most arranged marriage or bonding fics result in the love between the two parties with a happily ever after - and i think thats bull. So are there any fics where they either marry and stay friends or even only acquaintances and have someone they actuallt love on the side so to speak? OR a fic were they successfully get out of such a contract by whatever means.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** There is fun linkffn(6443368) with 11 year old Harry working based on partial knowledge what "nuptial contract" means.

Also, old oneshots linkffn(5201691) and linkffn(2612901) with fairly short dismantling of contract stupidity.

** I like this request. I only know two that might fit this:

Sad angsty Snape Tale, short fic: linkffn(5886102)

Canon through OoTP only but I find this the most interesting Hermione/Snape, and in my opinion really well-written. but the characters are taken liberties with. Snape is a complete dick still, which is appropriate. [[http://www.mirrordance.net/aashby/bnw/ChaosIndex.htm][Chaos is Come Again]]

Edit: Oh and this one but I'm still reading it. It's pretty much what the description says, no one is down with Marriage Law fuckery in the wizarding world here. linkffn(10595005)

** I read a Harry/Ginny soul bond where Harry bitched about her cold feet and Molly had Ginny in a chastity belt. They were horrified about the mind meld thing.. but they ended up in love .. It was a good story iirc, no idea what the name was..

I've always thought the Trio had a near enough version of this. Anyone else would forever on the outside. Read one where the Trio decided on a mutual hook up but.. not that big a fan of that visual. The married to separate people but still bound to one another would be an interesting twist.

**** I totally agree. I loved his other writings, so when I saw that he was starting a trilogy I thought I'd give it a chance. I read the summary and honestly wanted to hate it, but it was written so well. I probably won't read it again, but it was excellently done.
