Lately I've been noticing that I'll get about halfway through longer fics before I just stop caring enough about the story to continue. Usually those that aren't terrible, but aren't really amazing either. Maybe my standards of ‚Äúreadable fics‚Äù are just getting stricter, idk.

Anyone else have this issue? Thoughts on how to deal with it?


** I feel that. Except I tell myself I'll come back to it later, or in a couple days, but then I never do. And then I end up having like 300+ tabs open on my phone that I don't want to delete bc ‚Äúwhat if I want to finish reading them later?‚Äù

** Yes, I blame that on the lack of conciseness among fanfic writers. If you think about it the books are quite packed, but the least terse one is OOP and is quite frankly the hardest to re-read and even then it's not nearly as long-winded as most fanfictions are.

The other day I was reading a fic, don't remember the name, that was recommended here about the Potters surviving the attack but Harry being lost but then found in the streets by Sirius who brought him home. I think I was ten chapters in when I dropped because Harry was still not out of his fucking room and hadn't met his parents. Ten chapters.

*** My standard for this sort of thing is that every chapter must have /something/ related to the overall plot. It doesn't have to be the main focus, it can be a small thing or a Chekov's Gun that doesn't become important until later in the story, but /something./ In OOTP, for instance, the trip to the hospital seems like pure fluff, but then it turns out that the potted plant delivered to whats-his-face was actually a Devil's Snare, used as an assassination weapon to stop him from blabbing about Voldemort's plot regarding the Department of Mysteries. Suddenly that chapter now has some plot relevance. (On top of things like establishing that Arthur's on the mend and introducing us to Frank and Alice in person.)

*** This is my biggest reason to drop a fic. The number of fics that I've read that have Harry still being 11 after 100k words is crazy. Otherwise good authors just get stuck I guess.

**** Honestly yeah; this is my biggest thing too. If Harry is still in say first year after 15 chapters and the story is still basically a canon re-hash I tend to drop it.

There needs to be some kind of major change for that type of writing to be justified in my eyes. Major AU, time travel, different plot, different house sorting, etc. Just something to make it make sense.

** Same. It's definitely because I've been reading quality fics so my standards get higher and it leads to a positive feedback loop. I can't even touch fics with concepts that I'm interested in, like Harry getting Horcrux memories, because I open it up and see Lord Potter-Black.

** This has happened to me most recently with 'By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept.' It's an incredible story. Really well written, and I've been enjoying the focus on Petunia in a big way. A story of her finding out she's magic, leaving Vernon, becoming her own person. It has some incredible characters. Some awesome situations.

But. I'm 113 chapters in. 29 to go. And the pages, the situations, the /feel/ of the story... Well, it's all just blurring together, feeling the same. and I can't go any further.

** I find myself needing a certain emotional high, a particular stimulus that if a long fic doesn't hit often enough or at all then I will often drop and say I will come back without ever actually doing it. Longer fics especially have this problem because they can often have pacing issues which can exacerbate this.

*** I'm the same. I've been on a Stephen King high lately (read The Institute, Nightmares and Dreamscapes, The Eyes of the Dragon, Blaze, and Under the Dome in the past few months, and am now reading The Running Man), and because he's so good at writing, I can't but making comparisons to FanFiction and his stories. Of course, it's unfair and such comparisons are really meaningless considering how much experience Stephen King has, but my patience for FanFiction is considerably less than when I first started reading it back in 2015.

** It's rare I get to the end of a fic these days, even the ones recommended here as great. My standards absolutely have got stricter and what I might let slide for a few chapters winds me up further in.

I often find that lack of character development resulting in characters starting to feel flat, poor dialogue. Even when the plot is clearly structured if it seems to me that it should have been split into multiple fics each with a resolution then I just can't keep up with it anymore.

It's rare to find a fic that it well written throughout.

** This happens to me all the time. Mostly in series fics or long fics where I binge read a bunch and then just can't read anymore.

Most recently with The Pureblood Pretense... It's just so long and the chapters are so long. I did make it all the way to the fourth before it happened.

Only it's genuinely good. So, doesn't really fit with the 'passable' fics theme.

** I'll go read Reddit or watch pointless YouTube videos for fifteen minutes before I go back to reading a fic. The criteria I have for abandoning a fic is usually 1) horrible and repetitive grammar/spelling 2) can't keep it's own history straight. And for crossovers 3) a rehash of the original plot with no deviation except introducing a new character or ten who never do anything.

Of the hundreds of fics I've read, I think I've abandoned less than half a dozen. I try to be forgiving with spelling and grammar errors, especially when the sentence structure makes it obvious the author is not a native enhlish speaker. I've tried to learn a second language several times in my life, it is fucking hard to reprogram your brain into accepting a new language, the fact that English is one of (if not THE) hardest languages means I cut ESL authors a lot of slack. However, I still wish they would get native speakers to Beta.

Ignoring your own stories' history however is something that I cut almost no slack on.

** Happens to me, particularly coming back in the morning or after a new chapter's been posted for the first time in weeks and going "wait, why was I so into this?". I deal with it by not continuing to read a story that I'm clearly not really enjoying, though sometimes I'll come back to poke at the in-progress version when it's got more chapters posted.
