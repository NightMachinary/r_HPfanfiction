After Fred's death, George tries to rediscover meaning in his life, which ends up with him becoming an assassin/mercenary. In just a few years, his name becomes feared throughout the muggle and wizarding worlds -- (most of) his family is clueless.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

Though personally I'm rather more fond of the image of an adult George with a [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6b/Seter_irlandzki_profil_5o899.jpg/800px-Seter_irlandzki_profil_5o899.jpg][*red Irish Setter*]] or [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Bojars%27s_english_cocker_spaniel.jpg][*cocker spaniel*]] named Fred

** I didn't know I needed this until I read your post, and now I can't stop thinking about somebody like Theodore Nott or Blaise Zabini as the Dad Mafia guy, and like, Kingsley Shacklebolt as the guy who runs the guild, or whatever it was called, in John Wick 2. My mind is racing and this could be totally frickin epic...

*** I may make a one shot of something similar to this.

I could just replace all the John wick characters with potter verse ones.

I'll post a link if I do.

BTW just saw John Wick 3.... Pretty good.
