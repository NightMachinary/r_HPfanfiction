I read a version/fanfic of the battle of troy years ago where Cassandra was cursed as normal, however, her Father had made careful notes of what she said over the years. While he couldn't overcome the god given curse in her presence, once he left he was now able to overcome it and act on the things she said.

In order to keep Harry humble, Dumbledore used the same curse though targetted to make people perceive him as spoiled, arrogant, insulting, and entitled on Harry before he dropped him off at the Dursleys. As with the above, this only applies while in his presence.


** This seems like a standard set up for Angry!Pissed Off!Grey!Harry whose only friends are a mix of Hermione,Daphne,Susan and/or Luna but I think it could it could also be a good basis for a touching story about everyone seeing the sweet person Harry really is
