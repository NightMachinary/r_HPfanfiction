:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was quite heavily ghost-oriented, with cases of possession around Hogwarts IIRC

Plot stuff I remember:

- Hogwarts gets trapped in some time-thing that slows down time inside it

- Dumbledore gets trapped on his way to the Ministry, and remains in the trap for most of the fic

- Dumbledore throws a variety of bowling balls at Voldemort, each having an unique magical effect

- At the end Hagrid attacks Voldemort while riding on Norbert(a) using a magical minigun mounted on Norberta's back?

Feels like the title's at the tip of my tongue, but I just can't find the fic.
