Voldemort takes over Harry's body somehow, but it has unforseen consequences.

For some reason, Harry doesn't die from this, but is locked in his mind, able to converse with Voldemort, yet unable to control his own body. Voldemort can feel emotions. The hallows could be gone, leaving them both, mortal and dying together.

This ultimately leads to Voldemort taking charge of the Ministry as a Good guy when he "grows up", with Harry still locked away in his mind and Hermione/or someone else as his wife, because Voldemort, through Harry's possible whole soul, became empathic and fell in love

This was origanally inspired by Easier-than-Falling-Asleep on ff net, but Voldemort is removed after a few months, but I would just love to see what would happen if he wasn't removed.


** That's what [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106), is all about. Even though he's convinced he's Voldemort, he's nowhere near as evil. He doesn't get together with Hermione either, but sees her more as his 'successor':

  She stared up at the professors with big, innocent eyes. I grinned. Not only was Ms. Granger clever, but she was apparently an adept liar and surprisingly loyal, considering our previous lack of a relationship. If she was as talented at dueling as she was the simpler magics, she would resemble a younger, saner Bellatrix. As we hurried to our dormitory -- dismissed by the professors -- I seized the chance to recruit a new minion.

  "Hermione," I said sweetly, "Do you want to be friends?"

  Merlin bless the simple interactions of children.

  Upon closer observation, I had cast aside my early assumption that Hermione was this generation's Bellatrix. Her obsession with rules, goody-two-shoes personality, intelligence, and hidden cruelty were far more reminiscent of my younger self.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

** So just so I understand: condemn Harry to the very worst kind of prison, only being able to mentally interact with a murderous psychopath who killed his parents, takes over his life and pretends to be him. Unable to do anything, but watch as his body is being used by another like a peace of clothing?

And somehow call this a happy story, because the parasite infesting him "fell in love"?

Sounds interesting - bring it on!

  After growing concerned about some of his political decisions, Hermione decides to confront Minister for Magic Harry Potter, fifteen years after Voldemort's defeat. All she can hope is that she's overreacting, and that her worries are unfounded. Oneshot.
