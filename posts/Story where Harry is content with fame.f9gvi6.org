So many stories have Harry who complains about his fame and desire for normal life. However any story where Harry is okay with being famous, doesn't mind being known and recognized, heck maybe even enjoys it?

I don't mean where he struts around like peacock or is like Lockheart. Just a story where he doesn't complain about it constantly?

Please no mpreg/bashing/huge age difference


** Seconded.

** There's a few post war fics where he accepts that he's famous and always will be that I can't think of off the top of my head
