In it Harry has to fight off several other people for the position of the Head of House Black eventually it comes down to Draco and He. Harry is about to lose but then says that Draco isn't worthy of the soot because he doesn't follow the Black Fanily Motto which is basically Family First. Draco scoffs and says he will win and they test the family magic and Draco loses because he has already taken the dark Mark.

If anyone can find this fic or knows about it pls shoot me a message I read it a long time ago and it was fairly good and I'd like to read it again
