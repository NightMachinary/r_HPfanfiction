I really like Harry and Hermione in a sweet relationship. Breakfast In New York by Radaslab linkffn(5141159) or Coming Back by chem prof linkffn(7183939) I loved it when Harry and Hermione spend time together. I would like to read something about Harry and Hermione traveling together. It would even be better if they are on a honeymoon.
