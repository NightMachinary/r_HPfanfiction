looking for some good professor riddle ideas for a fanfic I'm planning to write! (preferably funny).


** Whatever you do, don't let him try to create spells from scratch just to show off to the students. The whole plot breaks down after that.

** I was just reading through the Methods of Humanity series by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/local_doom_void/pseuds/local_doom_void][local_doom_void]] which is about a retired Lord Voldemort who decides to take up teaching. It's well written and has some good ideas... I got a little disenchanted in some of the later episodes when Harry and Sirius both seem to completely forgive the Dark Lord for murdering Harry's parents.

I liked the part where Voldemort decided to have his NEWT students research how to really defeat and frighten dementors in order to keep them away from the school.

If he's teaching at the same time as Severus Snape is working at the school, that seems to be a good source of hijinks.

** What if he's not accustomed to teaching the younger years and actually has some difficulties? Understanding emotional children could be difficult for him. Patience could be difficult for him.

He's accustomed to explaining things to his Death Eaters (adults with an adult level of magic and adult understanding of things). He even enjoyed sometimes teaching them something.

It's not the same as teaching 11yo kids. Some of them would probably struggle even with his vocabulary. Riddle has to learn to keep it simple.

​

As for lessons ideas... Maybe he could teach them to think? Not only lectures about magical beasts and teaching spells but how to survive in battle. For example,

"Potter! You're surrounded by three people. What would you do?"

"Where are we?"

"In a living room. There are expansion charms, you have some space."

"How much time do I have? Do I have a wand in my hand?"

"Yes, you have already drawn it. Several seconds at most, your enemies have their wands as well and they're prepared to cast something"

"I would want to aim for the window to escape. Break it, disillusion charms as to not attract muggles and to hide. If I'm lucky, stick to the wall and climb. They would expect me to go to the ground and run so I could maybe climb higher..."

"But how would you first get to the window? You're surrounded."

"Silent Accio for their wands and run? Or overwhelm their senses somehow, with that sound charm we've learned recently."

"Interesting solution. Though you forgot to ask about anti-apparition wards. You could have simply apparated. Alright, let's imagine there are anti-apparition wards. What would you do, Nott?"

and so forth. Playing with scenarios, teaching them to think fast and to think of good solutions.

​

"... And what would you do, Potter?"\\
"I would summon several snakes, disillusion and silent them, and then tell them to do the job for me. Unpredictable and safe."

Someone groaned. "Again with snakes and parseltongue... You use them in every solution, Potter!"

Riddle smirked. "It's important to use all your abilities. Good that you've finally learned it, Potter."

** " He was /definitely/ her antisocial swot of a Defense Professor, " This is the best description of a Professor Riddle I've read.
