So I'm looking for a HP fanfic in which Harry Potter is a bit crazy and a bit dark. His"Friends" are Hermione, Daphne, Blaise and Millicent. I think he was raised by an assassin and could use guns and knives. He also taught DaDa a bit later, but he was so brutal that the boggart that was used in class transformier into him. I don't remember the Titel or the author anymore, so I hope you can help me. The length I think was max 50 chapter, but my memory is not the best.

Thank you in advance to anyone that can help me.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.

** Itachi, is that a baby?

I think that is the fic with most- if not all of the things you listed.
