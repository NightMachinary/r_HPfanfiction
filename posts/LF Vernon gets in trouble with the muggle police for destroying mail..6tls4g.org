  "Where's my letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through the door. "Who's writing to me?"

  "No one. It was addressed to you by mistake," said Uncle Vernon shortly. "I have burned it."

But isn't it illegal to destroy mail that doesn't belong to you? Even if it's mailed to you by mistake?

Looking for fics where Harry is a good little citizen and calls the police to tell them that his uncle destroyed some mail that didn't belong to him, plz.


** The police would just laugh. Unless it's some kind of certified legal notice, it's perfectly legal for a child's guardian to make decisions like that about unsolicited offers arriving through the mail.

**** If not, they are kidnappers and probably child slavers and a whole bunch of other things. So yes, mail destruction will be what Harry calls about.

***** I mean, in that kind of position someone would likely blame themselves for the abuse.
