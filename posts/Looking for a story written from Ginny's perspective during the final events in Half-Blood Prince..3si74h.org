Pretty straight forward. I'm not picky about rating as long as if it's canon and well written (obviously). I don't mind if it's a longer story about her 5th year, etc. Thanks!


** *Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince*, linkffn(5677867), is a well written Ginny POV of the final 2 books (plus a little OoTP and Epilogue).

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why. In-progress.
