** Linkffn(Shadow of Angmar). The gold standard of HP/LOTR crossovers. Slow, thoughtful, well written with an obvious love of the material.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** This one is more of a Middle Earth crossover with plenty of Silmarillon blending in. Casual LOTR readers or those who have only watched the movies will find themselves terribly confused given that the whole story is set centuries before LOTR.

***** 200k words in and the events of The Hobbit are in sight. As for his magic, Harry remains a immortal squib for quite some time. He never does regain his full power, whatever magic he does is closer to that of Gandalf. I will advice readers to get acquainted very well with the Tolkien verse via simpler fanfics before enjoying this epic.
