The first is Linkffn(You'll Be The Death of Me).

The second is Linkffn(Moments of Bliss).

I know that the stories themselves aren't similar (other than both being romances), but they are two of my favorites and I haven't been able to find much like them. So, if you have a story that has similar themes to either one, I'd love to read it. Thanks!

  AU. OC: Graces Malfoy, Draco's twin sister. Neville, with his usual bad luck, ends up partners with Graces Malfoy for Herbology, just after landing her father in Azkaban, after the Ministry ordeal. Will this partnership prove to be as awful as it sounds? 6th year. Rated M for sexual content.

  Remus Lupin is a man with a tragic past, one filled with pain, suffering and sorrow. But it is also a past filled with great adventure, true friendship and...love? Marauder's Era. Remus centric but loads of the Marauders. Mainly RLOC, with some JPLE.

** Can you explain what you liked about them. Like a specific plot point or what the themes were that you liked? It'd be easier to make recommendations that way.
