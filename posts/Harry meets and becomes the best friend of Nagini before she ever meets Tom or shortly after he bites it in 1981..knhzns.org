Although I'm not the biggest fan of the fantastic beasts series, I liked the fact they had Nagini as a human before she transformed completely. It's easy to see why she would bond with Tom if he was the first person she was able to talk to in years. Could even be after Tom is destroyed at the Potter house, and she bonds to Harry because he seems much nicer. If anyone deserves a huge snake as a bodyguard, its Harry.


** I'm just imagining Nagini moving in with the Dursleys and how much they would hate it, lol

** There was a trend for a while of writing Nagini as the snake that Harry freed at the zoo before first year, and in many of those fics he kept her and took her to Hogwarts with him. Not sure what tags to look for to find them now though, does anyone else remember those fics?

** There was a fic I read many moons ago that Harry had worn the basilisk after 2nd year around his neck, but I can't find it. I think Hermione wanted something similar to Harry's, too, but, guys, imagine a shrunken magical snake as your personal bodyguard - uh, yes please!

** Charred Paws and Heavy Coils on ao3 is kinda like this. A female Harry runs away from the Dursleys, her animagus is a wolf and she hides in a forest and it's within that forest she meets Nagini.

It's not completed, I read it such a long time ago but I thought it was kinda cute.
