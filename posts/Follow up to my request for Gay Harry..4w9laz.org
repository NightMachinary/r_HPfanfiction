:END:
Just wanted to first thank everyone for you suggestions I've enjoyed several of them, particularly Turn and An Unexpected Predicament. I also wanted to suggest the fic, A Lack of Colour, I ejnoyed it, it's a 4th year fic with Harry and Cedric that I thought was rather good. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859556/1/A-Lack-of-Color]]

What I know wanted to ask was for any Post Hogwarts fics with Charlie and Harry. They seem like similar people, great quidditch players, outdoorsy, adventurous, friends with Hagrid. I'd prefer Post Hogwarts given the 8 year age gap, or at least wait till Harry is in 6th/7th year.

Thank you.

P.S. I'd rather avoid MPreg if I can, please and thank you.


** I can't help with your actual request, but if you enjoyed Lack of Color you will probably love Aorist Subjunctive by Minisinoo. It's one of the best coming of age stories in the fandom.

That aside, i doubt scraping together the few little pieces of canon we have on Charlie would get you someone Harry is interested in. The only thing we really know about him is that he is /really/ obsessed with dragons and left Hogwarts after his 5th year to work with them. Harry dropped Care of magical Creatures on the first opportunity.. :)

** linkffn(4255820) Dragonfly is actually one of my favourite fics. The author has several other CW/HP fics as well.
