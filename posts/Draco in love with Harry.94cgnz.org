anyone know stories where Draco is in love with Harry and believes he is not reciprocated?

** I don't remember the name--- posting in case someone else remembers based on the description. It was a slow burn, almost canon fic from Draco's POV where he had a crush on Harry at Hogwarts, especially sweaty athlete Harry. But was too self loathing to admit it. But then one holiday they sit together at a meal and eat bacon sandwiches and share snarky humor and end up kind of making out . It was sweet and funny and light compared to so much fic so i remember it, even a few years later.

*** It sounds as horrible, corny and cliche as any other slash fic out there.

**** Couple questions:

Do you think any romance is horrible, corny and cliche, or is it only icky if it's slash?

Why would you click on this topic if you despise slash?

This one is really more of an observation. I don't think you can judge the quality of a piece of writing based on a plot summary. The plot isn't the point . Unless you are one of looking to scratch a specific itch (must be time travel Lupin / Luna romance , no Harry, over 300,000 words). In which case I don't know what to say to you.
