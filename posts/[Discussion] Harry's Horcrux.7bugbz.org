When writing Harry, his scar and the horcrux within are a pretty vital aspect of Harry's story. It is strongly hinted that upon the horcrux's end in the Deathly Hallows that Harry lost the ability to understand Parsletongue.

Does this hold for all you reader/writers? Do you include this trait in your stories and/or headcanon? Or do you like to believe that Harry's being a Parslemouth is in fact hereditary?


** Personally, I think the knowledge trickled down to Harry. I don't believe it'll be instinctive, as it once was. He understands parsletongue, and it would take a concerted effort on his behalf to re-assimilate it.

Compare it to tearing a ligament. You obviously know how to use the knee, but it takes a serious amount of work (physical therapy) to get the function of the knee back to its original point.

** /Cursed Child/ says unambiguously he kept the ability, and I don't like to go against canon, even when canon's a bit naff. Either way, it does seem to make sense for me that he'd retain it --- unlike Ginny who could only "speak" it because Diarymort was actively possessing her, Harry seems to be able to speak Parseltongue on his own volition, without /active/ interference from Scardemort himself; note how Harry gets no pain in his scar from speaking Parseltongue. I'd say the knowledge of Parseltongue "bled" into Harry's mind from Scardemort's, and the soul shard's ejection from Harry's scar and into limbo did nothing to erase what was already done.

*** Cursed Child is not canon for many readers, including me.

It also even goes against "Word of God" when JKR said it he couldn't do it anymore ([[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/a/27616][link]]) "and is very glad to do so".

So at best that is retconned. I personally think that he lost the ability - Voldemort had marked Harry so thoroughly by the end, that no magical abilities or even physical scars were needed anymore.

**** It is indeed a retcon, but while I understand why some people want to ignore it, that makes it Fanon Discontinuity. Properly speaking, it /is/ canon --- just a bit of canon some people choose to disregard.

As for your reasons for preferring a version where Harry lost it... if I understand correctly, you're making the argument that it's more /symbolically/ satisfying in your view, yes? What do you make of my argument for why the practical aspects of how it works would suggest otherwise?

Most of it is not written by JKR, and it really shows. Maybe I can accept is as 'extended universe', but as long as Rowling is alive what she writes counts more for me than something she 'approved', but that is personal preference of course.

#+begin_quote
  What do you make of my argument for why the practical aspects of how it works would suggest otherwise?
#+end_quote

Practically speaking, soul-magic seems to be a rather complicated thing, even in canon.

And sure, there are arguments like yours that it 'bled over' because there was no pain, but that is a dangerous assumption to make. If parseltongue can bleed over, can the secret of a Fidelus-charm bleed over? Where is the line?

The scar only ever hurt Harry when connecting to the "main" Voldemort, when there was a 'remote'-connection, and never simply from itself. So I assume the pain only really comes from the maindevort, and not from the part in Harry's body. Alternatively, maybe speaking with snakes indeed irritated him a little, but it was little compared to the constant /presence/ of Voldemort that he had for years and years.

I think this topic is a bit too complex to conclude it in either way without making huge assumptions about the magical system in Harry Potter.

I personally like to think that Harry was never a real, proper "Horcrux", but he had a soul-fragment of Voldemort inside him. It was not properly prepared, and implemented into the body of a growing boy. Harry's body and mind 'connected' in small parts with Voldemort's soul, in similar ways that it connected with Harry's, but since the fragment was so much smaller and not the original thing it had very limitedbody impact - only really the ability for parseltongue and the connection to Voldemort were really there.

Yes

That has never stopped Rowling either :>

But for the tl;dr of my answer above: There are not enough information in canon to really strongly suggest either way, so I chose the symbolically more satisfying way.

****** I see. You do make a sound argument. To me, it's just odd that Harry could somehow /forget a language/. Even if it didn't come to him as naturally because the active magical effect was gone, shouldn't he remember the words and gramar itself, from having actually used them in actual conversation before?

If it acts as a permanent, two-ways "translation spell" it makes sense he'd lose it because it would truly be a magical ability. However, I always took it as being magically innate, but in-and-on-its-own not supernatural, /knowledge/ of the language.

******* Well, to be fair, he could still speak it just like Ron had. The problem is understanding, since his ability may or may not have done all the linguistic heavy lifting for him and for him it felt like he was speaking English so we can't really say whether or not he actually spoke snake in his mind and him being a parselmouth translated it for his own understanding into English or if he spoke English in his mind and it translated his speech for the snake.

******** True. It /is/ all in the mechanics of how Parseltongue works. It could be anything from a two-way translation spell, to my usual interpretation that knowledge of the language is automatically etched into the Parselmouth's brain, as it were, and they develop a sort of "blind spot" comparable to a Confundus Charm that prevents them from noticing they've switched languages unless they actually focus on it.

** The diary horcrux was clearly capable of imparting the ability, otherwise Ginny would not have been able to open the Chamber of Secrets. While I think Ginny retaining the ability would be an interesting angle for a fanfiction, such a situation doesn't seem remotely canon-compliant. Thus once the horcrux was removed from Harry, I assume he lost the ability.

I also think Harry having it by bloodline is pretty far-fetched. Lily was muggle-born and James wasn't even hinted to have it, aside from it being heavily counter to his character. Even if the Potter bloodline is old and well-connected, the family's stance on blood purity would keep them from being a match for any of Slytherin's line.

Obviously it isn't impossible, but I think Harry being a Parselmouth post Deathly Hallows is extremely unintuitive.

** I think more important is the question of the nature of parsletongue, a blood magical trait. I think that the theory of magical resonnance by Horcrux is invalid. I think that Harry has the ability because he is very far related to Salasar Slytherin from his father side. Potters must have been of the Most Noble and Ancient House to have been married to Dorea Black. Futhermore, the Potters are descendant of Ignotus Peverell amd the Guant from Cadmus Peverell side, the Peverells related to Salasar Slytherin.

**** No. It's a common issue that plagues the fandom. Harry gets so many arbitrary power boosts that don't actually add to the story. Like, Harry is a metamorphmagus just so he can change his hair color, then never use it, or Harry becomes an animagus, just because the author things it's cool, or Harry gets some crazy custom wand with a dual core of basilisk and dementor blood, but precedes to do nothing special with it anyways.

I don't recall seeing one where a baby basilisk is used as a handy portable weapon, which is a shame. I suppose because a one-shot kill breaks a lot of plot tension. (There are plenty of fics where Harry decides to go on a murder spree).

** Him just loosing the trait seems ridiculous to me. Why would he be able to do that, but not retain /anything/ else of Voldemorts abilities or knowledge from the scar?

To me, you're going to have to either decide that the ability somehow got /transferred/ to Harry so he /keeps/ it, or he shouldn't have it in the first place. The idea that he looses it with the scar but the existence of the scar has literally no other real-world consequences for Harry just seems contrived to me.
