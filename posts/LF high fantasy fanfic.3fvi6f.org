One of the things that annoys me the most about searching for HP fanfic is trying to find fantasy stories--specifically "high fantasy" the likes of The Lord of the Rings.

I understand that Harry Potter itself is already a fantasy series, but it is more what I would consider to be "low fantasy" because it shows elements of the supernatural contrasting with a normal setting, that is to say the Muggle world. What annoys me about this is that throwing the "fantasy" filter on and looking for some fanfic leads to stories that are no more fantasy than canon, so the filter becomes basically a big waste of time.

In my time as a fanfiction reader, I've only come across three stories that fall somewhat in the category of what I would describe as high fantasy, and they are linkffn(Harry Potter and the World Beneath by Tellemicus Sundance), linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë by enembee) and linkffn(In Atlantean Caves by obstacle1). Ironically, none of those stories are tagged under fantasy and all three of them are unfinished and probably abandoned.

I know that I would have better luck if I looked at some crossover stories with Lord of the Rings, but I'm not interested in that, so if you know of any fic that could be described as high fantasy (I don't care by what means, be it AU, jumping to a different dimension, time travel to thousands of years in the past, etc), preferably finished, please let me know.


** Thank you! Someone else finally voices an opinion I also have. I would read any and all LotR crossovers to help but it was never as good as it could have been. For some reason, most LotR crossovers are slash, which I don't mind, but it kind of makes me not like the story as much. I look forward to seeing what people recommend in this thread.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

** I'm not sure if these meet your needs, but I enjoyed them and consider them more "fantasy" then most HP fanfics:

linkffn(7011387) Paths Cross By Mede is a very AU take on werewolves in HP-verse.

linkffn(5621051) Outcast's Alley by RhiannanT incorporates interesting magics including Unseelie Fae.

linka03(2141337) Gringott's Lesser-known Branch by Brennah_K has a really interesting goblin culture that would fit well in any fantasy world.

**** For what it's worth, later into the story of /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]]/ (W: 301,307; WiP) the narrative follows at least some characters who get sent into a D&D gameplay-setting-sorta universe. I don't think I can tell much more without spoiling the story, sorry.

There's also another one called /[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning][Mother of Learning]]/ (W: 279,202; WiP) [RPG-ish universe, [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GroundhogPeggySue][Groundhog Peggy Sue]]] which, even though is not a HP fanfic, may still prove enjoyable to you.

p.s. There's also one Buffy × Baldur's Gate crossover, but it's so out of relevance to your request that I'll dare not naming it here. : p
