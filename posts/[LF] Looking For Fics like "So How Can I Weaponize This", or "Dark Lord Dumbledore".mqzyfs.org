Basically, self-insert stories (canon or OC) where the main character become ridiculously powerful or wealthy, preferably having no moral boundaries. (example: putting a muggle billionaire under the imperius, then asking him to transfer a large amount of funds to a bank account)

** As we all know from /Worm/, moral boundaries are for weaklings.

**** Yes, but it's one of those rare long fics that is both complete and lacking in bloat, a rare and wonderful thing in my opinion.

A basic knowledge of Taylor's paranoid/morally flexible /Worm/ characterization is assumed, but any specific /Worm/ events or references are carefully explained. I can wholeheartedly recommend this after only getting 1/4th of the way through /Worm/, for example. It does, however, spoil the ending of /Worm/, if you care about that.

**** Not really, since "Taylor" is the fanon ultrawarrior a la Indy!Harry. I've heard the fic described as "a gun nut's home invasion fantasy," and my initial impression is exactly that. "Taylor" constantly ends up with justifications to respond with over-the-top violence, and the plot is a series of excuses to make those justifications.

Worm is a dark reconstruction of superhero novels, and Taylor is the protagonist who is the dictionary definition of "the road to hell is paved with good intentions". The fanon characterization turns her from a tragic character who relies on intense self-rationalizing into a champion of making the hard decisions and responding with far too much violence than is reasonable.

***** I don't mind over the top violence. In small doses it's even encouraged.

Guess I'll check what's all this about worm before reading it.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

  R.O.B was tired of reading about how Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was the greatest wizard of all time. He wanted to tear off the facade so that Dark Lord Dumbles is exposed for the villain he really is. To do so, he enlists the help of a like-minded geek and throws him into the body of baby Harry Potter when he was struck with the killing curse. Self Insert.
