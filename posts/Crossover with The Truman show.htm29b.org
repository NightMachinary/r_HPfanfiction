A fic in which every one else is a an actor. The magic is cgi The characters have scripts. Only Harry is real. His magic is stimulated with medication and special effects. Like a vent below him blowing hot air when he gets his wand like in the movie. Him getting drugged with something to make him tired and pass out when he does something major magically. ALL characters have to improv other than Harry reacting to him, but the Story plot remains the same. The entire world is watching him without his knowledge like in the Truman show.


** I just want to read the trauma that will come when he learns its all fake and the “ friends” he made were just acting and the dursleys were not even related to him. unless you make it so the only thing that was real about his life was the dursleys and they just hated harry for some other reason

** I've been playing with one in this vein. Harry was an orphan boy and the world is hanging on his every adventure as the abused child of the Dursley clan.

But then, the Actors playing the Dursleys was some time off from their roles of more than a decade to take other jobs, and the Chinese and Americans have both started their own versions of the story, cutting into the BBC's profits on the show.

The world-famous Producer/Director comes up with the 'Magical Boarding school' angle and casts himself as the Headmaster. Hermione and Ron are both youthful 16-year-olds playing 11 and are more interested in retaining the roles for the inevitable Movie version than getting along with Harry when not on camera.

The big drama of the first year will be the worldwide search for the actor to play Voldemort, and the letter-writing campaign to have the big bad be a woman.

Harry, being a bit of a dimwit, is going to actually have magic, because he was convinced that he did by the Hagrid character, causing the show to win multiple awards for special effects.

** Omg, that would be so fucking sad. Tom Riddle would be the producer (and Voldemort's actor) trying to keep him trapped, and only by defeating him would Harry be allowed out of his living nightmare. Because that's what it ended up being to Harry, a nightmare. He was emotionally abused for 10 years, then thrown into a world of "magic" that ended up being one trauma after another. Only to find out the one thing that kept him going (his loved ones), were all payed actors and not even real.

The slow realization that it was all fake would be triggered in his sixth year when he sees an extra that looks exactly like his "dead" godfather. They'd try to finish the script anyway, Harry being forced to play along on the slim chance this was actually real by raising the stakes.

More people keep dying, and when Harry "kills" Voldemort at the end; he sees him still breathing. So he walks over to the "body", and starts beating it. By the time the crew managed to pull him off, Tom Riddle is half dead and the world sees this 17 year old boy struggling in the hands of security dressed as Deatheaters hysterically sobbing and begging to be let go from his unending torture.

Of course this sparks huge controversy and eventually law enforcement gets involved, they get Harry Potter out of the set and into the real world.

Cue months of being treated in a psych ward, actors coming in to help him differentiate what was fake and what's real. Everyone got the cold shoulder, until his real parents were brought in. He nearly kills them when they were brought in, they were the ones that sold him into the circus into the first place.

The world sees the horror that was behind the cameras, and the mentally unstable teenager that was left behind.

** I think it would be even cooler if Harry is actually magical, but without anyone actually knowing that. Or that such a thing is possible.

Most of the things are special effects. Except in those rare occasions where the paperwork describing that effect was never found.

  Harry woke after the battle to the castle acting wierd. What in Merlin's name is going on? Is magic only in the movies? What really happened to Harry's parents? How will he get out of this mess? Took it out of crossover and just saying its similar to Truman.
