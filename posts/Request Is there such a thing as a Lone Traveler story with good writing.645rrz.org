Not to knock it for those who like 'em, I've slogged through a few myself, but they've all had a particular trademark writing style mostly consisting of Harry just saying how things will be and getting it. Out of all of these stories someone dedicated to realism and character development must have written one, right?

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.

** Forgive me if I am wrong here. You want to know if a fanfic by a particular writer whose writing style you don't enjoy .. is sometimes not that writing style? How would that work?

Or are you asking if someone else borrowed the idea?

Furthermore, there are a couple of Lone Traveler stories. Link the one you're discussing.

*** A number of writers have spun off the concept, though usually copying the writing style too.

** I've always been interested in the idea of a MoD dimension-hopping Harry too. As I've thought about writing one, though, I always come across the problem of the protagonist being too strong. Like, you'd have to either have have Harry use his really diverse power-set really foolishly, or make a plot that is pretty much solely contrived to give him a bad day in order to maintain conflict.

I've just started writing a fic that is a pokemon/ worm fusion and has Harry working in the background trying to solve the problems of the world. We'll see how that works out and if I can pull off a reveal that's satisfying rather than mystifying.

*** One solution to this is to have Harry get in his own way. Basically have Harry freshly arrive to a new dimension, misconstrue the situation and end up helping the bad guys for a time. By the time he starts figuring out what he's inadvertently been doing, he switches sides and needs to quickly make up for the huge advantage he gave the villains.
