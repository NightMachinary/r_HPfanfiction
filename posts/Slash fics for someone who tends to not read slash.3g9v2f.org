  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

*** My feeling with Irresistible Poison is that if you stop at Chapter 10, it's haunting and electric and beautiful. If you carry on to the end, it's mediocre. (It was the first fanfic I ever read, and was unfinished when I first read it. I thought Ch10 left it as a really lovely ambiguous ending. What came later didn't really fit, tonally, I think.)

Edit: If you like Irresistable Poison, you might try and get yourself a copy of Cassandra Claire's Draco Trilogy. It should be downloadable as a PDF somewhere, but it's not archived anywhere officially, as she's now Cassandra Clare and writing 'The Mortal Instruments'/Shadowhunter series. I'd describe it as slashy rather than slash. Super slow burn.

**** Hm, I'm not sure I agree with the chapter 10 for the ending. It's been a while since I read it last but after skimming through that chapter I feel like chapter 10 doesn't quite have a very fulfilling ending. Ambiguous, yes, but still questions left to be answered that would leave me really unsatisfied if left there. I do hear what you're saying about the tone changing at the end. It definitely does do that, but I feel like the ending provides the closure of all the ust that builds up over the course of the story. But then, I really do prefer happy, final endings. So it might just come down to a preference. :)

I personally didn't care for the Draco Trilogy too much. It was SO popular and I really did give it a good try. It wasn't holding my attention anymore by the end of the second book and then all of the drama about the plagiarism was the final straw for me. But for someone who is new to slash it would be a great place to start. It was definitely slashy, but as far as I know never fully slash. I do enjoy her original ya books though!

***** I really don't care for her original work and thought she was at her best when 60% Buffy quotes, so it's really a matter of taste.

Urgh. The plagiarism thing. Noooooooooo. I was always going "Look, loads of people use quotes, nobody cites them properly, just let it be," then they were all "It's huge sections from a book," which, yeah. Fair cop. That's super naughty. Those allegations have always been around though (it's the entire reason Schnoogle and Fiction Alley exist) and it was alway half legit with a reasonable portion of sour grapes, because, yes, it didn't deserve to be as popular as it was, but on the other hand, it was in the right place and the right time. CC had a very charismatic online presence, fandom was much more centralised and consequently she became a big deal, and everything to do with her became a big deal. And that just got tedious for everyone involved.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10502653/1/The-Bitter-Hug-of-Mortality][The Bitter Hug of Mortality]] is just interesting, though I don't think it's really gotten to any slash yet. Threadbare Threnody's stories will apparently eventually lead to slash and are very beautiful and very AU.
