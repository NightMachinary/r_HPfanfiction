So tired of reading WBWL stories where James and Lily are hateful or neglected towards Harry and any other child they have that's not the "Boy/Girl who Lived") It gets very annoying.

What would it be like if Harry was loved by his parents even if he wasn't thought of as the Boy Who Lived? I want to read that story!

Would rather NOT have Dumbledore/and or Weasley bashing, if we have to have bashing, let it be Dumbledore and NOT the Weasley's please (love that family)

Would rather NOT have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

Am FINE with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine.


** You've probably read it, but in case you haven't this one is a real treat and meets your criteria quite well.
