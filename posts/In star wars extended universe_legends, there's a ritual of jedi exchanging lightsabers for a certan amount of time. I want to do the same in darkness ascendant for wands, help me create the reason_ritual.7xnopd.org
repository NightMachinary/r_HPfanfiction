While i know another's wand won't be as affective, i'll ignore that or change it somehow for when they're swapped.


** Smear it with the other persons blood to get the wand to temporarily bend to another person's will. Because it's on the outside and not directly affecting the cores it would only work for a few hours.

How's that?

** /Why/ do you want this wand exchange ritual? Are you mirroring the /Concordance of Fealty/? What's the purpose?

** Maybe you could make a spell that makes the wand change allegiances for a time, otherwise the wand has to be won. Maybe the spell helps the wand realize it's owner is giving permission to be used by another person.

*** THAT WOULD MAKE SO MUCH SENSE, BECAUSE YES IN CANON THEY CONFUDED THE GOBLET OF FIRE!!! :) Which means you can confuse sentient objects! :)

** The Concordance of Fealty was the Jedi tradition of entrusting one's lightsaber to a fellow member of the Jedi Order. This exchange represented a serious, even sacred bond. The exchange represented the establishment of a reciprocal, master-less learning relationship.

Keep that in mind.

** [[https://www.pottermore.com/features/how-loyal-is-a-wand-to-a-wizard]]

Just read this and thought you might find it interesting, seems it can depend on the materials the wand is made from as to how it reacts to a new owner.

** It would be interesting if a person's wand acted as an extension of themself, and the ritual was for "corrupting" the person they gave it to. Think movie Crouch Jr, that muscle tic of his would show up on whoever he gave his wand to. Could originally have been created as a teamwork exercise that got out of hand.
