If not that, then any "SI-OC adopts Harry" is welcome


** Might be interested in my own linkffn(Why Time Travel Should Be Illegal and Other Morals). Pretty much exactly that happens. An SI and an OC adopt Harry at the age of 6. He ends up in Hufflepuff (eventually). Some people don't like that I include religious themes in the story.

**** [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] is devoutly religious, and his SI makes a point of raising Harry in the Church.

Given that a good chunk of the story is set in North America, this means attention to the Church in the United States, which is considerably more conservative than Western Europe.

I am honored to call [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] my brother in Christ.

***** I'll give it a chance, but honestly, I have a dislike for Christianity that mainly stems from going to a Christian school and being atheist

***** I have issues with faith in general, not just Christianity. Almost every religion has been subverted by the cult-minded, who used the existing faiths for their own gain, rather than creating cults of their own. Anything good in religion has been tainted with human greed and malice. To use Christianity as an example, we have evidence that many of the translations of the original hebrew texts that made up the bible were translated in such a way as to push an agenda, nevermind all the priests who have perverted its teachings for their own gain. You and Full-Paragon may have the most honest and wholesome intentions, but you've been part of a 2000+ year game of telephone and not everyone in the chain was playing fair.

A story set among a church community, about a person discovering their faith? Fine. That might even make for a quality story, and everyone is allowed their right to worship as they please. But injecting the faith into an existing work that didn't have strong religious themes before (excluding the Harry-is-Jesus allegory)? It feels like the author is trying to push their faith upon the readers, and that turns me off.

Thanks, but no thanks.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

  A freak train accident in the mundane world leads to myself being woken up at the Leaky Cauldron on the day Harry Potter became the Boy-who-lived. This story will go through what I would have done differently knowing what I know from the books and from fanfiction. Raising Harry, Self-Insert, Slight Dumbledore Bashing.
