Looking for fics where Harry is raised by his grandparents. I don't care whether they are Charlus and Dorea or Fleamont and Euphemia.

  Seven Year AU. Suppose the Dursleys had not been Harry's only living relations. How might the young hero that we know and adore have been changed by a loving childhood? The differences might not be as universally positive as one might think. Discontinued.

  It is said that as long Alessia's heirs bear the Amulet of Kings, then Tamriel shall be protected from Oblivion and the Empire will be prosperous. But the Amulet has been shattered, and an eternal barrier has been placed between Mundus and Oblivion. But even as an Emperor sits on it, the Ruby Throne waits for its true heirs to return. (Skyrim timeline; pre-GoF; AU and Timeline)
