Proof from canon that Ron is a terrible friend.

In Sorcerer's Stone, Ron talks mean about Hermione behind her back and makes her go cry in the bathroom.

Ron is an asshole to Hermione in Prisoner of Azkaban despite LITERALLY having NO right to be angry at or upset with her. He meanly shakes bedsheets in her face and yells at her in one of the most public settings of Hogwarts, the Gryffindor Common Room. He freezes her out of the food party in the Gryffindor Common Room after the Gryffindor-Ravenclaw Quidditch match. And he won't even listen to Hagrid when Hagrid gives Ron the correct perspective that Ron should value his friend more than rats. Ron LITERALLY had NO right to be angry at or upset with Hermione but took his own personal problems out on her. Hagrid's quote is spot on. Friends should ALWAYS be valued above pets without exception. Even minor level friendships such as Harry Potter and Katie Bell should be valued above pets. Hagrid was right on the money when he said Ron should value his friendship more than rats. Ron should've cared MUCH more about Hermione than about Scabbers.

Ron is inexcusably jealous of Harry's fame and attention despite knowing that that Harry doesn't like his fame and why. People like Hermione and Ginny understand and respect that Harry doesn't like his fame whereas Ron is a jealous glory hound. Ron never saw Harry as Harry, only ever as the Boy Who Lived. Ron only wanted to be Harry's friend in the first place because he had hoped being friends with the "Boy Who Lived" would bring him some deflected fame. And being overshadowed at home isn't an excuse. Ginny has the same number of siblings as Ron and having one more older sibling actually makes it harder for her to get attention at home than Ron. Yet, Ginny, like Hermione, is never jealous of Harry's fame and attention.

Ron BETRAYS Harry in Goblet of Fire after Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire. This was the time that proved that Hermione and not Ron is Harry's true bestie. Hermione's reaction to Harry's name coming out of the Goblet of Fire, especially her immediately believing Harry when he said he hadn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire, is the way any true or loyal friend with any ounce of faith or loyalty would have. After knowing Harry for three years plus, Ron and Hermione should understand that Harry would never have put his own name in the Goblet of Fire. There was no good reason for Ron to believe Harry had put his own name in the Goblet of Fire, yet because of petty jealousy he does and turns against Harry. This was the moment that proved Ron had no true loyalty to Harry and that Hermione was Harry's true BFF. Harry should NOT have forgiven Ron for this obvious betrayal.

On page 310 of Half Blood Prince, Luna says that Ron is unkind and that she had noticed that last year. So, Luna, who is new to the group, likes Harry but doesn't like Ron because Ron is unkind.

6.. Ron ABANDONS both Harry and Hermione during the horcrux hunt. Wearing and being influenced by the locket horcrux is NOT an excuse. Harry and Hermione both had to wear it as well. Yet, Ron runs out and abandons his friends when the going gets tough while Hermione stands by Harry all the way. Remember too that Ron was moody here even when he had taken the horcrux off. Abandoning both Harry and Hermione during their darkest days was the ultimate. It was the moment that made Ron 1000% unredeemable. Ron was a fair weather friend who left Harry and Hermione at their darkest time.

How is this proof that Ron is a bad friend? They weren't friends yet at this point.

In fact, most of your points have nothing to do with showing that he's a bad friend are are just there to prove that he's an asshole. No shit he's an asshole, he's a teenager, they're all assholes.

***** you need to reread the books. Imagine being constantly corrected by someone your not friends with and you don't know For over a month.

in the first few chapters every time we meet Hermione she is constantly being bossy towards Ron and harry and being extremely nosy.

we as adults understand she is a lonely child who wants to make friends but sucks at it.

but lets make the same situation as adults would you not find it incredible frustrating that some person your going to uni with and you barely know is constantly butting into your private business and constantly correcting your class work without even asking you.

** Hermione don't have a reason to be jealous of ron as she was well off in the money department and never had to suffer. Ginny were the special one of the Weasley'S so they tried to get her something that is good enough. Ron had a second hand wand and instead of getting his wand replaced it took the Weasleys a year. Also you had to realise ron did not walk out of his free will, Harry told him to leave in the argument. Which shows that Harry has also been affected terribly by the hocurox also the fact ron was injured left him in a more vulnerable state

** I agree with all these points.

And my argument is, Ron is a bloke. And I haven't met all blokes but I have met a large chunk of british lads in a mixed school aged 11-15 and I can confirm, 98% of them are fucking morons.

Harry is also a self entitled little prick for most of the series. None of them know how to communicate. They're british blokes they're all goddam idiots.

Quite honestly Ron is the most realistic character out of the whole series for all the point you made. Because boys age 11-15 don't think. Especially not boys who grew up the youngest in a house full of boys who can't have gotten out to socialise that much.

** I agree with all except the pet. First of all pets ARE family, and should be treated as such. Ron had good reason to believe that scabbers was killed by crookshanks, as they had both seen crookshanks go after scabbers. So really Hermione was choosing her New pet over Ron and Ron's pet that has been in his family for years.

*** Exactly! I could not even keep reading after that idiotic bit about friends over pets. If anyone hurts my pets, I will kick them out so fast they'll see stars. /Real/ friends care about the ones you care about.

******* people say ron is rude for snapping at her in the first book.

but honestly who the hell wouldnt snap at someone they are not friends with constantly butting in on them and then correcting them.

I actually enjoy asshole charcters because most stories go yeah he is an asshole. but with hermione all her asshole actions tend to get swept away.

oh hermione was a prick about scabbers its alright scabbers was a dude. hermione was a prick about lavender its okay ron broke up with her.

I do not hate Hermione as a character, but the story never really brought up her flaws and had her confront them in the way other characters did.
