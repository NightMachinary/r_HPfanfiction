Im looking for a fem harry Potter fanfic,where she is The dark lords aprintence. I read one years ago but I cant remeber the name. I remeber that we have fem harry Potter becoming the aprintence of the dark lord. She kills Cedric to prove herself. Im not a 100 procent sure of this but I think that she somehow ends up torturing a slitherin girl at some point. Im hoping someone can help me.


** I think you mean my old fic "The Dark Lady"? I had to take all my fics down from my old account on FFN and started re-uploading a couple of my fics on my new account (StellaStarMagic on both AO3 and FFN). If you can PM me your email I can send you "The Dark Lady" that way.
