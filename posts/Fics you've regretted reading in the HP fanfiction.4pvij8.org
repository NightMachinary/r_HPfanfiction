** linkffn(To Fight The Coming Darkness by jbern)

It started off okay, and about halfway through everything went to shit. Neville's vampire ancestor manipulated him into enslaving Pansy Parkinson, forcing her to spy for him as well as blow him(Ginny walks on the act and reacts as expected, causing Neville to order Pansy to stop her. Pansy ends up hitting Ginny with piercing hexes and a bone crushing curse, sending her flying down a staircase to her death) and slaughtering tons of Slytherin students in their common room. At least 10 characters died with zero impact or consequences within like 5 chapters.

** linkffn(Harry Potter, Wizarding Savior?):There was a shit ton of Dumbledore and Weasley bashing which I could overlook in a fic if it weren't for the fact that Harry was turned into a Gary-Stu and Daphne a Mary-Sue. Harry becomes all powerful, on par with Voldemort's magical ability at 16 and more powerful than Dumbledore. He has loads of money, political and magical power, a beautiful betrothed, popularity and intelligence. I mean, at least try to make him into something realistic. I kept reading, hoping it would get better, but it didn't. Thank god it was 'short' enough with only 21 chapters, but it was dreadful.

** Some fic where Harry is so upset at Dumbles, that he "marches up to him, and yanks him to his knees by his beard". THAT HAPPENED IN ONE I READ. I don't know why there are so many fics with this sort of occurrence. The adults, are "too stunned by the protagonists obviously superior and logical actions, that they can't respond". And the worst part is, many of them are fairly good up until that point. So I'm 30k words in, and have to abandon it.

I know some people don't really care about who an author is or what they do as long as the work they produce is good (Orson Scott Card is a great example of this) but I generally do. And wow. Also, the fic wasn't even that good. Honestly, it was just horrible. I was in a shittier place in my life when I read it so maybe that's how I excused it?

***** Oh boy. So much to sum up in a comment (especially typing it out on my phone...). Look up Abbey Willson's blog (kumquatwriter.wordpress.com) for her account of her time living with Andy and the cult he created. For a good overview of all things Andy, theteablogger.tumblr.com has a good timeline that covers all the major things. Another woman who was in one of cults wrote a book ("When a Fan Hits the Shit") but it's certainly biased and missing information which you can find all of and more online.

Biggest points: charity fraud; created(is still creating) cult(s); "channeled" fictional characters including but not limited to Frodo Baggins, Orlando Bloom, and a whole host of OCs from the 1940s; compulsive liar including fun things like faking an Irish accent or telling everyone his son was taken from him (his "son" was a pet sparrow...); basically integrates himself into fandom communities to prey on vulnerable women, and so much more. Honestly there are so many things all of which sound more unbelievable than the last, so I'm sure I've missed big things so check out either of these sources, but it's a WILD ride. Personally I just can't support something/someone that pulls in young and especially vulnerable fans and exposes them to someone with a proven history of abuse and manipulation.

*** THANK YOU. I so wanted to love this fic. The premise is A+ and I can get on board with going darker than a children's series wanted to go. But there is a difference between "more mature/adult than the series; swearing and sex and descriptions of violence" and gore porn, which DAYD and especially Slaugh tipped into. Plus the characterisation of the female characters is... kinda gross.

And it pisses me off that anyone else who tackles the DH year from the Hogwarts perspective is compared to DAYD, usually unfavourably.

Plus, well... I was around for the Victoria Bitter days. So, there's that.

** /Black Sky/ by Umei no Mai, a HP+KHR crossover featuring fem!Harry/Xanxus.

Whoo, boy. I'm not even going to start on what a huge disappointment that fic was. Let's put it this way: I /rarely/ leave fic authors negative reviews. If I come across a fic I end up disliking, I simply flounce and look for something else. No point in wasting my time writing something that the author will either ignore or get pissed at, right? Well, after reading /Black Sky/ I ended up writing an incredibly long review detailing almost everything I found wrong with the fic (I actually just hunted down the review and cringed my way through it--the whole thing was shamefully blunt). I honestly couldn't help it--I was just so goddamn frustrated by the story, not to mention disappointed. It started out so /well/, and then it plummeted faster than a hijacked plane. What's worse is that I forced myself through 62 friggin' chapters because I still had hope that the author would turn things around, but she didn't, and the story just kept getting worse and worse.

I don't often regret reading fics since I'm the type of reader who can usually determine whether or not I'll like a fic from the first few chapters, but that fic screwed with me. 62 chapters, and all of it a huge waste of my time. I still get a bad taste in my mouth when I think about that fic, haha.

This is all just my opinion, of course. The fic is listed first in the HP x KHR category (when filtered by reviews) and has a shit ton of faves, follows, and reviews, so clearly it's not an opinion shared by many.

The first HP+KHR crossover I read was cywscross' /Raison d'Etre/. I'd never no so much as seen an episode of KHR prior to that, but I was on a cywscross fic-binge and was desperate. That's the fic that sparked my interest in the series.

TBH, I still haven't seen more than a few episodes of KHR, but I'm at the point where I can speak to most fans about the series and still keep up.

Cywscross is scary.

Also, this totally got away from me. Sorry 'bout that.

** I'll nominate Dagger and Rose by Perspicacity.

It's good prose, interesting magic, good prose, reasonable characterization...and then it's slathered with an unhealthy dose of rape. Magically backed version of "being raped ruins you forever". Torture. Mind control. Let's take all those rape-related tropes and target Fleur with them.

The reason I'm specifically nominating it as a regret is that it started well and had potential, more than potential, and then shat on it in the second half. By comparison, there are plenty of low-quality fics that didn't disappoint me because I expected less of them -- but even then, they typically aren't that terrible in terms of sexualized violence, rape, and all that crud.

** There was this one fic that I read back when I was searching high and low for femslash of any kind - /Written In The Body/, the pairing is Hermione/Ginny, and both are just utter wish-fulfilment Mary Sues. I sorta looked past that at the time, because I needed the femslash "fix", but it had this weird lasting effect where Hermione/Ginny fics became less and less enjoyable because of it. A year ago or so I tried re-reading it and I simply could not get past the first couple chapters; I still have a hard time reading Hermione/Ginny because I just cannot get that awful crap and its ridiculous scenes and clunky dialogue out of my head. Why the fuck did I waste my time with it?
