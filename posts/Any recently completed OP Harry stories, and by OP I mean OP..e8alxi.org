Mostly because I haven't asked, or seen this request for a while now, and I know that this is a sort of guilty pleasure for a good chunk of the community. Whether it has romance(gen, het, slash, etc), or not. Bashing, or not. Anything is allowed as long as Harry is stupidly powerful either by circumstance, destiny, or even because of crossover elements(Chakra, FT magic, etc...).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.
