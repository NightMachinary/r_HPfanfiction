Hi all.

I was trying to think of what i wanted to read today and i started thinking about some of my favorite tropes to look for when i went looking. But as i did i started thinking about this subreddit, and i started to wonder why some things seem to be taken the way they are.

These questions might seem stupid or trollish to an experienced fanfiction reader or author, but i actually am curious about them. I can understand the issues with writing formats, pet peeves and some of the general dislikes shown by the community but some i just dont get.

- Why is making magic quantifiable seen as a trope of a bad fic? magical cores, spell crafting, and so many other magical things that are not directly from the books seems to be seen as a really bad thing. is it because of Power Levels instead of development occurring or what?

- Character in name only, why is it unliked? Mostly relating to Harry, i was thinking about this. It seems to be if the main character of a story (Harry) acts differently to his canon character, but still has some traits of the canon character, it's taken as a bad thing. some of the best fics i have read are about Harry (in name only) with new skills, or personality interacting with a somewhat in character hogwarts cast and HP plot.

I have many more but i really dont know how to ask them without seeming stupid or rambly about my questions. Things like why wish fulfilment, combat centric, idealistic or simple fics are seemingly disliked, when not only are they the origins of the community but also make up most of the available content.

I just want to understand this community a bit better, why it enjoys what it does and seems to avoid most of what is available to it.


** As far as characters in name only, it's off putting when I'm reading a fic and it starts to feel like I'm reading an author trying to insert themselves in the fic and masquerading as Harry to do it. It can be done well if it feels more like the author is exploring a different side of a character that you may have overlooked.

*** I could see that, mostly whenever i see or think of a character in name only character, its from a story where Harry has a different childhood or is introduced to an ability or magic earlier than canon. But i also read a lot of crossovers where harry's magic is usually very different, which lead to character in name only quite often.

Though i suppose i dont mind it as much as i just kind of accept when it happens, as long as the writing style is decent.

** Neither of these things can't be done well, but both are really hard to pull off well, and are associated with fics that don't pull it off well.

Quantified magic needs to work internally with itself, and unless it was the premise of the story from the get-go, it needs to do so in a way that doesn't really change how magic works in the world. And that's difficult, since the magic battles we see in canon are resolved either through clever use of power (Dumbledore vs Voldemort) or through coincidences of wandlore (Harry vs. Voldemort, every time). When you have two wizards dueling, it's supposed to be about choosing the right attack and blocking.

Of course, we have no idea how blocking works, or why some spells would be better choices than others, so I can certainly see an author expanding on this, but if all they do is say "well so and so's higher level, so they win" that writer hasn't improved on the vagueness of canon.

A last point on this: if magical core just happen and get a number and that's that - that's a crappy magic system. If magic cores are really just a way of measuring magic strength similar to using someone's bench press numbers as a way of measuring physical strength, then you have one element of a potentially very interesting magic system.

As for character in name only: this, to me, is a fundamental break from the basic agreement of fanfiction: as a reader, I'm looking for more stories about Harry Potter and/or more stories about the Wizarding World. If your story has a main character called Harry Potter, I'm expecting him to act at least something like Harry Potter. If your main character doesn't act like Harry Potter, then call them something else. To do otherwise is ... betrayal is too strong, but some lesser form of that.

But that gets back to my personal biggest pet peeve: you should let your readers know what changes you're going to make: during the summary is fine, since you can assume anyone who's reading your story has read the summary and made a choice to go along with it. Changes beyond the initial premise (aside form ones that flow from it) will jar readers out of the story and make them wonder what your doing.

*** Agreed, let your readers know in the summary or an A/N at the beginning of the fic any world breaking changes you plan to go through with.

With quantified magic i never know how to ask about it to the fandom.

I'm a fan of the fate stay night animes, and in those there are many more rules of magic with an easily quantifiable scale of your power. But at the same time each ability has potential trumps that no matter how powerful you are specific skills or objects would bypass it. Things like a weapon that is the incarnation of victory, so that no matter what occurs in a fight you can not lose, but doesn't stop you from having a pyrrhic victory. Or a dagger that can cut through any magical contract or binding but passes through a person without damage.

I dont like power levels as the end of a fight, but instead having power levels act as a kind of resource to make you pay attention to every action you take a second kind of stamina bar if you will.

Those types of magical systems, as well as those that create the basis of a fic are what i really want to find more of. Those moments when accidental magic occurs and harry latches on, and creates something that changes the HP plot. Or moments when he reads a book and attempts to mimic the ability of a character, leading to a different kind of story.

As for character in name only it depends to me, mostly on how the new characterization acts. A malevolent, emo, or otherwise overdone "Harry" isnt something im interested in, i like a Harry that still has some awkwardness, or single minded drive, or want for family to him, but if mixed into that are some new traits from his life in that fic im all for it. Im mostly in it for the interactions between the main character (which is just easier for me when it is named Harry) and the standard plot/ characters.

That is my main issue with this fandom it seems, I like fics that lead to a lot of combat and a lot of plot changes that stem from a change early in Harry's childhood. While i may wind down with a good romantic story or a growing up tale set in HP i really just prefer to read a big heart pumping battle story featuring all my childhood heroes. Things with just enough of a well done writing style that it isnt a slog to read, and help me envision the scene in my head.

**** The difference is that Kinoko Nasu has weapon-of-mass-destruction grade +autism+ Chuunibyou and is a giant RPG nerd, his universe is built upon power level wank and ridiculously detailed world building and mechanics down to the smallest of details. JK Rowling focuses purely on the part of the world that's relevant to Harry and Harry alone, while the rest of the world is pretty underdeveloped. To insert that kind of system into the Harry Potter world and have it fit properly would take a lot of effort and planning, and pretty much every time its only used to wank their super special awesome Gary Stu Harry in quantifiable form.

I feel like the best way to implement that kind of system would be a fic set in the HP Universe using the existing setting, but without involving canon directly. It strikes a balance between original fiction and fanfiction, allow you to develop/implement extra mechanics into the system without taking a massive dump on canon (cough Harry Crow cough)

***** The difference in style really does make it hard to mesh the two together, and i can definately appreciate where your coming from in it. Personally im a strange one in that depending on my mood i care very little about many parts of canon, while reading fanfiction. Somedays i only need a character to be named the same and go through the HP plot points, and some days i need something pretty true to canon.

I do have to ask though, power level wank in the nasuverse? Ok yea it exists but not (usually) amongst the majority of the characters we see. I'v never noticed that before, usually i just see that all the characters of a similar type are of near equal power, and fights are won through those super detailed Mechanics based around countering other skills.

I mean for god sakes Shirou is one of the weakest mages on earth, only reason he can do what he can is because he has variety. But it is also my favorite series (even above HP) so i could just turn a blind eye to it and never notice.

****** Fate is a story of fakes. Shirou emulate first magic (creation of something from nothing), Rin run around wielding a counterfeit Gem Sword of Zelretch and can semi-access second magic, and the entire Heaven's Feel ritual is a bootleg copy of the world's heroic spirit deployment system, and its built upon incomplete third magic. The story subvert rules a lot of the times to make a point, but the power level wank is still there, that's the point of the RPG ranking system. Tsukihime and Kara no Kyoukai avoid it to an extent by being a mystery/suspense/horror, and that MEODP render power level pretty moot, but Fate and its spinoffs capitalize on the concept.

Almost all your questions can be answered by 'Consistently terrible execution'. Authors often make Harry essentially the most powerful wizard because he was born a potter and potters had big cores in fanfction. That isn't a good story, it kills the tension and removes the actual process to get strong for instant gratification. Those stories then turn into first year Harry being a few orders of magnitude more powerful than Dumbledore which is really stupid in execution.

I've never really seen hate for spell crafting here, but I could imagine it. That's probably more of Rowling's fault as she never explained the process of spell making and as a result everyone has to come up with their own idea if they want it. So I imagine it would incite argument as everyone has a unique perspective none of which are right or wrong really as cannon only introduces the concept and never ties it up when Snape mentions he made Sectumsempra.

But in theory both can be done good, just a large number of authors do it bad so we hate on the idea often.

Honestly with fanfiction some people can't seem to grasp cannon Harry for the most part would be the death of most stories as he wouldn't actually do what the plot of the new story required. I get being annoyed at just changing his personality completely even when he had the exact same childhood and made most of the same decisions, but if Harry had a different childhood or made slightly different major decisions he would have developed differently. Honestly there really isn't an 'OoC Harry' as pretty much everyone tries to write him as an OC named Harry Potter.

** Honestly? The problem with Magic Core theory is simply that it's used as a means to make Harry more powerful than his peers, bypassing a need to earn his strength. In essence this could be used for interesting developments - strength vs skill - but authors tend to also make Harry extremely skilled. Thus you get powerful and skilled, setting Harry far above his peers. The pace this tends to happen - usually over a year - is also a case contention. This is a problem because rarely is it balanced out with others.

For instance, Malfoy is rarely made powerful in Harry hero fics. The two rivals can be balanced out via Malfoy weak but knows a high number of spells and how to use them well while Harry is powerful but knows few spells and can use them modertly well using power to compensate for lack of skill. Think Superman vs Batman.

As for "Characters in name only", this comes down to in nurture vs nature as well as where in canon you express a split. If you decide Harry to become a Muggle hater after Goblet of Fire, many are going to question the cause and most justifications are weak. Other than that, a lot of them also don't feel like the character and instead feel like what I like to call a "canon OC" - a character that exists in canon but has so little personality or you change it so much that it pretty much is not that character. In some cases, that's fine but there needs to be a logic to it.

*** I would love to read a fic where Harry is like a sorcerer from D&D, or a mage from Fairy Tail, where he only has one or two skills that he excels in, and has to learn either how to over power that skill to let him do more than he should be able too, or learns how to finesse his way through situations by learning variations of that skill.

Power is a fickle thing in writing and animation, too many people jump straight to Power=Victory, when a little bit of slytherin cunning could easily aid you in defeating a more powerful opponent.

I personally would love it to see more HP fans take a dip into Fate/Stay Night sometime and see how they would use the two together. Iv read a ton of fics with that premise and most are awesome reads.

Reason i say that though is that Fate does the idea of Quantified magic very well. Every mage has 5 components to their magic.

- Magic circuits (how a mage lets their magic flow),

- Origin (the origin their magic style pulls from),

- Element (The element of existence their magic is affiliated with),

- Mana (the magical energy of the world)

- and Od (the magical energy the magi makes in their body).

  Essentially Mages pull mana in to their circuits, mix it with Od and use their Element to focus their Prana into their desired goal. But magic is handled in a ranked form of rock paper scissors almost, where everything can be countered but sometimes with enough power you can resist your counter, but it takes a lot out of you. Power levels exist, but not in outrageous numbers, and not in such a way that either power or skill is more important than the other.

As for the nurture v nature i agree, you actually see it done pretty well in a ton of Crossovers where Harry is raised in the crossover setting. When you take the kid away from the Dursleys and raise him with a legit family, with knowledge of his parents, you will get such a different character than in canon.

**** When it comes to the magical core theory I work with the belief that the magical core is a pool of power to use, but control, wand work, memorization, creativity and confidence are part of it.

For instance, I tend to give Harry a lot of magical power and his control is something he easily comes into by constantly underselling himself. His wand work is good - Quidditch reflexes help but his confidence is so-so (he's quite self depricating and doesn't believe he's anything special so he has a tendency to think "I can't do this one" for harder spells) and his memorization is poor (he keeps only a small handful of spells in mind and remembers very few on the fly). The results is that his disarming charm can overpower many shield charms but he's unlikely to use a silencing charm simply for lack of thinking of it, etc.

Hermione on the flip side I tend to make less powerful but lacks of confidence in a high pressure situations, is uncreative in her usage of spells, but her control, memorization and wand work are second to none in low risk situations. She is absolutely not a duelist - her best place is behind the scenes. She has enough skills to escape or take down unskilled wizards and witches, but she can't duel the likes of Bellatrix.

** If you have more questions, go ahead. Civil discussion is always very welcome.

To your first question: I personally dislike this a lot. Why? Because in canon, magic was infinite. There was no one who was inherently bad or good at magic. There were only wizards and witches, and those who can't do magic at all like Squibs and Muggles. Period. Dumbledore, Grindelwald, Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange,... are all characters who have spent a lot of time, learning, researching and perfecting the use of magic. And /that/ is the true beauty of HP magic. The only thing that is able to bring you to mastery, to true legend, is your own dedication and drive. There are no limits to what you can do, as long as you invest yourself into furthering your own limits with dedication and practice.

Magical cores delete that aspect completely. They say that you are limited to your manapool. Don't have enough mana? Then some magic is simply out of your reach, through no fault but simple genetics (there are of course those fics that say you can increase your manapool. We're on a spectrum of how final the cores are here). But that is essentially why I dislike them. Magical Cores bring a element of "leveling up"/"being better by nature" into the mix that I detest and I think a lot of people dislike as well.

To your second question: I think what people dislike is when Harry is different without any explanation as to why. Its generally seen as a mark of bad writing when a character changes behavior with no apparent reason. The threshold as to when and how these changes are reasonable are very different. I personally can do with very little explanation, but some people want chapters of character arc for even the smallest changes. Its a matter of taste, of course, but the underlying statement holds true: Change without explanation makes for bad character design.

*** I think i enjoy Quantified magic in a very specific manner, those times when it allows power to be trumped by skill or planning, and when it allows a kind of goal to magic.

I love the idea that Dumbledore is actually very weak as a mage but he knew HOW to use his skill as a caster to do what he needed to do. Whereas Voldemort had way too much power without the finesse to truly utilize what he had. These kind of systems also allow an author to make magic truly involved, magic can be made into something personal and unique to each person. We all know that Neville is great at Herbology, but what if that meant that with a well done magic system, he could conjure and manipulate plants but it was all he could do. and so he had to find how to do as much as possible with that skill.

While its rare to find a fic that does it well, i do think it has great potential and really want to find more fics that do it right.

As for the Character behavior, that does make sense, i suppose i just never think about it as i usually just see the main character as the Readers Eyes. As long as its a decent person or he fits what im hoping for based off the fics changes i never really pay attention to it, things like an aggressive or battle hungry Harry with some canon traits i usually love to read But the second Harry becomes an Dark lord of the Emo kind, i drop the story in a heartbeat.

**** But you don't really need to quantify it. You don't have to establish that Voldemort has 217456287 magic points to use, while Dumbledore has only 63462 but the more cost effective casting techniques and ideas. Why not make it actual character traits? Or, you know, just use canon? Voldemort doesn't give two fucks about what magic he uses. He's depraved and pure evil, using spells Dumbledore would rather die than speaking himself. Albus Dumbledore has to counter that onslaught of destructive, evil magic with creative use of Transfiguration, Animation, Conjuration and many more things, because he will not fall to the moral depths of Riddle.

In the case of Neville, just look at normal school. Not everybody is good at everything. I, for one, am complete pants at math, but my historical, political-science and geographical knowledge was almost unmatched. So why do you need a system of magic to make someone good at something while he's useless at something else?

What I'm saying is that with such a system you take the /choice/ of a character to invest time, sweat and nerves into something to become good at it, and make it a predetermined fate for the character. In my ideal fic, Voldemort chose to give everything for as much power as possible, Dumbledore chose to stay clean of the dark and Neville chose to follow his love for plants. They weren't railroaded into it by their magic. They made a choice.

And choice, I can not underline this enough, *is the most important thing for any character*. The less choice a character has, the duller the character becomes. Choice is what truly creates a character, not predetermined Fate. Because in the end it is not the magic system, the worldbuilding or incredible writing that keeps us reading, its the characters. Its always the characters.

***** I understand what you're getting at, and i can somewhat agree that's how most people see it, but i do have my own take on it as well.

Stories about Fate have always been my favorites, the idea that there is a loose set of boundaries that you as an individual must follow, but you have the freedom to define those boundaries are what i love. I probably didn't say that right.

For me it is much more rewarding to see a character find their niche and make that their own. Seeing something where someone would only ever have 1 skill that they could use, and that they had to work hard just to get that much and then seeing them figure out how to use that as best they can.

I like magic systems because in my eyes when used correctly they give you an understanding of your expected place in the world, and then it is the character's job to BREAK that expectation. Neville is only good at nature magic? Then let's see that fic where he uses his skill with nature magic to cure disease or become the greatest duelist ever. But the journey the fic tells is all about his determination to break the expectations of those around him.

Now yeah there are tropes of it that go too far, those times that you see Harry have 2 mil magic points and naturally is good at all battle magics are too far. But if instead you go with general/ broad stroke terms, and dont try to make it sound impressive then i think it's great.

For me the ideal fic is one where Harry is a bit of a natural at DADA (or some specific magic), and realises that if its what he's best at, then he will make himself THE best, period. Where its recognized that he can make the best of what he has, and uses that in everything that he faces, from schoolwork to his adventures.

But i will admit this comes from my love of JRPG's and growing up off of Anime.

** Character in name only? Ugh. That one drives me crazy. Harry Potter is one of my favorite characters in fiction. I like him as he is and, when I search for fanfiction featuring him, I'm looking for fanfiction that's /actually/ featuring him. Everything else is just false advertising. Many times, the character could easily be an original character in a Hogwarts setting. It feels like the only reason the HP name is even used is to attract readers who'd be turned off by an OC (which Harry becomes in all but name.) It really frustrates me to get duped like that.

That doesn't mean I'm against complete AUs where the character is different but recognizable. I also know that some people will interpret canon Harry differently. That's all great. It's just the wildly different characterizations that really bother me ('in name only' characterizations). Because really, most of the traits authors claim their wildly OOC Harry has in common with canon Harry are very generic things (i.e. they're brave). Having a few generic traits similar to HP does not make them HP. If it did, Harry and Sirius would be the same character (both brave, reckless, rebellious, and loyal). That's not enough.

I get that it's fun for some people to write that, but I just wish they wouldn't tag it as just 'Harry Potter (character)' when they do that. Even if they leave a note to warn you, you still can't filter by author's notes so the tags are filled with a character you weren't searching for. Add an OC!Harry tag or, if it's somewhere where you can't add your own tags, just put it in the fandom tag instead of tagging the character. I'd just really love it if authors would distinguish canon Harry Potter (or any character) with their own wildly different version.

*** There definately seems to be a few different groups when it comes to characterization. Loyalists, Fanon, CINA, AU, all sorts exist the problem comes from when you go to a page and the author isnt in the same group as you and dont tag in a way you expect.

Personally i dont mind CINA Harry as long as some major traits are shared, but at the same time with the kind of fics i like its hard to make canon Harry fit that plot point (i like combat fics and battle loving characters)

But it can also be an issue if someone wants their fics main character to interact with and be the main character of the canon plot. What i mean by that is, i like a warrior for a main character, if i were to write a Warrior style Harry type character as the leading man of my fic, and then had him go through most every plot point of HP then i would be ripped into by the readers just as much as i would be for just writing a CINA Harry fic.

When this is about Harry, it is usually because the author is attempting a self insert without labelling it as one. I have nothing against SI fics and have read a LOT of good ones over on spacebattles, but they rarely turn out well when the author is only halfway committed. A good SI is interesting because humans are vastly different from each other. Often they try to go back to "Harry" by visiting a station of canon to make up for their OOCness. Being caught between the desires of the author and those of the character can also cause his actions to come off as preachy. A lot of "Harry's" actions reek of fix fics.

All bets are off when AU of course.(fix fic AU's are another thing) I don't mind fix fics ordinarily(I like to see various character's takes on it), but they get samey, and after taking on a ton of fanon they become unreadable.

When it comes to other characters, very often female characters are in name only in order to accommodate a romance. Or power wank Hermione. Others like Snape and Draco are pardoned freely. WRITE YOUR AU. This is very important, because otherwise you end up with shit like the HPMOR intro, where both every main character but Ron(why no power boost?) is radically different from canon. Some fics are even worse because the characters other than the mc will continue to behave according to canon when the situation has changed, and fail to adapt(average manipulative dumbledore vs super harry).

Power Levels for the sake of power levels are usually never good, but if you're not using it to make a character into a powerhouse but to instead introduce a theme or give scale to your feats i dont see whats wrong with it.

Character in name, fair point, i usually just dont care as long as the fic is fun and most of the cast is about right.

Wish fulfilment i cant say much, i dont mind it as i see it being a needed thing to even write a fic, but at the same time it can easily be too blatant.

Idealistic fics should not be demeaned just because you want a complex story. Most of the community past this subreddit seem to care more about having fun in the HP setting for a bit longer rather than trying to write a great literary work. Its not for everyone, but it doesnt mean its not a legitimate type of fic.

Because I'm an aggressive person.

It's still regressive in relation to source material. Fics should build upon what exist in setting, not devolving it.

I don't really get your opinion. Can you explain it further?

I mentioned "some readers", not the "community at large". As I mentioned, almost everything you pointed out is accepted by community as large. Just look at Harry Crow's favourites on ffnet.

** For why we avoid most of what's available: See Sturgeon's Law.

Both things you've listed can be done well, but they just have a slightly higher percentage of crap (or it stands out more). With the Harry in name only, generally I'm fine with it, but at some point it goes to far, and you're just reading some random thing that's not really Harry Potter.

** For the first one, usually it's a sign that the author is either going to get into really specific detail about their fanon idea of magic, over-explaining ideas that to them are probably interesting the think about, but are absolutely shit boring to read about. Also, it forces the concept of magic into a box that is easily understood, instead of it being, you know.../magic/. Writing it that way takes all the mystery and originality out of the idea, which makes it boring.

As for writing characters OOC, people go looking for fanfiction because they liked the original, and they want to see it explored more. The more OOC you write someone, the more likely you're going to change something that was the reason the person is reading your fic in the first place. If you're going to write someone super-OOC you may as well just write an original character. I think people are more okay with Harry being OOC if there is reason given. We've read so much canon-like Harry already, changing him is fine as long as it makes sense and is entertaining.

** Character in name early comes across as self insertion, where the author is making the main character OP in order to live through them, effectively because they're not skilled enough as a writer or as an independent thinker to give their protagonist actual flaws and weaknesses.

Similarly, when magic is made into something obscenely powerful or something that can be measured in numbers or something equally ridiculous, it becomes boring, lacking in its natural mystery and often OP.

Generally, I associate these tropes with children who can't write three-dimensionally but are trying very hard, which I'm sure I would care about if I was a primary school teacher, or more upsettingly, adults who can't write three-dimensionally but are trying very hard, and in that case, I don't care at all.

Wish fulfilment is great for one's internal imaginations, but in fiction, even fanfiction, it creates utter tripe.
