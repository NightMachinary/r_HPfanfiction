I have no idea whether these exist, but I was wondering whether there were any stories round where Xeno potions Luna's mother to get her to marry him, or Luna to keep control of her. Something like that. Or anything with a “bad” Xeno. Crazy Xeno is obviously welcome, too.


** There are the fanfics by HaikenEdge on FF, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head.

** There was some crazy smut fic where Xeno pimps out Luna when she is a kid. It was dumb, but overly graphic. I don't remember the name, and didn't read it (for obvious reasons).

**** It started off with like "angry/indy!Harry" which i like, but Luna's my fav character so when I got to the part where Luna was raped I dropped out.
