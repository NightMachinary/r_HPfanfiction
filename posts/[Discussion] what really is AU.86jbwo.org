I do not understand why some fanfics are AU and others are not. All fanfics should be AU right? If I write a story that is word for word like canon but I want Harry to have blue hair that makes it an alternate universe. Just one small change makes it different then JKRs world thus AU...right?


** AU means non-canon story elements up to the point that the fanfic starts.

*** I'm not sure about that definition.. I'm reasonably sure that some crossovers are canon compliant leading up to, and quite possibly a few chapters into the story.. and they can hardly be classed as anything but AU.

**** I think I get what they're trying to say but it's weirdly written. Like, a version of HP in a universe where there's no magic would, under this definition, be AU since before the fanfic starts things would still be different from the source material.

But it's I think too short a definition to really cover all the possible bases.

** Well, fanfiction is not canon but some stories try harder than others to stick to canon elements. It's useful to distinguish stories that are more different than others. You could call all fanfics AUs but it's more useful to describe stories that are only loosely related to canon as AU.

Even so, the term isn't always the clearest. You'll have some stories that claim things like canon-compliant up to book 4 and AU from then onwards - some people will take that to mean it diverges wildly while others will still accept a more subtle divergence.

Then there are other stories which will have (mostly) canon Harry accidentally travel to a world that is similar to his world but different, these dimension travelling stories give a different meaning to an AU again.

** My interpretation would be that an alternate universe fic would be Harry moving to New York to fight with the Avengers or being adopted as an infant by Sirius and moving to Australia. Regular fics within the canon universe where Harry has blue hair or dates Susan instead of Ginny, or those that take place after the books end but don't change the previous story as told by JK, don't diverge enough from the canon universe to be 'AU'.

*** Yeah I think I agree with you- it has to diverge “enough.” There's like an invisible line between canon and AU.

** AU, for me at least, usually means the story is radically different then the books.. Eg. Crossovers, major deviances like gender flipping, change of house and the like.. as opposed to Harry starts dating Hermione instead of Cho/Ginny but still has to deal with canon stuff, like the GoF and TriWiz, Fudge's incompetence and Umbridge's presence at Hogwarts

** AU is to be distinguished from a canon divergence.

Divergence: backstory is canon, events change after the fic begins. E.g. a 5th year divergence means that the story continues on from PS, CoS, PoA and GoF. The set-up of the world is the same, it's just that events diverge at some point.

AU: backstory is non-canon. The set-up of the universe is different from before the start of the fic.

This may sound like an arbitrary distinction, but it actually makes a huge difference to both reader and writer. When you are writing an AU, you have to explain a lot of things to the reader because they cannot assume their knowledge of the universe from canon. It bears more similarity to original fiction than other fanfic does, because you're having to do your own worldbuilding etc.

On the other hand, when writing a canon divergence, you can write as if you were JKR writing a later instalment of the series, with the reader able to assume everything up to your point of divergence.

** AU to me usually means what it says, alternate universe. Like instead of Harry Potter universe it's actually in Narnia or California. I think the exceptions to that are different time periods (like the English wizarding world but Victorian) or where they're all muggles (since that's also technically another universe). Little altered details aren't really AU. Sometimes I see stuff like Professor!Harry AU but I don't really consider that an AU since it's plausible that could happen in the HPU (and arguably should have happened? But that's a convo for another time...).

Soooo no. Tl;Dr I don't think blue hair is AU.
