By this I mean he either doesn't help any side or he helps both and they know that he helps the other side. If it is an OC I would prefer if it was a male but a female is fine. 100k words, completed or on-going. There doesn't have to be any relationships, or if there is I'm really not bothered. I don't know if this subreddit has been done before but it probably has so please bare(?) with me.

Thank you!!!

Harry goes out of his way to not be involved with the ongoing war. The whole plot is pretty much him doing whatever he can to not have to fight, so he can live his own life. He's essentially caught in the middle.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
