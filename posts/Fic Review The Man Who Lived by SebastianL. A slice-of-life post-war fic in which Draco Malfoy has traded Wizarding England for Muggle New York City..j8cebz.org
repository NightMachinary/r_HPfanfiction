:END:
This is a very popular and also very controversial fic.

Firstly it is /heavy/. 250k words heavy in volume, and even heavier in content. The fic's rating is Explicit, but not really for sexual content (although there is some of that as well). I would advise not reading this fic if you are triggered by such subjects as suicide, school shooters or police brutality -- especially in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement. However, none of that breaks the rules of the subreddit, so [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9167785/chapters/20815621][here is a link to the story]] if you wish to read it.

Secondly it doesn't read like a lot of fanfiction does. It takes place entirely outside England and most of the supporting cast are muggle OCs. It is written as a very realistic look at life and doesn't hold back on utilising a lot of hot political themes around social justice, not to mention the themes I mentioned above.

It was published in early 2017 between January and February, and was written in advance from October the year before. I know I say this a lot about the fics I'm recommended, but good grief I do not know what this author was taking to be able to pump out that many words (let alone good ones) in such a short space of time.

* Premise
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: premise
  :END:
12 years after the war, a heavily tattooed Draco Malfoy has built a life for himself in Muggle New York City as a youth worker. He is a happy and well-adjusted gay man, and almost entirely estranged from the magical world until an accidental wish throws the real Harry Potter into his dreams. The two cannot be free of each other during their sleeping hours until the former enemies can learn to see each other as they truly are.

* Plot
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: plot
  :END:
Look, I'd be raising my eyebrows at a premise like that too. It's so left field it's practically a different ballpark. I get it. It's a story you have to really get into before you can judge it, which is fitting because that's also kind of the central theme of the story.

The establishing chapter shows us a day in the life of Draco Malfoy, and it feels absolutely NOTHING like canon. Draco works days as a receptionist at a tattoo parlour and evenings at an outreach center for underprivileged youth, who are largely African American and Latino. He carries a wand with him, but barely uses magic at all anymore. All of his friendships are with muggles, whom he refers to as regulars, and he seems to live a very meaningful and fulfilling life. His one drawback is his refusal to date, because he doesn't want a wizard boyfriend and would have to lie to a muggle one due to the Statute of Secrecy, so he simply refrains from getting into relationships.

The day in Draco's life we come upon is not a good day. His coffee is spilled, his wallet stolen, and he is asked to add a new boy into his group; Evan, who has been picked up by his mother and his school for writing a manifesto detailing his plans to shoot up the school and kill himself. At the end of this day Draco comes home and a crazy old woman outside his apartment tells him to make a wish. He brushes her off, but back in his apartment after a few drinks and with only himself to hear, he wishes for his enemies to see him as he truly is -- amongst other things that I won't repeat here.

Famous last words of course, and in his dream he finds himself in a white room with Harry Potter, the latter of whom believes he has died again and is furious that it is Draco he is meeting instead of someone he actually cares about. Draco puts two and two together from his encounter with the old woman and realises she must have been a witch or at least some kind of magical being.

From here, the story sprinkles itself along in a non-linear timeline. Sometimes we follow Draco's present attempts to help out his boys, spend time with his friends and celebrate his 30th birthday. At others we see him try and explain himself to Harry in a way that might make Harry see eye to eye with him, although Harry is having none of it. At still other times, we start having flash backs to the time in between, to show us the trajectory Draco took from the person he was at the end of Deathly Hallows to the man he has become.

Structurally it's a really sound plot, and this is a reflection of the author having written the entire story before publishing it online. Every chapter has a purpose, and the pacing is neither rushed nor dawdling. It also packs a really effective emotional punch because it seems to come from such an authentic place.

* Writing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: writing
  :END:
SebastianL's writing quality is exceptional. Although it has a tendency to strip away the glamour that literature can give to a scene or a life, it is highly immersive and believable. Many readers have remarked on this, but the author's ability to write OCs and bring them to life within a paragraph is unparalleled in any fanfiction I have read. This is fortunate, because there is a plethora of OCs who now make up Draco's social life, so if they hadn't felt as much like real people as they do then the fanfic would have suffered tremendously.

Another strength which really stood out to me was the author's ability to write authentic-sounding dialogue, which also contributed to the fantastic characterisation. I was pretty sceptical in the first chapter because Draco was sounding very Americanised and it was pulling me out of the story. However, when you read the first scene in which Draco interacts with his mother, his entire manner of speaking changes. You can practically hear the formal British accent, and his speech patterns are suddenly spot on for canon Draco. It isn't something the author ever draws attention to, which just seems to add to the subtle genius of it -- Draco has been living in New York for 8 years, and he has developed adaptational speech patterns which revert when he interacts with people from his past.

The non-linear structure of the story telling also really works for me, especially with the type of story it is. Bit by bit we peel back the layers of what happened to Draco and Harry the past 12 years. How one grew from his suffering and the other gave in to it, and I feel like the emotional beats of the story are more effectively told with the jumps. I've seen this type of structure done before in a way that was confusing because it wasn't always clear which timeline I was reading, but in Man Who Lived there is never a question because of the way it handles tense.

Whilst all the flashbacks are told in past tense, the present timeline of the story is told in present tense, and it is a first-person narrative from Draco's POV. I've talked before in my [[https://draquiareviews.wordpress.com/2020/02/03/robes-of-green-series-by-kz55/][harem deep dive review]] about how a first-person narrative goes better with present tense because it feels like an intimate look at life out of someone's eyes, and I think that holds true here. Present tense can be jarring to read and adjust to, but for myself I completely ceased to notice it after the first chapter. The water is fine, just try to jump in for a bit and see how you feel.

* Draco Malfoy and the benefits of self-insert characters

  :END:
Something which took me by surprise when I was reading this story was that Draco Malfoy is not only the main character, but also an obvious author stand-in. I've seen Draco used as a proxy for an author's sense of humour and critiques about the Harry Potter series before, and I've seen author stand-in Harry Potter more times than I can count, but I've never seen someone so completely put themselves into Draco's shoes. It seemed like an odd choice. And the more I read about the author from his comments, the more I came to understand how thoroughly his experiences shaped the plot of this fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  ...yeah, there is a lot of me in this version of Draco... we share a high level of snark and a sense of outrage at any perceived injustice. We also have rocky relationships with our parents over being queer in common, so it's not like I have to dig deep when I write about being estranged from a parent. I suppose Draco is like a thin, cis, magical version of me in some ways.
#+end_quote

The author is a trans, queer man, and this is the first Drarry fanfiction I've read from the perspective of a queer man rather than a cis, straight woman (that I know of). There are some obvious differences in how it reads, such as it coming across as a somewhat more authentic, even gritty reading of a queer experience, and lacking the undertones of the fetishization of gay men often seen in slash fanfiction.

As the quote says, there are a lot of themes in the story about overcoming the circumstances you were born into by adopting chosen family. Draco is very close to the friends who took him in when he first came to America, is not on speaking terms with his father and has a very strained relationship with his mother. The author recounts having at one time been made homeless after he came out to his conservative family, and some of his early experiences of being accepted into the LGBT+ community and estranged from his blood relatives are echoed through Draco's flashbacks.

On top of that, “Draco's boys”, whom he supports at the youth center are also echoes of the author in other ways.

#+begin_quote
  I do have some experience with kids like this: I was one. I was one of those kids in the outreach programs, poor as hell, not expected to graduate, and somehow grew up to be a (relatively) well adjusted adult, thanks to God knows how many amazing mentors I had along the way.
#+end_quote

I'd say that more than any slash fanfiction I've ever read, The Man Who Lived is a great exercise in empathy for a perspective you might not often read about. For that alone I would recommend it widely.

* Draco Malfoy and the drawbacks of self-insert characters
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: draco-malfoy-and-the-drawbacks-of-self-insert-characters
  :END:
That said, I am not without criticisms for this story. Whilst Draco's change from canon is handled extremely well (if you read the entire fic through), I can also see why some people get put off by this fic. Obviously it's a good thing that Draco managed to be reprogramed away from pureblood mania, but in his rejection of Voldemort's ideals he has also rejected magic and magical society more or less altogether. As stated earlier he barely uses his wand, only ventures into wizarding New York when he has to, and purposefully makes no friendships with any other witches or wizards. He has even vowed never to return to England or propagate the Malfoy line by having children.

I could feel myself becoming defensive in some scenes when Draco criticised magical society, because he seemed to be dismissive of such a broad amount of content of the Harry Potter books that it just comes across as the whole source material being held in contempt. It's hard for me to wrap my head around someone putting so much effort into writing fanfiction for a work they don't seem to like that much. Not to mention of course, that the magic of Harry Potter is one of the main reasons I love the series so much.

Then there's the portrayal of Draco as opposed to other canon characters. I am pretty open to meta-analysis of the faults of beloved characters and even enjoy a fic which properly calls out the way Harry can be a jerk sometimes, but I've seen it done better than it was here. While Harry sputters at Draco's take downs of Dumbledore and Hagrid and rages at having to be stuck with Draco in some pretty immature ways, it feels a bit like Harry is being straw-manned, and it's kind of depressing seeing him portrayed as so bitter and stunted. Draco raises some good points, but Harry's retorts were weak and often frustratingly left good rebuttals unsaid. Characters as author-mouthpieces frequently fall into this trap of getting to be righteous all the time and schooling everybody else about what they've done wrong. Draco thankfully isn't portrayed as universally right all the time, but he clearly has the upper hand in all of his conversations about the events of the books.

It's odd, because whilst the purpose of Harry and Draco's conversations are to make Harry understand that Draco is a changed man, there's this pervasive feeling that Draco is also trying to rewrite his childhood to make himself look like the victim. There are 3 moments Draco recounts which took me out of the story because they felt like overly convenient retcons.

The first one is that Dobby apparently outed a young gay Draco to his father on purpose, and so Draco has righteously hated him ever since. Dobby being petty in this way seems pretty farfetched already, but let's also keep in mind that Dobby was a literal slave in Draco's household, who was subject to frequent physical abuse from Draco and his parents. Even in the present timeline, Draco doesn't seem to have any self-awareness about this, and I can only assume it was retconned in to make Draco seem like less of a turd-child.

The second is that Snape and Draco became friends long before Draco went to Hogwarts (fine, sure) and that Snape told a pre-Hogwarts Draco about his feelings for Lily (absolutely heckin' no). The only thing keeping Snape alive for a long time was the fact that his superior legilimency kept his secret from Voldemort -- there's no way he was going to divulge it to a kid, no matter how much he liked Draco.

The third and final one was the train scene in PS. Harry recounts Draco insulting Ron's family by calling them poor, and cementing Harry's dislike of Draco. Draco goes into explaining mode that Ron had laughed at Draco's name first, which because of pureblood traditions about your mother choosing your name was tantamount to saying ‘f*ck your mother'. I feel like you can write this scene in Draco's shoes, acknowledging that Draco was a d*ckbag whilst also seeing how he was eleven and lashing out about someone laughing at his name without needing to retcon in pureblood rules. Since Draco is so good at taking Harry to task for being a jerk, I feel like he should be able to own it when he is too.

* Other hot button topics
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: other-hot-button-topics
  :END:
It is such a tightrope walk to try to write about systemic issues for people of colour in America, especially when the main character interacting with them is about as privileged as it comes. When I first read about Draco's job, my cringe-o-meter shot up. I was sure the handling of this was going to be horrendously offensive and involve a lot of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_savior_narrative_in_film][white saviour]] crap. Thankfully, this was not the case.

Once or twice commenters would pull the author up for something he hadn't handled so well, and to his credit he accepted their criticism gracefully and promised to do better in future. I don't think I'm in a qualified position to say whether the topics and characters were holistically handled well, but I can certainly see that a good attempt was made to handle them with compassion.

The author aims to create a bridge of understanding by having Draco portray himself as someone who was part of a cult and made horrible and destructive decisions as a teenager. From this perspective he can do his best to support his boys from becoming only a product of their environment like he used to be. Mind you, I'm still not really sold on making the wannabe school shooter into a sympathetic character, but at least the fic doesn't attempt to justify his intentions at all.

* TL;DR
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: tldr
  :END:
This is a fanfiction unlike most you will read. It is a solidly constructed and realistic story, which for all its criticisms of the Harry Potter books is deeply heartfelt and doesn't pull its emotional punches. I had some trouble getting into it to begin with, but once I was invested it was hard to stop reading, and despite its flaws I would highly recommend it.

The Man Who Lived gets an 8/10 from me.

** Yep, I basically agree with all of this. The fic was strongest when talking about Draco and his post-DH story, both past and present, whereas many things to do with Harry were weaker. From a relationship perspective it was kind of one sided, in a way that's not uncommon in fics: one character (here, Draco) draws the other into his life and introduces him to new things that he comes to have strong positive reactions to, but there's not much in the other direction. Admittedly Harry's kind of a depressed hermit, but I'd have liked it if he'd brought more to the table.

** I've read this story a few times and I absolutely agree with your review. It makes me want to re read my favorite fix of all time Let Go (by the same author) which is an Albus/Scorpius pairing. It's been a bit since my reread but Albus also feels kind of mouth-piecey in that one as well but since we never see a canonical adult Al, it's more believable and acceptable than Draco in Man who Lived

**** Let Go is nice because (lol I'm about to feel like Stefan from SNL) it has a murder type mystery, loss of magic mystery, world/character building with Albus and his siblings and all their flaws, eventual Scorbus but with some angst building up, an awesome Harry vs Albus fight that made my cry, and one of the most badass Draco's I've read. If you do read it, let me know how you like it!

** Thank you for reminding me the name of this fic! I read it ages ago and have often thought it's worth a reread but could never remember it's name. I honestly think it's one of the best written, interesting and novel fics I've read. It's a unique take on the events following the books but not unbelievable, an outrageous plot but written with subtlety. I do agree with you that Harry portrayal is a weak point, but the exploration of Draco's character and the way his life takes a totally different direction makes up for this for me. Great write up!
