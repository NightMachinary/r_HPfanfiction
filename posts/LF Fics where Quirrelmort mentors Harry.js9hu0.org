Or just any fic where Voldemort realizes that babies don't have political affiliations and/or Harry is curious and/or good at magic.

I've already read linkao3(A New Kind of Normal), linkffn(Bloodcrest) and linkao3(Resurrection)


** Probably the only time where I'd recommend linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality). I don't like the fic, but the Harry-Quirrel interaction is probably one of the most interesting part of it.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  It was a bone-deep almost-ache when he opened his eyes and spotted the light flitting through the slats of his cupboard, both a familiar sight and at the same time distant like an old memory. It was a twist in his chest when he sat up, expecting---strangely---to hit his head on the sloped ceiling only to pause when he realized, of course, that he was far too short for that to happen. Harry was struck with a strong sensation---which had no apparent reason at all---that he should not be here.---In which Harry Potter returns to his 11 year-old body after “dying” in the Forbidden Forest, given a second chance to change the ending of his story and the fate of the wizarding world. Except with the memories of his previous life buried deep in his subconscious, Harry must rely on his ever-present sense of deja-vu to guide him down a different path.

  Harry doesn't want to learn magic or go to Hogwarts -- he just wants to be normal, like the Dursleys. But a meddling, crazy old wizard won't take “no” for an answer. Harry might have to learn how to be a normal wizard instead. But who will teach him what that means -- Light wizards or pure-blood friends?
