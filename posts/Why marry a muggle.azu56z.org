** The answer my friend is love. You cannot help with whom you fall in love with.

#+begin_quote
  most wizards can't pretend to be normal in the muggle world for 5 minutes, they normally live completely separated.
#+end_quote

Admittedly, most wizards are unable to discuss quantum physics, but who the hell would do that in a club? You probably grab a Muggleborn friend, get a short briefing and then go to town. Tell your date/the guy you are grinding against that you have been to a remote, traditional boarding school and probably a little rusty about the latest trends and you ought to be set.

#+begin_quote
  but most of them lock their wands away and a good number probably get abused..
#+end_quote

That happens once.

Lastly, you can always disclose magic. It's not like anyone would ever believe that person that their girlfriend used to be a witch. To qoute my own story:

#+begin_quote
  "What about the Statute of Secrecy?"

  "What about it? She could scream the truth from Tower Bridge and no one would believe her. /Oh, your girlfriend works for the Wizard Bobbies? And her hair changes its colour when you play with it?/ Honey, whatever you are taking, I want two," Tonks mocked and when she put it like that, it didn't quite sound like the exposure of the magical world was nigh.

*** I'm not an expert, but I'm fairly sure that the 'love at first sight ' thing barely ever really happens, I'm also pretty sure that it's not a good idea to build a relationship based on lies.

I mainly posted this because I'm reading a fanfic called 'reincarnation at its finest ' but while I don't have other examples right now, it's a pretty common theme in fanfiction.

I get that it sounds romantic to make such a sacrifice for love, but really they basically give up the foundation of their life, leave behind their family and all their friends and usually deceive their 'beloved '..

Maybe I'm the least romantic person to ever walk the earth , but to me it just seems wrong on so many levels.

It's not always a huge sacrifice to some people.

Queenie from the Fantastic Beasts movies is a natural Legilimens, and is ostracized or treated like a useful tool by other wizards and witches who learn of her ability. She falls in love with a muggle guy (Kowalski) because he doesn't have the instant kneejerk "OMG MIND READER!" reaction to her replying to his thoughts, like a wizard would have done.

Of course, there's an inherent power imbalance because Queenie can read her man's thoughts and take offense at things he didn't even say, but her initial attraction to him happened because she found him to be an honest, good-hearted guy whose returned attraction had nothing to do with her abilities.

Hellstrike didn't say anything about love at first sight. Just love.

I get what you're saying, but we're human beings. If you found yourself really enjoying spending time with a woman, are you going to immediately back off? Probably not. You'll continue to spend time with her.

And then one day you'll notice you want to date her. And maybe you do. But you don't want to break the Statute, and you're a little afraid of her leaving you out of panic and then her perhaps having to be Obliviated.

So you keep it secret until you feel her love for you is enough to make her stay no matter how freaked out she may be. It is deceptive, but I don't think there's any real good solution.

It's also not too difficult to lead two lives, so they don't necessarily have to leave their magical life behind.

*** also about the statue of secrecy, I'm not sue about the laws, but I think they're pretty strict: on the Harry Potter fandom wiki page for mcgonnagall it said that her mother had to give up magic and that she would have had to do the same, which is why she ended her own engagement to a muggle.

Maybe they changed it recently? Or it's just another inconsistency..

** What a weird question haha

Because sometimes you're out in a bar with your mates and you strike up a conversation with an interesting bloke and he happens to be a muggle and you have chemistry and go on a date and fall in love and decided love was worth the stigma

It's not like they had their tinder match set to "muggle" and swiped left on all wizards on purpose or something. Back in the olden days you married someone who you met and got to know mostly by chance

You're acting like interfaith and interrace marriage doesn't exist in the real world with real world consequences. Sometimes people meet and fall in love and it's not any more mysterious than that

***** Yea, but aren't talking modern world norms/ culture, it'd be more like noble lady from medieval Europe running of with a Jew or pre civil war rich farmers daughter running of with one of her daddy's slaves.\\
Nor saying it didn't happen, but it definitely wasn't as common.

Also it'd be closer to species mixing than race mixing, I mean with one partner being able to do magic, read minds, teleport, brainwash, whatever the balance off power would just be off.

I mean if a friend of yours started dating someone who was the mental equivalent of an 8 year old, wouldn't you question their motives?

** Maybe I'm being a robot again or something, but it just annoys me.

Snape's mom might seriously be the most pathetic character in the series for me, with arguable competition from Pettigrew. She let herself and her son be abused for years, while living in poverty, and got them both kicked out of the family to be with a drunk coal miner or whatever he he was?

**** Yea abuse is horrible, people who suffer it should be helped and protected and abusers should be stopped and punished.

But she was a witch and she still didn't even step in to protect her son.

That's like having a midget beating up your kid and being to apathetic to pull it off.

I'm sure they're all sorts of psychological explanations, but if you refuse to protect your children (especially when you easily can) you're just scum.
