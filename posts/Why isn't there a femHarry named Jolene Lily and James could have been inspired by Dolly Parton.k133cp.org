"Flaming locks of auburn hair, ivory skin, and eyes of emerald green"


** I'm not familiar with Dolly Parton (or country music in general) so I had to look it up.

I could say that, while technically possible, it seems pretty unlikely for Lily and James to be a fan of this singer (especially with James being a Pureblood and probably unfamiliar with Muggle music in general). I could also say that most fanfic author probably didn't know about this song, or that there are tons of other potential name with a more obvious link to the Potter (such as all the "flowery" names like Rose, Pany, Lavander and so on to keep the potential tradition of the Evans).

But I'll just ask : do you think it's a very good idea for a parent to name their child after a song character whose only characteristic (outisde of her "flaming locks of auburn hair . . .) seem to be the fact that she is a homebreaker (at least it's what I understood from the wiki page) ?

*** Jolene wasn't a homewrecker. The song seems to indicate that the husband has very obvious feelings for Jolene, but we really don't know if Jolene reciprocated those feelings. The song /was/ based on a bank teller who had a crush on her husband, but Dolly Parton said it was a running joke between her and her husband.

*** If we can have a Harald and a Hadrian, we can have a Jolene. Also, that song is very popular in the North America and there are a lot of fan fic writers here.

**** Heh. You have a point - after Hadrian, the sky really is the limit. :D

Also, according to Wikipedia at least (I got curious and googled) the song 'Jolene' actually charted here in the UK in 1976 when the Marauder Era group were 16. This was also apparently when Sirius moved in with the Potters. Quite possible they went out into the Muggle World as a celebration and ended up in a record shop or something. :D

I do agree with PlusMortgage that they'd probably not seriously name a daughter after a homebreaker character though. Generally a child being 'named for' something indicates qualities or similarities the parents want said child to have or expresses some admiration for that thing. Lily doesn't seem the type to admire a homewrecker and neither of them seem the type to want their child to be envied for their looks or ability to attract partners.

This is something you'd probably /have/ to mention in an author's note somewhere, because James and/or Lily being fans of Dolly Parton would normally sound like a hell of an anachronistic Americanism.

****** Indeed it does. I love weird-sounding history like that - like Oxford University predates the Aztecs by a few centuries, and Mammoths were still alive when the Pyramids were being built. It's so fun. :)

**** Both Harald and Hadrian sort of make sense in the UK.

Harald due to old Viking populations there, and Hadrian due to the wall.

Jolene doesn't seem to have any relevance in that context, I believe?

** Because their British magicians who probably weren't too interested in country music. And when authors think of names for their female versions of Harry, they tend to stick to certain themes.

Variations of Harry (e.g. Harriet, Harriah, Henrietta, Harrieta) are quite popular with the common nickname: Harry, Harri, Hari.

The fan theory of James' family tradition of giving their children a true “British” name. Something that a prominent figure in history would have. Examples include Elizabeth, Victoria, Mary.

Or the popular assumes Evans family tradition of naming their daughters after flowers/plants. Names such as Rose, Daisy, Violet, Jasmine, Iris for the flowers. And plant names like Ivy, Willow, and Hazel.

Oh and Holly also up there on popular names writers in their fanfiction use.
