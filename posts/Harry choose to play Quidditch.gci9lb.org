** Ooooh, I just read a good one. It's a Snape/Harry so you'll want to avoid it if that isn't to your liking. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1566626][The Weather Outside]] by Sheankelor. Even though Harry is a quidditch player (and it's relevant to the plot), there is no actual quidditch in the story.
