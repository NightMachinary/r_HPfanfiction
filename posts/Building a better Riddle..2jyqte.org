Some fridge logic happened during dinner tonight.

What exactly was Riddle's plan in book 2? Did he have a goal? I've always assumed that his goal was his own resurrection... but then why not just sit tight and quietly gulp down Ginny's soul. Why the theatrics? Or is him regaining independent life something that I've adopted into my memory of canon erroneously?

And did he just /not/ know that a basilisk's venom could kill his horcrux that he spent all that time researching and making? That he was literally summoning the only way for harry to defeat him when he called on the basilisk?


** I got the impression - and my memory of Book 2 is a bit hazy, so don't treat it as gospel - that the diary was "pre-programmed" by Voldemort to seduce/control a student into opening the Chamber and terrorizing the school. Though it does have a piece of Voldemort's soul in it, it's not /sentient/ the way Voldemort (at that time, nothing more than a spirit) is.

You do bring up an interesting point, though. Presumably Voldemort wouldn't want a piece of himself, having sapped the life from someone, running around with its own agency, so just what was diary-Riddle's endgame if Harry had never come along? Would he go into some kind of sleep mode or something?

*** I agree with you that he was pre-programmed into opening the Chamber and terrorizing the school. But his whole plan changed, "months ago" according to the piece of Voldemort's soul. He had a new target: Harry Potter.

I always thought that his whole reason for the theatrics was to figure out what happened. As a piece of Voldemort's soul, it acts in a way that Voldemort's inner most person would act. In Voldemort's case, all he wants is to obtain immortality and invincibility. In order to do that, he can't just gulp down Ginny's soul and come back to life. He had to figure out how this stupid kid was able to defeat him. He had to understand how his track to immortality was sidetracked by a baby.

Then, after that he wants to kill Harry. As for why he called on the basilisk, perhaps because that was the only weapon at his disposal for killing Harry that he had. He could've come back to life to kill Harry himself, but maybe he did not want to risk coming back to life until the person that ended his first reign was killed. So, with really no other weapons to turn to than the basilisk he was originally designed to use to kill muggles, he tried to use it to kill Harry. One of Voldemort's major flaws through the books is his arrogance. Even if he knew basilisk venom could destroy a horcrux, he did not comprehend a situation where Harry kills the basilisk.

Assuming he had killed Harry, I believe he would've acted like a horcrux was designed to act, killed Ginny, and assumed life. As for what his endgame was if Harry had never come along, I have no idea. I believe all his actions were made in an attempt to lure Harry into the Chamber. Perhaps he would've just kept Ginny alive until Harry made it down there, or eventually he would have simply pursued Harry with the basilisk.

Voldemort's actions throughout the series defied logic in many instances. Some may see this as unrealistic writing. I like to think of it as Voldemort's blind desire for power and immortality led him to overlook details that he could not burden himself to notice. We know he wasn't an idiot: prefect, head boy, one of the most powerful wizards of all time. The only explanation for his mistakes is that so many of the qualities he lacked (the ability to love, empathy, friendship, etc...) led to holes in his ability to foresee the actions of others.

** Canon Tom Riddle's Diary had a simple plan. To drive Dumbledore out of Hogwarts, then to get it closed down while he resurrected in the CoS by killing Ginny. It was hours away from working, too, and all without Dumbledore even knowing. With the school empty, he could have escaped riding his pet monster and no one would have been the wiser. Toss Ginny's body out of the CoS (or even intentionally reveal it by leaving it wide open) and various gambits could be run. It was a great play, /especially/ compared to the brain-dead GoF "plot".

I think that babymort wasn't running on all cylinders.

Based on the splitting theory of Horcruxes (1st Horcrux: 1/2 of his soul goes into it; 2nd: 1/2 of 1/2, or 1/4; etc) the Diary was basically stronger than the shade that was at that moment zipping around Albania. If it had come back, it /would have been/ Tom Riddle more than anyone or anything else. And the Voldemort shade would have had a fight on his hands. One it would have lost /bad/.

Regardless, this was Tom Riddle unmaimed by years living as a shade or crazy baby thing, and not killed once already or snakified by a weird resurrection ritual. He was old-school Voldemort and he had the only plot that Dumbledore wasn't ready for in the entire series. It would have been the 1950-60s all over again for him, except this time he had a Death Eaters network all ready to go.

Remember, the CoS plot was the only one that Dumbledore didn't have even a /hint/ of how to solve. Ginny would have died and Tom Riddle would have lived again if not for really random Harry Potter decisions, ones not directly influenced by Dumbledore for once. It was a great plan, and I don't think adult Voldemort had really expected it.

I think the Diary /itself/ told Lucius what to do. That's why he thought it would take over Ginny and make her just do some Dark magic on some Muggle-born or something, embarrassing her father and ruining the Muggle Protection act legislation (that last part is pure canon, btw). I don't think Lucius would have intentionally tried to bring back Voldemort. He certainly hadn't tried it up to that point, a subject Voldemort (the shade resurrected) made very pointedly to several people.

That is true. The splitting, though, needs to either be relatively small "shards" or something close to this pattern, though. It can't be split evenly /over all horcruxes/ every time the ritual is done. That doesn't make sense.

This relates to there being a master soul, or rather the lack of evidence for such a thing. In canon, Voldemort has absolutely no knowledge of what is happening to his soul fragments. Nor does he show any sort of ability to control or recognize them even when in their presence.

In fact, there is no evidence that there is a special "feel" to horcruxes at all -- one good excuse for no one knowing there was something wrong with Harry's scar.

The diary, diadem, and cup weren't said to feel odd and it is only the locket that attempts to corrupt people in that specific way in canon (something clearly ripped off from Lord of the Rings). The ring was boobytrapped, which is why Dumbledore's hand rotted. That wasn't a horcrux property. If there was something odd about horcruxes, it was a slow burn type of magic. Something as subtle as the locket's corruption effects. Certainly not something Voldemort ever tried to use actively.

Just like he did the first time around in canon...?

Diary Tom was already inserted into Hogwarts by Malfoy the Elder. His network is in the same shape or better than at the end of GoF when Voldemort picked it up again. Nothing is preventing 16-year-old Tom from using Lucius to do something similar. If he already knows the basics of the Dark Mark (likely) or can figure it out, it doesn't matter what his form is (as was demonstrated by GoF's end). They will serve him.

***** There is actually very good evidence regarding there being a master soul. This is that the horcruxes don't anchor the soul fragments of other horcruxes to life. The only piece of soul anchored to life by horcruxes is the "master soul". If there was no difference between the pieces of soul in horcruxes and the "master soul", then you couldn't destroy a horcrux so long as another horcrux existed.

Indeed, if horcruxes and the piece of soul walking and talking were equivalent, then the "live" soul would act as a horcrux for the horcrux-soul, and the only way to ever kill the wizard would be to destroy all the soul pieces simultaneously.

You also miss a few possibilities regarding soul quantities. You posit two possibilities: horcruxes having tiny slivers of soul, or halving each time. You reject any kind of active redistribution of soul between horcruxes each time they're made, as do I.

But here's another possibility: a soul is infinite (compare: the natural numbers). You can split it but each part is also infinite (compare: into odd and even numbers).

And here's another possibility: the soul is quantifiable, but Voldemort planned in advanced for how many horcruxes he would make, and the wizard making the horcrux is able to determine how much soul goes into each, and therefore each horcrux is of equal soul quantity (until he accidentally makes one too many, unless he also planned redundancy).

I'm quite a fan of the infinite soul approach, but also like the "tiny slivers" approach.

I wasn't making a point about 16-year-old Tom Riddle's ability to command the Death Eaters, which I consider more of a vanity project than anything else. We saw how useful the Death Eaters are without Voldemort at the end of the First War, when their entire organisation collapsed within days.

No, I was referring to Tom Riddle's personal power -- his ability to beat people in duels. At 16, he can't hope to beat Dumbledore in a duel. 16-year-old Riddle never duelled Dumbledore in canon, as he was a student, so I'm not sure what you're getting at there.

****** There is also the "soul regrows" scenario and the "soul shatters the first time and random bits fall into horcrux" scenario, and quite a few more that I didn't mention. But the ones I did mention, actually have positive support in canon.

Dumbledore seems to think that Voldemort has lost something through making horcruxes, and that making more than one (other than possibly Harry) is so absurdly insane that it doesn't seem to be accepted by him until after GoF.

As for personal /magical/ power (which canon doesn't support very strongly as even existing), Voldemort has never counted on personally defeating Dumbledore as part of his plans. Anything he would do after a diary resurrection would follow the same lines.

A successful Voldemort plan has Dumbledore out of Hogwarts, out of political power, and only able to circle the wagons around a few blood traitors as the rest of the magical world falls under Death Eater control. Tom doesn't /have/ to try and defeat someone he suspects of possessing the Death Stick in a straight-up duel. Which is good, as the Elder Wand's single ability is being unbeatable in a straight-up fight when possessed by the true owner.

******* You have no idea how ironic it is that you're trying to convince me that magical power doesn't exist XD I've spent 7 years and tens of thousands of words arguing exactly that point.

Regardless, Dumbledore is way out of 16-year-old Tom Riddle's league merely as a result of skill. You don't need any concept of power. Tom Riddle is still two or three years away from being able to hold his own against Dumbledore at this point, I reckon.

All of the above horcrux mechanics involve losing something by making horcruxes. The "half every time" approach just seems so unbelievably literal and mathematical that it feels completely at odds with the fairy tale nature of HP magic.

I disagree with about the Elder wand. Firstly, it's fallible, since Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while he had it. Secondly, given that Dumbledore beat Grindelwald while Grindelwald had the wand, and given that Dumbledore was only "a shade more skillful" than Grindelwald, it would seem that the Elder wand did not give Grindelwald much of a boost at all. The only way I can see to explain this is that the Elder wand modifies your spells to the level at which wizards like Dumbledore are already casting. So the more skilled you are, the greater the diminishing returns on Elder wand utility.

Finally, I do think that Voldemort's plan requires Dumbledore dead. There's a reason he didn't enact his Ministry coup until after Dumbledore was dead. Any attempted coup before such time would undoubtedly had Dumbledore rushing to the Ministry's aid, and thus a duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore (or, if Voldemort wasn't there, then Dumbledore mopping up the Death Eaters single handedly).

******** It seems clear that Dumbledore didn't beat Grindelwald in a duel, or that Grindelwald gave up instead of being physically and magically defeated. The wand isn't merely "powerful", it was made by Death (whatever that means) to be undefeatable in a duel. It was only lost by true owners through deceit and trickery in non-combat situation, in folk tales and in canon.

My bet is, Dumbledore poisoned Grindelwald, tricked him into dropping the wand somehow, or emotionally berated him into making a serious non-magical tactical mistake.

If he said something like, "let's put down the wands and settle this like men," while taking off his shirt, I wouldn't be surprised.

If Dumbledore had lost political power earlier, this wouldn't have been the case. He never tried to storm the Ministry and replace the current government after Fudge's stooge tried to kill Harry, and then Fudge himself tried to magically castrate him, after all. Dumbledore worked within the system.

If he isn't part of the system, he doesn't seem like the sort of person to go /directly/ against established social constructs to do what he feels is right. That was his whole deal with his ex-boyfriend, after all. He clearly thinks those with personal power shouldn't just dictate to the people what is right.

I don't see Dumbledore as a private citizen attacking aurors in the Ministry like some magical Che Guevara after Death Eaters elect a pawn, even one mind-controlled. That would have been the endgame after removing Dumbledore from political office, and was what Diary Tom was attempting at Hogwarts. The other option was what he tried with Harry at the end of OotP, making Dumbledore lose or choose to sacrifice people one by one until he made a mistake. I don't think one-on-one was ever in the cards.

Dumbledore was, after all, the only person Voldemort ever feared. And Voldemort doesn't face his fears, he /flees/ from them.

If Dumbledore beat the Death Stick in a straight-up fight, that seems very significant, but he never comments on that. He also never says /how/ he did it. You'd think the techniques he used would be very well studied and widely known, if there was a good series of witnesses to the fight. But we don't get that, just vague reports.

I think you're getting the obituary confused with Rita Skeeter's book. It was Rita Skeeter's book which suggested your idea that the duel never happened, the Daily Prophet obituary - not written by Skeeter - that stated the accepted fact that Dumbledore and Grindelwald's duel was spectacular.

Perhaps you are forgetting the fact that both Mad-Eye Moody and Dumbledore saw through Harry's invisibility cloak, demonstrating its fallibility. Each of the Hallows is demonstrated to be fallible in this way. The cloak can be bypassed with magical detection, the Resurrection stone only brings back the shades of the dead, not true resurrection, and the Elder wand's owners are continually defeated.

You could be right. I've read that awful book only once, so details may escape me. But though that makes sense, but isn't more reliable.

In fact, that Rita would bring it up that way suggests there is a nugget of truth in it, as all of her stories were based on twisted facts. There is also the established canon fact that Grindelwald survived the "duel" relatively unharmed and was simply arrested after.

That isn't clear. Moody's eye could have seen any number of things, from Harry's shoes to the heat of his footprints on the floor around him to the air moving from his breathing. Dumbledore never said he could see Harry, only hinting that he had ways.

But those are the weaknesses consistent with the folk tales. The cloak didn't have a weakness in the story. And the wand owner is never "defeated" in the tales, but attacked in their sleep or otherwise ambushed.

I don't see any evidence for a rewriting or weakening of the Deathly Hallows simply because they fit the original story and have weaknesses. That is consistent with them having the powers from the story, not the other way around.

Dumbledore stunned one known Death Eater in self defense, and then did the same to his own man Kingsley, with a spell less severe than school children regularly used against each other.

He could have Mind Charmed the Toad and the Death Eater (as Kingsley apparently already had a schoolgirl) and no one would have known. Hell, he could have killed both of them and made the bodies disappear. No one could have proved anything and his foes would be gone.

In HBP, it was again a known Death Eater he hit in self defense. Hardly the bandana-wearing revolutionary.

And if you're going to assume massive convoluted duplicity, the oh-so-convenient appearance of Fawkes flashing into the Chamber - a bird that can carry Dumbledore - would seem better evidence of it. Afterall - let's be honest - Harry didn't kill the basilisk and diary-Riddle, Fawkes did. Fawkes blinded the snake, gave Harry the sword, cured Harry when he screwed up the job Fawkes gave him, figured out that the physical diary was Tom's weakpoint, gave it to Harry, and then carried everyone out. Harry was Fawke's sidekick.

This is not very coherent. /Can/ solve doesn't mean /does/ solve.

Of course Dumbledore know about the GoF plot, at least it's basic goals. It was clear someone was trying to kill Harry by entering him in the tournament. The way for Dumbledore to prevent that plot from working was to keep Harry as safe as he could, given the rules of the contest.

That at the end Voldemort also had it all wrapped up in some obscure resurrection thing to get around Harry's mother's protections was secondary, as he wanted to kill Harry too. Just in a weird, convoluted way.

Why would it matter if he defeated Harry's mother's protections so he could touch Harry if he planned on killing him in a "duel" the next minute? Would he have canceled the resurrection ritual if only Cedric had come over the portkey? Hell no. He'd have used his blood and gone without. That is why he was a "spare". But overall, it just doesn't make much sense.

As for the contests and how dangerous they were, it seems clear the contents of them were worked out ahead of time. And also that Harry was never in any real danger. Sure, dragons are very dangerous, and that was where his protections seem weakest. But remember that the movie version of that scene wasn't in the books. And Dumbledore was there with his wand watching the whole time. Harry's single injury wasn't even the most severe he'd ever had on a broom.

The lake was a joke and the maze was not instantly lethal at any point to someone with a wand. In fact, Dumbledore might have thought that Moody was sneaking around to /protect/ Harry, instead of messing with the other competitors. That would have kept Harry from being kill by giant spiders or such.

In the end, the portkey plot wouldn't have worked at all, except that Dumbledore had let /that specific/ portkey function inside Hogwarts grounds. That part of Voldemort's plot was really the oddest, and isn't ever explained in the books. Why couldn't Crouch Jr. just stun and /carry/ Harry outside of Hogwarts, and then move him anywhere, using any method?

Now I'm not saying Dumbledore /helped/ Voldemort's plot in GoF, only that he at least knew that there was a plot and what form it took.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  And if you're going to assume massive convoluted duplicity...
#+end_quote

That wasn't what I was saying at all. I'm not sure why this comes up every time with Dumbledore.

Of course Dumbledore didn't directly help Harry in the CoS. Sure, Fawkes gave him the tools he needed, but Dumbledore still didn't know the whole story until Harry explained. Dumbledore said Harry's devotion to the Headmaster was what drew Fawkes to him in the Chamber. This doesn't make Dumbledore a great manipulator or something.

In fact, it is strongly suggested that Dumbledore wasn't even in the castle when Fawkes acted. The Headmaster wasn't called back until they discovered that Ginny was missing and presumed killed. And even then, the governors had to write letters, travel time, etc. Fawkes acting alone based on some emotional connection to Harry is the only thing ever suggested in canon.

I'm not sure what the rest of that meant, but I hope that answered any issues you might have had with my take on canon events.

Look, we either take canon at face value or we don't. If we take canon at face value, then Dumbledore didn't know how to solve the CoS plot, but he also doesn't know how to solve the GoF plot - and Dumbledore doesn't even know the basic goal of the GoF plot.

In GoF Dumbledore is unable to remove Harry from the Tournament, he is unable to stop Harry from being abducted, he is unable to prevent Voldemort's resurrection. In CoS Dumbledore is unable to stop the petrifactions, unable to stop Malfoy from forcing him to leave, and unable to prevent diary-Riddle's resurrection. The only difference is that in CoS Harry manages to do what Dumbledore could not, and in GoF the best Harry can do is manage to escape with his life.

To assume that Dumbledore "can solve" these problems but chooses not to is to assume some massive duplicity. The idea that Harry was somehow safe from harm because Dumbledore was watching him so closely has no canon evidence. Never does Dumbledore or any character appear to believe that Harry will be safe from actual harm in the Tournament. It is explicitly stated that teachers cannot interfere in the tournament. (EDIT: If anything, in the third task Harry is actually held and bit by an acromantula and the text pretty clearly states that it is only luck and Cedric's help that he manages to not die. If Dumbledore was ever going to intervene, he would have. done so then. In the second task, Dumbledore has to talk to the mermen before he even appears to know what was happening underwater. There really is no evidence that Dumbledore was secretly protecting Harry from actual harm in the Tournament.)

Voldemort's basic goal in the GoF plot is to be resurrected using Harry's blood. He is successful in that goal. There is no indication, even the subtlest implication, that Dumbledore thought that was the goal of entering Harry into the Tournament. Everyone either does not know why Harry was entered or assumes it is some sort of assassination attempt. Even if Dumbledore was protecting Harry from true harm in Gof (without that ever being indicated in the text), he still hasn't a hint of how to prevent the real goal of Voldemort's resurrection and indeed doesn't even appear to know that that is a goal.

--------------

If we don't take canon at face value, there is no reason to think that Dumbledore doesn't have complete control of the situation in CoS. McGonagall knows that Ginny was taken into the Chamber before Harry and Ron find out. Harry and Ron actually sit around in the Griffendor common room from mid-morning (when Ginny is taken) to sunset, before going to the Chamber. There is no reason to believe that Dumbledore is not on site by that time.

  In fact, it is strongly suggested that Dumbledore wasn't even in the castle when Fawkes acted.
#+end_quote

No it isn't. Actually, the opposite is true. Harry and Ron visit Hermoine in the "mid-morning" skivvying History and learn that the monster is a basilisk. Then they are waiting for "break" (lunch?) in the staff room to tell McGonagall when they learn Ginny has been taken. They don't go down to the Chamber until sunset. This is at the end of May in Scotland, so sunset is quite late (8pm? EDIT: Actually, 9:30pm). When they go down, they don't look for any professor apart from Lockhart. When they come back up, Dumbledore is already there, composed and surprisingly knowledgeable.

Once Ginny was taken, McGonagall immediately decided to send the students home the next day, so the Governors were presumably told in quick order, near noon. Dumbledore is sent a "hailstorm of owls" by the governors as soon as they learn Ginny has been taken demanding that he come back "at once". So there is no reason to think that when Harry and Ron actually go down to the Chamber Dumbledore isn't already back at Hogwarts. If anything, the text suggests that he is.

  In CoS Dumbledore is unable to stop the petrifactions, unable to stop Malfoy from forcing him to leave, and unable to prevent diary-Riddle's resurrection.
#+end_quote

He didn't know why they were occurring. He didn't know about Voldemort /at all/, let alone the Diary Horcrux. That is all I'm trying to say. In GoF, he knew someone put Harry's name in the goblet, which is far, far more than he knew in CoS.

  To assume that Dumbledore "can solve" these problems but chooses not to is to assume some massive duplicity.

That's not a logical assumption to make. You clearly want a discussion about ManipulativeDumbledore that I'm simply not interested in.

#+end_quote

Why? Says who? To what end? Why /that way/? Without those answers, this doesn't seem to be a failure on Dumbledore's part. With Harry forced into the tournament instead of, say, /not/ being in repeated danger, his death was clearly something Voldemort was prepared to deal with. Dumbledore wasn't incorrect about that part of the plot, or that there was a plotter at all who surely worked for Voldemort in one way or another.

This timeline is confused. Harry and Ron find out literally the second the rest of the teachers do, right around lunch. That is when the attack happened.

Lockhart was still packing to run when Harry and Ron cornered him -- at, as you say, sunset. I don't hold anything more for that, as JKR repeatedly shows she sucks at time and calendar issues. That she'd nail this one seems...unlikely.

Dumbledore clearly hadn't returned yet, as Lockhart had claimed he knew the entrance and was trying to escape before he was supposed to go after the monsters that night. A suggestion McGonagall used to get him out of the way, but one he still took as a serious threat. He'd have been up in Dumbledore's office or gone already.

Because when Harry got back, there were people in Dumbledore's office, where Fawkes and the Hat were kept. Surely they would have noticed Fawkes grabbing the Hat and flaming out if they'd been there. Dumbledore and the Weasleys had clearly had just recently arrived, and were still with McGonagall discussing what had happened.

What you're suggesting is that Dumbledore got back to Hogwarts before Harry and Ron went to see Lockhart, but the Headmaster then delayed talking to the Weasleys until /after/ he sent Fawkes to Harry. That is certainly possible, but seems to go against everything canon says about the situation. A great jumping off point for an Evil or Gray Dumbledore fic, but not a clear view of canon events.

******* I don't want a discussion of manipulative!Dumbledore. What I'm saying is that claiming that Dumbledore has any control over events in the GoF necessarily implies manipulative!Dumbledore.

If you take canon at face value - which we both do - I think it is clearly implied that Dumbledore has no control over events in either GoF or CoS. Given that, I don't understand your original claim that CoS is the only plot where "Dumbledore didn't have even a hint of how to solve".

Yes, in GoF Dumbledore knows that Harry is stuck in a dangerous Tournament. In the exact same way, in CoS Dumbledore knows that the "Chamber of Secrets is indeed open again" and a monster is petrifying people. In neither case does Dumbledore know how to use that knowledge to solve the plot. In neither case does that information appear to help Dumbledore do anything.

There are two ways of looking at this. Either Dumbledore knew this was the plan, and he failed to prevent it (which we both agree that canon doesn't suggest). Or Dumbledore didn't know that this was Voldemort's plan, in which case Dumbledore didn't know what Voldemort's real plan was, anymore than in CoS Dumbledore didn't know that the real risk was not the basilisk killing students but diary-Riddle's resurrection.

My point from the beginning is that if you accept canon, there's no reason to think that CoS is special. Dumbledore doesn't know what's going on in CoS, but he also doesn't know what's going on in GoF. In both cases he has some vague understanding of a plot, but doesn't know the real threat the plot poses and doesn't know how to prevent the bit of the plot that is obvious. He can't stop the basilisk and he can't protect Harry, and in both cases the real problem is something he appeared to be entirely unaware of beforehand.

At break-time, when Harry and Ron learn that Ginny is taken and the teachers get rid of Lockhart, Dumbledore hasn't returned. Many hours later, at sunset, when Harry and Ron go to Lockhart and then down to the Chamber, there is no reason for Dumbledore to have not returned. Lockhart is fleeing, but that is the obvious implication of the break-time meeting. There is no reason for Lockhart to know whether Dumbledore has returned or not and nothing Lockhart says implies either way.

Dumbledore could have returned anytime between the break-room meeting (which we assume is sometime around noon, but frankly could have been a break well before lunch - the latest time we have before the meeting is "mid-morning") and when Harry and Ron see him (which is presumably sometime around 11pm). But everything that Dumbledore says implies that once Ginny went missing he was promptly alerted and returned quickly, suggesting that he was back at Hogwarts in the early afternoon. Even if JK thought sunset in May was at 7pm, there is no reason to think that Dumbledore wasn't back well beforehand.

When Harry and Ron come back, Fawkes guides them to McGonagall's office. The Weasleys are not sitting around Dumbledore's office, there is no reason to believe that people were sitting around Dumbledore's office to see the Hat being taken. And there is no textual implication that Dumbledore had just arrived at that point.

Indeed, when Harry and Ron see him, Dumbledore already knows what is going on as far as anyone does and suggestively more. He is "beaming" but not shocked by Harry and Ron's appearance (perhaps Dumbledore did see Fawkes flash out, we have no knowledge either way, he just seems unsurprised compared to everyone else). Dumbledore immediately understands from Harry's story that Ginny was ensorcelled by Riddle while everyone else is stunned. He has already taken command, he knows that Pomfrey is still awake, knows that the mandrake juice is being given out.

So, no, I think that, if anything, the text suggests that Dumbledore had been at Hogwarts for quite a while before Harry and Ron returned and very likely from before they went down in the first place.

EDIT: For what it's worth, I also don't think the Weasleys just arrived. Their daughter went missing before noon and they only arrive after sunset? Regardless of whether that's 7pm or 10pm, that doesn't make any sense. Presumably McGonagall flooed them, they immediately came through and they've probably been worrying in McGonagall's office the whole afternoon. Certainly there is nothing in the text suggesting otherwise.

** I wouldve liked it a bit more LOTR-esque. Where we didnt really see Voldemort and he was just there in the background controlling things. The main thing of the build up in PS, was that he was this oppressive background character imo till the end anyways.

** Easiest explanation is that Voldemort didn't know the Horcrux could /come to life/ by being imbued with life force (from Ginny).

To me, the diary goes against the ethos of a Horcrux, where the active, main Voldemort /can't die/ because part of his soul is protected, thus the piece of soul residing within him is bound to earth in wraith-like state if his body is destroyed.
