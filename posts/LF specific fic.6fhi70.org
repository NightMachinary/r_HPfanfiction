I remember the trio, but mainly hermione, were trying to perform a spell to make them be able to understand crookshanks, since he had seen something they needed to know. This has been in my head for a couple of days, but i can't remember which one was it. Might have been hermione-centric


** I think you're thinking of female-Ron in linkffn(weasley girl by hyaroo). The understanding Crookshanks part happens in the sequel, linkffn(weasley girl: secrets of the past).

  Sequel to "Weasley Girl"! Potter's Gang are back for their second year at Hogwarts, and face a dramatic escape, a mysterious diary, a strange cat, a "loony" girl, a hidden monster and many past secrets coming to light. It looks like this year will be at least as eventful and dangerous as the previous one.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
