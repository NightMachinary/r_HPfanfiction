I would really like one at least 100k words long but doesn't have to be.


** There's this one and its sequel. It's complete and the sequel is brand new, just updated the other day, ongoing. It's a Harem fic (tho' there's no sex shown on screen), not a Harry/Daphne only fic. The sequel is a Stargate SG1 crossover...

..additionally, it's one of the few fics that does Magical Science right (or maybe Scientific Magic?), so there is that.

  Harry finds himself thrust into his four-year old body, after Voldemort killed him in the forest in what would have been his seventh year. Knowing what he did, he decided to fix some things he never had a chance to before. He'd not go into the magical world untrained this time. OP Harry. Science, magic and discovery. Harem.

#+begin_quote
  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

#+begin_quote
  When a more studious Harry Potter entered Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming. A Ravenclaw Harry story. Warning: child abuse, character bashing, and pureblood society.
