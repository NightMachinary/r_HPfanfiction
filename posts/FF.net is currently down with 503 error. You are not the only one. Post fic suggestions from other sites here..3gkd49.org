** For anyone who was in the middle of reading a long fic like I was, I was able to find a .mobi of the story to read in an app from here:

[[http://p0ody-files.com/ff_to_ebook/]]

Click the link that says archive and search for what you were reading. (if you get a plain page with a file upload box and nothing else, change your mobile browser to desktop mode. Took me a minute to figure that one out)

(I skimmed the sidebar to make sure, so I hope this is allowed)

** Dang the site that Harry Potter & The Soulmate Bond is from is pretty sexy... I'm totally digging the colors and the looks. Just needed to share that.

I'm planning to try out the story itself.. it actually looks like a promising romantic story with drama (I think) even though it uses soulbond.. but I never had a problem with soul bonds existing in a magical world.

I've done enough network administration to know this, but ffnet really isn't that large, and with how few people work on it, I wouldn't put it past them to make that mistake even if it has been almost 15 years. Actually, that probably makes it even more likely as people get lazy unless it's automated.
