I'm currently searching for new fanfiction to read in which Harry is smart, powerful who hides his abilities (but in a realistic way - enough to be able to take on two aurors at the same time, but below the level of Voldemort / Dumbledore).

​

My personal favorites are:

​

1. Harry Potter and the Masked Marauder (Once you get through the first few chapters this became the greatest fiction I've ever read)
2. Deprived (This battles and characterization are amazing)


** I'll never not recommend Linkffn(Antithesis) under "realistic". Author does an amazing job

*** It's a very interesting fic, but he's not very smart, he makes dumb mistakes all the time. He's also not especially powerful (compared to how he could have been with the training he got)

**** Exactly! He has such potential especially when he is at the Dursley's and all he can really do is read and practice. But then the author doesn't continue with it and we only see his power when he gets pissed. Which admittedly is quite often as he seems to have the emotional range of a toddler.

I'm on chapter 42 I believe but haven't worked up the energy to finish it.

***** What annoyed me was that he was actually smarter in the beginning but then he begun to deteriorate and make dumb mistake after dumb mistake. I suppose it is because he is mentally unstable but still.

******* True, I don't hate the fic, I'm actually reading it right now and I think it's interesting. It's just that, as you said, it's not good for someone who wants powerful Harry.

****** I think it would have made more sense if he had been really getting into the dark arts at a younger age. Over doing it with those kinds of spells at such a young age could have really warped his mind and made him a lot more unstable, similar to how Bellatrix acts.

I also really didn't like the whole deals thing he does with other students. At first I understood it as a way for him to make a name for himself and to be seen as useful to his fellow students. But the execution was weak and pretty boring. Plus he doesn't even save his money or buy anything all that useful; instead he admits he spent a majority of it on spoiling Hedwig.

I want to see how things end bit I'm sure it will be a let down.

******* Is it? I'm about in the middle, right after Dumbledore has to break all of Harry's deals and now he has no clout in his house anymore. I really want to read about the light aide finding out about Harry/Adrian but it's been like pulling teeth for me. I still really can't get over what he did to Ginny and I've never even liked her as a character.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux)

In this one, the part of Voldemort that is inside of him awakens when Harry is still a child and starts manipulating him in various ways. He also teaches him a lot of spells and Harry is really powerful for his age. He's also smart (able to craft his own spells at a young age) but also kinda naive when it comes to the voice inside his head.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

Just linking OP's fic recommendations.

Edit to add below reply:

Bot didn't work. Perhaps OP means [[https://www.quotev.com/story/3104674/Harry-Potter-and-the-Masked-Marauder/1][this one]] on Quotev for the first? Explains the failure of the bot. Perhaps [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7402590/1/Deprived][this one]] on FFN for the second. +I'll update my above comment to add this.+

****** A Google search for "<fanfic name> fanfic" generally works, too, especially for stories on odd sites. Google search is far better than FFN search at displaying relevant results, so using the pattern "<fanfic name> site:[[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]]" is always helpful if you know that the story is on FFN or any other particular site.

Incidentally, the same trick works for Reddit too. Its search feature is remarkably substandard for such a large product and company.

In both cases, surrounding quotes are omitted from the search, naturally.
