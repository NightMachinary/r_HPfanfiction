I say Hermione shipping but really its Hermione centric anything in fanfic. You know how alot of people complain about how Movie Hermione cut out Hermione's flaws and took alot of Ron's and sometimes even Harry's positive qualities?

I kind of feel like fanfic Hermione does that alot too. And maybe even more so than the movies did. Except its not so much that shes stealing other peoples moments. Its more like shes the one exelling while others just aren't nearly as much. I guess kinda Mary sueish. But as a result everyone else kinda seems boring or uniteresting compared to her. So it makes me really dislike Hermione romance in fics because the other character seems boring compared to her so their interactions are boring too.

Harry has this issue too in alot of Dark or Independent Harry fics. But I can easily find fics where Harry is not depicted in that way. Hermione its harder to find a alternative for.

Is thia just me? Am I just finding only the shitty Hermione fics? What do you guys think?

*** I think it's funny that people (including Hermione herself) treat her like she's the Fount of Common Sense and Logic, when her own common sense fails her a bunch of times over the books.

*Year One Hermione*

#+begin_quote
  "Brilliant," said Hermione. "This isn't magic---it's logic---a puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic, they'd be stuck in here for ever."
#+end_quote

.

*Year Seven Hermione*

- Chapter 15:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.

  "It's impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you've already got some---"

  "Well, don't bother increasing this, it's disgusting," said Ron.
#+end_quote

Months and months of starving in a tent. But then, somehow...

- Chapter 16:

#+begin_quote
  They had just eaten an unusually good meal: Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left) and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears.

#+begin_quote
  Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed towards him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry's head and he tried to push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: he and Hermione had already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione's sleeve.

But they did visit the muggle supermarket for perishable foods, in the quote above. For some unknown, illogical reason, it took them months of wandering around in the tent to do that, after Ron left because he was hungry and stressed.

******* Checking the chapter where it happens, it looks more like a severe case of JKR's plot railroading than Harry/Hermione being deliberately thoughtless or illogical.

#+begin_quote
  There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak and kidney pie that Harry, Ron and Hermione would never eat.
#+end_quote

They escape the house, Ron gets splinched, Hermione explains that Grimmauld is now unsafe because everyone who knows about Grimmauld has become a Secret Keeper after Dumbledore's death, and she showed Yaxley the secret. Harry feels sorry for Kreacher...

...and then the narration skips over it and Kreacher is not mentioned or thought about for the next couple of chapters. The entire purpose of them leaving Grimmauld Place was because the plot needed some more tension and conflict - the characters aren't allowed to feel too safe and happy, because they're soldiers fighting in a war, dontcha know.

Other than the showdown in the cafe, sneaking in and out of the Ministry to yoink the locket off Umbridge, and Malfoy Manor, there aren't any. Unless you count the Battle of Hogwarts. Throughout most of DH, the trio didn't participate as active combatants because they were on the secret mission to locate and destroy the horcuxes. The whole point was to be sneaky or Voldemort would become suspicious and move the hiding spots.

However, JKR wanted it to still /feel/ like a war, so the "War is Hell" aspect was done not through actual combat and killing, but making the characters face deprivation and suffering. By having the trio make the dumb decision of living in a tent and eating mushrooms off the ground.

The reason why fanfic fails at conveying the tension of war is because fanfic authors aren't as good as JKR at conveying tone and establishing atmosphere. Rowling's absolute pants at math and logic, but she's perfectly capable of writing strong feels.

** Well, you'll find that sort of 'super power'/'perfect' situation for any character really, depending on the author. Harry is the prime offender, just because he's the MC of so many fanfics - so there'll be a ton of terrible power fantasies including him.

Hermione does lend herself to it as well, but for a different reason - it's because in canon she's the smartest of their year, abnormally so, and is often used as a plot device to bring in certain knowledge/new inventions. When you've got a super smart character, who excels in canon, it's not that hard to tweak her to be a bit more focused on the /right/ things and not have brain farts to make her amazing.

In terms of the Harry/Hermione pairing, I'll confess that I tend to consider that more the 'default' pairing, but that's me. I don't consider it any better or worse than any other pairing, really, but Harry/Hermione always fit together better in my view.

In terms of fic quality, I've found that the pairings don't really matter there - you'll find good and bad quality ones with any of them. I suppose it's like Harry - there are so many Harry/Hermione fics out there that there's bound to be a lot of terrible ones - particularly if you're someone that doesn't /really/ like Hermione much. (Means you'll be less willing to overlook minor flaws or to see them as more important, whereas someone like me who /does/ like her might not even see those as really a problem in the work).

***** I just use it as a shorthand way of saying she's not the most brilliant student Hogwarts had ever seen. Also she was portrayed as a stressed and harried throughout the time she was using the time turner to attend two extra classes. Like butter spread over too much bread. Her tendency to over-prepare and over-stress before exams casts doubt on assertions that she'd be able to get through OWL year with 12 subjects. Not because she doesn't have the intelligence for it, but because her bad habits would lead her to give herself a workload that was too high.

***** What makes the 12 OWL record remarkable is not just an intelligence thing (I don't think it's ever mentioned whether those OWLs were Outstandings or merely Acceptables), it was that the people who earned them had the diligence and had put in the hard work to take those classes up until the Year 5 exams, /without a Time Turner/.

Hermione took those classes. She dropped them because she thought Divination was hocus-pocus nonsense (it's /magic/, of course it's not scientific) and Muggle Studies was too much for her schedule, after she gave back the Time Turner.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/time-turner][According to JKR on Pottermore,]] Hermione was the only Hogwarts student /ever/ to get a Time Turner.

#+begin_quote
  *"I had Hermione give back the only Time-Turner ever to enter Hogwarts.* Thirdly, I smashed all remaining Time-Turners during the battle in the Department of Mysteries, removing the possibility of reliving even short periods in the future."

Just wanted to point this out. I personally believe that a student earning 12 OWLs is and /should be/ recognized as a great achievement. Hermione might be capable of getting 12 OWLs, but she /didn't./ To me, your statement of /"she's definitely smart enough to pass both classes, she just chose not to be in them"/ is the difference between being a Navy SEAL and being "that guy" in the local bar who says he thought about joining the army but didn't because he would, like, totally have cussed out the drill sergeant on Day Two.

****** See that never made sense to me, and I think part of the issue is JKR's continuity. It's made pretty clear in PoA that Hermione physically could not be in all her classes without the Time Turner. However, if others had done it, then either it was a quirk of the classes that year, or you can take the exams without being in the classes. There's no real reason then why Hermione would need a time-turner, but of course she ends up having one.

My point is, I think that this area isn't really fleshed out, and I don't see any point using it in the overall Hermione point when there are other points to consider.

****** That's a complete false equivalence. She didn't take the classes, not because she isn't smart enough to, but because Divination was being taught by an absolutely shit teacher and she didn't need Muggle-Studies being a Muggle-born (she basically took that class just to see how Muggles were seen from a wizard perspective). She quit both to lighten her workload. This doesn't actually say anything about her intelligence.

Also, I don't believe two of the Weasleys got 12 OWLs unless they did some kind of independent study over Summer, or took the extra exams after independent study post-Hogwarts. Since they didn't get Time-Turners and it's literally impossible to take all of the classes without one. This is just another example of JKR being shit at math and consistency.

First of all, Pureblood children are also shown to have no idea how to perform magic before Hogwarts. Ideas about Pureblood kids being allowed to practice before Hogwarts is fanon. Also Hermione is never shown as being particularly knowledgeable about wizarding culture. She didn't know what "mudblood" meant until Ron explained it to her, and she didn't know that house elves were slaves until she went down into the kitchens and met them. She had never read Beedle the Bard or known who Babbity Rabbity was until Ron told her.

She is also most likely the oldest in her year, her birthday being in September. While I don't want to take away from her being the top student in her year, being older than everyone else at that age certainly helps. (Research shows this helps both academically and athletically [[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/08/18/544483397/oldest-kids-in-class-do-better-even-through-college]]). Harry is capable of casting a corporeal Patronus that clears a field of Dementors at 13. Draco repairs a Vanishing Cabinet, an expensive and rare piece of magical equipment, at 16. Her yearmates have their moments.

What.

I think inconsistencies like this is why Fanon Hermione is not as commonly derided as OOC as Fanon Draco (AKA, Draco in Leather Pants). People don't know what Canon Hermione is really like, because Hermione goes back and forth depending on the requirements of the plot. She's intelligent, but forgets important things (Nicholas Flamel, Devil's Snare, how to shop at the muggle supermarket when everyone was starving in the tent in DH). She's strongly moral, but will blackmail and kidnap human beings, and permanently scar her classmates for revenge. She protects and defends sentient magical creatures, but also mocks them when she's feeling petty.

Because she read about it in a book she mentioned to Harry when they first met. I can easily see her following the taboo, not because she's genuinely afraid, but because she sees it as a rule she should follow. But yes, Hermione's characterization is very inconsistent, especially post GoF.

****** When I said wizarding culture or practice, I intended in the sense of 'culture or practice' as one phrase - wizarding culture or wizarding practice, as in, the wizarding manner of going about things. Not practice in the sense of practi/sing/ to do magic.

As to your other points - yes, that's exactly what I meant. /Despite/ starting at an older age than any of her classmates - non-wizarding culture having had longer to permeate her mind as normal and her then having to re-learn everything essentially from the age of 11 going on 12 - as I said, one of the oldest in her year, /and despite/ not having /any/ of the /basic/ frames of reference that all wizarding-raised children have, she /still/ manages to top the year in every single subject with the odd exception of Defense by the time it comes to taking her OWLs.

Those are in my mind some pretty big handicaps to overcome in the first place and nevertheless she is able to excel through hard work and grit, yes, but natural talent too - she gets Wingardium Leviosa, for example, off the bat in the Charms lesson, she is fast at Transfiguration, etc. etc. It's hard to tell her specific strengths as we venture further into the books because less and less time is spent in a class environment.

This... Is certainly one take on things. But not necesarily one I'd agree with. They aren't asked to completely change their sense of self or learn a new language. The magical subjects taught are not things Pureblood children know automatically. Exactly what basic frames of reference are pureblood children shown to have in class that muggleborn don't? I'd be interested if you could show from the canon text anything to back this up please.

Please refer to my first comment. The idea that Pureblood children get extra time to be taught magic before Hogwarts is fanon. It is never shown anywhere, from books 1 to 7. The scenes of her rapidly learning magic are there to show us how intelligent she is, and to establish her character to the reader (assertive, a bit of a know-it-all, proud of her achievements).

******** Well, we don't have a lot to go on from canon as the only young wizard we see any detail on is Ron Weasley,and canonically Ron Weasley is pretty lazy and work-avoidant, as well as - implicitly - kept from helping his mother round the house with the magical domestic tasks - given that every time we see Molly ask for help she only asks the girls in the vicinity.

However, logically at least some of the kids are likely to pick up some details and at least their basic logical paths from their families by osmosis. Just like if you stuck a kid from, say, an African tribe into an American high school at age 11 you might exoect them to have an adjustment period to how things are done differently there.

Logically, wizard and witch children have someone in the house with them growing up, whether its mom,dad, or some kind of childminder. This adult witch or wizard will be doing magic and the kid will watch and pick up some ideas. Sure, they may not be able to practice it themself, but they'll pick up some idea of what spell to use for what task, maybe some basic theory. How to grow plants or at least some idea of what the plants in their garden /are/ and what to expect. Stories of magicalcreatures, references to their history and that of the wizarding world,maybe some ideas of what potion ingredients tend to go together, like cheese and tomato or carrots and parsnips, etc.

Hermione is going in /completely blind/ without /any/ of this. And /despite/ that she excels above any other student.

I guess for context, flip it. If any of the other wizarding raised students had found out they were a squib and come to high school in the muggle world at age 11 with zero context or grounding. If one of them had then gone on to top the year in every single subject, it'd be pretty damn impressive, no?

We also see Neville and Seamus struggle through the curriculum despite being raised knowing about magic. Ron is only lazy and work avoidant compared to Hermione. Most other children of that age would do the same things Ron does, and are often shown doing so. Scenes of Ron skiving off work and pulling Harry along are scenes that are supposed to show Harry getting over the Dursleys' inhibition and finding a true home at Hogwarts.

I get what you're saying, and I somewhat agree. I just don't think it's such a huge disadvantage when the children aren't allowed to practice magic and don't show any special accelerated learning when in school. Of course the Harrys of the world would be caught out, but the Hermiones of the world would have read several introductory texts at the library.

I studied biology at university despite not studying it during high school. All it took was extra reading during the first semester courses because I lacked the background most of the other students had from high school. It wasn't nearly as hard as I made it look to my peers ;).

#+begin_quote
  I guess for context, flip it. If any of the other wizarding raised students had found out they were a squib and come to high school in the muggle world at age 11 with zero context or grounding. If one of them had then gone on to top the year in every single subject, it'd be pretty damn impressive, no?
#+end_quote

Well keep in mind the discussion earlier this week theorising about how wizards probably pretend to be a lot less knowledgeable about muggles than they actually are as a sign of prestige. I would think that first year would be pretty impressive, but in the following years it's just business as usual.

Yes, this is another example of how studious and determined she is. Polyjuice is, again, something that older students learn as a matter of course when preparing for their NEWTs.

The Weasley twins are constantly inventing potions, enchanted objects and charms. Snape invented several curses while a Hogwarts student, some quite lethal, as well as refined potions beyond what the textbooks (no doubt written by an expert) had. The Marauders become animagi before 5th year, and create the Marauders Map, achieving the task of plotting the unplottable. Going back further, Dumbledore showed his OWL examiners magic they had never seen before.

Hermione is not abnormally smart at all. She uses what she learns (and she learns a whole lot), but she's never shown to create new magic, nor does she have any feats that match or exceed those of the people I've described in the paragraph above.

She can get frazzled easily and can be very insensitive because isnt the best with emotions, her own emotions or other people's emotions. She's not the best at understanding how her words could be interpreted or how others react to her. So she's not intelligent in the way young Tom Riddle is either. He had to be very minipulative in a way that required he be able to understand how others felt and how they perceived him.

But often in fics when they make her smart they make her smart in all the ways shes not too and so others don't get a chance to shine and she gets less oppurtunity to grow( at least in my opinion).

I once got into a really dumb Who-Would-Win debate between Hermione and Young Tom Riddle, in the comments section of a Ao3 fic (obviously not the best place to post such an argument, lmao). I said that Tom was more intelligent, in terms of creatively applying his knowledge, and emotional awareness when it comes to manipulating other people. Hermione has her research abilities, and empathy which allows her to form and maintain friendships, but never truly /innovates/ the way Snape or the Twins do.

I was reamed out in the comments. It made me realize the extent to which fanfic perpetuates an idealized version of Hermione, repeats and recycles fanon ideas, and I imagine that Hermione's true canon personality and character (without the intervention of Steve Kloves) has been lost in the void. And though it's not wrong for people enjoy this version of Hermione, I was surprised to see how much of a figurehead to them Hermione, or the ideal of Hermione, had become.

#+begin_quote
  "Your interpretations of Hermione and Tom's characters are largely influenced by ingrained expectations and gendered power dynamics of male and female characters in fiction. Then, any disparities in skill/intelligence are smoothed over with claims that the female character is more emotionally adept, and/or morally sound. Which is not to say that these aren't valid strengths, but *rather that they adhere to sexist expectations of male-female traits."*
#+end_quote

In the world of female-led fantasy, Fanon Hermione must be a breath of fresh air. She's intelligent, capable, brave, determined, goal-oriented, and has a strong sense of justice that makes her a Good Person, but this also confers on her the agency to make things "right" when she notices wrongdoings. But it's just strange how often making her the protagonist results in Hermione scrubbing out the nuance and most of her weaknesses, because Fanon Hermione is never allowed to cry, and never feels upset when she's afraid or rejected.

Something I've noticed from reading the comments/reviews sections of fics, is that fanfiction authors get more flack for giving their protagonists reasonable shortcomings than they do for making them unreasonably OP. Making characters powerful will turn some people off, but the majority of readers will enjoy it. And depending on the degree and nature of a flaw, giving them to your MC will result in readers complaining, which isn't conducive to establishing the broadest range of readers.

Notice in Pet Peeves threads, how often people complain about Harry fics where he is some combination of angsty, depressed, gullible, victimized, or unable to bang the girl he wants. They're the majority of people compared to those who complain about Harry being too OP; in fact, people laud OP Harry, as long as it's written in a reasonable way and not King of Magic ridiculous borderline-parody levels.

So tl;dr - you're in the minority for identifying with Hermione for her flaws and human weaknesses. Most other readers identify with her for her strengths.

******** This is /such/ an interesting perspective on the idea of Hermione in fanfic - especially if female writers are writing her as this because of a push back against the traditional male fantasy hero in the genre.

As someone who writes Hermione-centric fanfic, I do my best to try to keep to "canon" as much as possible... but to me, fanfiction is more than me exercising my writing ability; it's also escapism and fantasy for me to write and read Hermione (the character I identified with, in memory, as opposed to Harry -- I'm sure reading the series is feel different now) in different scenarios and situations that her canon character never experienced. And that means changing her traits or personality at times to suit the narrative.

Of course, if she's written to an extent that I feel isn't exhibiting the "essence" of Hermione, I won't read it.

That's my main issue with why I can't enjoy most Strong!Hermione fics. The story doesn't make me feel that the author has truly captured - or even understands - what the essence of Hermione is. What I've most often seen is her intelligence and loyalty touted as Hermione's defining traits, the qualities that make Hermione who she is, and the more you pump it up, the more Hermione-ish the MC is, right?

My opinion (colored by gender-coded expectations, of course 🙄) is that Hermione's essence and defining qualities are in her flaws. She's a high-achiever whose self-esteem depends on validation and affirmation of her abilities, which is why she raises her hand in class and takes it so personally when Snape calls her a know-it-all that she gets tears in her eyes. Her boggart is being told she is a failure. She enjoys being the smart one of the Trio, being relied on for coming up with answers to the big mysteries, and takes an emotional hit when she feels her friends don't need to rely on her that much anymore - the HBP textbook was a blow to her ego, and so was Ron choosing Lavender over her.

I think fanfic can write Hermione a number of different ways to suit any plot, but this desire for recognition is what makes Hermione... Hermione. This is the reason why she was sorted into Gryffindor and not Ravenclaw.

*** Im not opposed to power fantasies and I actually once upon a time really liked Hermione power fantasies. But the thing is I hardly ever see her outside of that context. Harry Ive seen positive depictions of when he's not depicted to be a powerfantasy.

My problem is two fold

1. Hermione unlike Harry is never depicted in a way where shes not a powerfantasy so not only does the depiction itself get stale but the characters around her have to be less interesting as a result because the focus is on making her look cool not fleshing out characters and sometimes it might make charcters come off as dumber to make her look smarter or by accomplishing the same thing with being dismissive of the accomplishments of other characters while highlighting her accomplishments. Which hinders her potential romances for me since I now care about Hermione but not anyone else.

2. Flaws are what make characters compelling because that way you can feel good when they over come them and have arcs. You can still be critical of the flaws and be aware of them while loving the character. By removing all the flaws and making her so perfect she has less room to grow. This can still be fun cuz she will have other narrative obstacles but shes now confined to the powerfantasy type story if its not a bashing story. And her depiction gets stale.

   Its not so much that these kinds of fics cant be good they are ive loved several. But the lack of variety has starting to make me bored.

If I don't want to see Harry as hypercompetent or super talented I can find fics with that. Even ones where he is a major character. But I can't do that with Hermione very easily if at all. Again that doesn't make it bad but its samey in a way that fics that focus on other characters arent and despite liking the character I find my self looking for stories where shes less relevant to have variety. And to have others get the spotlight too.

It's possible - or I would even hazard, /likely/, that a sizeable portion of powerful! and/or independent!Hermione stories, even stories with a pairing, now, are being written by writers who came up on weak!Hermione and supporting!Hermione fics and have decided firmly /not/ to fall into those characterizations in their own work - sometimes swinging the pendulum far in the other direction in the process.

This lack of genuine female- minority- Queer representation has been fueling a great amount of fanfiction writers. In an A.U world you can make the female most proeminent character- Hermione- into your own version of protagonist. You can imagine a Harry Potter gay-bi-biracial...you can genderbend...you can make them powerful because you yourself are not...

Incidently, that was part of the strong negative reaction to GoT. Many were watching as a female empowerement fantasy series and the end resorted to the worst of Standard male nerdy farei: women are too emotional...If they are horny and get no dick, they Go NUTS.

*** I mean yes though for me Mary Sue isnt so much a hyper competent female lead or a op female lead. Its making that op character the main focus and making the story just about ways to make them look cool. The problem isn't Hermione is bad ass and strong. Its Hermione is bad ass and strong at the expense of making her flawed or interesting or giving her a arc or giving her actually challenging obstacles that will make her grow as opposed to make her look cool. It also is at the expense of having other characters be fleshed out intetesting, or talented. Because the focus becomes making her look cool because you want others to appreciate her like you do other aspects of the stories suffer like the romance and/or her character growth.

This isnt unique to Hermione but it happens most with Hermione in my experience. Even more than Harry who does have this potrayal often but its just as easy to find him be competent without being a Mary Sue

Its definetly possible to make her talented and competent while still giving her flaws and challenges to give her an arc and letting other prople get the spotlight too. But its also really easy to get caught up in making her look cool which is why this happens i think.

But making her smart talented and the protagonist doesnt have to mean making her Sueish.

Which isnt always bad it can be fun making her very smart in all the ways to beat all the obstacles in creative ways almost effortlessly. There are tons of Mary Sue protagonists that are fun and I really like. But if thats all there is or its hard to find alternatives it can get tiresome or boring.

And often by trying to make her this super smart and talented badass the actual personality and unique qualities Hermione has are lost as well.

**** But this- making Hermione competent at the expense of her own canon flawed nature- I think is often more about not experienced fanfic writers. The difference between what you think you are writing and what actually is written can be jarring. If you take into consideration many young people are writing stories, then it also comes with being naive. Obviously, there are authors more concerned in bashing than anything ( and I am a sucker for a good bashing) and in such stories, most times, they overpower one character at the expense of the author more for plot sake than anything.

But yes, let´s take Robst for instance: his whole style is BASED on this idealized version of Hermione and Harry. So, his stories are about This Hermione and how amazing she is and well, IMO they are fun the way they are because he intentionally wrote this way and, although not a great author, Robst is very sucesful in selling his Hermione to his audience.

Mary Sue, Gary Sue, for me is any given protagonist that is given a TOO good to be true hand. There are some authors I see rec again and again here, especially when time travel- fix it are being requested, that make Hermione into this sex goddess- all marauders have a crush on her; Lucius serve her, not the Dark Lord etc. There is one in particular I find utterly ridiculous, as she keeps this relationship with Remus, despite not being his " soulmate" and is also in love with Sirius?

So, to me, this- enhancing Hermione attractiveness to absurd levels just because( unless, of course, she has her soul transported to a more attractive body)- is a much worse sin than making her the ultimate genius. ( unless, of course, she has her soul transported to a more attractive body)

And many members of the fandom now are at least in their 20s both current writers and readers. So i guess I may sometimes might assume that the people writing or reccing fics are older than they are.

She's not particularly great at DADA in canon.

In any case, skill levels are so obviously railroaded to keep the canon plot going, arguing that Hermione shouldn't be this or that smart is just arguing personal preference. JKR for example described Hermione as "borderline genius" - that covers a lot.

*********** No, it's just discussing a book. You can't have a personal preference saying Hermione only got 10 OWLs and is worse than Harry at defense. She was the only person to get a time-turner to take classes, yet multiple people got more OWLs. Borderline genius might mean she's smart, but she's not going to suddenly outclass adults or even other smart kids years ahead of her. And it does not mean diminishing other's achievements.

Now for writing or reading a fic, yes it is. You can have a super-powerful Hermione, especially in an AU. But whether it's any good is doubtful. Keep in mind this goes for Harry and any other character.

But canon rehashes that are so popular? No, making a super powered character is just wish fulfillment.

Canon contradicts itself all the time because JKR didn't really think things through when she added stuff. The Time-Turner mess is one, Dumbledore taking a broom to fly to London another, the whole thing with the trace that rings every damn "The GM made a mistake and pulls a weak excuse out of their butt" bell, the economy, people suddenly forgetting that they can multiply and enlarge food, and so on.

But worst contradictions are the characterisations. Dumbledore is the best example, pretty much reduced to a plot device instead of a character since if he were a real character, Harry wouldn't have had half his "adventures".

That's not a contradiction, that's a choice. People can fly and often choose to do so. It might not be logical to order a cab when I can drive.

Rowling left that in there to explain why they didn't just conjure food, but because the explanation wasn't perfect, it's just nitpicked at.

You're again looking at him from differing perspectives. The first books were reminiscent of things like Matilda or Charlie and the Chocolate factory with exaggerated adults. Arguably the only thing Dumbledore did wrong was keep Harry in the dark about why Voldemort was attacking his mind.

He would have easily found out who was doing this - Malfoy heads the list, after all, and a few probing questions would have confirmed it since Snape wouldn't be able to answer without violating his oath.

Dumbledore had a bloody list of Death Eaters and sympathisers, and a gung-ho Ministry in year 6. And he pretty much knew every wizard from Hogwarts - and, thanks to Snape, also knew the worst bigots. He could have given a list to Scrimgeour and stopped the whole Ministry takeover cold by getting the worst of the bigots arrested and thrown into Azkaban. And executed after drowning them in Veritaserum. And he sure as hell would have told Harry, Hermione and Ron all they needed to know, including some Occluemncy training, instead of wasting his last year on "Tom Riddle, the Home Videos" and leaving cryptic hints. Would he have been able to do anything more about the Horcruxes? probably not. But Voldemort's takeover attempt would have failed if Dumbledore had actually been able to be more than a shitty plot device.

** I think it is more problem of Harmony or really Hermoine-centric stories (some of them, I think linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) are not that bad, not of Hermione as such. And yes, of course most Harmony-stories are based on the movie Hermione, because according to [[https://angua9.livejournal.com/204545.html][their philosophy]] there cannot be conflict in her main romantic relationship, which makes them usually rather boring. More or less canonical Romione can be fun, which is the reason why for example they work pretty well in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][the Northumbrian stories]] (although particularly his Hermione is not the best written one).

**** Yes, it was wrong to have it there without a qualification. Yes, it is rant, yes, it is over the top and mean, but on the other hand, when you tone it down (significantly), it is the best description of Harmonians philosophy I have ever met. And yes, not everything labelled Harry/Hermione follows the philosophy, but despite all its proclaimed realism many stories follow this pattern to the crazy length.

E.g., linkffn(Notebooks and Letters by chem prof) (and I intentionally use rather good story with a very nice basic idea). You know what is the worst conflict between Harry and Hermione over which Harry is broken for many chapters. When (literally) naked Cho throws herself on him, of course he doesn't sleep with her, but he kissed her back. And he was somehow disabled if I am not mistaken. When basically Hermione slaps him over his head, that he was an idiot, and the crap happens, that's the last time there is any conflict between them. That makes their relationship quite unrealistic and boring.

Or in most Harmony fics that incredible feeling of superiority over everybody while doing horrible things in fact. I have still never got of the shock of my attempt to read linkffn(The Augurey by La-Matrona) and I have even written [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/augurey-or-loosing-of-sanity.html][a blogpost]] as self-therapy.

*** I mean conflict is a way to dramatize romance for sore. But personally I don't think conflict is necessary to make it interesting. Its a bit like friendship in stories. You don't need them to fight for their interactions to come off as interesting. It can be very interesting to see them just interact with each other and help each other grow. Maybe just bounce off each other and overcome problems together. I do think Harry and Hermione are chatacters that would butt heads occasionally though and trying to fight that tendency is unnecessary. But the point isn't they should be fighting. The point is they should be flawed so they can help each other grow so they have things to overcome . That would be what makes the relationship compelling. If the focus is on Hermione and Hermione is given no flaws to work on it doesnt really work for her
