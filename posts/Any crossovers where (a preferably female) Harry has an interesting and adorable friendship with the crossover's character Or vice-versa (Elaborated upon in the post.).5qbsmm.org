Found [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/swords-and-sorcery-fate-stay-night-harry-potter.399084/][Swords and Sorcery]], a crossover between HP and Fate/stay night, a few days ago. It's a basic Shirou getting de-aged and thrown into the HP world, but I was surprised by the interactions between him and Harry's female counterpart, Iris (also somewhat---pleasantly---surprised by her characterization: I don't read a lot of HP fics, so maybe it's because of that, but I think she is done a little differently than most fem!Harry's I've read).

The story is certainly not without its flaws, and it has fallen into a fair number of pits that, unfortunately, many fics fall into, such as the scenes where a character, after their abused past (or insert something similar) is found out, offers to end a friendship, which sounds like a platitude more than anything else, really, considering how much it is used. Even so, I found myself enjoying the story, despite the fact that Shirou (the main character of the fic) is far from my "favorite characters" list.

Have any of you ever read something similar? I'd point out which fics I've already read (quite a few, actually. Especially in the fem!Harry area. Dunno why, but I like those, despite being a perfectly ordinary dude), but it's been at least two years since I read my last one, so my memories are kinda foggy. Therefore, feel free to point out the stories which you may find obvious. New ones, too.

Thanks in advance!


** A fic on spacebattles. I've read some great stories on it but also some horrible ones. I always wonder if I miss any gems because I barely check the forum.

Do you also want any romance fics or not? Because there are two Tony(IronMan)/femHarry that come to mind. linkffn(The Observer Effect) and linkffn(Blackdog).

I think the Observer effect was rather good, not sure about the Blackdog tho, it's been a while

*** I'm fine with romance, although I was hoping for stories where she's a kid.

That said, I've read the Observer Effect already. Not Black Dog, though, so that might be fun! Thanks!
