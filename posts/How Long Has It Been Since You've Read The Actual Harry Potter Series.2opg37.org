I was just thinking about it this morning - when it comes right down to it, I haven't read all seven books, cover to cover, since 2010-ish. I've skimmed various sections for reference when debating various sections of fanon/canon, but I haven't actually sat down and read them like a story in quite some time.

How long has it been for you? Do you think it would be strange to read the novels again after reading so much fanfiction? Do you think some of your fanon perceptions would be challenged? Do you think you'd still enjoy the source material?


** The last time I read anything from the actual Harry Potter series of novels was when I finished reading The Deathly Hollows on the night of it's release. It's been a long while for me.

That being said, realizing how long it's been really makes me want to go back and reread the series properly.

*** But could you really stand it? I know I couldn't. Simply been reading too much fanfic. I don't like the pairings in the books or the number of small details that should or could have gone differently.

** I've technically never read them. I listened to the audiobooks. Why would you ever want to read something when you can have Stephen Fry read it to you? The last time was probably a year or two ago, if skimming for reference doesn't count.

*** Audiobooks are amazing. One of my fondest memories is listening to /The Dark Tower/ books 2-5 on tape during a long, long road trip.

** Sometime close to 2007, when I threw my copy of Deathly Hallows at the wall after finishing it. My headcanon: There is no canon, only glorious fanfiction. Rowling is a pretender that doesn't know what she is talking about. Goddamnit.

** It's been a couple of months, I do a reread once a year. I'll reread individual chapters/chunks if I need to look something up and the context for it, and I will reread individual books if the lines between canon and fanon start blurring too much.

** I got into fanfiction around 2005, coinciding with a general slowing down of my rereading of the original series. While I've read every volume multiple times over the years (even having read the first five volumes aloud to my son a couple of times when he was younger), I've actually read the whole series in one go and still haven't read any of the HP Apocrypha (/Tales of Beedle the Bard/, /Quidditch through the Ages/, etc.) Probably the last time I read a HP canon book cover to cover (figuratively) was 2012, when I was stuck waiting in an airport and realized I'd grabbed my son's Kindle instead of my own.

I do reread sections when writing fanfiction in order to make sure I have the general sense of events (sometimes they get mangled or misordered in my head otherwise). I probably read sections of /Goblet of Fire/ a half-dozen times when writing /Dagger and Rose/.

** I tend to pick them up out of order and read a bit when I feel the need but haven't gotten through the whole series for about 2 years.

** I haven't read any of the canon books since shortly after Deathly Hallows came out. I didn't start reading fanfiction until about March of this year though.

** I haven't read all of them since 2010, but I read Philosopher's Stone earlier this year and I am planning to make my way through the rest of them again. (Of course, I said that earlier this year, before reading PS... it /will/ happen, just no telling /when/ exactly...)

** I did it this spring! I had a great time. Definitely interesting to go back to the source after the fan fiction.. changes my perceptions of some characters a LOT.

The biggest thing I noticed is that the whole series is told from Harry's POV. Duh, yes, but it's strange to go back to that after reading fics that swap around or focus entirely on other characters. It definitely got me interested in reading fics about side characters (LUNA, you guys) and side stories -- e.g., Hogwarts during the 7th book when Our Hero wasn't there. I read a lot more canon-consistent stuff right after re-reading all the books.

** It's been a few years. I've tried to go back and read them all again but I get distracted. I wanted to earlier this year when my boyfriend started reading the series for the first time, but I got busy couldn't fit them in.

** It's been years. It's got to the point where I confuse fanon with canon at times. I should definitely give them a reread when I have some time one of these days.

** I read the series quite late, maybe 2011? But I haven't reread them all since.

I went through a phase of rereading certain books - I think I read OotP several times, PoA about the same and HBP maybe once; all over the year and a half after I read them all.

** I just re-read the series about six months ago. I still enjoy them but I do feel like my opinions about characters have been influenced by fanfiction.

** I havn't reread it in a while, but my cousin and I just watched the first movie for the first time in years. My god they did such a great job with the casting and capturing the wonder of the world. Also, I realized I had developed a hatred of Hagrid and Ron through fanfiction, which makes him out as a dangerous fool, and of Ron who is portrayed as useless.

I would be honored to know someone as kind as Hagrid, and Ron sacrificing himself at the chess board hit me hard.

Fanfiction has warped me, I need to reread and watch everything.

** The last time was when DH came out for me too, but fanon is definitely better. I didn't actually like them all that much until I discovered fanfic.

** About three or four years now. I tried to read them a fourth time maybe a year ago, but by this point I had already started reading fanfiction so I stopped about 100 pages into Book 1. It's hard to give a shit about rereading the books when there's great fanfiction, or great regular fiction, to be read.

** Mmm... I read the first few books when they came out... up till OotP.... never read anything after. Saw part one of the DH movies. Yeah, my entire knowledge of everything after ootp is from fanfics. I have no idea whats canon and what is merely popular fancanon.
