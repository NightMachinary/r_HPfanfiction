** I thought you were talking about gease for a moment... like a differentiation between malfoy's peacocks and potter's gease... hummm riveting social commentary potential there.

  supernatural ability which certain people can bestow upon others.

Though they're probably talking about a specific ability Harry would have, rather than the ability to bestow an ability.

It comes from Cohde Geass. Don't know much about the show beyond people having different abilities bestowed upon them...

**** my guess is that he's talking about the ability that the MC of the show had, if he looks someone in the eye he can give them one command that they will carry out. There are a few more specifics, but no need to go into them.
