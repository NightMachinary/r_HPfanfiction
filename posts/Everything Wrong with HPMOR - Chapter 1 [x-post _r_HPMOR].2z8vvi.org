  /...blood spills out in litres, and someone screams a word./

Foreshadowing. /*Ding!*/

#+begin_quote
  Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows.
#+end_quote

Damn. I mean, I know Harry's supposed to be smart, but seriously. Your house is literally /covered/ in bookcases, and you /still/ have an excess? /*Ding!*/

#+begin_quote
  and their adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.
#+end_quote

Unnecessarily long names. /*Ding!*/

#+begin_quote
  And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to
#+end_quote

Lily is either being uncharacteristically mean [by usual fanfiction standards], or she /actually/ heard a prophecy to that effect. */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that's what a Good Parent would do
#+end_quote

Unnecessarily Capitalized Words. */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  "Mum," Harry said. "If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There's a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation - that you just have to look at the world and report what you see."
#+end_quote

As far as I can tell, their argument wasn't even /about/ the question of what is scientific and what isn't. */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  "I don't want to win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once -"
#+end_quote

Trying to guilt trip a scientist into believing magic. */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  /Where do you come from, strange little prediction?/ Harry directed the thought at his brain.
#+end_quote

Harry is arguing with himself. */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  /Sincerely,/

  /Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres./
#+end_quote

Does he /really/ sign all of his letters with his full unnecessarily long name? */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  "Well, the letter got here somehow," Harry said, "so I'll just wave it around outside and call 'letter for Hogwarts!' and see if an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?"
#+end_quote

Harry thinks this might work. */Ding!/*

#+begin_quote
  Then a boy's voice said, calmly and quietly, "What."
#+end_quote

Flat What. */Ding!/*

*** Most of the criticism I see has to do with how much of the author's opinion makes its way into Harry's thoughts. Sort of a self insertion I guess.

** It's easy to criticize the first 10 or so chapters. Even the author thinks it's bad, and he thinks everything he does is God's gift to the world. Also he doesn't believe in gods, but that's not really relevant. Which is not to say that what you're saying is /wrong/, just repetitive.

Try starting at somewhere like chapter 13 for more meaningful critique.

** I'm glad you X-posted this here. :)

Personally I don't think that's enough sins, the book one in particular killed me though. Although it's really weird even just seeing snapshots of the beginning chapters how different in tone it is to the rest of the fic.

I hope you continue with the rest of the fic

Also probably worth mentioning to people if you aren't familiar with the format of this to check out cinemasins on youtube (earlier videos are better and shorter).

** :D Still in the mirror, I see? This was very nice, a tasteful homage to both HPMOR and CinemaSins.

Minor nitpick, but here the capitalization is completely necessary! :) The author is conveying the concept that these terms may as well be proper nouns for all the A) amount we say them verbatim over and over and B) lack of meaning they contain.

** I see this format working if you don't /just/ go about HPMOR

If you go through popular fics and tear them apart like this, I'd digg it.

Once again fueling the anti-HPMOR circlejerk... meh

**** as a place to start it definitely is. But I see it becoming old quickly if you stick with HPMOR

But if it was a request from [[/r/HPMoR]] then stick with your audience, I'd say.
