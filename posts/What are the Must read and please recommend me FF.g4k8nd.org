- Please lost of chapters or more that 100k words.

thanks you in advance.


** If you insist on FFnet, I can give you [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]], but here we can see already how AO3 is just superior for reading. FFnet has unordered mess (or ordered by dates of publication, which is completely useless for later reading). [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian on AO3]] has all stories ordered by the stories time line and I found it generally a way more readable.

  Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. Harry Potter and the Cthulhu Mythos clash.
