** They seem to be their own race of being in Harry Potter, not just some curse that spreads to others like werewolves.

We know that they are classified as beings like goblins and hags are(unlike werewolves who still count as wizards unless they're transformed), Percy also mentions that hunting them is illegal under laws about the treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans. We also know that they seem to have their own culture considering the author in Slughorns party was writing a book about them. They also seem to be able to breed with humans, Rowling mentioned a wizard singer being part vampire on her old website.

** We know next to nothing about vampires in the Harry Potter universe. We don't know if vampirism can be spread through bites, or if vampires are a separate race of beings. As such, it may have been impossible for him to turn into a vampire.

** Well for that I think maybe it would be like how canon Dumbledore said Voldemort did not want to be dependent on the Elixir of Life - having to regularly drink it - so if he was a vampire he would have to regularly find people to blood suck! So I think he would hate that too. Even more because he would actually have to rely on PEOPLE!

#+begin_quote
  "While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain the immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you, but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended to continue to rely on his Horcruxes."

** A) Vampires have to die before they rise, and Voldemort was terrified of death.

B) He would have to trust a vampire with his life.

C) Vampires have a whole host of weaknesses (presumably).

D) DADA courses would regularly train children to murder him.

E) He would still be vulnerable to a host of magic that Horcruxes would defend him from, including the Killing Curse.

** I read a fanfic once where Tom Riddle tried to explore that route but learned that vampires don't have magic because they're not alive anymore, and active magic use is tied to life.

** We don't know how vampires work in the Harry Potter universe (other than Sanguinis, a "half vampire" none are ever seen), but I would guess "control." In most vampire mythos, the siring vampire has domination over the fledgling; I can't see Voldemort conceding control to anyone else, even with insurance plans like having his minions kill his sure immediately.

Limitations like sunlight vulnerability would probably also be a factor.

** Because vampires /aren't/ immortal. At least, they aren't in any mythos I know of, and we don't know nearly enough about them in the HP verse to assume that they operate differently within it. They don't age, yes, but if he gets hit with a killing curse, he's still just as dead as he'd've been as a normal human. Horcruxes were a safer bet.

** Well, we don't know enough about vampirism in Harry Potter. Presumably there are some downsides to it - perhaps like lycanthropy, it has mental effects, or it's not guaranteed to happen, or you need a full soul for it to happen. If you're looking at it from a fanfic's perspective, you could justify either way.

From canon's perspective, it's mostly that vampires are there for worldbuilding - JKR likes to throw in references to fairy tales and stories in the world, a way to connect magic/the magical world to our real life stories. But they're only there for a light bit of background, really - nothing more.

Amusingly, one of my favorite stories has that exact same question you have - it's played more for laughs, but the protagonist's first thought is that Voldemort is /already/ a vampire.

** Because if Harry Potter vampires have half the weaknesses they do in other fiction then Voldemort would have dismissed the idea of being one outright.

** There had to be a huge downside. For instance, if HP vampires are vulnerable to light, they teach that spell to first years.
