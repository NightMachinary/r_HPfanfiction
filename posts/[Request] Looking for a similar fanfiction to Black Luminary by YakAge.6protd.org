** The thing is Black Luminary hits a lot of popular cliches - but in contrast to most of fics doing them, manages to do them right.

So there is the political background with the cultural conflict between muggleborns and purebloods which reminds me heavily of linkffn(Pillars of Power by SeriousScribble).

There are scheming Slytherins and Harry with overcomplicated plans, the best I can think of is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man), flawed but still interesting read.

Harry has sort of similar relationship to the one with Rose, with Cecilia Quirrel in linkffn(Old Blood by Oil on Canvas).

If you specify what aspects you liked, I may be able to find something more.

*** Thanks for the recommendations and I agree with pretty much what you said.

Also what I liked... Its kind of hard to put but I honestly liked the whole Yule holiday thing very interesting with lots of Harry and Professor Rose moments, I just straight up liked how the author executed it, usually you'll see that Harry acts like a Casanova and bags women like no big deal but here it really showed an actual 13 year old. (Not gonna lie, the "romance" of sorts made me really happy, internally.)

Also, I really liked the family above all matter. Harry having great relations with Lestranges and Malfoys and just actually showed what the relation between Blacks and the aforementioned houses should be.

As a big fan of the ship Harry and Daphne, I really liked the new Daphne here, everyone makes Daphne seem like ice queen who is melted by Casanova Harry in a couple of days.

Sorry for lots of specifics!

  For the Ancient and Noble House of Black, the height of power marked the beginning of its decline. A game of politics, for personal gain, for the good of everyone... but using Voldemort's rise to prevent a war was a gamble.-- Winner of DLPs January Contest.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300][Black Luminary]] - Non-BWL (at least it seems so) Harry adopted by Blacks in the world where some of the old pureblood families (Bones, Prewetts, etc.) made a power move after Grindelwald's defeat to get other old pureblood families (Blacks, Lestranges, Malfoys, etc.) out of the politics using protecting muggleborns' and half-bloods' rights as an excuse. Strong wordbuilding, slow pacing. Just finished the first year.
