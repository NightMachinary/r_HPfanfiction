I already know some famous like ultima ratio, choosing grey, please save me. I wanted something like those ones but is actually hard to find. Anyone?


** While I usually don't really care for this pairing, a while back I had an odd craving for it so I read a couple of fics. Among these, the one I liked the most was linkffn(Have You Ever by Lady Moonglow)

The Riddle portrayal is a bit implausible here though.

  With the war looking bleak, the Golden Trio, Ginny, Draco, and Lavender go back to Tom Riddle's 7th Year to destroy Lord Voldemort once and for all. What Hermione DIDN'T count on, however, is a shared common room, a curse, and a crazy little thing called love.

******* It's quite long, but I personally enjoy it. Hermione is badass on this fanfic and Tom still bad and dark so I think it's more believable. I don't need to say that I really love this one and I've already read it for like five times. I sure if you get into the story you will like it ;)

Edit: If you liked it or have more suggestions you can send me a message! I would love to read more or talk with someone about it

**** Here it is!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15707220/chapters/36506895][Nothing Like The Sun]] Really, really well written. First few chapters are a little tedious but it's SO worth it. Basically, Tom Riddle is born in the 1990s with the trio. Unsurprisingly, they don't like each other very much. I won't say anything more for fear of spoiling it. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10643571/chapters/23549517][Blood and Gold]] Not usually the type of fic I'd go for, but I ended up really enjoying this! If you like political intrigue/mystery you will certainly like this. Set in the 1950s where Hermione poses as Hepzibah Smiths' niece. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5012851/chapters/11520664][Addendum: He Is Also A Liar]] Reading this one currently. Tom has the ability to time travel.. but only to Hermione and her time, oddly enough? Lovely fic. Hasn't actually gotten to the romance yet, and it hasn't updated for a while but I refuse to give up on this fic! I love it too much. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936][Birds of a Feather]] Set in the 1930-40s. Hermione meets Tom at the orphanage (she isn't an orphan, though) and they become friends, yay! I like that Tom is still very manipulative and at times cruel, but still has a capacity for kindness (towards Hermione, that is.) A little slow for my liking but still a good read. Eventual romance. Sorry for bad formatting, I'm on mobile lol.

***** I already know Blood and Gold and it's really good! The others I have no idea and I will give it a try for sure - I love a dark Tom so I think I will start with Birds and Feather. I'm excited, thanks! No problem, I feel you - I'm on mobile too :/

****** To be honest, Birds Of A Feather is probably one of the less dark ones lol. I'd recommend Nothing Like The Sun, he is most definitely dark throughout the whole fic. I don't want to spoil anything but he does some pretty bad stuff.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7728303/1/unsphere-the-stars][unsphere the stars]] This. The best tomoine fic I've read in a long time. It's refreshing to see some plausible characterization without “bleaching” Tom's character. He's still perfectly amoral without being the near-comical evil. I find that people usually either make him so evil it's unrealistic, or as if he's a misunderstood teddy bear. I won't say any more because I don't want to spoil. There's a bit of suspension of disbelief necessary in how Hermione gets sent to the past, but it's easy to get sucked into the story

** Strange Attractors by Orange et Blue Morality [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12734980/62]]

Unspeakable Granger wakes up with missing memories in Hogwarts...in 1942. Way back? What way back? If there's anyone who's too,used to making the best of things, it's her. The least she could do is to drag the wizarding world kicking and screaming to the 21st century (that prejudice has to go - and oh, the things she knows...). But there's someone here that makes her brain itch...

This is hands down my favourite fic, it's so well-written I would like it even if Tomione wasn't really my thing. It's often mentioned that Hermione is the 'Brightest Witch of Her Age' but rare that you actually get to see her intelligence. This is a fic that really shows the depths of both her and Tom's knowledge. One of the few Tomione fics where neither Tom or Hermione are completely ooc. Every element of the story is so clearly researched

#+begin_quote
  A new killer causes a worldwide media sensation by committing crimes so depraved, that they're creating a global panic. It appears that he chooses his victims random, but they're always accompanied by a riddle that leads to the next one. Only Special Agent and Consulter Hermione Granger can stop the killer---if she can solve his most complex and terrifying puzzle. Will she see through his game before her time runs out? Or will she lose herself in his maze of terror?
