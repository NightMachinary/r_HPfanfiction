** Judging by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/topic/62357/32941085/Title-A-little-light-reading][this forum post]] and a few other pages I saw from a google search, Dullastacks withdrew from the fanfiction world following the deletion of her fics from FFN, and in the light of potential real world publication she won't be returning.

** She posted a news update to the CaerAzkaban yahoo!group as /sylein/ back in February of 2013: her novel was published in May and has been picked up by Universal for a movie adaptation. (Msg#237507 in that yahoo!group, if you want to slog through the new Neo web-garbage to read the comment-stream for her how-it-happened.)

**** OOOooookay.... Well, that's silly but harmless. Everybody know that a Yahoo!group message number will always equal either shocking purple, or, if done in Neo, turd-brown. Of course, on my Lovecraft-influenced Linux desktop, it'd be the color "out of space".
