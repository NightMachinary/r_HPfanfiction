So, I've been reading an Iron Man/Harry Potter crossover on AO3. It's titled Proof That Tony Stark Has a Heart. However, it has been orphaned. I'm unaware of a way to find any books written by the same author after they have deleted their account, and I was wondering if anyone knows who wrote this, and what else they may have posted?
