** My favorite time travel fic is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]]. It's not one of the scenarios you asked for, but rather Harry goes back in time to kill an infant Voldemort. It's worth a read!

*** Wow, what a premise. It sounds like The Terminator, but from the perspective of The Terminator.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233539/1/The-Last-Marauder][The Last Maraurder]] is a rl/hg fic. But it's a good, and /very/ long one if that's what floats your boat.

** So many. I really need to make a list. Time Travel fics are my passion. Esp Golden Trio going to Marauder, or Second Gen time-travel. I've also read some Mara going into the future. If I dont edit/comment in a few days, PM me. I probably can make a list of a least a dozen stories.

Any preferences? Complete, in progress? abandoned? slash? Non-slash? Just let me know

*** I LOVE time travel. I like Harry centered. I don't mind slash (I have a love for Harry/Vold and Vold raises Harry, I once read a Harry raises Vold but I can't find it)

I love dark-harry or Harry going back to save everything. Show me some stories?

**** I might of come across the one where Harry raises Tom. I know I have one (the 3 Marauders) where Tom is his older brother.

Ok, once I actually sleep, I'll have to remember to just compile all the TT stories I have into some sort of list. I've needed to do this for a while anywho

** I'm currently reading [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4801140/14/Mysterious-Thing-Time]]

Harry and Dumbledore go back in time but things get screwed up and Harry is still a baby but with his adult mind.
