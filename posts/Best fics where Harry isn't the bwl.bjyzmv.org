Best means well written and good plot/action. Also probable I've read them already :))

Not slash, H/G or H/Hr

Bonus points for avoiding the cliche abused Harry taken in by Voldemort, Malfoys etc.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185), is then my top pick for this category. Just because he was raised by his loving parents doesn't mean he's a nice guy though. On the contrary, this Harry is far more vicious than in canon.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

** Well as you probably already read them, it's likely unnecessary, but just in case (and for the other viewers of this post):

The Other Boy Who lived is one I haven't seen recced here in a long time, so maybe you haven't read it. Some interesting concepts in this one.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived]]

The art of self-fashioning is a great, dark story, likely my favorite completed fic that has Neville as the BWL. Really enjoyed the development of Harry's abilities.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]]

​

HP and the Boy Who lived the most obvious one, fantastic world building, I really liked how the author developed the Durmstrang educational system, shame it's incomplete:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived]]

​

No Knowledge, No Money, No Aim is a fun, incomplete fic. Has the whole nobody knows how OP OP!Harry is trope.

  [AU] A decade ago James and Lily Potter made an extreme choice to protect their son. Now, Harry Potter enters the magical world and tries to make sense of his past to understand his future. Maybe he can avoid a cycle of mistakes. And out of sight, unbeknownst to most, looms a prophecy with strange ways to be fulfilled. (Dark Harry, no bashing, no children politicians) [7/33]

** I enjoyed linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) . It's very similar to linkffn(Prince of Slytherin) but I found I enjoyed Den of Snakes and the Sarcasm and Slytherin series a lot more. It gets less AU. Another very interesting WBWL is linkffn(Antithesis) , one of my absolute favorite fics of all time

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
