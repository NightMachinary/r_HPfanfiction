I'm an avid reader of Harry/Snape (non-slash) and Hermione/Snape pairings. I prefer Snape to be the snarky bastard that he is, even if he softens a tiny bit over the course of the story. I can't stand a Snape that is too nicey nice! ugh!

I especially love fics with heavy emphasis on Occlumency/Legilimency training, Potions/Dueling/Dark-Arts training, and soul-bonds/blood-bonds/mental-mindspeak-connections lol.

​

I've got a few I'm still reading and don't want to list here until I've gotten far enough into them to decide if I would recommend them or not.

​

I am open to other fanfic scenarios about Snape, because I've definitely enjoyed a few, but I really prefer him interacting heavily with Harry or Hermione. I'm NOT interested in male slash at all, but it's fine if it's just going on in the background with secondary characters and I can ignore it. Female slash is fine, but I don't have anyone I ship in this particular fandom.

I do not like time-travel fics in general.

*Please make recommendations of your favorite Severus Snape fics!*


** You've got The Boy Who Died A Lot by starcrossedgirl listed as non-slash, when it is in fact a Snarry fic and was an entry in the Snape/Potter Big Bang fest. The actual sex doesn't happen until the end, but that doesn't mean it's a mentor fic.

Also, when you list something with a / between the names, you're identifying them as a ship. Snape/Harry leads me to expect slash, a romantic and/or sexual relationship. If you want to be clear that it's not, the standard fannish shorthand is Snape & Harry. As a slash reader, I looked at the list titled Harry/Snape and thought, "What?"

** Hermione/Snape was my first pairing, and I read literally nothing else for years. I've read easily hundreds if not thousands of stories, but some of your suggestions as well as some others in this thread are new to me. Thanks!

Besides the many good suggestions already listed, here are some of my own:

linkffn(Of Muggles and Magic by Aurette) This is probably my #1 favorite HG/SS story, and Aurette is one of my favorite authors. A Regency AU (but still with magic).

linkffn(Better than Life by anoesis) Cute little post-DH oneshot

linkffn(Just to Be by Amarti)

The Marriage Benefit by miamadwyn on Ashwinder: The Board of Governors decide to give married teachers nearly twice the salary of unmarried teachers, so in protest Hermione and Snape get married. This story has probably the best aweful-first-time-having-sex scenes I've ever read.

linkffn(Unfinished Business by Ramos) Not DH compliant. I'm surprised this one hasn't been listed already--I see it rec'd decently often. Another favorite.

The Letter by alexa83 on Ashwinder: Severus acts on a note he received from who he thought was Hermione. It was not. Cute and fluffy.

linkffn(The Fire and the Rose by MetroRhos) This one may not have aged well (it was published in 2002), but it was one of my first fanfics I read (and the first I remember specifically) and so I still enjoy it for the nostalgia factor if nothing else. It's a body-swap fic while Hermione's still in school. There's a sequel (not of FFN, you may have to dig for it), but if I remember correctly it's pretty bad.

linkffn(His Draught of Delicate Poison by Subversa) Another that is good perhaps only subjectively rather than objectively. AU as of pretty early--GoF if I remember correctly. Definitely before we knew any of Snape's backstory. This one is based on The Grand Sophy, a Regency-era novel by Georgette Heyer, but is not a Regency AU itself. Snape is a wealthy pureblook and is dating Fleur. Hermione decides to break them up via sneaky machinations all while hooking all of her other friends up with each other. Snape discovers what she's up to and turns the tables on her. No smut, but still a bit of a guilty pleasure for me.

** I have read thousands of HGSS fics. So I'm definitely keeping this brief. But if you like what I'm about to suggest maybe you could give me deetz on more specific things you like and I can get you more.

First up, my favorite bit of silly snark is /Big Name Death Eater/, which is pretty tame in terms of the shipping, so it's less likely to offend the anti-HGSS crowd that seems to be downvote-happy in this sub. linkffn(2533891)

Next, get thee to the Wayback Machine to access the [[https://web.archive.org/web/20151209122636/http://www.witchfics.org/][WitchFics.org archive]]. It was an exclusive club of Snapefans with a strong HGSS emphasis. This is pre-MLC, and I don't think you'll find much if any time travel. There you will find Anna's /Roman Holiday/ trilogy, and Abby's work is all gold (there's a subtle LOTR influence/crossover with /The Other Side of Darkness/ that I appreciated more after becoming a LOTR fan too!), and pretty much anything else in that archive is a good bet.

Since you are on Ashwinder, check out the author [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=2560][southern_witch_69]] who has 18 stories and excellent favorites lists to crawl.

I'm also fond of [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewuser.php?uid=75698][grangerous]] whose /Phoenix/ series weaves through Books 6&7 -- one the best I've seen in terms of keeping HGSS canon-compliant, and also addresses what I consider one of the bigger plot-holes/dumbledore-fuckups of the series.

If you're amenable, could I pm you later this summer when I finish the outline for a Snape/OC epfic? The OC is the main perspective through the events of Book 6&7, but it delves frequently into mind magic and soul magic with a lot of influence from Anne Bishop's Black Jewels series. There's over 100 pages already in my gdoc file but I need to finish the outline before I write any more. I've also been re-reading Kaz's /Falling Further In/ and whoops definitely lifted some of the good stuff from that fic, which written was pre-OotP. linkffn(532103)

Enjoy :)

  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?
