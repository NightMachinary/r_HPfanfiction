:END:
Hey I'm looking for this fic where Hermione goes back in time to the Marauder's Era to stop Voldemort. I don't remember much, but I do know she has a time turner, and that close to the end theres a big battle. Right before the battle Fabian Prewett's ghost shows up to talk to Hermione because she feels guilty about his death. I think Hermione is James' sister, but I'm not sure.
