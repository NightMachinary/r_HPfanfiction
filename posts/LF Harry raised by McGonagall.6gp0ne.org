Completed preferably. Any ratings/warnings/etc.

Aside from the hair thing which is unrealistic, I found this to be quite entertaining and now I can't stop thinking about it.

*** Hahahaha. But More sassy, I think. Percy is just to straight laced for me. Even when he's joking in DH.

**** eh. I started reading it a bit ago and stopped. I started over last night/this morning. One thing I hate is the way Harry and Brianna talk. I know they're young, but at 5 you talk in complete sentences. Unless the author was going for a "Chicago accent", then the writing is even worse than I thought.

Long story short, I'm not a huge fan, but I'll continue reading it till I find something better.

  She was a teacher, not a mother. But in the aftermath of a Death Eater attack, Minerva McGonagall found herself rearing two orphaned werewolf boys as her own, one of whom the darkness would do anything to destroy...Harry Potter. AU.
