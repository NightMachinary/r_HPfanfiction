** I'm no writer, but I had an idea for a fic like this a while back.

Petunia was a witch and went to Hogwarts and had a miserable time because she got sorted into Slytherin. Then Lily came and made friends and had a great time because she was a Gryffindor. Petunia was constantly surrounded by pure-bloods, always taunted and mocked and treated as being lesser. She grew bitter and clever because she had to be. She may not have liked Snape but she worked out a sort of alliance with him because the Marauders picked on her as well, James seeing the split between Lily and Petunia and somehow thinking that he was "defending Lily". Lily and Petunia had their differences and eventually worked things out . I also have this idea that Petunia's domineering influence constantly nearby kept Snape from joining the Death Eaters.

Petunia joined the Order after graduation and quickly gained a reputation for being ruthless. When the Potters went into hiding they told Dumbledore that it was Petunia who was the secret keeper, but they still made the switch to Pettigrew. When the betrayal came it was easy to blame Petunia. She was a bitter, cold, ruthless, and sometimes terrifying women. She had spent so long in the shadow of others (her pure-blood dorm mates and beautiful, popular Lily) that it wasn't really a surprise that she betrayed the Potters. Who knew what Voldemort offered her. Petunia was found in Godric's Hollow with baby Harry and was arrested at the scene because she choose to look after her nephew instead of pursuing Pettigrew.

The fic begins before Harry's third year. Harry was raised by Sirius, Remus, and Peter at a series of safe locations (because Harry lacked a safe place like Privet Drive because his mother's only living relative was the assumed betrayer). Remus reaches Defense Against the Dark Arts and Peter teaches History of Magic, both present at Hogwarts to provide extra protection for Harry. Peter has recently published a book about the first war against Voldemort and had his picture in the Daily Prophet.

The next day Harry is told his Aunt broke out of Azkaban after being heard to mutter, "He's at Hogwarts". For an extra level of protection, an old friend of his mother's named Severus Snape has agreed to end his lengthy sabbatical on the continent to teach potions at Hogwarts.

** IIRC, isn't Petunia older than Lily?

In that case, I could see Petunia taking Lily under her wing when she started. Showing Lily everything she's learnt and being a cool big sister mentor.

I started writing one, but never got further than the first few lines... It started on that Fateful night, but I didn't get much further than that.

*** It would probably lead to an earlier split between Lily and Snape because once you remove the "first magical person she ever met" and the mentor role there's little left to keep them friends, especially since Snape had shady friends long before their OWLs and generally had no problem hanging out with pureblood supremacists. His fascination with the Dark arts would also immediately put him on Petunias "I have to keep my sister away from that" list.
