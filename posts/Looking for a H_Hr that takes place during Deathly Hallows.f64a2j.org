:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi there everyone, been trying to look for a H/Hr fic during deathly hallows; specifically when they were hiding out in the woods. I remember the plot being: Ron leaves and H/Hr get together. However, Ron comes back and things get awkward.

Specific, I know, since there's a lot of those kinds of fics out there. However, any help on this front would be appreciated it. Thanks.

*** Thx for the help, but not this one. The fic I'm thinking of has lemons but the tone was more....bleak?

** That's not specific in this case. There are literally dozens of HHr stories that fit that description. It's a popular point to start a Harmony romance for HHr writers and I've come across a lot of one shots/stories that take place after Ron leaves.

  ‘So why are you still here?' Harry asked Ron.‘Search me,' said Ron.‘Go home then,' said Harry.‘Yeah, maybe I will!' shouted Ron, and he took several steps towards Harry, who did not back away...What could have happened between Harry and Hermione in the Deathly Hallows after Ron leaves. This story mostly follows canon but provides a different look at how the relationships in HP could have formed had Hermione realized that her and Ron did not fit well together and that Harry, her best friend, was really what she was looking for the whole time.[Updated Sundays, with occasional extra chapters on Wednesdays]*note: this has grown into a rewrite of book seven

** There are so many of these that you probably aren't going to find the one you want from just that description. However, by far the best such story ever (IMHO) is: linkao3(9482156)
