Something akin to 'Legends of Tomorrow' and/or 'Guardians of the Galaxy' -- the rag-tag team doesn't have to include Harry.

I would prefer no slash, and the fic has to be well-written. Additionally, Voldemort or any typical HP character isn't the main villain.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.

**** I'll quote myself from another thread

It would help to know the very basics. If you ever played Warcraft III or WoW you'll know plenty as a deep knowledge of the lore isn't required (but might help you see a couple of plot twists coming). Really, just watching the original [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhNr563aJWs][World of Warcraft cinemati]]c and the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCr7y4SLhck][Wrath of the Lich King]] cinematic will tell you plenty. You don't even have to do that, but it will set the table to show you more or less what the difference races look like and show you what kind of high fantasy setting you're diving into. And why Arthas is a stone cold badass you do not want to fuck with, because he can make dragon zombies.

Edit: Also, if you've never played WCIII, you really should. It's hands down one of the best RTS games of all time, and its gameplay and story hold up even today. Especially the Frozen Throne campaigns.

Edit again: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ch4rc5W4dKY][The Wrathgate]] shows Arthas in action, kicking ass and taking souls. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8XtohlqEeM][The Burning Crusade cinemati]]c will show you what a draenei looks like.

******* wat.

Typo is just short for "typing error".

I think the point you're trying to make is that it's not an "error" if its done intentionally, but he's obviously unintentionally using the incorrect word because, as you stated, he doesn't know the correct spelling.

Doing something because you don't know any better is a pretty classic understanding of "unintentional".

******** From Wiki: 'A typographical error (often shortened to typo), also called misprint, is a mistake made in the typingprocess (such as a spelling mistake) of printed material. Historically, this referred to mistakes in manual type-setting (typography). The term includes errors due to mechanical failure or slips of the hand or finger, but excludes errors of ignorance, such as spelling errors, or the flip-flopping of words such as "than" and "then". '

You could probably find a different definition which includes spelling errors and that's fine, I just happen to use this definition because it means I can differentiate between the two types of error (and I also think this definition is better, but that's besides the point).

Anyway, the point of my post was simply to point out that the author didn't just make a mistake in the summary, and in fact the depth to which their errors go is quite alarming.

I do have one other story that is slash and Voldemort is the main enemy. The team of misfits aspect and travelling is done well, though not around the world. If you were interested?
