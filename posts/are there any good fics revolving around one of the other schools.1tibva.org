like beauxbatons, durmstrang, or one that hasn't even been explored at all? i mean... even beauxbatons and durmstrang have barely any information about them. I can't be the only one whose wanted to know more about the rest of the world, though, regardless. So, are there any well thought out fics about other schools?

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] takes places in the US, primarily at Charmwood Academy. It's up to four complete book-length pieces, and the author is working on the fifth at the moment (but doesn't post on FF until they're finished).

**** I'm not sure, it probably progresses to over a half year of Dieter's first year? I don't remember since it's been a while since I last read it. What I really liked about the story was the juxtaposition of Dieter's Nazi-instilled prejudices and the anti-muggle prejudices of a lot of the wizards around him (Dieter is a muggle-born, which makes it even more interesting to me).

****** I agree, I love that kind of detail! Though it isn't a fic about another wizarding school, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]] does have some pretty original ideas about WWII/Grindelwald/pureblood ideology, etc. The author even threw some mention/analysis of the London bombings in too, I believe. It's an amazing fic (though depending on your tastes, it'll take 'til around chapter 3 to really get into it). It is AU - 7th year and possibly 6th year don't occur as they did in the books, Harry loses to Voldemort, he goes back in time to the Marauder era (I /love/ this part!), and the main pairing is HarryxBellatrix. So I recommend that fic too, even though it's not exactly what you're looking for.

Another person also mentioned the Alexandra Quick series, so I second that. That series is amazing.

** Miranda Flairgold's series, which has already been mentioned, is by far my favourite stories in this direction. Others that come to mind are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1779719/1/][Harry Potter and the Marcello School of Magic]] Complete. Harry goes to a warrior school after 5th year, he discovers an array of new powers, makes new friends and enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3771102/1/][Harry Potter and the Irish Choice]] A relatively short (60K) story where Harry goes to another school instead of Hogwarts at the start of his education. Spans 4 years and is complete

Another one of my favorite stories is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5238750/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Antiquity-Link][Harry Potter and the Antiquity Link]], This is set Post Hogwarts and Post Voldemort, and not really focussed around him going to an alternate school. But he does attend a school in japan for a while and the story expands a lot of differences between the british and japanese magical world and what implications this has in the school environment.

**** fair warning for the last one he doesn't actually travel to japan until midway into the story, so if the start of the isn't what you had in mind, sorry. But it really is a fantastic fanfic in my opinion. It explores the japanese magic culture in way that is not only interesting but makes sense in the context of japanese society in the real world.

** It's a bit infamous, but Miranda Flairgold's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][A Second Chance at Life]] and sequels have Harry training at a Canadian school of assassins.

The Mad Mad Reviewer's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool][Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool]] makes frequent allusions to Arkham Academy, a school Harry attended in his previous life.

Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird Trilogy]] has reference to several other magical schools.

It's an old story (2005) and hasn't aged well, but Naia's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2400483/1/Anarkia][Anarkia]] was among of the first of this type.

*** I started reading "A Second Chance at Life" (got through maybe ~3 chapters) and couldn't continue because there was just not enough detail for me, and it made Harry into a genius extremely fast (like around one chapter?). It might be that it's just my personal taste, but would you say the style of writing changes as the fic goes on?

**** It's a weird fic, to be honest, and definitely not to everyone's tastes. The author is undisciplined, introducing new magical systems at the drop of a hat (blood magic, thread magic, feather magic, multiple schools of necromancy, vampires über alles, etc.) and while the story gets technically better (and abandons most stereotypes several chapters in, taking many creative turns), it is still very polarizing and pretty much isn't even "Harry in name only" anymore once he takes on the moniker Rakhesh Asmodeus.
