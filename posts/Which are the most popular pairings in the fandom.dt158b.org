** Drarry, according to this I made a while back: [[http://home.fiq.se/top30.txt]]

The 2 pairings I personally especially like (to the point where I've searched for fics due to the ship alone on more than just a whim) is in top20 and outside the top30 alltogether respectively.

The list was created by taking the whole Harry Potter fanfiction archive for the site, and use the Relationship filters. I merged all the iterations of Voldemort, because he's somewhat inconsistently tagged. For top 10, this was easy since I could just copy the list straight. Top20 and beyond becomes problematic, because excluding all of top10 will not neccessarily give the correct top20 list. The reason is simple: some ships are usually tagged alongside others -- either because of mutual compatibility (Heron+Hinny, also called "One Big Happy Weasely Family") or because of unrequited love (Snily+Jily). Recognizing these cases, and selectively re-enabling those ships to not filter a huge chunk of fics, combined with doing the whole exclude-relationships thing up to around 50 ships was good enough for a mostly accurate list, IMO.

*** Ao3 is not an accurate representation of all fanfiction though. There is a massvely disproportionate amount of male/male on that website, for whatever reason. I highly doubt Draco/Harry is the most popular overall, because 1) it makes literally no sense as a pairing, and 2) there are so many bad Harry/Hermione fics out there that they must outnumber the Harry/Draco ones.

*** The trouble with relationship filters on Ao3 is that a fic can have multiple pairings, but only one will usually be the focus of the story. So, for example, a lot of those Drarry fics have Hermione/Ron in the background, and often both are tagged

** Drarry and Harmony are probably the two most popular pairings. For me, though, it's usually about the quality of the fic. Some of my favorite fics ever have pairings all over the spectrum. That being said, I'm not a shipper in the sense that I will only read one pairing.

** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/9emp6z/my_posts_with_character_and_pairing_statistics/]]

On ffn Dramione and Drarry are still the top by some margin

I'm not sure why the statistics are so far from my intuition. I'm flabbergasted that anyone thinks Draco is romantic, and it just /feels/ like Harmony should be the most popular ship but it doesn't even reliably beat out Romione. I guess Romione being buffed by Drarry might explain that

** Harry/Ginny

Fanficdom is somewhat skewed against it but in the general fandom it is the preferred pairing by far.

** In terms of fics written, I'd say Harry x Hermione is far and away the most popular pairing.

In terms of most popular on this sub, I'd guess Harry x Daphne but could be wrong.

My personal favourites (in order): Harry x Gabrielle (aged up), Harry x Fleur, Harry x Daphne.

My least favourite pairing is easily Harry x Hermione, with Harry x Ginny in a not-even-close second place.

**** Seems you're right. Scryer returns 2443 results for Harry x Hermione and 3913 results for Harry x Draco. I'm surprised as I always see Harry x Hermione fics when searching for new stuff, I suppose that's because I don't personally enjoy slash though, not that I have anything against it.

2298 results for Harry x Ginny would suggest that Harry x Hermione is the most popular het pairing, it's much closer than I thought though.
