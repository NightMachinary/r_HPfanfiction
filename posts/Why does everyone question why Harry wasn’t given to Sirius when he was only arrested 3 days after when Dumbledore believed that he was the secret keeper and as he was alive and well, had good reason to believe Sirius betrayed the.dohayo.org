I'm not talking about the trial or lack thereof Sirius recurved for the muggles deaths. I'm referring to Dumbledore not having Sirius take care of Harry when there is suspicion he might be a servant of Voldemort.

Edit for clarity : I've seen it asked/stated in fanfics and here several times that Sirius is Harry's rightful guardian and should have been given Harry and Harry not going to the Dursley's. If Dumbledore thinks that Sirius is the secret keeper(that was the plan until the last minute) and he's completely fine and yet told Voldemort the secret, why would he be willing to let Sirius keep Harry?

If you had the belief that a man just betrayed and got 2 people killed, would you let that man take care of that child? And if he is talking to other powerful people about this and what options they have, what do they do? “If a mans best friend since 11 betrayed them, who can we trust?” “There's still a lot of people who would do him harm if they had the chance” “I will put him with his blood relatives, hidden behind powerful magic to protect him, but secrecy is paramount to protect him best” The chaos at the end of the war would mean that someone as looked up at as Dumbledore saying he would ensure the safety of their newest hero would probably be accepted. However, to better ensure that nobody can find Harry there can't be any checks on the house or the people by the ministry (because who knows who can be trusted and could they be interrogated or bribed and reveal Harry's location).


** Because plot convenience and JKR's lack of math skills.

No one questions what happened to Harry when Hagrid took the baby out of the cottage on the evening of Oct 31, 1981. Harry is dropped on the doorstep of Number Four, Privet Drive on the evening of Nov 1, 1981. Petunia discovers him on the morning of Nov 2, 1981. That leaves ~30 hours of baby Harry floating around, at a stage of his life where he's still dependent on breastmilk and soft foods, 4-5 feedings every day.

Hopefully Dumbledore remembered to feed Harry, keep him warm on a 5°C evening, and protect him from being eaten by a feral dog or a hungry fox. Because the "Dingo Ate My Baby" scandal was huge news, and relatively recent, from August 1980.

It was actually even worse than you might think, because originally the police suspected the mother of murdering her own child and blaming it on a feral dingo. It took 32 years for the truth to be acknowledged.

**** *Death of Azaria Chamberlain*

Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain (11 June -- 17 August 1980) was an Australian two-month-old baby girl who was killed by a dingo on the night of 17 August 1980, on a family camping trip to Uluru (also known as Ayers Rock) in the Northern Territory. Her body was never found. Her parents, Lindy and Michael Chamberlain, reported that she had been taken from their tent by a dingo. Lindy Chamberlain was, however, tried for murder and spent more than three years in prison.

My belief is for that day Harry was being checked on by a healer/taken care of while dumbledore came up with a way for Harry to be taken care of. He didn't know Harry was a horcrux and needed to die yet(I think) so he had to find somewhere for Harry to be when the potters BEST FRIEND seemed to have betrayed them. If he's a traitor who can truly be trusted. Not just that, who can protect him from anyone wanting to hurt him/getting a super inflated ego when he's needed for the prophecy.

** My biggest problem isn't with Sirius not being given Harry. Because the blood wards were needed and Sirius probably wasn't very fit to be a guardian even if innocent. No, the biggest problem is how no one ever checked up on harry, especially after Minerva watched the Dursley's the entire day and concluded that they were 'the worst sort of muggles'. Why not just have someone move in next door and watch over/take care of Harry, maybe even in secret or something I dunno. Or just speak the Dursley's after they had taken Harry in.\\
The fact that mrs. Figg knew of Harry's treatment (and therefore we can assume Dumbledore knew), combined with Dumbledore's confession of knowingly subjecting Harry to 'ten dark years', is the most damning proof of evil/senile/manipulative Dumbledore we ever need.

Here's the actual quote:

  "You don't mean - you /can't/ mean the people who live /here/?" cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four, "Dumbledore - you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son - I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!"
#+end_quote

McGonagall has two main concerns with the Dursleys. One is that Dudley is a horrible child for Harry to grow up with. Two is that they are Muggles, that they are nothing like wizards and will never understand Harry. She never, not /once/, suggests that she thinks Harry will be mistreated by the Dursleys.

Sirius received no trial. AFAIK the secret keeper spell wasnt well known or registered with the government (obviously Peter's name would come up if it was). So we have Dumbledores word that Sirus was involved in a secret spell and betrayed the Potters, and a bunch of confused witnesses that literally dont know magic and dont know what happened.

A simple check of Sirius' wand would have proved that he committed no crimes.

But the WW legal system just found a man at the scene of a crime and said "yeah, probably him" and incarcerated and tortured him for 12 years.

Of course fanfiction authors with any care for ethics would want to question that. There is SO MUCH wrong with the whole situation.

Aside from the lack of evidence (because he didnt commit any crimes) they didnt vet where they sent Harry, at all. He was left to be neglected at best and abused at worst.

Americans should be aware of their history. From the suspension of habeas corpus during the civil war to the present day extrajudicial killings of American citizens in the various wars on terror, the notion that 'innocent until proven guilty' has been a cornerstone of our legal system in times of strife is naive. We are willing to sacrifice principles for pragmatics.

Sirius' arrest and conviction took place during an analogous time of strife. One can easily imagine a similar response of pragmatism over principles.

#+begin_quote

We have no idea what spells Sirius cast before or during his confrontation with Peter. Sirius says, "When I cornered him, he yelled for the whole street to hear that I'd betrayed Lily and James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street with the wand behind his back...". That passage can easily be interpreted to include Sirius sending a curse at Peter as he transformed. Peter choosing a spell whose effect corresponded well with the one that Sirius cast is all that it takes for an arrest and conviction to be sensible.

*** While realistically it's probably one of the many plot holes in the story, I think that the situation could also be explained by the confusion created in the aftermath of Voldemort's defeat. Just think that the wizarding world was in the middle of a war which was on the verge of being won by the Death Eaters. The other side experienced many casualties, while on Voldemort's side only Wilkes and Rosier are named. Then all of a sudden, Voldemort disappears, his followers find themselves disorganized due to the iron fist with which they were ruled. But I bet the Ministry and the Order were equally confused and the public was outraged and wanted blood from those who had probably killed members of their families. So the Ministry, which is already described as fairly incompetent, just tried to grab whoever they could and whoever had no shield of money or influence to protect them just to show people that they were doing their jobs.

***** Isn't it said in the books he offers no defense because of his poor state of mind? He's found in a street full of muggles, laughing, gives no defense, Peter had screamed out “lily and james, how could you” before transforming leaving enough evidence to seem like he's dead, a bunch of dead people, the muggles are confused and terrified. If the police found a man laughing in a street full of panicking people with the weapon that seemed to have killed them, what would they think?

Dumbledore is a hero from fighting grindelwald and I'm pretty certain he was already chief warlock/supreme mugwump so if he said handled, I bet everyone would be fine with it. Who is Dumbledore supposed to trust and believe can protect him after someone nobody suspected apparently turned traitor.

The Ministry was losing so badly that the Ministry actually lost the first war with Voldemort; only arcane, unpredictable magic saved them. It was leaking like a sieve and was almost completely unable to effective prosecute Death Eaters.

Why would you want the Ministry anywhere near Harry?

The weirding component of this reasoning is that so many readers also want the OotP to become even more extrajudicial, e.g., they want suspected Death Eaters, and their children, murdered in the beds. And yet, somehow, when it comes to child placement decisions Dumbledore is supposed to follow the law to the letter?

Furthermore, Sirius straight up tells us Barty Crouch Sr threw him and his son in Azkaban.

He was found in a street full of dead people laughing crazily. If I remember right (it has been a long time since I read the books) lots of wizards were freed from the imperius. It was pure chaos.

He can apparate. I believe he does so after the Diagon Alley trip. And because he's a half-giant, his skin is resistant to most spells. So he was absolutely one of the best people to retrieve Harry.

Look at this from Dumbledore's perspective. He thought knew that Sirius was secret keeper , as far was we know Fidelius is strongest magic there is. Sirius was found in the scene of crime and witnesses said that Sirius was guilty. Heck his mind was so messed up that he admitted his fault during interogation. (Or is that fanon?) Magical world isn't the same as the modern law.

The problem with all this , is that Bartemius Sr. Is the one who was responsible. Yet even then , his actions can be explained by furthering his political career by catching important death eater.
