hi

as far as i checked i couldnt find the story i was looking for...so maybe someone can help me.

harry is dropped at the dursleys by dumbledore with a comment along the lines of " do what you wish with him, we dont need him anymore" dudley then help harry escape to gringotts in the night, before his father can "kill" harry. they both get a protection detail ( i believe one of the security guys is related to mcgonnagal) and are shipped to florida till britain is safe again. i believe there where parts when they went to disneyland and got than shipped an island....i read that story often.. but forgot the title and cant seem to find it anymore... hope some of you have an idea..

  Harry stopped Voldemort when he was 15. Less than a month later he finds not everyone is as appreciative as he thought. Bloodied and bruised he sets out to escape and runs into a little unexpected help, from several places. Updating THE LIST periodically. I compare Scotland and Florida to show how they break larger nation into smaller parts.
