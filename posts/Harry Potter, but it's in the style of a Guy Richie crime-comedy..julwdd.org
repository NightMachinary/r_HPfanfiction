If you've never seen a Guy Ritchie crime-comedy, go watch Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, then come back. I'll wait.

Okay, with that out of the way, here's the idea of this request/prompt.

- Harry and Co are basically pinballed through the plot - they might start off doing something that sets off everything else, but other than that they're just kinda bumbling through things and nothing they do really matters.
- There's at least two gangs/organizations that target Harry&Co for various reasons.
- These organizations are at war with each other as much as they are with Harry&Co, and they basically end up taking each other out while Harry&Co get out relatively scot-free.
- There's several moments in which everyone involved just has to scratch their heads and wonder what the hell is going on.
- The black-comedy is real.

May or may not be inspired by this fanmade trailer: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfTz708-PE0]]
