The more cavity inducing the better, I want to have diabetes after I finish reading it.

Would like it to be Harry centric, pairings don't matter as long as it isn't any slash. Long stories, short stories, anything is welcome. Thanks

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

** linkffn(His Angel) is an extremely fluffy, but unfinished Harry/Fleur fic. I'd advise you to just skip the last chapter where he details his plan for the rest of the fic after apologising for being unable to finish it- it's just depressing and I'm guessing you don't want that.

**** Frankly, I can't say I was invested into the actual plot enough to care much about it being incomplete. This story is great for the relationship and the smut and the fluffiness, but its plot isn't really that amazing - at least for me it wasn't. And he /does/ summarise the ending in the last chapter, so there's that, at least.

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.

** Aw man, so sorry that the Goblet of Fire broke it up. SOmetimes it just doesn't work between human and magical spewing fire artifact of legend.

Anyway, sorry I don't really have any good romantic stuff to add. In fact, I'll probably lurk this thread and see if I can find something for myself as well, since that's a glaring lack of it in my résumé. I mean, I know fluffy stuff, but it's not necessarily romantic. Maybe linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince) and [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection]] qualify?

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

** There's a really popular Dramione fic if you sort by top with those two as featured characters. Ron cheats, they fuck at Malfoy Manor, etc. Really sappy. Very...Twilighty.

But. You wanna get over her? Don't fill the void. Let her departure hurt, embrace it, accept it, and get it over with. I medicated with fanfiction for around 6 months. H/G fics used to make me cry and feel and I loved it. It wasn't my best decision, but I was hurting and I wanted to feel strong and loved even if only by proxy.

You'll be fine in time.
