In your opinion, just how much does Draco Malfoy have to go through to actually /get/ redeemed? ::curious:: Is it possible?


** Well, if you want my ongoing thoughts on the matter. ;)

*** 1) Adding it to my list to read (I'm trying to do the same in my story, Unthinkable Acts, so your approach may help. Draco is SO such a stubborn git (IMHO).

2) Do you only post on that site, or do you post on multiple sites?

Thanks!!!

**** At least so far, I've only posted stories on HPFF. The rules are a bit constraining at times, but so far I haven't been hit by that one flash of inspiration that just won't fit within them.

** I personally see Draco's post-war story as one of moving on rather than redemption. He may be selfish and spoiled but I don't think he's bad at heart; I pity him. I think a lot of his worldviews aren't necessarily his own -- that is, they've been indoctrinated in him in his upbringing, and he hasn't had many chances to form his own opinions. Moving on from his childhood is the crux of Draco's transformation for me, and even then, I don't think he'll change much outwardly from what we know of him; he'll be angry at the world for a long, long time.

Oh! If you're looking for stories, I've got my Draco story [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=322009][here]] :) It's due to be 3 chapters, but the first is relatively standalone.

*** Thank you! I'm also working on a "moving on" type story, by your definition, anyway. Trying to find a way to make some kind of amends for what he's done, trying to find the courage to reexamine some of his prejudices, struggling with how ingrained his selfishness and arrogance actually is . . . and oftentimes, failing, because he himself doesn't understand how deep-rooted this stuff can be. I see it as the beginning of a process--that wherever he is at the end of the story is the first part of a lifetime journey.

Someone like Draco can't become good in a year or because of one "love." Instead, (IMHO) he'd probably turn into one of those racists (since there is an obvious parallel) who says "this person may be from X group which is XYZ bad stuff, but this person I care about is just a better kind of X."

I am curious and will check out your story. Here's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8820839/1/Unthinkable-Acts][my story]] if you are curious.
