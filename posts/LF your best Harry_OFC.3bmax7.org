Looking for fics/characters similar to Miranda Rookwood in Harry Potter and the Dark's Rise and Kari Boslov in The Undead Alliance, although they don't have to be Slytherin OCs. And please no Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss...


** The fandom tends to dislike OCs, so I doubt you'll get much. I personally like linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen) in which Harry + Rachel Marx is probably going to be a thing, but it's a dormant fic and has been so for a few years.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

*** Thanks for that, it was really good! But yeah, too bad it's probably never going to be finished

** Daphne Greengrass is technically only mentioned as waiting for her turn to perform in one of the practicals for OWLs in 5th year, and beyond that one mention, she could essentially be considered an OFC.
