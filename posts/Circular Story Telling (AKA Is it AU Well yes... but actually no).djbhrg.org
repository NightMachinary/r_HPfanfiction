It is an incredibly common "story telling technique" that I refer to as /circular story telling/ (I'm unaware if the name's taken or if there is a different term that describes this phenomenon).

It follows the logic of AUs where you have a divergence point, something in cannon changes and as a result the characters change aswell. But then, for some inexplicable reason, /everything is still the same.../

No matter how great the change is, no matter how many waves it should've caused, cannon will *always* play out.

What is even the point of writing an AU if you are copy pasting cannon?

I've seen so many great and unique ideas for AUs that end up /boring/ due to the fact that no matter how hard characters try, no matter how much emotional anguish they go through, /everything is the same/.

And the worse offence of all (for me at least) is the fact that they are illogical. If, for example, you have Hermione and Harry be friends from an early age then why in the world does Hermione end up in the bathroom with the troll again (As I saw in a different thread)? Logical errors like that completely wreck my suspension of disbelief.

What is your opinion regarding those types of fics?


** There is a name: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][the stations of canon]]

Unfortunately a lot of writers are lazy and unimaginative, and they would rather rehash canon than create a new, original story based on an interesting divergence.

** That's called canon rehash. Our sub hates that shit so you are in good company.

Hermione ending in that bathroom is not even the worst offense. I've seen fics in which Indy!Lord Hadrian Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Peverell-Slytherin..., master of Wizengamot politics at age 13 and heir to gazillion of Galleons, still falls to Wormtail's stunner in that Graveyard. Now that's really fucked up.

** This is part of why I like Nightmares of Futures Past so much. The author seems to have properly thought things through, so things only stay the same if that's reasonably logical. Eg Barty Crouch Jr still sits behind Harry at the Quidditch World Cup (because there's no reason for his seating to change), but the Weasleys don't win the galleon draw and go to Egypt (because Harry has interacted with them a lot, so that gets butterflied away). And several times, Harry deliberately tries to change something from the first timeline, and somehow a variation on it still happens - and it freaks him out, wondering if there's some higher power working to keep the timeline on track.

Sticking with canon a bit too closely is the one thing that bothers me a little about Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions, but the author acknowledges up front that he considers time to be "sticky" and he writes well enough to more than make up for it.

** There are some events that are mostly unavoidable if Harry goes to Hogwarts, but exactly describing the events of Canon is stupid, as the changes to the MC should make for some completely events

** I feel like a time travel fic with that premise(character time travels over and over, but canon happens every time) would be a fun read

*** There are a couple of fics where the protagonist tries over and over but can't meaningfully change anything. They're less "fun" and more "nightmare fuel". Sisyphus by esama is one (but the bot never seems to find it properly), Getting the Hang of Thursdays is another, and perhaps Wastelands of Time.
