I dont know I recently read certain dark things and made me curious in other interpretations of an oc who is the son of Sirius


** There's one I'd like to recommend, but I can't remember the name. It's on ao3. His daughter is half-veela and French. She's a slytherin. Her name is Bellona. It was quite long, I only read up to the end of 5th year/the beginning of 6th and that was less than halfway through

** There was one called Paint it Black on fanfiction. The MC is Sirius' daughter and it's been a long time since I read it but I remember it being pretty great. She's friends with Fred and George I think, and her mother's character was pretty fleshed out too, which is always nice

#+begin_quote
  Bellona de Poitiers begins her time at Hogwarts as an interloper for her French accent, for her Veela's blood, for the absence of her father.Hogwarts is not the haven she expected, though, and she quickly discovers that Slytherin is no true home to any interloper. With fewer friends than enemies, she does her best to keep her head down and muddle through safely.Then, just as she's about to return for third year, her father escapes from prison, and everything goes to hell.
