** They do get more and more ridiculous, to the point where the author breaks the 4th wall. It's been awhile since I've read it, but IIRC, the second and third books focus less on a singular location and "travel" around quite a bit, which I guess is what you don't want to see. The overarching bad guy in the middle part is pretty good though.

*** Just wanted to mention something: I'm reading through this second book (chapter 17 now) and you know what it means remind me of? It reminds me of one of the Artemis Fowl books, the one where there is weird dimension and time hopping. It's kind of...creepy and scary. Like with the white rose imagery and stuff.

But pretty interesting :)

** Sword of the Hero is the weakest of the 3 fics in the trilogy in my opinion. I would recommend you keep reading, and then read the wastelands of time story by the same author, which is one of my all time favorites

*** Thanks for the response. Not to sound sappy, but does his relationship with Ginny pick up at all throughout the 2nd book and/or become more relevant? I don't want it to be a thing where it fizzles out or stays in the same way of "we barely get time together or get to hang out or anything."

(On the other hand, I assumed it would become more and more relevant since there was the reveal at the end of book 1 about love.)

**** As others have said, his relationship is in the background in Book 2, but there's a reason.

I would /strongly/ recommend Book 2. IMHO it's /the/ "most epic" fic in the HP fandom, and it's much better than the first book (which is saying quite a bit).

***** Yeah, I'm starting book 3 at the moment :)

Book 2 was very nice. It had me on my seat almost the entire time. Loving the series! I'm glad that I made this post about the trilogy because I'm pretty sure I was about to stop reading after the first one!

****** Tell me if you find Book 3 as epic as Book 2! I never found the time to read beyond the first few chapters.

******* I just finished book 3. And all I can say is /wow/. It was epic in so many different ways from book 2. I personally preferred 3 over 2. This was one of the few stories I've read where I cried at various points (whether out of shock, raw emotion, happiness...). Such a confusing but amazing story. Someone else pointed out that this story breaks the 4th wall somewhat annoyingly---I kind of disagree with this. It does break the 4th wall, but this is the *only* fanfic I've read where the breaking of the 4th wall almost makes sense in the context of the story.

Anyway, this is one of those stories where I sit back and reel for several days before I can bring myself to pick up a new fanfic, because of how emotionally involved I was (am) with this trilogy. I do hope you get time to read and enjoy it.

By the way, I have one final thing I want to add:

*(SPOILER ALERT)*

/(spoilers for the book 3 below)/

/(I don't know how to do spoiler tags)/

You know how people say "I would move heaven and earth for you?" (or similar). In this story, there were several scenes where Harry alluded to that phrase or ones similar. And this was the only fanfic where it was /literally true/, where he would, and did, *literally* move heaven, set the sky on fire, and destroy the universe for the girl he loved.

******** Finishing Book 3, 80% through. So glad you encouraged me to read it. This is the sort of series that pushes the boundaries of imagination, the sort of series that you'll never forget.

**** It stays somewhat in the background in book 2, but is much more of a focus in book 3
