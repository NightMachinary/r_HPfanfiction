My little sister (10) is obsessed with reading fanfics. Problem is, she often inadvertently starts reading fics with inappropriate content for her age. Sadly, the fics that are fine for her tend to be flash-fics.

Only one I've found for her was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks]]; she really enjoyed it.

So does anyone know any child-friendly fics that are enjoyable and not too short? Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks everyone for all the recommendations! We're very excited to read these :D


** Blu Taiger's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] is child-friendly. A Calvin and Hobbes/Harry Potter crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/943028/BajaB][BajaB's]] Harry the Hufflepuff and sequel are child-friendly.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244417/1/Hocus-Pocus-Adele-Polkiss][Hocus Pocus, Adele Polkiss]] by Ecmm.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6619152/1/Harry-and-the-Hobgoblins]] Harry and the Hobgoblins by Respitechristopher.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4176058/1/India][India]] by Perspicacity.

All are complete and child-friendly. Of the ones listed, only Respitechristopher's and Perspicacity's are one-shots (but both are great writing and worth checking out anyway).

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/][Just a Random Tuesday]] by Twisted Biscuit. It is focuses on an adult (McGonagall) rather than any of the kids so don't know if that will be off putting, but it's got no sex stuff or violence.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/][Mine]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/483952/][Gillian Middleton]] has several sequels. Totally kid-friendly given that Harry is 5 years old.

**** I really enjoyed Finding Why by B. A. Ware recently. It's poorly edited (grammatical and sentence flow errors) but very kid-friendly until the veeeeery last chapter or two, where there's one implied sex scene and a scene the next morning in bed together. It does not say "naked" or "penis" or anything but it's pretty obvious what's going on... I would have been OK with it at 10, especially after all the awesomeness of the first 94 chapters.

****** There's a brief scene with a character that curses a lot, though.

If that's not a concern, then it's otherwise a good rec I think.
