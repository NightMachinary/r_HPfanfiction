Harry have to be sorter into slytherin and be best student like Tom was(I would like some rivarly between Hermione)

Edit: No Voldemort/Harry pairing


** *I don't know, I'm not quite sure I've read such a ff yet. But I liked the idea, so I wrote a little one-shot for you on the spot based on the first interaction with Harry Potter and Severus Snape if our favourite Potions Master comes to give Harry Potter his letter and finds him in an orphanage.*

*P.S: Please note that this is un-edited.*

​

“I must admit to be confused upon receiving your letter, Mr Snape,” An old lady smiled at him, making Severus look at her. “In all the years Harry has been here, never once has he received a visitor.”

He understood her silent question, ‘Why are you here?'

“Mr Potter had been admitted to being a student of the school I work at before he was born by his parents,” Severus explained, trying his best not to sneer at the last word,"I am here to deliver him his acceptance letter and take him shopping for his books and uniforms.”

“Oh!” The woman said, a flash of concern in her eyes. “So you are going to take him away then?” Her voice sounded eager. Hopeful.

Severus raised an eyebrow at that. “Yes,” He drawled. “Hogwarts is a boarding school, so all necessities will be provided there. Mr Potter will only be returning during Christmas holidays and the Summer vacations."

“But other than that, he is going to go with you lot, right?” The matron asked.

“Yes,” Severus replied.

The matron breathed a visible sign of relief.

“Is there a problem, madam?” Severus asked softly.

“No, not at all.” She replied quickly. Too quickly.

“Please,” Severus said, “I insist.”

The matron hesitated, looking around nervously. “The boy won't be refused admittance to this school, right?"

“Yes,” Severus confirmed.

The matron hesitated again. “Harry is a lovely boy,” She started slowly. “Very polite. Extremely smart. But there have been... incidents.” She revealed.

“Oh?” Severus said. She must be talking about accidental magic. “What kind of incidents?”

“Weird ones.” The matron replied. “Nasty ones. Once, this other boy Richie, took away Harry's blanket and threw it in the fireplace, and the next day, his whole room caught on fire. Then there was this other time when one of his teachers told him that his answer was wrong, and the man's hair turned blue! There was no proof that Harry did this, but... he's always there whenever these strange things happen. A girl Daisy tried to cut his hair, but it grew back the next day and Daisy became bald! He even once somehow got on the roof, you know! Then there was Mark, he bullied some of the younger kids -Harry included- and once when we took the children to the zoo, a poisonous snake bit him and he died! Poor boy. Now, I know Harry could have not done those things, but... he was smiling, you know. He was smiling when Mark was crying out in pain- didn't even lift a finger to help him.”

Severus listened patiently. The incidents didn't bother him too much, what really did strike him was the tone in which the matron used to talk about Potter- scared awe. Severus would never be able to forget that tone. How could he, when every Death Eater had used the same tone to speak about the Dark Lord.

“This is Harry's door.” The matron pointed. She knocked on it. “Harry, you have a visitor.” and without another word, she left immediately.

Severus cleared his mind and once again, cursed Albus for sending him of all people to fetch the boy. He opened the door.

An angelic looking boy sat near the window. The light casting a halo-like illusion behind him. James Potter's face with Lily Evans' eyes met his.

The boy looked at him from head to toe and only said one word, “Go.”

Severus raised an eyebrow.

“You are a doctor aren't you?” The boy asked, his voice soft, clear and regal.

“No,” Severus replied coldly as he looked at the boy who was the product of his bully and the love of his life. “I'm a professor.”

The boy smiled emotionlessly. “I don't believe you,” He said, “She thinks I'm different. She wants to put me in a mental hospital. Are you here to profile me?” The boy asked, his tone mocking. “Do you think I'm different too, /Professor/?"

“Yes,” Severus said, “But you are not mad. Hogwarts isn't a mental institute, it's a school.” He said, giving Potter the letter. “A school for learning magic.”

The boy raised his eyebrows, eyes filled with distrust as he took the envelope, opened it and read it's contents.

Severus prepared himself for the boy's reaction. Some would question that it was a joke, others would think it made perfect sense and still others would think it was devil-worship and yet others would argue about the existence of magic. But he couldn't have known that he would have never been prepared for the boy's statements.

“I knew it,” He whispered. “I knew it. I am special.”

*** Severus raised an eyebrow at that, but chose to ignore it. “You can do things, can't you Mr Potter?” Severus asked tightly, seeing that the boy was looking star-struck at his letter. “Things other children can't.”

The boy lifted his head and smiled so beautifully at Severus, much like Lily used to, making his heart clench. “I can move things without touching them,” He confessed in a near-whisper. “I can make animals to things for me without training them. I can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.” He said gleefully. “I can make them /hurt/ if I want to. Can you do the same?”

“Can you do the same, Sir.” Severus corrected. Leave it to Potter's brat to not have any semblance of manners. “And yes, I can."

“Prove it.” The boy said stubbornly. Skeptically.

Severus took out his wand and uttered a simple reducto to a vase, breaking it, before using a simple repairo to fix it. The boy looked at him in awe, making Severus a little smug.

“Hogwarts will let you learn all this, and how to control your magic.” He stood up. “Come. We shall go and shop for your school supplies.”

“We?” The boy asked. “Can't I do it myself? I'm used to it.”

All the more better for him, then. Severus would prefer to not spend any more time with the boy than necessary. “Alright. Go to the Leaky Culdron Pub in London and tell a barman named Tom that you are a student shopping for Hogwarts, and he will give you directions. Visit the bank first, here is your key.” Severus said, producing a key and handing it over to the boy. “Everything that you need will be written down in your list. School starts on September first. Here is your train ticket and to get to the platform, you must run through the platform between nine and ten, got it boy?”

The boy nodded, taking the Hogwarts Express train ticket and keeping it next to the bank key he had placed on the window pane.

Severus Snape curtly nodded and turned toward the door before a voice stopped him-

“I can speak to snakes too.”

Severus stopped in his steps. Unsavoury memories flashed through his mind- a handsome pale man hissing, pain, screams of mad laughter, the dark mark, more pain, red and green lights- Severus forced them back down.

Severus turned to face the boy, “What?”

“They speak to me,” Potter smirked, his green eyes flashing like the killing curse -the same curse that killed Lily, Lily had the same eyes, Lily-

“Oh?” Severus said nonchalantly.

“I can speak to snakes,” the boy repeated, tilting his head to the side much like Lily used to. “They find me. They whisper things to me. Is that /normal/ for someone like me?”

Severus swallowed. “No,” He stated simply and walked away from the boy as fast as he could.

Minutes later, Severus Snape would show the memory of Harry Potter to Albus Dumbledore.

Some more minutes later, Severus Snape would see Albus Dumbledore's face become pale, and then green; his eyes flashing with regret, concern, nostalgia and pain.

A month later, Severus would see a mop of black hair with aristocratic features and the most beautiful emerald eyes smirk at him when Minerva would call out his name. He wold see the boy gracefully sit on the stool as excited mutters floated around the Great Hall. He would see the Sorting Hat shout “Slytherin” immediately and without hesitation, without even touching the boy's perfect hair. He would see Albus Dumbledore clutching his goblet so hard with a pained and forced smile that his knuckles would turn white before lightly clapping. He would see Draco Malfoy smirking and welcoming Potter to the house of snakes.

Two months later, he would see a sort of crowd surrounding Potter- Draco Malfoy to his right, Marcus Flint to his left, Crabbe and Goyle walking behind him protectively and so many others following them in a formation that he could recognise all too well.

After all, the Death Eaters moved the same way.

And that same day would be the first -but not the last- time that Severus Snape would find Albus Dumbledore chucking down a bottle of fire whiskey.

  What if the sliver of Lord Voldemort's soul in Harry's scar wasn't a Horcrux at all. Instead, when the Dark Lord's curse rebounded that Halloween night, a piece of his fractured soul sought out the one thing that had felt similar, equal even. And after his abuse suffered by the Dursleys, Harry shows up to Hogwarts with a very different outlook on things. Dark Harry! TR/HP SLASH

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
