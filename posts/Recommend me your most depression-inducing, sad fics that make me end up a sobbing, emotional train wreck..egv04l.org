Make me regret this.

Thanks in advance!


** Here's a cute little tear-jerker:

And some self-recommendations:

I'm proud of the teary reviews on this little one-shot:

This one's seasonally depressing:

  Since Ron got a new owl, it's only fair that Ginny gets her own pet. She adopts a big black dog.

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  “It's always been the three of us, Harry,” Hermione assured him, her arms wrapped tightly around his middle as he sobbed into her shoulder.“We've dealt with enough strange things mate,” Ron whispered in his ear, his chest pressed against Harry's back and his arms holding him tight. “Let this be a good thing.”With the wizarding world thrown into grief by the end of the war, Harry turns to his best friends to help him survive the terrible losses. Meanwhile, George's parallel isolating tendencies show Harry what might have happened if he'd not given into temptation.

** Recnac Transfero

Harry meets a muggle family and takes on the father's cancer. It is not only sad there are some great moments that are basically slices of life. Like you can see how Hermione and Ron are great friends, you see how people react when they learn Harry is dying of cancer.
