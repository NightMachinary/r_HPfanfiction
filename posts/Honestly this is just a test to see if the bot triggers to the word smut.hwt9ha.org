**** This [[https://reddit.com/r/FanFiction/comments/hd5oxh/_/fvk41wc/?context=1][comment]] explains it well

#+begin_quote
  As I understand it, there was a whole range of citrus terminology at one time for fanfic sexual content.

  Grapefruit: non-con sex or really off the wall lemon-lime.

  Lemon: explicit sex.

  Lime: sexual content but not explicit.

  Orange: kissing and groping but that's it.

  The more sour the fruit, the more adult.

******** Well, it makes sense. Most of those automated scripts can't discern context, so they just do a quick search in the entire text for specific words, and if they find a match, they trigger a response. Automated moderation is far from perfect, but I guess it's the best they have to keep order in the meantime.
