** The story with the most sarcastic Harry I have ever read has to be So Sue Me by lunakatrina, it is an old story and unfinished, but its still a fun if silly read.

** Linkffn(8398832) From Dust, it's a Danny Phantom Crossover, but the real highlights are Harry's sarcasm, like how he managed to have a halfway decent conversation with Dudley.

  Danny Phantom already had to deal with the problems of two worlds, so what were more mortal problems to him? Even if they were problems of a magical nature. And Harry Potter's got even more on his plate for his fifth year at Hogwarts.
