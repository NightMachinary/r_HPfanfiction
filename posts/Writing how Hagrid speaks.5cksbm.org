In one of my WIPS, part of the chapter i am working on contains a section of dialogue between Hagrid tells Dumbledore that Ron Weasley has partially become a snack for his pet spiders.

The only problem is I seem to have problems writing how Hagrid speaks.

Can you folks give some advice please??


** I use this as a guide.

** Don't do too much, it's distracting and difficult to read. A few dropped Hs ('Arry, 'ow), leaving the g off -ing words, and maybe swapping in "yeh" for "you" would be enough to convey the accent.

*** Well, outside of the dropped Hs, yes.

**** I may be confusing accents in fics with actual accents. I've only seen two of the movies, and they were both years ago.

But "don't overdo it" stands.

** Trying going through the books and writing out his lines. It will help you notice the patterns and become familiar with it. It is a tough dialect to master, so it does take practice.

** I know its not exactly what you're looking for, but I do have some advice.

DO NOT try to show his accent in his writing. He writes like normal people. He just speaks differently.

P.S. Sorry if I came off as rude, but it is a fairly common and annoying mistake.

** It's very easy to over do. Drop the odd hard consonant off the start of words. Never more than two in a line of dialogue. If you do it on every word Hagrid comes across as a parody of himself.

** Write him speaking normally. People reading your fic would know how Hagrid speaks. Accents in writing are good only if you want to establish that character and that trait serves as a plot point, otherwise it's distracting and pointless. Written speech =/= speaking. We don't talk the way dialogue is written in books and books don't signify every pause, the "um"s and "eh"s, and omit frequent repetitions that most people use when speaking. Our brains analyze written and spoken words differently, so we use different means to successfully achieve the main goal of it all - communication. Mixing it up only brings confusion and in large doses needlessly tires readers as they try to adjust their perception to understand what is written.
