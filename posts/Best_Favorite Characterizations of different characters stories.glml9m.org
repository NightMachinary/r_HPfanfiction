Looking for your ultimate this is how I see these characters, or how close they are in the books, or just very interesting look inside the characters that aren't usually done.

They can be major characters, minor characters, only mentioned in Pottermore or Lexicon or whatever else, as long as they're characters in the Harry Potter stories.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be focused on pairings).

The plot and genre itself can be anything, from romance to drama, to thriller to hurt/comfort to slice of life to gen to whatever.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any sites, can have any warnings.

If Harry is in the story: If Harry is a "Lord" I don't want him to be Draco Malfoy 2.0, I want him to still help people. No Harem Harry. No OP Harry. Harry can be smarter or more powerful then in canon, but I'd like for it to be believable.

No character bashing, if at all possible. If there is, then minor, or makes enough sense in character. Not to be a oh what a twist or shock value or just because everyone else is doing it.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.


** I liked Harry's characterization in “ Harry is a Dragon and That's Okay”.

I also liked Harry's characterization in “The Many Deaths Of Harry Potter”.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** Dumbledore's characterization in /Defiance/ is one of the best I've read. linkffn(12516323)

Tonks, Ron, Neville and Fleur in /Renegade/ are well-written, 'improved' versions of their canon counterparts. linkffn(11302568)

Harry's characterization in /The Merging/ is brilliant, especially because it doesn't fall too much into the 'angsty' or 'ridiculously independent' sides. linkffn(9720211)

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  At the height of his power, Lord Voldemort employed another failsafe next to the horcruxes: his most loyal followers would be able to retrieve them and resurrect him with their help. As a result, Barty Crouch Jr. breaks his father's mind control early and goes off to seek his master.While he is unsuccessful in locating him, he manages to find surprising but welcome allies in the Boy-Who-Lived and his godfather. With the support of the Ancient and Noble House of Black on his side, Barty needs to use all his cunning and guile to navigate the world of politics and Dark Arts. And so, four years after their first meeting, a different Harry Potter will arrive at Hogwarts: one who wants nothing more than to bring Lord Voldemort back and who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
