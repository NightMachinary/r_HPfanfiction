There was a story I found through here at one point (And I've tried the search function) where Severus Snape and Remus Lupin are both, at various points in the story, isolating themselves (Lupin due to the werewolf thing, Snape due to injuries from Voldie's torture) and basically thinking that by doing so and possibly dying they'll make life easier on the whole world.

But then in each instance, the other shows up, helps them out, and they call out each others' idiocy and have a discussion about good things they'd ignored in life and how they really weren't as much of a "loner" as they made themselves out to be and how they should reintegrate into the group, probably saving each others' lives.

I believe it only had a few chapters.

Any help finding it?


** Was it a wip or complete?

edit: Also was it on FFnet or elsewhere?

edit: and were they paired?

edit: I should point out that I wouldn't read this type of fic, but I am willing to search summaries to see of I can help you out. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=1&g1=20&lan=1&r=10&len=1&c1=5&c2=9&_c1=3221&_c2=4][Here's]] what I searched on ffnet, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6065987/1/Smoke][Smoke by Fayet]] is the first that sticks out as a candidate.

*** Complete. Perhaps on ff.net, that seems right. They weren't paired, no.

Hmm interesting story but that's not it.

**** Did you check out the 80 or so stories that popped up on that search? [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10514621/1/Among-Friends][Among Friends]] might be another candidate.
