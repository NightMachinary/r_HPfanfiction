** I really enjoyed 'Match.' , a Sirius/OC fic. It used to be on HPFF but it's gone now :( but if you can find it definitely give it a read!

*** Someone republished it on ff.net. If you google search "match. By mental" you'll probably be able to find it.

P.S. It's incomplete at the most crucial moment in plot climax lol :(

Sadly, this story was abandoned a few years back. But it still to this day remains one of the funniest things that I have ever read on HPFF!! Any time I need a good laugh, I just pull up this story and start reading. It's too bad that the writer never came back and finished it, because this story is seriously amazing!!! I do hope that you enjoy it as much as I have over the years. =)
