Imagine, if you will, a girl as magically attuned as a brick. With many slights of hand, chemistry theories, and general griftiness at her disposal, how difficult would it be to sneak her way into Hogwarts? This is assuming she had inside info on how to get there and such, and that the sorting hat couldn't care less whether she was magical or not (only that her personality matched with her house) and doesn't blow her cover. She studies and understands magical theory, so the only obstacles are physical tests of magic (such as spells and broom flying)

If it helps, she might possibly be a spy sent by muggles snubbed by their magical relatives for being different, and there's maybe like an artifact hidden at Hogwarts that could give a muggle powers as if they were a regular witch/wizard.

What sorts of obstacles would she have to face, both in entering at first and in staying there? If she were to make a wizard friend who is willing to help her, how much easier would that make it to keep her secret in the long run?

I ask because I haven't read many books yet (I know, I'm working on it!) and don't even know if some wizards can ‘sense' if someone has magic or what have you.

Any thoughts, answering of the question, or just vaguely related brainstorming are appreciated!

Edit: If anyone is still interested in this, I'm now wondering if there would be any reason that a witch or wizard would not be able to use their powers, even if they had them. This would help her get in at least, even though she can't use powers.


** It would probably become very conspicuous that the kid doesn't ever cast any spells; honestly, I think a better bet would be to smuggle oneself into the Castle /without/ posing as a student --- to just set up camp in an abandoned classroom and just hide from everyone, blending into a crowd of student whenever it is necessary to pass through the more well-frequented halls and corridors. Hogwarts is already full of unexplained mysteries, Ghouls, Ghosts, Elves and assorted things that go bump in the night; I think you'd have a fair shot at successfully keeping beneath the Professors' notice. Especially if, after noticing you on the Marauder's Map, Fred and George decide to help you.

** It would be impossible to fake being accepted- there's a magical book and quill that determines who can go to Hogwarts. Your name isn't in the books, you are not going.

To actually sneak in regardless I think would be equally impossible. Even if one managed to get on the train or get to the location, due to the enchantments around the school all they would see is old, abandoned, ruins in the middle of nowhere.

Getting past /that/ hurtle, I would suspect it would become fairly obvious when they can't fly a broom or perform any kind of magic in class. Even the most challenged wizards could do /something/ magical.

*** Huh, that ruins thing is a good point. Are there EVER any exceptions, or relatively understandable ones I could make for her to be able to see the place? Any way she could use an item or be gifted a charm or something?

**** Probably not unless she has a source of magic from a bracelet so when she tries to perform spells, there's some sort of a response. That being said, unless you want to have your AU have some sort of lineage test that somehow she could pass, I'd have a hard time seeing her even getting through the sorting. I know you said that the hat doesn't care, but to me it would still matter, as her name wouldn't be on the roll and she'd need to explain that.

**** I think she would still need some kind of magic to activate whatever spell or charm was on the object, unless you invented some kind of special charm a wizard/witch could give her that is completely self supporting. At that point the object would most likely only have a specific purpose and be limited. It being a new spell, may also open up possibilities for it malfunctioning.

I don't know what you could do about the ruins thing, unless she always wore special goggles or something? Maybe something another witch/Wizard was tinkering on? She could have swiped them?

Canonically though, there is no way around those charms from what I know. Unless the character has stronger magic than what cast those cloaking charms, which doesn't sound like a possibility.

** I think there was once a Squib named Angus Buchanan that tried to fake his way in, but the hat caught him and refused to sort him. He couldn't see the castle and had no magic of his own, so he'd been faking having magic for months before this so his family wouldn't catch on. His older brother flew him to the school on a broom since he wouldn't have been able to make it through the barrier to the train.

** The greatest challenge would be the classes that actually require using a wand. Those are Transfiguration, Charms and Defence. It's also indicated that Potions require the witch or wizard to perform magic of their own as well, hence Filch is incapable of brewing them. That's already more than half of the core classes. She'd be fine in Herbology, Astronomy and History of Magic though, which probably already earns her more OWLs than Goyle will ever get.

*** I was hoping that chemistry could help with potions, even if it's just making them explode and being like “oops I failed!” The other ones, though, I have no idea how she could fake defense or transfiguration.

** Besides the whole muggle repelling thing, remember that Draco had been tasked with finding a way to get the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, and I can't remember if it was stated outright or implied, as security was greater after the Crouch/Moody affair. The wards would only allow those that were supposed to be there or allowed to come onsite.

Not on THE LIST (a quill that writes the name and a book that decides whether they are worthy), then you aren't getting in.

** There was a lovely NextGen story, which I cannot find anywhere (please, help!), where Neville Longbottom was a professor at Hogwarts and his daughter, who grew up in the castle, knew every nook and cranny, ghosts told her bedtime fairy tales, turns out to be a squib. The story is how she struggles to be included into students of Hogwarts.

** The standard way this see to be played is 'muggle comes from a different universe and is thus immune to magic'. Seen that in a few fics.

I think fanon holds there is no way for muggles to end up at Hogwarts. I'm not sure I buy it: squibs have been to Hogwarts, and unless you want to classify 'non-magical wizard-born' separately, you could probably believably do something like this.

You would have to think up a reason they could bypass the protections...
