I'm looking for a good sad fic with Severus Snape as main character. I want it to be so sad that's its gonna make me sob for hours when reading it. Any pairing, any length, in English, no warnings can scare me.

Break me, please, I need a good cry.


** "Eileen and Tobias" by white mouse is a very old but excellent story, I think. Two-shot about Snape's childhood

** The Birthday Present is my favorite Snape centered fic. It is not necessarily sad but not happy either.

** the carriage held. this might not be sad per se, I'm always trying to stay away from sad, but this one fic was very depressing. it also had humor though. and it's not about Lily. basically just Snape going through things by himself. Dumbles and Mcgone will also turn their back from him etc. very depressing to me and it has two endings, if you want to get the more depressing one. It is a very good fic too methinks.

also this time loop. getting the hang of thursdays. also have two endings and the happy one is the last chapter so you could just not read it. I wish I didn't read the sad one.

  The Dark Lord lingers. Severus spirals. Did Harry Potter ever truly exist at all?[Severus Snape splits his time between the war effort, a mysterious plot hatched by his students, the ever nefarious Dolores Umbridge, and the physical and mental well-being of Harry Potter. The last one turns out to be more difficult than it sounds. And then things take a turn for the worse. OotP AU in which it turns out the Dark Lord had more than one way to return from the dead, and Severus discovers just how far he has left to fall. Expect dark humor, a liberal dose of angst, and plenty of Severus Snape's personal opinions.Other things to look forward to in this fic include: Dolores Umbridge's frankly deeply disturbing crush on Severus Snape, Minerva and Severus as best bros, Albus Dumbledore as a really bad prankster, Lucius Malfoy as a poncy git, Kreacher the house-elf, a Harry Potter who seems more and more different every day, a surprisingly pragmatic Hermione Granger, and a Severus Snape who for some reason can't stop dreaming about the Dark Lord.]

  A good day goes bad and then gets far worse than Severus could ever have imagined. Again and again and again. Inspired by the WIKTT Time-Loop Challenge.
