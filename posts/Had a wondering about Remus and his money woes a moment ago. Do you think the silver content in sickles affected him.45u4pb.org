** Werewolves in HP canon are not affected by silver at all. From Pottermore:

#+begin_quote
  The many Muggle myths and legends surrounding werewolves are, in the main, false, although some contain nuggets of truth. Silver bullets do not kill werewolves, but a mixture of powdered silver and dittany applied to a fresh bite will â€˜seal' the wound and prevent the victim bleeding to death (although tragic tales are told of victims who beg to be allowed to die rather than to live on as werewolves).
#+end_quote

I also recall in OotP that they were drinking out of solid silver goblets, and there was no mention of Remus being allergic to silver there either.

** I remember somewhere reading that there's a goblin-applied charm on sickles to prevent this exact thing from being an issue... problem is, I can't remember if it was canon or fanon :/

*** According to the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Werewolf][HP wiki]], with a reference to Pottermore: "Contrary to what the Muggle world believes, werewolves are not affected by silver, except in that it can be used to prevent death and merely closes their wounds to prevent bleeding in a severe werewolf attack."

**** But it's [[/u/Karinta]] 's story. If she wants to have Hermione be allergic to silver, who's to stop her? I mean, the whole point of fanfic is to deviate from canon, right?

****** No, me neither. I see it more as a source of inspiration rather than a guideline. If everyone followed canon religiously, then there wouldn't be any fanfiction.

******* Yes obviously, but it's nice to tell people about it anyway. In this case they're not, but they could be the kind of person that prefers to follow canon and now would go on to write something that deviates from it.

I for instance, would have loved to be informed that I was making as "mistake"

** Do we see any instances of skin contact with silver being a problem in canon? I know blood contact is an issue since silver/dittany is used to seal the bite wound according to Pottermore, but blood contact vs skin contact are very different things.

There may be some slight discomfort at the very most is what I'd think. Not like the dramatic 'my hand is on fire' we see in old vampire movies when they touch a cross. But if there's nothing in canon to say or imply that there was an issue (like the goblets another post mentioned!) then there's no reason to think the silver in sickles would be an issue.
