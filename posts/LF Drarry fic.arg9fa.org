Okay um looking for a Drarry Fic with this plot. I dont remember when they start a relationship but it is near the early middle part of the fic. Im pretty sure it was on FNN. Harry leaves the wizarding world for a few years after the war. He comes back finds Draco with his friends. Draco owns a shop and an apartment and Harry eventually moves in with him. Draco discovers Harry has only a year or so to live and wants him to tell his friends. I don't remember if he does but Harry's time comes to die and he requests Draco to bring him to the forbidden forest so he can die there. Draco watches him die and leaves. Harry wakes up and goes to find Draco.
