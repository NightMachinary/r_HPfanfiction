Is it too OP to make my characters create unsupported flight in their 7th year?

I'm writing a fanfiction in which harry is reincarnated into the Marauders era. He becomes friends with both lily and severus.

They practice magic together in a group.

*They become proficient in occlumens and legilimens in their 3rd yr.

*Become animagi in their 5th yr

*Create unsupported flight in their 7th yr.

Would this be too ridiculous or OP?


** **They become proficient in occlumens and legilimens in their 3rd yr.*

Way too OP. It's obscure magic, with powerful witches and wizards becoming "proficient" in it.

**Become animagi in their 5th yr*

Not too OP. This is, canonically, when Sirius, James, and Peter managed to become Animagi, and it was taught to children at Uagadou (the African magical school) even younger. The process to become one was long and highly involved, though.

**Create unsupported flight in their 7th yr.*

Too OP. Only two characters in canon are known to be able to fly unsupported: Voldemort and Snape, the latter learning it from the former. People were godsmacked when they saw Voldemort fly in DH, so it's rare enough to be mythical and terrifying.

In the end, it's your story, of course. I would just caution that less is more. Imo, it would be interesting for your characters to acquire just one of these skills.

*** I agree. I'll move them being good enough in legilimens and occlumens to 5th yr.

Unsupported flight I guess I'll do it when they are done with Hogwarts

** By canon standards, probably.

By fanfic standards, not really.

Let's work through the list.

#+begin_quote
  They become proficient in occlumens and legilimens in their 3rd yr.
#+end_quote

We don't really have much of a canon basis to go on here. If Snape and Dumbledore seemed to believe that Harry could learn at least some basic occlumency within a few months. So some third years might be able to pull it off with some good teachers or reference books over the course of a year. Legilimency, on the other hand, is apparently rare, so it's probably hard to learn. Third years learning it seems like a bit much, but not necessarily Mary Sue levels of OP.

In fanfics, I've seen plenty of stories where pureblood families teach their kids occlumency from a young age, so you're probably good there. Legilimency is still rare and powerful though. But if it's necessary for your fic, I don't think anyone will mind.

#+begin_quote
  Become animagi in their 5th yr
#+end_quote

In canon, the Marauders did it, so it's definitely possible. We don't know how long they spent working on it though.

In fanfics, it takes like a week to become an animagus.

#+begin_quote
  Create unsupported flight in their 7th yr.
#+end_quote

That seems like a bit of a stretch. Unsupported flight was something witches and wizards have been trying to figure out for years, and Voldemort was the one to do it. It seems like a stretch for some teenagers to suddenly figure it out, unless they get some sort of help. Like finding something helpful in the Chamber of Secrets, or Harry somehow getting it from Voldemort pre-reincarnation.

On that note, if Harry remembers his pre-reincarnation life, that could easily be used to justify any of this. Especially if his death is several years after Voldemort's canon defeat.

** It's your story so it all depends on what the standard is. I mean there were most certainly extraordinary feats performed by students in the books.

Voldemort (although in a league of his own) already had mastered the Unforgivable Curses, managed to cast memory charms so powerful that it could deceive Ministry officials and had already created two horcruxes, all by seventeen.

Harry had mastered a corporeal Patronus by thirteen and even though we don't realize how far he has come during his training for the Triwizard Tournament, we see that he is in fact quite good compared to even students older than him during his DA training. He never really masters Occlumency but I don't think it's a skill he really ever cared for (because despite saying otherwise, he was really curious to see what Voldemort was up to).

Sirius says about Snape that when he came to Hogwarts he knew more dark magic than students in seventh year. He even invented quite a few spells of his own, of which, one is a very sinister severing curse. He comes up with improved techniques for potions on his own.

So, even relying on canon, I don't think your story makes the characters too OP.

I don't know about Lily though. Everyone seems to praise her, but for some reason, my headcanon is that she was shit in potions and Snape was the one who helped her enter the graces of Slughorn.

** Is this adult!Harry reincarnating? In that case, I guess he can look like a prodigy by simply relying on his previous life's skills. The others? I guess given a dedicated mentor can speed things up by quite a bit.

At the same time, if my headcanon is correct, it might not be a good idea for one's mental health to learn Occlumency when too young.

Flight---I wouldn't go that far, because it would be accomplishing something that wizards have been trying and failing to accomplish for many centuries. (IIRC, the inventor of the Levitation Charm at first thought that he had mastered flight, but it was only his clothes.)

Actually, new headcanon: Voldemort's and Snape's flight were accomplished by smuggling in some magic carpets and making underwear out of them.

The bottom line, though, is what you do with it. That is, against whom will they be using this power?

*** Yes it's Harry reincarnated into the Marauders era.

I won't be making occlumency too complicated with how it's perceived in fanon. In my story it will be only to prevent your mind be penetrated by a legilimens. And since Malfoy learned it in 6th year, I don't think it has detrimental. Perhaps I can make it that it makes them become more in control of their emotions.

They will create unsupported flight to be able to fight against Voldemort and death eaters. Perhaps to escape places that have anti apparate jinxes

** In my headcanon, Voldemort and Snape's unsupported flight is a development of Lily-hover (a technique she was able to perform at 9 years old) that I imagined she and Snape managed to master to some extent together while they were still friends. However, I believe that by the time their friendship (and thus further tinkering with the enchantment) ended, they had yet to manage completely unaided flight. I then figured Snape later revealed it to Voldemort, who perfected it. Mostly because I always liked the irony in Voldemort taking and using something that was initially developed by a Muggleborn -- the very same Muggleborn that would be quite the thorn in his side later on.

While I can get behind students being able to mess with their momentum, perhaps even glide, in 7th year in a similar fashion to Severus and Lily in my headcanon above, I highly doubt they'd be able to master truly unaided flight. The same with Legilimency in 3rd year.

I could definitely buy them becoming good at Occlumency in 3rd year and Animagi in 5th year, though. Remember, the Marauders became Animagi in 5th year at the latest in canon.

** If Harry is reincarnated Occlumemcy and Legimency would be fine as a third year, he wouldn't be studying a lot of magic (someone that got their OWLs should breeze through the first few years) and would have enough time to master it. Animagus transformation as a 5th year wouldn't even be OP first time around. Flight is the only thing I consider OP, Voldemort is the only wizard to achieve wandless flight on his own withing the thousands of years of wizarding history. Harry is a DADA prodigy, he was able to tutor 7th years during his fifth. But he seems mediocre in most other magical fields. Wandless flight looks like charms territory, and I really can't see him ever reaching this kind of level.

**** As a writer I like to employ the Chekhov's gun principle (i.e. all elements introduced in the story should serve a role at some point in the plot) in my writing, because as a reader, I hate reading long stories containing lots of irrelevant information (such as the ASOIAF book do). Of course, everyone has their style, but if you want to stick with JK's writing style, you'll have to give these skills a purpose. For example, I'm sure Voldemort or Dumbledore had lots of uncommon skills but only those that serve a purpose to the plot are mentioned. Same for the Marauders... they only learn how to become animagi because they want to comfort their friend. Harry has an invisibility cloak so he doesn't need the skill to sneak around. Occlumency is only introduced as a device to further the rift between Harry and Snape.

I would suggest a self-transfiguration for the unsupported flight. It would be a unique exploration of what was hinted at in book four.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.
