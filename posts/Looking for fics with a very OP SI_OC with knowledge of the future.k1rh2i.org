Hello, I'm looking for fics where someone from our world who read the books gets reinacrnated into harry potter and finds magic extremely easy to do and becomes very strong at a young age. Maybe the OC can be a genius in wandless magic or do things that no other wizard or witch can do because of the reincarnation thing. I would also prefer if the oc/si actually uses their future knowledge to change some things.

I would prefer if the oc/si is the same age Harry or close to his age or the same age as lily and severus with the story taking place in the marauders era.

Idc if the OC is some random person with muggle parents or if they end up being related to a canon character like becoming harry's twin or something, I just want the story to be well-written and have a good plot.


** My friend and I are writing an SI fic. Not Voldemort or Dumbledore-level OP, but much stronger than average. Our SIs are both in Fred & George's year.

  The fuckery of Lyra and James, two idiots who can't agree on how their thrust into the wizarding world should be handled. Double SI. Co-written with darienqmk.

  On the other side of the hill, at the end of a vast field is a house, sister to Malfoy Manor, a house that stands as much in the sunlight as the other stands in shade, a house that opens up her arms to a group of lost souls in the aftermath of battle. In the summer of '98 this group of not - quite- children find a series of hidden underground passageways linking the two houses and Harry begins to learn that a lot of things that appear opposites are connected so much more completely than he ever realised. Strange things are happening to Hermione in the library at Mallowsweet as she works to juggle two romances, there are entities far bigger than Voldemort at work and nothing is simple any more.....then again it never was.Drarry with a side order of Kromione. Should still work as a story for anyone who hasn't heard The Magnus Archives but some A+ crossover times if you have :-)
