I wanted to post this in the [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] but people aren't always nice there and Lupin is wildly popular in the fandom. I do sympathize that he had a terrible life due to being a werewolf. Anyway, Lupin is likable but also questionable, in addition to his temporarily ditching Tonks in book 7. Some things I wonder:

-Harry is Remus's best friend's son. Your best friend's kid is almost like a nephew or niece. I am sure that Remus had love for Harry before Hogwarts. Why doesn't he contact him before book 3, at least write a letter? Even if Dumbledore told him to stay away? He could just say, 'Sod it, Dumbledore, you're not god' and write him?

-Why didn't he keep in better touch with Harry after his Hogwarts stint? He could have been like another godfather. Actually he doesn't write Harry at all even though we see him during a couple of holidays.

-Why isn't he more apologetic/embarrassed to Snape regarding the Werewolf Prank? Yes Lupin can't help turning into a werewolf, didn't really do anything but I would have still felt embarrassed. And furious with Sirius.

-And this isn't against Lupin, more like a general plot device question, but why does he praise Snape at least twice for making the Wolfsbane Potion at Hogwarts perfectly? I get it's a difficult and rare potion, but Snape probably *had* to make it perfectly because his boss Dumbledore told him to, not because of Snape's benevolence!

Someone in the other sub said Lupin seems like someone who uses his likable personality to hide his cowardice and unreliability, and I think that's a fair point. Characters who appear one way while masking something else are super interesting. Your thoughts?


** I don't think Lupin qualifies as gray. His flaws are just a little more relatable/common.

He has absolutely no reason to be apologetic to Snape. Snape at best wanted to expose hia secret. At worst, he was out to kill him/get him killed. Lupin literally ran from the minister in DH. Imagine how parents would have reacted during the middle of the previous war.

*** Good point re: Snape had a strong idea of what he was getting into.

With the potion, the point I was trying to make is that I don't think Snape doing what he was supposed to do is something to hype up. It is a testament to Snape's skill to make a supposedly complicated potion, but when Lupin says 'he made it perfectly so I wouldn't have to suffer...' well he was supposed to! If Snape fucked up Dumbledore would be on him.

**** This is speculation but as such a good potions master Snape could've played with the recipe and made a potion that while effective could have unpleasant side effects, maybe even letting the potion still let Lupin keep his wits but the pain remaining. Lupin seems like the person that would not go tattle to Dumbledore about it. Snape not being malicious once in his life might be why Remus praises him

** I think he is one of the most human characters in the book because he had flaws. That's what I like on Remus Lupin. He doesn't try to hide that he is constantly afraid of disappointing someone - he says so outright in POA and in DH. He also acts to his fears. I think for some time now that the reason why Sirius thought that Remus is the spy was not only because he was a werewolf but because it is obvious that he isn't the strongest man character wise. He didn't betray them because even with all his flaws and his insecurity he is loyal to the core and would have never joined Voldemort to save his hide like Pettigrew did - but I do see why Sirius had this thought.

To the werewolf prank: I think Remus had a right to be pissed about Snape and not embarised. Sure - Sirius led Snape to Remus. But Snape tried to prove that Remus is a werewolf for ages before that. And if Snape had found prove and outed him, Remus would have lost his place in the school and any hope for a future beside being a criminal like most werewolfes are. (Which is exactly what happened in POA by the way - hardly anyone knew that Remus was a werewolf until Snape outed him. Which led to even more poverty and misery for Remus than ever before) So yeah - while I don't think "the Prank" was the right thing to do, I totally see why Remus didn't pity Snape at all.

** You left out what, in my opinion, was his most unforgiveable sin: because he didn't want Dumbledore to give him the "I'm so disappointed" look over stuff that happened when he was a schoolboy, he didn't tell anybody that Sirius was an animagus AND knew multiple secret passages into Hogwarts. He didn't tell even after Sirius got into the castle TWICE, once actually standing over Ron's bed with a knife!

As far as he knew at the time, Sirius betrayed one of his friends and murdered another (along with collateral damage in Lily and 12 muggles), and was trying to kill his friend's only child---who was also a student under his (dubious) care. Yet, rather than have to reveal an embarrassing story from when he was a teenager, he didn't say a word.

*** I agree. Dumbledore's patented look is no excuse for letting someone who you think is a mass murderer in by not mentioning the fact he's a Animagus. Sure, he told himself Sirius must've learned dark magic, but it's still handy to mention when organizing the defense - especially the secret passageways. Even if he didn't want to tell Dumbledore about the map, he had it in his possession for a good part of the year - what stopped him from securing the passages himself? That would've stopped a whole lot of trouble. Essentially, he was willing to let his pupils die to avoid Dumbledore's disappointment, while being perfectly willing to admit to it at the end - but I don't think he told Dumbledore about the map or Sirius' method of getting in even when he left Hogwarts.

*** While I think he should be furious with Sirius, I don't think he showed it. Remus wasn't exactly the type who stood up against his friends. It's only speculation of course but since the Prank and Snapes Worst Memory both happend in fifth year and the marauders only did the transformation in fifth year both events can't be far appart and Remus didn't seem angry during his OWLs.

*** I imagine he was. We just don't see the memories of how they made up, but I think all the Marauders were mad at Sirius, not just for endangering Snape (who knew what he was doing), but for endangering Remus in the process. After all, what'd you think would happen if they found the mangled body of a pupil and identified the wounds as being done by a werewolf? There'd be a manhunt to find the wolf, Dumbledore would be forced to admit to letting a werewolf in (not to mention the risk of Peter ratting him out, or Remus feeling so guilty he'd admit to it in a instant) and Remus would probably be found and thrown to Azkaban. James, for one, would be painfully aware of that. I imagine somehow they made up.

** I don't disagree that Remus isn't as overwhelmingly perfect as a lot of people seem to think, but I don't think he's grey and I don't really agree with your points.

First of all, it's pretty clear he wasn't interested in having a child. There's absolutely nothing morally wrong with that. If my best friend had a child I would tolerate it for them, of course, and play the cool aunt, but if they died when the child was a year old I'd make zero effort to stay in contact with it. If I ran into the child later on, I'd probably offer to talk about their parents with them, but not much more. Remus had zero obligation toward Harry, and acted generally positively toward him anyway, so I'm not sure how his lack of letter writing makes him grey.

And as far as the werewolf thing... he was as much as a victim as Snape (arguably more of a victim since Snape did knowingly choose to investigate something potentially dangerous; Remus had zero choice at all that night). It also happened almost twenty years ago. I'm pretty sure he has much worse memories and most important things to worry about.

Remus is a somewhat complex character, but only in that he's weak and has a low sense of self worth. He's not what is generally considered morally grey.

** This might be more my personal interpretation of the character, but whatever.

For point the first, I believe that Remus had had something of a falling out with the others due to some suspicions that he was a spy within the Order, possibly due to his seemingly sympathizing with the werewolves loyal to Greyback, and by extention Voldemort.

For point the second, I don't really have an answer for, but at the same time I would like to point out that Harry could've written to him too but didn't.

For point the third, why should he be? He was just as much a victim of that incident as Snape was; and had James not intervened when he did, it likely would've resulted in Remus's expulsion at a bare minimum, and death at the worst.

For point the fourth, it could just be him trying to be courteous to a fellow colleague, but I think there's an underlying attempt on Remus's part to not give Snape an excuse to "mess up" the potion and "accidentally" make a lethal concotion. I suspect that because it's pretty clear that Snape hates Remus almost as much as he does James and Sirius.

  Yeah regarding the letter-writing I just thought since Lupin is the adult he should be the one initiating things. And with the potion, if Snape did 'mess up' then Dumbledore would have been on him, and Snape needs to stay in Dumbledore's back pocket. So even if he fantasized about screwing up the potion the chances of him doing it are low.

**** Maybe, but I could see Snape easily coming up with a dozen or so different reasons for how and why the potion didn't work as intended, ranging from poor quality potions ingredients to "some dunderheaded Gryffindor messing with potions that are beyond their feeble understanding", or something along those lines.

** Well, I don't know if Harry would've been like a nephew to Remus. First of all, the Potters went into hiding very soon after Harry's birth. Maybe he never even saw him. Remember, they were suspicious of him. Apart from that, it is very possible he didn't want to interfere in Harry's happy family life and accidentally endanger him and his family. If Harry grew up happy, what good could it possibly do to meet the shabby best friend of his father who had nothing to offer him (or so he thought, I suspect. He's hardly known for being aware of his self-worth at the best of times)? Your second point is really very interesting. After all, if even Sirius could write to Harry while on the run, why wouldn't Remus? Even if he thought he was only a teacher to Harry (which he was), he could, by this point, guess that Harry was, in fact, interested in his dads' old friends. Even if only sporadically, he must've been able to afford a owl /sometimes/. I don't really know any reason for that one, I can only guess he didn't want to grow closer to Harry. I mean, he meets the Dursley's at the end of year 5 and before that he hears they don't care if Harry lives; he has zero reason to assume Harry is happier without him. I always thought that he /was/ mad at Sirius at the time, that it played a role in his assumptions that Sirius was the traitor. He just sort of grew over it. That doesn't excuse the fact that he doesn't disagree with Sirius when the latter claims Snape ‘deserved it' (mind, Snape interfered around that time, so there wasn't much time).Maybe his constant politeness, praising of Snape's skills and appreciation, not to mention telling Harry he'll always appreciate how Snape made the potion correctly, enabling him to teach at Hogwarts at all, are his way of making up for it. I mean, even if Snape was forced to make the potion correctly, nothing's stopping him from making a ‘mistake', but he didn't. Even if that was only to protect the students, Remus can still appreciate it. I always read that as Remus simply being kind and somewhat guilty about his past behavior, but not really having the balls to tell Snape. Would be IC.

** Although ditching Tonks in book 7 wasn't cool at all, I think that maybe Remus didn't want a child. We don't know what kind of contraception exists in the wizarding world. As a childfree person, I understand how Remus could have freaked out, even if I still think he was responsible for his actions. Same stands for baby Harry: if Remus didn't like kids or didn't feel he had the potential to become a good parental figure, he had the right to back off. But to be fair, the books made it pretty clear that Dumbledore made all of the decisions by himself and made sure Harry remained out of contact with wizards until he was 11.
