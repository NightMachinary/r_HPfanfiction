:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So it sorta just came to mind out of nowhere and I've been ruminating on it for awhile. There was a crossover fic for Naruto and Harry Potter and all I can really remember of it is that Naruto was dying with his like great great grandchild by his bedside and reincarnated into the body of young Harry and seemed to mostly just carry over an impressive Occlumency ability. Does anyone have any clue what I'm talking about?

  An old and dying Naruto throws his soul forward through time in order to prevent the Juubi's escape upon his death. His soul merges with that of 15 month old Harry Potter in the moment the Killing Curse is reflected. Super!Harry.

  Pain and misery, the two constants in Harry Potter's life awaken in him something that has not been seen for several centuries. Will it mean the salvation of the magical world, or will it be its dissolution to nothingness? Concepts from Naruto, and Crossover with Dresden Files later.
