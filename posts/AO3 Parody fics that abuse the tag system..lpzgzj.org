There have been a few parody fics that are used for the sole purpose of pointing out the tag abuse. Do you think they are justified?


** No, those people are dickheads and wasting the time of the volunteers that run the site.

** Not really. Why add to the problem that they hate so much? Aren't they just creating more walls of tags people have to scroll through?

I don't know, just comes across a bit childish to me.

**** At least they're working on it! It'll come someday. Until then, at least there are some decent workarounds.

** If you don't like the tags, use fanfiction.net or some other site. Stop being an arsehole for the other million people who use it.

** Justified or not, it's not the right path to get their issue solved. This is just a dick move towards the volunteers who run the site - all this will do is sour them to their actual cause.

It's like one of those people who always complain about holiday medical services being taken up by people who've drank too much or taken some bad drug or something going off and getting incredibly drunk themselves. Like, yes, they're trying to make a point, but they're going about it in a terrible way, regardless of whether the point is valid or not.

** Can you provide a recommendation/example to look at? I've read several fics on AO3 but not sure I've seen one whose purpose (or one of them) was to point out tag abuse.

*** linkao3(29639040)

Most recent one. There were others.

EDIT: And they got removed minutes ago. Just my luck. Fact is, their criticism was somewhat valid. The tag system on AO3 is broken like a mule's back. It was the first time I've seen it abused as a statement though.

**** Is that parody though? It seems legit and the exact thing the parody people wanted to protest about... Can't say for sure.
