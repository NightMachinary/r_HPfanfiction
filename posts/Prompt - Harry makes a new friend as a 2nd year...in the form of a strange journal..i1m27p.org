After learning about The-Boy-Who-Lived, Tom Riddle decides to "become his friend" instead of opening the Chamber of Secrets and killing muggle-borns. After all, this is the boy who ended him, he would never find a greater weapon, and he can't help but feel a connection with him... Like they were meant to be /friends/.

Feel free to take it whatever direction you want to! I'll make my own post in the comments as well. I can't wait to see your takes on the prompt!

^ _ ^

Have fun!


** Harry had found the journal on his bed one day. He tried to find out if it belongs to anyone, but after everyone denying it as theirs, he decided to keep it. It was an old blank journal; after all, he is sure to find some way to use it.

Eventually, he decided to use it to keep track of valuable information---tests, schedules...whatever needed to remember. So he sat in the common room and wrote the date, along with the most annoying thing Snape had done that day.

He hadn't expected the journal to respond.

*/He sounds like a horrible man./*

Harry stared at the pages for a moment.

/You can talk?/

*/Of course. I am Pharrell Mcgillis, you are?/*

/Harry Potter./

/---

"Harry, you take that bloody book with you everywhere!" Ron hissed, "You think you could leave it behind when you're eating!"

"No, I can't! He'll be lonely!"

Harry snapped his mouth shut as soon as he'd said that. Things had been tough lately. The book seemed to be his only real friend after he was outed as a parseltongue...they treated him as less than human. Pharrell /understood. After/ all, he is, was a parseltongue too. /Pharrel is his friend. Unlike these two who stare at him with those concerned eyes because he can talk to snakes./

"He.../He will be lonely?"/ Ron blinks and glancing at Hermione.

The girl gives him a concerned look, "Harry...This book is unhealthy! We should take it to Dumbledore--"

"NO!"

Harry didn't mean to shout so loud.

The rest of the table stopped talking and looked at him.

It seemed as everyone stopped talking to stare at the Parseltongue. Ha. They went back to their food and discussion in a matter of seconds, but it appeared eternal for Harry.

"Harry Potter. Your grades have been steadily dropping, and you don't talk to anyone anymore; you barely even talk to /us./ The people aren't avoiding you because you're a parseltongue, they're avoiding you because you're rude to them, and avoid them!" Hermione hissed at him and pointed to the book, "/It's/ responsible for this, Harry, please, you have to understand that!"

"She's right, mate," Ron states, "Ever since you've gotten that book...you've been off."

"It's not '/that book,'/ or '/it' you know."/

There was a second of silence.

"He has a name. It's /Pharrell Mcgillis./"

With those words, he promptly got up, leaving the Great Hall without even touching breakfast.

"Ron...we have to tell Dumbledor, this has gone on long enough. It's been weeks."

/---

"Harry, your teachers, tell me that you've been exhibiting some concerning behavior," Dumbledore began carefully, "Is there something you wish to talk about?"

"No, sir. Nothing." With the way that the headmaster looked at him, peering over his half-moon spectacles, Harry realized he wouldn't be able to get away with that statement.

"Nothing...Nothing at all?"

"No, sir. Nothing at all."

"Very well, then." Dumbledore sighed, "Of you go." Harry quickly walked towards the door of the room. "But Harry, please come back when you're ready, to tell the truth."

The boy froze.

"But Professor Dumbledor, I am telling the truth."

Harry didn't wait for the headmaster to respond, leaving quickly to head down the spiral staircase.

It was true what Pharrell said...they would separate him...separate him from his only friend, Pharrell.

/---

Dumbledor waited three days for Harry to come back before calling him back to his office.

"I know about the journal Harry."

As soon as he heard that, Harry froze.

So he did know...he was going to take his only friend away from him. He took a few steps back, turning to walk through the door before it slammed shut in front of him.

"Harry. Don't you go through that door."

He was startled by the seriousness in the headmaster's voice, he never heard the man talk like that before, and he doubts anyone else has either.

"I know you have it on you, bring it here."

"No Professor, you don't understand--" He pleaded to turn back to look at Dumbledor, back pressed against his only exit, desperate for it to open. "It is dangerous, Harry; it's dark magic."

"It's not. And it's not an /'It'/ sir. He's my friend, and you can't have him!"\\
With a flick of his wand, Dumbledore wordlessly summoned both the book and his wand, grabbing both as they flew at him, sitting them gently on his desk.

"Let's talk about this, Harry."
