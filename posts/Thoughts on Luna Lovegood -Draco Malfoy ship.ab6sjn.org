my friends and i were recently discussing about weird ships in harry potter when this odd pairing got brought up. the weirdo and the cool guy seemed like a good chick flick plot. what are your thoughts on this pairing and would u know an existing fanfic about them?? let me know haha


** I've seen a few Druna fics around over the years. They're definitely considered a rare pair, so there aren't too many that I can think of.

** I think this pairing has all the characterisation issues of Dramione, without the opportunity for a twisted plot such as linkffn(Heap Coals of Fire on His Head by White Squirrel).

** I have read a Theodore Nott x Hermione fanfic a while ago. There was Ron x Pansy, Blaise x Ginny and Draco x Luna in the side-lines. It is the only fanfic I have read with the pair. I liked the Theodore x Hermione pairing but the Draco x Luna pairing was just plain awful to read for me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12505731/1/Extinction][Extinction]] pairs Draco with Luna, but it's a Cissamione fic and Draco and Luna are not in it as much as other side characters. I do think they are both very in character, so it's not like Draco is redeemed or his behavior is forgotten or justified. Luna is just her sweet, loving self, and Draco seems to have changed (a bit).

*** I believe many in the fandom give Draco and Snape a pass for how they behaved all those years because of Epilogue. In the case of Draco, there is also the actor´s good performance to be taken into consideration and the fact that , well, based on chemistry alone, many were dissastisfied on how things turned out...

​

At any rate, I do read a lot of Hermione or Luna paired with Slytherins and Draco and Snape are the ones we get to see, in the end, at least chance of redemption and from there a fanfiction writer can do a LOT. (Lucius is a very interesting character, but there is not much for us to go there in terms of redemption, right?)

Regardless, for fanfiction writers, a relationship of opposites, where the main pairing has a LOT to overcome in terms of political, familiar and social standards and expectations is much more INTERESTING than what it feels like a safe, predicatable and all too perfect happy ending couple.

​

So, what I was trying to say is, if well written, a Luna Draco fic COULD work. ( but anything Harry-Tom Riddle or Harry-Voldermort or any fic that whitewash Death Eaters ( hello cleotheo!) , ake Harry or Hermione racist or has all Muggles are evil just to justifiy the pairinga is LAZY as fuck!)

As for fics:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8226674/1/The-Vow]])

​

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8576790/1/The-Other-Heir]])

​

I simply LOVE the Vow, but it is incomplete; The Other Heir has a pretty dark set up, but it is complete.

​

There is also some one shots of pure smutty and crazines from Yeaka:

And others were disgusted that terrorists got off Scot's free or were even lauded as heroes. I mean, without Snape Harry's parents would not have been explicitly targeted in the first place. And that's not even taking into account that his "standards" deprived a whole country of manpower for crucial jobs because he was an atrocious teacher and yet only took in a smaller number of students in the advanced classes.

We can play that game both ways, but IMO Luna deserves better than the guy who enjoyed Hagrid's suffering and wanted Buckbeak executed to cover his own fuck-ups.

***** That is the thing: even the hero named his son Albus Severus...so, yeah, you can either read it as a redemption tale, or feel vindicated by his death. In the case of Draco, I would say that YES he should have received some punishment - the whole think with Katie Bell comes to mind- but frankly, Hogwarts was a place where bullying ran rampant, there is this " boy will be byos" attitude that is TERRIBLE and I guess in the aftermath of second war, like in the aftermath of the first war MANY things that should happened DID NOT.

​

My point remains: there are some DE where you can write some pretty compelling redemption arcas and from there, yes I would buy a romance with Luna...as there are others that you REALLY have to spin an AU where Harry was a complete jerk to make it happen.

  Our favorite ginger twins were managing mischief long before they arrived at Hogwarts, such as convincing 5 year old Draco Malfoy to make an Unbreakable Vow to marry Luna Lovegood when he grew up. No one took it seriously, until Draco tried to marry someone else. PS - Fred is alive. At least until the Malfoys get a hold of him...
