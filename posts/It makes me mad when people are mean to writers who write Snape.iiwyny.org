Like I feel like Snape is a good example of a character who could've been a really good grey character, but JKR messed it up. When people write Snape and adjust his character to fit the narrative and their fanfic, it makes sense to me. That's what fanfic is about. Using characters and worlds to create your own emotions and outlets. There is tons of HP fanfic out there, you can ignore him and keep reading or you can find a new fic. Don't comment every time he appears expressing your distaste.


** "Making Snape grey" has always feel off for me. Isn't Snape already grey?

*** I'd say that Snape is grey, but somewhat poorly handled grey. If you're reading the books with the usual like kid growing up with the characters perspective, he lands - starting out as the mean scary teacher who's easy to assume the worst of, and then slowly learning his complexities and how the one person to show him genuine kindness eventually caused him to throw his lot in with the side of good despite his mistakes.

The problem comes when you read the books again, being closer in age to Snape than to Harry, and realize that his menacing of students - which works very well to make him appear a dislikeable antagonist and set up the twist of his actually becoming a hero - is, well, a grown man committing child abuse. It's hard to read his redemption as fully valid when chronologically /after/ it he spends his time not just being strict and unpleasant (as I believe he was intended to come off), but actively bullying eleven year olds. So it ends up coming down to the reader to suspend their disbelief pretty hard in order to try and focus on the Doylist intentions rather than the Watsonian result, or to fanfiction authors to either treat his behavior the way an adult sees it as deserving to be treated or /adjust/ his behavior to try and bring it more in line with the actual intended greyness.

****** I don't think it says much about the dynamic of Hinny since Ginny definitely "wears the pants" in that relationship. I think it says a lot about fan service by authors and how even good writers can make shitty decisions. Also, there is the theory that Ginny is the one to bring us Severus and/or encourages the name because of how Snape saved Ginny, Luna, and Neville from the Carrows throughout their 6th/7th year and how he gave them detention with Hagrid whenever he could. Honestly, those three (the silver trio?) were so ballsy they could've been killed by the carrows if snape didn't intervene.

**** Agree with your points, except that Snape never intended to redeem himself in front of Harry... in fact he hated Harry just as much as he hated James. He was only atoning for the fact that he had sentenced his friend to death. Doesn't make him less nasty or more likable... but it gives him some humanity. Harry chose to forgive him but then again, what's the point in holding grudges against the dead?

***** I agree. But I feel like we diverge at the same time with the same evidence.

I agree; he wasn't trying to redeem himself to Harry. If that was the case it would have been done in book one.

I agree; he certainly makes mistakes, and has significant character flaws. That is his entirely reasonable for a character and makes him more human.

'he was only a atoning for [sentencing] his friend to death'. This, I feel, doesn't support your statement to make him more human; it's not normal to desire emotional pain and abuse to the child of the man who won your teenage sweetheart's love. Especially if it's also said sweetheart's child. I feel this makes him less 'human' and more 'psychotic?'

Perhaps I'm not the typical (highly likely) person, but I feel this makes him less connected to humanity and more abstract/hyperbolic to an unacceptably abusive point.

****** While it could be concluded from one chapter, it's never even implied that Snape had any romantic interest in Lily. At the very most, you can draw the conclusion that he loved her as a friend. One of the things that always pisses me off is the fact that redditors talk about him as if he were creep. Lily accepted him and if he were only in for the pussy, I'm quite sure he wouldn't have taken upon himself to be so hated for a dead woman.

****** I would say that his animosity towards Harry goes beyond "child of the man who won your teenage sweetheart's love". James bullied and abused him mercilessly for years. If James followed through on his threat to remove Snape's underwear while dangling him upside down in front of the school he also sexually assaulted Snape in front of a crowd of his peers.

His treatment of Harry is not excusable, but more understandable in that context. I definitely think that if Lily had married someone who had no history of bullying Snape and Harry didn't bear such a strong resemblance to said bully (like maybe Xenophilius Lovegood?), Snape would have been a lot more even-handed toward Harry. Not necessarily friendly, but not actively hating him either.

He'll always be morally grey, and add to that the emotional scars of murdering Dumbledore, which would probably fester longer than his venom-scarred throat.

If you want a truly Gray character who murders people and also saves lives, look at Kiritsugu Emiya from FATE. An assassin for hire who accidentally helped destroy an entire city and then devoted his last few years to teaching the sole survivor of his greatest regret that there's no point in doing villainous things, so he should try to be a hero, no matter if it's by doing repair work or saving babies from burning buildings.

You seem to have this conception that grey means "being a good guy in the heart and has made mistakes". No. Grey means making significant bad decisions and significant good decisions. Redemption and the tone of the actions of the character do not depend of how much you like the character.

You're problem with Snape it's not that he is badly written, it's that it didn't have a redemption arc written as in other stories you have read. Having a or not a redemption arc, or completed or not is meaningless. A good character who has done great things and suddenly makes massive errors is not a redemption arc yet still a grey character. Not every grey character has to follow a redemption arc formula, otherwise it makes them feel less real, if every grey character is written with the same blue print.

Snape is an asshole. An abuser. A non-likeable douche. He did good deeds though. Some of which were crucial to keep all your favorite characters alive. It's not that JKRowling "failed" to write him likable enough, it's that he was never intended to be likeable. Snape sucks, and, as in real life, some characters just suck.

If I were to go to a school anywhere in the US or UK and abuse a group of kids in a school, I'd be fired at arrested. If I just so happened to know where the leader of ISIS is, that wouldn't excuse me of the child abuse.

Something like 97% of all Gray characters have some kind of code they follow, or line they don't cross, such as "I'll steal as much food as I want, but only from the rich," or "I don't care what anyone says or does, it doesn't matter---but if they get in my way, I'll kill 'em."

Snape doesn't have something like that. He's just an antagonistic asshat due to shit Harry has no control over, and then suddenly he sheds a tear over his obsession and then suddenly everyone acts like he shits Rainbows. He's not gray. He's a bad person who did two actions that had better than even results for the protagonist, and that's just bullshit.

***************** I have stated that he is a shit person already, but that doesn't mean he isn't grey.

And he does develop some lines. He doesn't care about his students but he does build some moral code for himself. Hence his hesitations about his "soul" when Dumbledore asks him to kill him.

Again redeeming is not a requirement for a grey character. A character can go from good to bad doing the opposite of redeeming and still be grey.

************** Kinda cutting randomly into the debate here without touching on the main topic, but I really don't buy the saving thing.

In book 1, He slightly delays Quirrel's actions; but it's Hermione (admittedly accidentally) knocking Quirrel over that saves him.

Book 5 is way more suspect. The kids have time to get Umbridge to follow them down into the forest, deal with Grawp and the centaurs, come back out from the forest, meet up with the rest of the group, get to the thestrals, fly from Scotland to London on said thestrals, meander their way through the DoM while checking out the different rooms, hold a conversation with the Death Eaters, give a go at fighting their way out, and fight for a bit in the room with the veil before the Order finally shows up. So in other words even being generous it took a good couple hours (though with Harry getting back to Dumbledore's office around dawn, I'd guess closer to 5 or more) for the Order to mobilize; which with apparation being the wizarding world's equivalent of a driving test, that's ridiculous. Therefore it stands to reason that Snape actively chose to wait to inform the Order.

A good example would be if Character A killed Character B because B knew too much information to be left alive, even though A is part of the good guys, and the information he just got from B is, I dunno, let's say... the possible whereabouts of the big bad's doomsday weapon. The good guys need to know this information, but don't want others to know they know, thus murdering their informant so he can't (accidentally or otherwise) inform their enemies. THAT is a Gray thing. It's definitely low on the Gray scale compared to, say, the extremely discriminate slaughter of innocents that the Death Eaters performed on Muggles and "blood traitors," but you're right, the fact that Snape abused Harry and didn't outright murder him obviously counterbalanced for all his sins.

He's a complete bastard, abuses his authority over children, literally joined a group of genocidal maniacs because HE was a cowardly little bitch and called his best friend the worst word he could, and she, understandably, broke off from him. The only reason he does anything to help against Voldemort is because ol' Voldy killed the woman he obsessed over, and before he ever even meets Harry he decides that he MUST be a spoiled brat, and despite literally every sign and flag showing otherwise, EVEN WHEN HE MINDR@PES HARRY under the guise of "Occlumency lessons," he never ONCE goes "what have I done? This child suffered in a similar way to how I suffered and all I did was add to it!" No. Instead, he's fucking relishing the fact that James Potter's son is treated like shit, because he blames literally everyone (including himself) for Lily's death, and only cared to see Harry survive long enough that the Prophecy was fulfilled and then both Harry and Voldemort could go choke in Hell for all Snape cared, because he's a selfish, hateful, evil bastard, and no matter how much you suck him off by reusing the only two "good" things he did in the entire series, they don't compare to all his other actions. A black-hearted, spiteful bastard cannot, by definition be considered "gray." End of story.

In BNHA Bakugou swearing profusely is the default, despite it stemming from a mistranslation in an unofficial translation. All of these are things that the majority of readers will take for granted, so for better or worse these things really don't need to be tagged.

Also, "What if" summaries are bad, but you know what's worse? A "What if" summary where the author doesn't know how to use questions marks. Or to make it doubly worse, a chain of "What if" questions in the summary. And of course you can make it even more awful with the "Find out ...." part of the summary.

Except for that bit where he joined the magical Nazis and worked his way into Voldemort's inner circle. And while we do not know what exactly he did to get into that position, it was hardly by serving tea. Then there is the whole prophecy bit where he ran straight to Voldemort despite knowing that he was signing someone's death warrant.

Then we get to his reformation, which is nonexistent. He is a highly abusive teacher who likely had a negative influence on the career choices of his students. I mean, the fact that he and not Bellatrix Lestrange or the death of his parents was Neville's boggart alone should be alarming.

But perhaps more importantly, we never see Snape reject Voldemort's ideology. He switches sides, but that seems personal rather than an ideological shift.

Do we have a real chance at seeing that, though? He spends the entire length of the series needing plausible deniability to Voldemort to remain the double/triple agent that he is. Not exactly a good canvass for a reformed Snape to showcase that rejection of Voldemort's ideology.

I think the most we can say (one way or the other) is that he initially switched sides for personal reasons, and that they were still the most important reason when he died - but more than that? It could be argued either way. (Just like we don't really know why he joined up in the first place - do we ever see Snape /supporting/ Voldemort's ideology, either? It always striked me as though he was more interested in power/knowledge than anything else.)

Snape is smart enough to know that Voldemort has no ideology. He's just out for himself. If you're talking about Death Eater ideology though, I think it's very clear in canon that Snape simply doesn't give a shit. His entire raison d'être is revenge against Voldemort. If Snape had survived the second war, I think it's very likely that he'd have bought a cabin in the middle of nowhere and never been heard from again.

*** I think it depends. Like, if it's a Slytherin!Harry story, good!Snape is implied anyways. Or if it has a Gryffindor bashing tag, James Potter bashing tag, Sirius Black bashing tag etc.

If you clicked on a fic that has Gryffindors throwing first year Slytherins off the Astronomy Tower and trying to hit them with hexes while they are falling down, I don't think it's the author's fault if you are flabbergasted when Snape smiles, mate.

But in stories that don't dedicate at least 100k words to how Slytherins are totally misunderstood and it's actually Ron Weasley's fault that an entire House is turned into a Nazi recruitment camp, a genuinely likable Snape is so rare that I'd have to agree with you. But in my experience, most of those stories are tagged properly anyways, yet authors still get shit for it.

In my opinion, he may be one of the more powerful wizards in the series but he is far too self-involved and weak-minded to be anything more than a puppet on strings for Dumbledore or Voldemort.

** I'm a HUGE 'Snape gets his eyes opened and becomes a *REAL* person' in HPff fan.

I had great difficulty just trying to get through the books; mostly, I've come to realize, due to the 'author' failing to warn that she'd written an 'AU world' where *all* of the 'Child Protection' Acts, Laws, and Provisions had been suspended or never enacted. Had I known that I'd have never attempted to read the first book!

Canon Snape is a 2-dimensional, cardboard cut-out 'villain' ala "Snidely Whiplash" (I believe in the UK the characterization is called "Dastardly Dick" ;) ) and is truly an abusive lout!

Discovering that he came from a background of alcoholic-induced poverty and abuse and then was horribly bullied at the one place that should have been a sanctuary turned my entire view of Snape on its head! All because IMO, canon Snape doesn't match with *that* kind of background!

In my 58 years of walking around, I've only come across that kind of personality in those 'rarified' and entitled pissants who've /grown up/ feeling superior and that that kind of vitriol only comes out when their egotism has taken a *major* 'hit': Having to take a job that they see as 'beneath' them; loss of their 'position' and/or monetary security; loss of their 'one true love' to a rival, etc., etc.. But Snape's background /does/ */not/* /match!!/

Which is why I *love* seeing writers 'stretch' Snape into becoming /Severus/! Severus Snape is the "Youngest Potions Master" ever(?) which means he's no dummy. Having been a spy against Moldy Warts (a /successful spy/) means his powers of observation and mental compartmentalization would have had to have been extraordinary. Yet Rowling expects us to believe that this acutely vigilant man couldn't see that this shorter than average, skinny, and frightened little boy /wasn't/ his rival reborn! The 'spy' would have watched and made note of the child and after /thorough/ observation come to a conclusion. Not this slap-dash rush to judgment!

Nope, I much prefer the more thoughtful and intelligent fanfiction writers' takes on Severus Snape, who's become my favorite character to read.., outside of realistic and/or rescued Harry!

Thanks for your posting!\\

** Snape is my favorite character because he's so polarizing: he can be interpreted as both the horrid, obsessive bastard and the long-suffering hero. Good!Snape and Evil!Snape are both right.

There's always been an element of absurdity in the Harry Potter, so I never personally interpreted his behavior as abusive. Bullying and belittling? Yes. In a realistic lense, would his behavior fly? No. But, then again, nothing in that bloody school would have passed legal standards. I think it's ridiculous writers--real people--get harrassed over how they showcase a fictional character, either by die-hard Snape fans or by his haters.

Whatever your interpretation of Snape, the war would have been lost without him. As far as the reader is aware, Dumbledore and the Order did not have another spy. People would have died without his intel. A Death Eater would have been selected as Headmaster, because whether or not Snape killed Dumbledore, the Headmaster was still dying and Voldemort was still going to overthrow the Ministry. Children would have died Hogwarts, more than what died in the Battle. We can assume Harry probably wouldn't have gotten the sword. So whether you hate or love Snape, I believe it's important to recognize he was integral to the war's success.

** Making him grey is fine. Making him magically (no pun intended) become a nice guy and father figure to Harry is poor writing, and has extremely problematic implications if the “no longer an abusive asshole” change is brought about by Harry behaving a certain way (eg answering the questions right in the first potions class, being good at potions, being meek, calling Snape “sir,” etc)

Another common good guy Snape trope I can't stand is when Snape reads Harry's mind and reacts in horror when he finds out Harry was abused! “I'm so sorry Harry I only abused you and your classmates because I thought you were spoiled and rich! Now that I know you're a woobie I can adopt you and we'll live happily ever after!” Nevermind that Snape saw Harry's abusive childhood during the Occlumency lessons and if anything was just MORE of an asshole about it.

I agree nobody should harass writers though. If I don't care for a fic, I close out and read something else. It's not a difficult concept.

#+end_quote

It is evident that Severus is concerned about his soul splitting. In fact it's more than just concern he's extremely upset by it. When he shouts at Dumbledore over it. In the exchange between him and Dumbledore, Dumbledore specifically says how many have you WATCHED DIE? implying Severus as a former Death Eater was used to seeing death which he is. Not committing it. Seeing it.

I assume the assumption that Severus must have killed people comes from the fact that because Snape was one of Voldemort's favorites. I think that view neglects the fact that Voldemort presumably knows Snape's past. Sees this young wizard fresh out of Hogwarts who is a half-blood, like him, who was around shitty muggles, like him, who proclaims to hate them like him, who is a genius wizard like him (reminder that Snape invented many spells and edited his potion textbook before he left school) that also neglects another possibility that Snape is in a privileged position because he discovered the prophecy and reported it to Voldemort.

In conclusion is it expressly stated, no. Is it strongly implied through the jumble of memories, and character interaction? Yes. Does it make sense that Snape as spy for both sides wouldn't have killed someone yes. Will it probably retconned one way or the other by JK yeah probably.

That's an incredibly self-serving way to look at it: Snape mocked a student's physical appearance (something that he was bullied for as a kid; you'd think he'd be a touch more empathetic) and denied her medical treatment (after immediately sending another student to the infirmary), thereby reducing her to tears in front of numerous classmates immediately after she'd been cursed by a student whom he refused to punish for attacking a peer. If your only takeaway from that is genuinely they "[he] hurt her feelers," then I sincerely hope that you're never put in a position of authority over any child for any reason.

I'd suggest you read about how gangs work. It is arrogant to think you or anyone else could have somehow done better when not in the situation. Be realistic what are the chances that you, yourself wouldn't have joined Hitler had you lived in Germany? Almost zero.

“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?”“Don't be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?”“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.”“Meaning?”“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter's son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter--”Quoted straight from the book.

  As a teacher. Part of a teacher's job is to mediate conflicts like this; it wouldn't have hurt his standing with Voldemort /in the slightest/ to make the barest pretense of caring about his day job.
#+end_quote

Yet again completely ignoring the fact that Snape is consistantly surrounded by the children of Death Eaters, and almost all of Snape's cruelest interactions are with Draco directly present.

​

#+begin_quote
  Yeah, weird, almost like Snape is a terrorist who guiltlessly condemned an entire family to death without a second though, only cared when n he realised that he'd endangered one specific person whom he (claimed to) personally care about (despite having no regard for what /she/ actually wanted or valued), and expressed confusion at the idea that his willingness to sacrifice her husband's and infant son's lives for her own (despite, again, this being something that she would /never/ agree to) would be abhorrent to someone with the barest regard for human life.
#+end_quote

I think you need to go back and reread the books, really reread them. I feel like this is very clearly showing some headcanon/fanon you subscribe to or some notion that isn't expressed in the books. Using words like claim and the entire last part shows a completely different understanding than the cannon one that or you're somehow suggesting Snape should have stood up to the Dark Lord and said "No don't kill the Potters!" and died for literally no reason. He asked the Dark Lord to spare Lily. Then he went to Dumbledore and begged Dumbledore to protect them, all of them.

#+begin_quote
  I think the reason people dislike Snape in universe is that he's an emotionally stunted, self-obsessed, and extremely toxic manchild who's decided that his bitterness needs to be a problem not just for him, but for everyone around him.
#+end_quote

I disagree. I think most people who don't like Snape are emotionally immature children who have some delusion that because someone did something bad once they are forever condemned as evil, even though they've never done any evil action like murder. For those people Snape's actions are usually "Not enough"

I think the other Snape Haters again have some delusion they would have done differently. "I wouldn't have joined Hitler!!!" Realistically chances are you would have unfortunately. I think most of this group either have a lack of understanding of canon or let fanon get to them.

To be clear I'm not saying he's good. He is an emotionally stunted character, he's most assuredly self obsessed, but again I don't think that's why most people dislike him.

I'm not the final authority. It's quite clear the message in the books is he is redeemed. Harry even thinks he's redeemed. Snape's story is one that started on a road of bigotry and hatred. He begins his redemption for a personal reason. Yes he joined the Order of the Phoenix for Lily, but by the end of it all. He has shown remorse and regret for his actions, not just towards Lily, all of it, he has internalized the principles of the Order of the Phoenix and won't tolerate the casual use of the word Mudblood anymore even when applied to Hermione.

At the end of the day you can think Snape's bully actions towards his students outweigh any good he did but evidently it wasn't a big deal in the wizarding world since a no point did any teacher or even the headmaster ever reprimand him with any sort of recourse. That's the final point. The wizarding world operates under different principles than our world. Gauging their actions like that in terms of what we are used to is an incorrect thing to do. When you live in a world where most "muggle problems" can be solved with magic you have a different understanding of what problems are.

I think most people do Snape a disservice because either they refuse to see fault with him, or they refuse to accept his change.

He did a hell of a lot more than that

When Hermione got hit by the tooth growing hex and Harry asked if she could go to the hospital wing, he retorted with "I see no difference".

He threatened to poison Neville's pet and punished Hermione for helping him not let it die

He took a snipe at Neville in front of other teachers multiple times- Lockhart at the dueling club, "we'll be sending what left of his opponent up to the hospital wing in matchbox" and lupin, "possibly no one's warned you that this class contains Neville longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions in his ear. "

He took points from Harry, (Ron?), and Hermione for breaking a made-up rule of not taking library books out of the castle

He screamed about how it was Harry's fault when black escaped (even if it was he had no idea how and just assumed it was Harry's fault)

Let's not forget Harry's first class where he's minding his own business and Snape attacks him and his work ethic for not reading ahead

Where they acting out of line at the time? Yes, that was not so with snape. Did she insult students for having a hard time with the material? Not to the best of my recollection. Did she ever threaten students with anything beyond homework or maybe detention for missing a single step in the directions or an inaccurate reenactment thereof? Nope, and she sure as hell didn't threaten anyone with poisoning their pets. Did she ever pointlessly insult students to other teachers in front of their faces and call them generally incompetent? I thought not

Lockhart was the poster boy for Hanlon's razor "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity or incompetence"

Umbridge- was totally abusive and is in fact hated more than Snape

Lupin made a mistake one time when he was shocked to discover his 12 years dead apparently traitorous, mass murdering friend was alive again and nearby as well as his apparently not traitorous, 11 years unjustly locked in a torture chamber friend was nearby as well as 3 students in his care- abuse is a pattern of such behavior and one instance of even severe neglect under exceptional circumstances does not undo the pattern of treating student with care and respect that he had been exhibiting all year

********* For someone who's been repeatedly told that they won't change someone's mind, you seem oddly invested in attempting. Point by point:

Abuse isn't comparative. Snape tried to poison a student's pet, mocked a student's appearance and denied her medical treatment after one of his students cursed her, and spent years disparaging the memory of a man who saved his life and whom he subsequently got killed to said man's orphaned son. Other teachers also being abusive does not absolve him.

You're right that it's a bit more complicated than him simply being on the right side, but since your only apparent point was that he wasn't on the /wrong/ side, that's what I rebutted. Yes, he was a spy, which was far riskier than it would have been to simply openly switch allegiances. I'm not denying that. What I /am/ saying is that it doesn't change the fact that he spent his adult life bullying children. Also, given that he spent time as a death eater and actively aided Voldemort's rise, I would argue that he's a moral responsibility to oppose him, and his fulfilling that basic obligation doesn't impress me as much as it seems to do you.

I said not one word about James or Sirius, but since you've raised the subject: yes, James and Sirius /did/ bully Snape when they were kids. I'm not sure why you think /that's/ wrong, but that it's fine for Snape to do the same thing to his students when he's an adult teacher, though.

Also:

#+begin_quote
  But if me or you were in his shoes, we never would have had the guts to beguile the dark lord.
#+end_quote

If it were me, I wouldn't've gotten into this situation in this first place because I am not genocidally racist. Snape put himself in this position by choosing to actively support and serve a genocidal, autocratic terrorist. He could have avoided that situation by not choosing to actively support and serve a genocidal, autocratic terrorist, so you'll have to forgive me if I think that his switching sides purely because he realised that he'd endangered one specific person he claims to care about despite having no regard for what she wants or values doesn't reflect well on his character.

I didn't respond to the thing about the Order allegedly mistreating him for two reasons: one, I don't recall there being any evidence of it in canon, and two, even if they are as bad to him as you say, I think it's far more likely to be a response to his having been unpleasant to them, first, based on how he chooses to conduct himself in general.

* edit: and Snape /was not forced into joining the Death Eaters./ Yes, the marauders' bullying absolutely pushed him in that direction, but he still made the choice. Yes, Voldemort's targeting bullied and abused children for recruitment /is/ predatory, but Snape was openly aspiring to join up with a terrorist group that murders muggleborns while being best friends with a muggleborn.

And yes, Voldemort absolutely could and would have risen to power without taking advantage of young adults who'd been bullied as children. Most of his inner circle are from rich pureblood families; I doubt Lucius Malfoy was bullied when he was in Hogwarts. People like Snape would mostly occupy the footsoldier role that largely didn't exist in canon until Deathly Hallows and was filled with snatchers, who were quite distinctly /not/ Death Eaters. During the first war, it was a much smaller group that relied on fear more than military might, and carried out murders and assassinations which targeted people individual people or small families rather than engaging in open warfare.

If anything I doubt he would, considering he was offended by notion when James accused him of hiding behind Lily. And he believed in blood purism. He called every muggleborn except Lily a mudblood. He joined the death eaters as an adult, of his own volition, with full knowledge of what he signed up for. And he only left because the one person he cared about was being threatened. If Voldemort had picked the Longbottoms I doubt Snape would have even cared that he condemned three people to death.

I have been bullied. It was fucking awful, but that was damn near 20 years ago. I moved the fuck on. Murder is never an adequate reaction to what Snape went through, especially with his vindictive personality. The man is still waging war with a dead man.

You are absolutely right tho, when you say the heroes would have been screwed without Snape. That doesn't change the fact that he's also a petty bully who made some shit decisions with his life, and blaming someone else because that someone was mean to him is preposterous.
