*** All [[https://FF.Net][FF.Net]] needs to do is make sure they aren't hosting anything in Europe and geo-block the EEA. I hope that when enough of the internet is unavailable to the EU (they bitch on [[/r/worldnews][r/worldnews]] about media sites being unavailable to them due to the GDPR) they get their shit together. I appreciate what the EU has done on a myriad of things, especially the Environment...but this is not one of their strong points. I hope the Pirate Party starts getting more attention.

**** The bell tolls for thee. No matter whether or not just blacklisting European users will be enough, the blacklisting itself will already affect the community, since Europeans are part of the community as well. Less people will be participating in discussion, less people will be creating and sharing new works.

Fanfiction as a whole will become something less.

****** Site owners aren't powerful enough to be able to afford showing respect, as you call it. If the bureaucrats decide that fanfiction violates their new law, they can destroy the website rather easily. One possible solution to avoid this would be to migrate the website to darknet, but that would cost money and lose visitors anyway, because for most users navigating to the new location would be inconvenient enough to make them gradually lose interest.

The hosting websites and the community don't have much control over the developments for the question of respectfulness to even apply to them. It's like getting cross with Alice because she's being disrespectful and not greeting you after Bob has hit her on the head with a pipe and sent her into a coma.

I didn't mean on behalf of the sites, it's just a bit of a kick from the community to be a bit gung ho about it. There would be no Harry Potter fanfiction in the first place were it not for an author in Europe, so 'screw you I got mine' feels a bit harsh. Guess its interesting to see how HP has diversified out as a brand and property.

***** It was approved by the European Parliament...a very elected group of officials. Technically speaking as every official of the European Union government is either elected directly or appointed by elected officials it's fairly more democratic than the United States Government. Democratic doesn't mean better, though...there is a reason the most stable governments are Representative Republics rather than actual Democracies.

******* The President of the United States is selected by the Electoral College (which have a massively complicated explanation behind it but basically they aren't elected and don't have to do what we vote for, and that was decided on purpose because our founders thought direct democracy was stupid).

Every senior government official (Executive AND Judicial) is nominated by the President who was selected in that undemocratic method and given an up or down vote by the Senate which (while democratically elected now) is very lopsided on how it represents our population (because it was supposed to represent the sovereignty of the individual states, thus why it used to be up to the state legislatures or governors to select them and still is when there is a vacancy).

All other members of the Government, like your post man, is a civil employee and is not elected.

******** I feel like you're giving a slightly misleading impression of how undemocratic the American government is. Nothing you said is technically wrong, but you left out the democratic parts.

The electoral college isn't strictly democratic, but it's approximately so, since it just means votes are by state instead of by individual. But the individual votes do go into selecting the state votes. (I'm sure you know this, so this point is for people who might not.) You do say the Senate is democratically elected, and that's just as correct as saying the Electoral College members are democratically chosen.

Also, you left out the House of Representatives, which is a lot more democratic than the Senate and an equal partner in the legislative branch.

********* The house has nothing to do with the selection of government officials (government means executive to most of the world). Also the individual votes don't decide what the electors choose. Some states have laws saying that the electors are supposed to uphold the popular vote but it's all behind the scenes and is unenforceable. See faithless electors. Additionally see the election of Hayes and the appointment of Ford for more weirdness. In short, you don't know what you are talking about.

********** I knew faithless electors were possible, but I'll admit I didn't realize they happened as often as they apparently do. Of course, at least according to Wikipedia, "Ultimately, faithless electors have only impacted the outcome of an election once, during the 1796 election." So maybe that's what I was thinking of when I thought that even though they technically could do what they wanted, it didn't matter.

Does "government" really mean "executive" in the rest of the world? That seems very strange. How are lawmakers and judges not part of the government? I guess it makes some sense to focus specifically on government officials.

The election of Hayes was over 100 years ago, so while it could technically happen again, I'm not as concerned with it. As for Ford's appointment, I didn't claim that the American government was completely democratic. That obviously wasn't democratic at all. I just said you left some stuff out.

*********** The guy you're responding to is....well calling him clueless is as disingenuous as his argument. As you said he's not technically wrong. But...it's all wrong in practice.

It's based on things that could, in theory, happen. But wont. And if they did the system would immediately change. It's sorta like how the Queen has the authority to Declare war for Canada. If she said today, "Canada you are now at war with Chad! Invade!" Canada would decide that the queen no longer had the authority to declare war for Canada.

There's also the fact that he presents the 'United States' as one entity, ignoring what happens on a state level. Like, say, the fact that the Justices of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin are all elected officials.

The Election of Hayes didn't have a faithless elector, but does remain the only that could have really had one change the outcome. But it didn't, and the election process has evolved away from that.

The bit about the Founding Fathers shows a lack of understanding of...well..the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers would detest the American Government today. The amount of 'Federal' power would seem shocking to almost all of them. They were smart enough to anticipate that individual states would have individual needs and that Tyranny of the Majority should be avoided. An immediate concession to the majority does not foster debate or improve ideas.

But as you said, the things he said are possible, but hyperbole. Yes, they could happen. Also the world could end tomorrow. But then the whole iamverysmart Did you know the US Isn't a democracy! Yes? It's common knowledge? But then goes on to ignore virtually everything that makes the government work and the entire concept of the States. One of the biggest debates in US Politics is the individualized power of the states vs Federal power.

And ignores the fact that State decisions effect the every day life of the majority of Americans far more than Federal ones.

******* They are not. They are directly elected by the people in European Union nations in the European Parliament elections. The next are being held starting May 23rd.

Even if they were actually elected by the European Council, it would still be democratic...as the European Council is comprised of the member Prime Ministers or their chosen representatives (all elected directly or indirectly through party control). The group you are thinking of being elected by the European Council is the European Commission.

Remember...

European Parliament = US House of Representatives / UK House of Commons

European Council = US Senate / UK House of Lords

European Commission = US Government (Cabinet) / HM Government (Cabinet)

Except a fair group of the powers are flopped or more closely resemble their historical counterparts.

***** No they are not. The path of EU legislation is started at the Council of Ministers. This is when all the EU member state government ministers of a similar portfolio gather to discuss the direction of EU wide legislation.

Then the Commissioner ( every 5 years each member state parliament nominates a parliamentarian who is sent to EU to supervise a portfolio. They mutually divide up the portfolios among themselves, allowing country's to administer their own pet sectors ) carries out the directed objective listening to input from the council, the parliament, groups lobbying and from member states parliaments.

Finally it is passed or amended at a parliament stage through straight up majority voting. The EU parliament is elected via proportional representation from every EU state with smaller countries getting a larger number of representatives per person.

At this point it becomes EU wide law unless it needs further passing in local assemblies due to constitutional reasons.

At all stages of this legislation, an official at a member state or EU level has guided and shaped this legislation. The EU as pooled national sovereignty is highly reactive to the public, I have lobbied them in previous periods on matters of agriculture and have only found well-informed and well-meaning individuals.

Well, that's not exactly surprising, is it? As a lobbyist, or part of a lobbying effort, you would have been much closer to and certainly have a lot more influential over EU politicians than the vast majority of EU citizens will ever have in their life. Case in point the copyright reform here.

Fair disclaimer: I left out the "to the public" part of your quote, because I don't agree with it as it was stated and because it feels misleading, considering the content of your next sentence.

But then again, that is merely my impression and experience. While I never lobbied for or against anything with that particular group, I've been in contact with a couple dozen EU politicians from my country over the past two decades and my experience hasn't been any better or worse than with any other politician on a national level.

I can understand why you'd have a different experience, because many matters of agriculture would have an immediate impact on a certain region or even the whole country and thus the national economy. It's not exactly far-fetched that they'd go the extra mile for their constituents. On matters of policy however I am convinced the EU would look /very/ different if the population had a greater, or at least a more direct influence on EU politics.

*** The issue is that the host (ex: FF.net) is profiting off of the service they're providing (Ie hosing the stories) and thus by extension are profiting off of copyrighted materials. As technically ff.net is profitting from the usage of a copyrighted product almost certainly without the consent of the copyright holder.

There's some distinctions that I think are important, but my opinion is irrelevant in the debate in that there's big difference from say, Youtube where snippets from movies and tv and other things can be used, uncited, and done with no permission.

There's sort of a dubious consent with fanfiction. And you don't usually get copyright strikes against Fanfiction because there's sort of the intrinsic understanding that it's not original work.

I honestly don't think this will have any affect on fanfiction as a whole.
