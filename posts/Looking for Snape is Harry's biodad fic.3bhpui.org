I'm relatively new to reading HP fan fiction, having read the books themselves as they came out (as an adult) but never having been involved in fandom. I'm now rediscovering the series through reading them to my six year old daughter (I know she's on the young side, but up to near the end of Goblet of Fire she seems to be coping fairly well), and I find myself craving some fanfic.

I know that 'Snape is Harry's father' is a major subgenre, and I've browsed through a few, but what I would particularly like to read are stories where Snape turns out to be Harry's actual, biological father through having had sex with Lily - as opposed to magical fertility rituals and the like. Everyone in character and everything as close to canon as possible too would be great.

Does anyone have any recommendations?

But probably not age appropriate.

** [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.net/][Potions and Snitches]] has a filter for it, so I'd start there.

I will once again post my favorite fanfic series since it's kinda relevant, the /Severus' Rose/ series by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1901751/][WrittenWord1]]. Now this is fem!harry, but otherwise fits your criteria (it's also deliciously fluffy).

** Thanks everyone! Didn't realise there was a site devoted to Snape and Harry focussed fic. I will check all recs out.

(These fics are for my own enjoyment, I wouldn't confuse my daughter by reading her fanfic at this stage. She can corrupt herself later when she's ready...)

** BioDad!Snape stories are my favorite Severitus stories (versus Guardian!Snape). Here are a few I thought were pretty good:

linkffn(Vows by zarathustra46) This story has 2 finished sequels.

linkffn(Lily's Charm by notevenhere)

linkffn(In Blood Only by E.M. Snape)

[[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=2025][Blood Magic]] by Gateway Girl

Also, Potions and Snitches has a [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/browse.php?type=categories&catid=6][Biological Dad]] category and you can find a lot of stories there.
