Anyone know a fic where Peeves become Harry's pet? Asking for a friend.

Other poltergeists are acceptable, but I'd really prefer Peeves.

** Reviews. Not only do people rarely review, but when they do it's either asking for an update or literally 3 words that don't help me at all.

It really grinds my gears that James Potter is sad has 40 something reviews and I have essentially 0. Like c'mon my writing isn't great but it's better than a 4 word fic.

Edit: Apparently this thread isn't asking for our pet peeves, rather peeves as a form of pet. I can't read apparently.

**** Linkffn(12849829)

It's a crossover with the Inheritance cycle, that tries not to take itself too seriously. Its my first 'real' fic that I've wrote and I'm rather proud with how its turning out. Any feedback is appreciated.

  Thrown into Alagaësia, Harry encounters a blue stone, visits Ellesméra, and tries to seduce an elven princess. Perhaps even in a strange world he can find rest. Or will he take up his wand and stand against evil yet gain? Either way with a dragon at his side he is bound to get himself into some adventures! Elements of a CRACK fic.

** Damned, I thought you were asking for pet peeves (and maybe how to avoid the most common ones) and I wanted to make the joke that: Yes, I'd like Peeves as a pet :) (I could live of the money people would pay me to call of "the menace" :D ^{^{)}}

As for the request: I can sadly only say that I'd also like to read those stories :D (man the ghosts and Peeves in particular probably know more about Hogwarts than most headmasters, the marauders and maybe even the houselfs because they simply are around way longer!)
