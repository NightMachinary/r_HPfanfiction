What are the facts about these three that an author needs to keep straight if they are trying to be as canon-compliant as possible? Katie is a year younger than the other two; Angelina is black and was captain in Harry's fifth year. Is there anything else in the books (not Pottermore) that highlights the character traits of these three female chasers? Even if there's no canonical basis for it, how do you prefer to differentiate their personalities in your writing?


** More than anything with respect to the Chasing, Katie appears to be quite a bit friendlier than Angelina, if her interactions, however brief, with Harry in /Half-Blood Prince/ are anything to go by. She congratulates Harry on his Captaincy, and even says that she expected him to get it. This, despite Harry being a year younger than her and having equal seniority on the team. Most notably, she openly acknowledges the possibility of someone beating her for tryouts on skill. She does *not* expect a spot on the team, despite the fact that nobody would begrudge her for it.

Angelina seems to have a bit more ambition. She delights in the chance to enter the Triwizard Tournament. And it is she, not Alicia, who is chosen for the Captaincy. She's also got a real temper--we didn't even see Wood shout at anyone in /anger/ outside the Pitch (never shutting up about strategy is another story entirely), but Angelina shouts at Harry in the Great Hall upon learning of his detentions. Her apology also seems a bit...contrived. Like someone told her to apologize.

Alicia...I don't remember a single scene where it was just Alicia mentioned. At all. I don't even think we're ever told what she officially looked like. We do know some things however. She makes the most penalty shots against Slytherin, so it may have been she who was the most talented at Quidditch. She's also the most sensitive--in /Prisoner of Azkaban/ she whispers to Harry that "we thought you died"after he fell off his broom, and the text explicitly describes that she was "shaking." And while Angelina has a temper, Alicia has righteous fury--she screams "How dare you" at Malfoy when he calls Hermione a mudblood, while the reactions of the other Chasers wasn't mentioned beyond gasping.

I think it was she who suggested that Ron try on Oliver's old robes to see if they fit, so she may be the most team-oriented overall.

** Aside from age and the fact that Angelina was Quidditch captain, they're basically interchangeable.

Like, until Harry's 5th year, you could use them interchangeably and make no great impact on the story.

** The only other thing I can think of is that it was Katie who picked up the locket. Nothing to do with personality though

** You can also infer some things about their personality from the fact that they are in Gryffindor house. Additionally, Harry gets on well enough with them that there's no major conflicts and they work well as a sports team yet he doesn't hang out with them much outside of quidditch as far as I recall. From this we can presume that there's nothing particularly disagreeable about their personalities form Harry's POV but there's still a social gap between them likely due to the age difference but potentially due to not having much in common outside quidditch, and Harry's not exactly the sort of social butterfly that would actively attempt to bridge that gap.

** Possibly their romantic entanglements with Fred and George? Anyone remember what those are?

*** Lee Jordan complimented Angelina's looks every seven seconds in the Quidditch matches, but it was Fred who asked her to Yule Ball and George ends up marrying her.
