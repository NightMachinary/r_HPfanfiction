  The Battle of Hogwarts is over. On the third of May, 1998, Harry wakes to a changed world, to a future he did not think he would have. This is a story about those first days after the battle. Days of mourning and funerals, love and loss. Grave Days.

  The wizarding war is over. Harry & Ron are in London, where Auror training has begun. Ginny & Hermione are back at Hogwarts School. Do these parted pairings have divergent destinies? When, where, & how can these separated souls meet?
