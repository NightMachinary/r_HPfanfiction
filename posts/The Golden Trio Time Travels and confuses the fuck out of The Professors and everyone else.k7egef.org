So basically it would happen around Third year. Maybe they would freeze up after seeing Snape, or look relieved when he insults them or even freak out a little because they keep picturing him bleeding out in the Shrieking Shack.

Maybe they say something really out of character for them like ‚ÄúDon't worry Percy, I'm sure you'll do great‚Äù with a suspicious amount of sincerity.

Ron spends the first day clinging to Fred and everyone's confused. Harry sees Padfoot and freaks out. Ron suddenly not caring whether Crookshanks eats Scabbers. Hermione being more Sympathetic about Lavender's pet rabbit.

Maybe they are suddenly closer to Luna and Neville


** The twins walk in looking shaken.

"What is it?" asks Harry.

"We, thought Ron and Hermione weren't talking to each other. You know, because of the rat." Says Fred

"Oh, is that so?"

"Yeah, and we just found them snogging each other's brains out in a broom closet."

Effect-based Charms are always temporary even when successfully completed--we see several Charms wearing off in canon, Cheering Charms for example.

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.
