See the title. I just LOVE TAURE SO MUCH!!!


** I'm sorry to break it to you, but Taure is incapable of feeling human emotion.

For reference, [[http://wp.eltopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/robot-family.jpg][here's a picture of young Taure and his parents.]]

** Nothing tops The One He Feared - simultaniously including the best Dumbledore and slightly OP Harry in one fic.

You're the best!

** I'm here for an appreciation post. The One He Feared is one of my favorites and I'm excited about Victoria Potter. I'm very impressed by how realistic of a preteen girl Victoria is, especially written by a guy. I had to double check because she's so much better written than pretty much all preteen girl fanfic characters regardless of the author's gender. (And no offense, but a lot of male writers don't know what to do with an eleven year old girl.)

*** I on the other hand don't care much about his recent stuff, but I still think of that fic where dark!Harry wakes up in the future from stasis and immediately starts fucking shit up. Also the Lords of magic story was the shit.
