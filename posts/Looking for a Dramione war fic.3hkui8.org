This is going to be completely unhelpful, but I don't remember many details from it at all. I know Hermione and Draco were leaders of a rebel group, they stayed in camps, took a long time to actually get together. One specific scene I remember was when Draco goes someplace Hermione didn't want him to go, she waits anxiously for him but gives him the cold shoulder when he returns, until he comes to her. I vaguely remember her smashing plates or glasses, but I could be totally wrong about that. The fic was longer than 100,000 and on fanfiction.net.


** The only one I can really find is linkffn(To Begin Again by RZZMG)

Edit: fixed the link
