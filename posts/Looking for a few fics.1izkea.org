Looking for a few fics, first is a fic where Tom Riddle goes to Diagon Alley to get his school supplies alone. Second is a follow on after Deathly Hallows. I've read most of Nineteen Years Later, but wouldn't mind checking out something else. Third is any series where Lily and James were still alive and raising Harry through Hogwarts. I remember reading one once when Harry had a sister and it was a bit rubbish. I don't mind if Harry is/isn't BWL or if Voldemort is about at all. Thanks :)


** For your second request: all the stories by [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. I stumbled across Questions and Answers, which is still in progress, first and then read everything else.
