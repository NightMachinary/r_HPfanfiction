Are there any fics out there where Hagrid and Tom Riddle became friends for...any reason during the time they were at Hogwarts?

I'm just really curious if such a thing exists.


** I do remember a fic where Tom Riddle was good friends with Hagrid and other muggleborns but he snaped when his girlfriend died in the 5th year and he succumbed to the dark arts.

** Fury by MonsieurClavier fits the bill Tom is raised by doting muggle parents in this story becomes interested in social justice and is best friends with Hagrid it literally says so in the tags too.
