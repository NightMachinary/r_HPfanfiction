The next day the headlines of the paper scream "Dumbledore has finally cracked"!! The article covers how Dumbledore spent the whole night killing off every supporter of Voldemort. He broke their wards, killed their entire families, burned their houses to ash and to add insult to injury he salted the earth. The death eaters in Azkaban didn't know what hit them. Within moments of Dumbledore's arrival they were all dead and the dementers were scattered to the winds. Dumbledore was not willing to fight another long drawn out war were he had to watch friends and family slowly die at the wands of his enemies. Voldemort may have returned but he would find himself without his supporters. In one night Dumbledore broke the pureblood movement. It could not survive the death of its strongest supporters.

** This one is close to your request. Indy!Dumbledore emerges after Fudge ousts him from Hogwarts in Order of the Phoenix. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent]]) Well written, WIP though it seems like the author is spending more time writing their Evil!Ginny piece so it might be a bit before an update.

Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.

*** Yeah, that got grotesque quickly. Much as i like the idea of watching dumbledoor slowly fall into depravity - actually, no. Fuck no. I abhor reading stories where the main character loses himself to depravity and or evil.

This one was written well enough to set off all my personal boundaries regarding characters actually becoming evil, like not cartoon evil, not jk rowling evil, hell its worse than asiof evil because at least there you expect the characters to be depraved as fuck.

The story is well written, despite its unfinished state, but i refuse to stick around to see where it ends because if i hate the characters im reading about, the transitive property ensures i hate the story im reading. I like to pretend im the characters, i like to insert myself alongside as they struggle, but ultimately succeed in their sympathetic, if not noble goals. Stories where i begin to hate the character, and therefore myself are a huge /no/ from me. Also, it contains actual torture scenes. Fuck that.

**** It's certainly not for everyone. If you can believe it this is one of the author's milder works. At a certain point for some of them, I had to stop too. That or skip over all the intense scenes.

Yeah, that doesn't sound like a great strategy if you read stories from the perspective of the evil characters, lol.
