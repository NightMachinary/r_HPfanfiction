I have the first chapter written and I'm about halfway through what I want to get done on the second chapter but I don't dare post the first chapter without someone looking over it.

The main premise is 1. Fem!Harry (Goes by Azalea).

And 2. She has a best friend before Hogwarts that saved her life and owes a life debt to, but doesn't know it.

There is more like the OC's background (Ooooh that'll be fun) and other such stuff but the two points above are the /main/ premise.


** Hmu and I'll read it tomorrow, but the most important thing is just that you keep on writing. Your first chapter won't be perfect. That's okay. Just keep at it and you'll be better in no time.
