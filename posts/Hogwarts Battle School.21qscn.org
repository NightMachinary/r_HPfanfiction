A shameless self promotion. Hogwarts Battle School is a story inspired by THE Battle School. It begins in Harry's 3rd year in a reconstituted Hogwarts. As he battles his way to the top, he learns the cost of winning. With a little help from his friends, he might just make it through, but the powers that be aren't going to make it easy for him. Welcome to Hogwarts Battle School. Features Slytherin! Harry

** Dude, I frickin' love this story. And that's saying a lot since I usually dislike Harry-centric stories.

Keep writing! Faster if possible ;).

*** Yes, I hope an update will come in the next week or so. Chapter 35 is all but done save for some revisions and Chapter 36 is halfway done.

I've been in the process of revising all of the previous chapters with my beta as well, hence the longer update times between chapters.

HBS is only about halfway finished, but it is broken up into three books. Book 1 is complete if you're a completionist and can be read as a stand alone piece.

** I just read through the first chapter, and I really liked it so far. I've been avoiding this for reasons I cannot fathom, and it's probably the best opening to a fic I've read in a long while.

It was a bit heavy on the exposition, but I enjoyed your changes so I didn't particularly mind. I still feel it would have been better if the exposition was revealed a bit more subtly.

I had one question though:

#+begin_quote
  ...so there were five boys and five girls accepted every year with no deviation.
#+end_quote

This was confusing me for a while. Don't you mean twenty each?

*** Some confusing verbiage there on my part. I meant that ten students would be accepted for each House every year.

I've started most of my other stories in media res, and I don't usually like formal openings, but I opted for an exposition dump in the beginning while wrapping it around the opening dialogue.

** To be honest, I've been avoiding the story. I've seen it on DLP and on various lists, but nothing really caught my eye, despite loving both HP and EG. Probably had something to do with "The Other Boy Who Lived", which I never finished (nothing particularly wrong with it, it's just I found the whole tower/james debacle to contrived as fuck).

Going through it now though, I'm surprised to say that I'm enjoying it. The idea is pretty convoluted, but maybe that's what I'm looking for after 10 years of reading fanfiction. Something new, original, and different from everything else. I'll definitely be finishing this one.

*** Glad you finally got to start it!

To be honest, I understand the hesitation. Looking back, I made several mistakes in OBWL. Lots of plotting errors that led to an increasingly convoluted plot line. I'm proud of sections of that story, but there are many things I would have changed.

In contrast, I feel that I have HBS more in control and have a very specific idea of where to go with it. But I'm glad you overlooked some of the crazier aspects of HBS to give it a chance.

** One of the best HP stories still updating; between this story and OBWL, I've probably recommended it twenty times in the sub.

My only quibble is that the story has seemed a bit adrift the past few chapters. Perhaps it's the nature of the serial publication format, and I suspect this will change in a chapter or so as the TWT gets underway, but there hasn't been a very strong sense of direction of late.

*** Thank you! And it does have a different pacing than Book 1. It's a bit of a different landscape. By Chapter 5 of Book 1, you already have the villains and the main conflict for that year, but since we're walking over somewhat familiar territory, there's a sense of familiarity that takes away some of the urgency and surprise.

But I expect it will pick up ;)

** I've my doubts about reading this fanfic, and I would apreciate if you could answer my questions. I read somewhere, probably in a comment here on [[/r/HPfanfiction]], that you story it is similar to the Ender's Game story. Thats good cause I really enjoy that film (I want to read the books now).

Actually I only have one question, but for 4 characters. What can you tell me about the four principal characters in your story Harry, Hermione, Ron and Snape? (well, I think they are the principals, but I am not sure because so far I only read the summary of your fanfic)

*** It is inspired (and at times borrows heavily) from Ender's Game. I would urge you to read the books as I feel they're far more entertaining than the movie.

- Harry - a gifted Slytherin with a penchant for dueling. As each battle becomes more challenging, Harry must find it within himself to find the will to go forward and the ingenuity to keep winning

- Hermione - Intelligent but stubborn, Hermione drives the Gryffindors forward with her own unique brand of magic. She is one of the few that rival Harry's skill in the battle room

- Snape - the headmaster of Hogwarts, Snape is merciless in his approach to cultivate the students into fighting machines. To what end is not yet known...

- Ron - Ron is a very minor character in this story

**** Wow, that sounds awesome.

I don't like Ron, so being a very minor character is okay with me :3 Hermione is Harry rival? Not usually what I read, but this looks interesting. I can either like or hate Snape, it all depends on how the author writes him.

Thanks for answer the questions, I will give your fanfic a try, and I think I will enjoy it :)

The books are on my list "What I Have To Read This Year", but right now I don't have time to read anything :/

Do it do it do it do it do it DO IT.

Seriously, the movie does a ton of things right. In fact, I would say that it's probably /the best/ movie you could make out of the Ender's Game book.

That said, the book is so much better. It's more detailed, battle school is actually really interesting. The plot makes more sense, the characters feel more real. All those little side characters in the movie that don't really seem important? Bean, Petra, Ali? They're much more fleshed out in the book, and you come to understand why they're highlighted in the movie.
