So, I've been wondering about something. I've gotten several reviews on my fic, where people have blasted the story, and stopped reading, because my Harry's hesitant to cross the threshold of actually take another human life in a deliberate manner.

He does eventually get over himself, and becomes more ruthless, but I wanted it to be something he struggled with, and did not do lightly.

Sure, my Harry was trained by the spirit of Gryffindor, who himself was an accomplished warrior, but my Harry is a very kind person, who still had trouble getting there. It needed a tragic event, related to one of his friends to heave him across the line.

So, my question is this: if you're reading a story, how patient are you, in regards to character progression? Do you prefer Harry to almost instantly become a 'heartless' killer who disposes of Death Eaters with ruthless efficiency? Or is a more natural progression of a person's mind?


** It depends on how the characterization is built up.

In your scenario he's been trained by someone from the tenth century so killing and torture shouldn't be something Harry blinks at.

** I'd much rather read a story where Harry only kills to save someone else or if he has no choice. I understand the argument that he's been trained by Gryffindor, but I don't think that means he has to be a killer. Magic allows for someone to incapacitate an enemy without killing them, so I don't think it necessarily makes sense for Harry to just go around killing people. If you're writing Harry as a kind person (which I agree that he is) then I think you should definitely avoid having him devolve into a ruthless killer. That portrayal of Harry always turns me off because he no longer seems much better than the people he's fighting. That being said, it's your story, so write whatever feels right. Don't let the haters shape your story! If you like it, then that's reward enough!

** Just make the reasoning understandable and I'd be happy. Like maybe a Death Eater is about to kill someone he cares about, so he kills them first

** I find it irritating when someone angsts over it repeatedly especially when it's a kill or be killed situation. Also most fanfic authors are just very bad at writing angst and it stalls the story and is very boring. If it slows down the story I don't think it's needed and is angst for the sake of angst.

** Problem you have here, he's being trained by a guy who lived in the 10th century or before, where the mindset of humans were far more primitive than it is right now or have been for the past 200 years.

Here his mentor is a warrior that wasnt born during the time where honor wasn't as valued, where pepole were far more racist than they are today aswell as had a diffrent world view.

He should have no hesitation in killing enemies that do the same to other pepole, simply due to a major influence in his life not living in the era where human rights have increased.

This isn't quite true, for a lot of European history it was your religion that mattered more than your ethnicity, I'm not completely sure on when that changed, but it was definitely still religious persecution in the 10th century.

religion fits in the description of racism though, its also what most pepole allowed themselves to justify their horrible actions.

***** On the contrary, history suggests that people have never needed a justification to kill each other unless some outside system of morality - which is, in the broad sense, a religion - told them that they might need it. The default state has been that the strong simply take what they want from the weak, and kill them if they get in the way. Only by introducing the idea of external and unchanging standards of "right" and "wrong" are people motivated to even think that it might be an issue needing justification.

** Length doesn't bother me so much as how well it is done. If it takes a long time but is done well, then awesome. If it takes a long time and was done poorly, then garbage. If it was short and done well, great, if it was short and done badly, then garbage. Then you have the whole range in-between length and done well/bad.

This question has no simple answer because the answer is going to literally differ from person to person.

Imo, readers don't want to see your characters be who they are supposed to be so late in the story that you don't see them being that person much because the story is about to end.

Likewise, if you have your character like that from the begining, it will look like your character has not grown at all over the fiction.

** Kind of ironic, since in /canon/ harry was so firmly against taking other human life that he refused to even use Stupefy on a Death Eater actively trying to kill him in situations where falling unconscious /could/ lead to the Death Eater dying.

Actually killing other human beings is pretty hard for most people, and studies show that even actual soldiers in war hesitate or miss because of conscious or subconscious desire to avoid killing al the goddamn time.

OTOH I think there's a lot of people who have very low threshold for frustration with mental blocks on characters. You can get around it if it seldom comes up- for instance, people don't complain as much with canon Harry because in most situations Stupefy is nearly as effective as AK would be, but you seem like you want to make it narratively a big deal.

I guess I think there it'd be best to make sure everyone treats it as a big deal. If Harry's alone in his hesitance he sticks out and seems more unreasonable, so make it a point that almost all the good guys and even many of the bad guy are reluctant to actually kill.
