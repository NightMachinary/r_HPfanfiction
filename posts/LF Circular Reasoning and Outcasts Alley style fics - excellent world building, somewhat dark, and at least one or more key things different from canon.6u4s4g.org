Basically what the title says. I am looking for fics which have great world building and are somewhat dark (I count Outcasts Alley as having dark undertones because of the Alley segments and the ideas about Harry as a creature). They should also having some key differences from cannon.

In Circular Reasoning i love the idea of the Lords of Magic and the Sharr family with their reputation that Harry lives up to. In outcasts Alley I love the fact that Harry is a very unique creature who struggles with what he is and who has to deal with the presence of a power greater than he is in the form of the creature courts, and has to learn how to deal with having a child and being a prince (and the fact that he does so in a very believable way).

Thanks in advance for any recommendations. If you can't link a fic, I don't mind so long as you can list the name of the story and preferably the author.

** One of the biggest complaints about linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is that there's too /much/ worldbuilding, so I'd check it out. It's a WBWL that starts roughly similar to canon and diverges pretty fast around the end of the 1st year.

linkffn(Elizium for Sleepless Souls) is a fantastic thriller where Harry is sent to Azkaban and tries to escape. There's a good amount of worldbuillding, but the main highlight is the dark tone and the "thriller feeling" (that building feeling that /something/'s off, you just don't know what until it's too late).

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

** I generally write AUs, and they often have somewhat dark elements - generally, Wizarding Britain is among the most progressive magical countries with regards to muggleborn rights, for example, despite oftenhaving serious issues with discrimination. I also try not to repeat myself, or canon, so things like the horcruxes are often quite different to canon, in addition to other points of divergence. World building is a big part too - "Patron" for example covers Magical France, Bulgaria, Jamaica, the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire as well as Scandinavia, in addition to an alternate Britain. "Divided and Entwined" is a rather dark and bloody take on a wizarding civil war, with four factions and several characters on all sides walking on slippery slopes as the war escalates. "The Dark Lord Never Died" has a smart and cunning Lucius Malfoy ruling a Wizarding Britain he rebuilt in his image, with both Voldemort and Dumbledore planning to topple him. Lucius has anticipated such threats to his rule, and has been raising muggleborns as wards of the country into a jannissary guard personally loyal to him while he has deliberately weakened the Aurors and Hit-Wizards to cement his rule.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
