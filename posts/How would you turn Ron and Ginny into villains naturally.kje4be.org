So Ive noticed in my years of reading fanfics that Ron and Ginny tend to get bashed a fair bit but the reason for them turning to villiany is never really established. Its always usually

​

1. they were just always like that and either hid it really well or other people let their behavior slide.

​

1. Its sort of hand waved with something like........."He didnt know when it happened but Ron had changed since the war"

​

How would you have them naturally and realistically transition into a more villanious role without uprooting their entire character?

****** I like stories where I am truly unsure if it will end "good" or "bad"while reading them. And I prefer if things end generally happy, but not every tiny detail gets wrapped up neatly and you do get the feeling that things are better now, but not perfect. There are still problems to deal with but that 's not the story we were focussing on, so how these things are dealt with is up to the reader's imagination.

** I think I would have them make a tough choice and the consequences would drive them mad. For example, they're forced to choose between Harry and Percy. It's so easy to choose! Until the guilt of the easy choice. The empty chair at the kitchen table. The hand on the family clock. Harry knows the cost. He feels survivor's guilt. He starts to avoid the Burrow, making the Weasleys feel abandoned and regret their choice. A particularly pernicious variant of this could be if intel shows Percy is in danger but they can't act on the information withour compromising a valuable source. That would really give the baddies a foothold.

** If you start at the train, I can imagine a slighted Ron holding a grudge that grows with every tiny thing that he percieves as offensive. Maybe Harry is reading a book or something and ignores him on the train, Ron assumes Harry thinks he is better than him and it grows from there. Harry doesn't even have to do much, he is just naturally antagonistic. Ginny could follow Ron or have lingering effects from the diary ect.

** In the Harry Potter universe being evil doesn't inherently mean being a death eater or in the same league with Voldemort.

One instance I can think is that during the final battle, Molly dies. Ron and Ginny were both close to her. They were in a state of mental trauma. They think Harry responsible for not saving her. So they make plans to kill him. They have to be given therapy or taken to a mind healer.

** My personal experience with people "going bad" has mostly been drug related.

To that end, Ron was perfectly willing to cheat with liquid luck to get on the house quidditch team. It's really not a stretch that he would risk other potions--maybe at Lavender's suggestion. And personalities change fast once someone is unbalanced.

Ron doesn't have the cash to sustain a drug abuse habit. And they've already stolen from Snape's stores. Ron starts to steal, gets involved with other thieving kids, and eventually falls into a dark arts addiction.

If you want to have Ron and Ginny both fall in the same story--she could hook up with one of Ron's junky friends in a vain effort to make Harry jealous, and then follow the crowd to the same place.

** Ron do to having so many siblings thinks he is finally going to out shine them when he becomes Harry's friend (as harry ended the war that took his uncle's and Molly only brothers) but instead he just gets pushed out of the way as everyone dolts over him (only getting worse when he, Fred, and George being sharry to the house for the first time). "Hell even his sister is obsessed with him and all she talks about his harry this harry that" resulting in him becoming vary bitter and jealous of everything that happens to Harry good or bad.

On the same pass

Ginny after growing up with the Harry Potter books (the ones like lockharts books not the irl books) and putting herself in the books as whatever "Damsel in Distress" is in that book. Her childish mind has desided that she is his and they are ment to be together. This thought is only strengthened after he almost dies saving her her first year at school. After this she becomes obsessed with Harry (intensified by the damage done by the horcrux and her not getting a mine healer for the whole ordeal) she finaly became violent with any girl close to harry.

** 1) Ron was a pretty insecure and jealous Person. It's not hard to imagine him becoming consumed with thoughts about what he is owed. If Harry in 3rd (edit: 4th) year for example didn't forgive Ron after the first task. I could see that being the start of a long spiral downwards. 2) Or maybe petigrew could have done something to Ron. Either molested him and poorly obliviated him leading to suppressed mental trauma and manic type behavior/ or cast some botched spells on him. 3) Ginny could be from the diary, or maybe just an obsession with “her” prince Harry, and being “just like James and lily”.\\
4) Or maybe Lockhart oblivates the youngest weasleys one too many times throughout the year.

5)Or maybe molly or Arthur got hit with a spell at the end of the war that affects any children they have from then on. (So only the youngest two are affected). A literal curse on the bloodline that makes them slowly become insane. Maybe cast by one of the lestrange or black brood.

6)Or maybe they just get a taste for blood shed/ or dark magic.

7)Maybe Ron and Ginny are tired of being considered blood traitors, they are pure bloods who shouldn't want for anything after all.

8) Or being a villain doesn't necessarily mean you are evil. It could just mean you have different political ideology. Maybe they have looser morals (ones that pure bloods have no problem with because it's what they have always known/how it's been done), things like love potions being a ok, squibs being shunned and mistreated is normal, abuse of house elves, disregard for magical “creatures” such as werewolves, centaur, Veela, etc, purebloods being able to get jobs not based on skill but name while muggle borns and the common man are bared. So not evil and plotting murder and betrayal, but different standards for what is acceptable/expected behavior. So they are villainous to the muggle raised people as they are part of the system.

** I like the way Kreia from KOTOR puts it. "It is such a quiet thing, to fall. But far more terrible is to admit it."

So, that's how I'd take it. Think about what they want, and what they (in their right mind) would be willing to do to get it. Then work out what it would take to make them just... bend it, ever so slightly. A little thing at first - maybe cheating on a test they're so desperate to pass, maybe warning another girl off of Harry (for his own good, of course, she's such a slag) - just a slight bending of morals, and then have it slowly grow and grow, thinking they're doing the right thing all the while, until something big happens to catalyse it into villainy. Either they embrace it and feel justified in doing so, or they feel regret and convince themselves that they can't turn back or make up for it. The Fall is so much more interesting when its a slow burn, or when the Fallen truly believes they did the right thing.

Or give Ron everything the more anti-Ron side of the fandom thinks he wants. After all they went through, Ron is the one to take down Voldemort. Harry might still have to kill him afterward, but Ron is the one to /beat/ him. So, Harry, being a good friend and a perpetually shy soul, steps back and lets Ron take the spotlight. He goes into the Aurors, lauded as a hero, and even 'gets the girl' in Hermione. But then it starts to sour. The fame keeps dragging him away from Harry and Hermione, the job is long and hard and egad there's so much paperwork. Hermione gets upset at him spending so much time at work - but it's not his fault, it's his boss, demanding wanker who keeps treating him like this - creating some stress at home too. All his dreams aren't quite what he thought they'd be, and he's under so much stress. The little seed of resentment starts, and starts to grow. After that point, the sky's the limit. Get him into drugs, get him angry, send him to the Fight Club, whatever. If his life is getting him insecure and angry, there's so many potential falls right there.

Could also have someone seduce them into it. Maybe Daphne draws Ron or Ginny in and convinces them down that path. Or Ginny, while she did lose the possession, never did quite lose that little voice in her head, the one that reminded her of everything she didn't have, everything that her circumstances denied her, everything she could simply /take/ - she is the Greatest Witch Who Ever Lived, after all.

** There was one I read recently that had psychological reasons. It started at CoS, Ron said "let's get Lockhart", Harry disagreed and they split up, Lockhart botched the memory spell and because Ron was angry at Harry, his brain blamed Harry for everything bad. Ginny had been brainwashed by Molly (she was a bit nuts from losing her brothers) so was like a stalker.

They were both a bit villainy but got help in the end, it was pretty good. Ron and Harry realised they didn't actually have much in common, Ron just wanted to be friends with the boy who lived, not Harry himself.

** Have it grow naturally over the course of at least 2-3 years. Also, it should be built on a solid foundation- a real grievance that can escalate when the offending parties refuse to apologise or make up for the slight.

1. In 4th year- Harry DOES enter the tournament without telling Ron. Then makes excuses for it.

2. In 5th year- Harry, perhaps worried that he will be dismissed, doesn't mention the attack on Mr Weasley and gets defensive in the aftermath, rather than admit fault.

3. In 6th year- Harry doesn't tell his friends about horcruxes, despite Dumbledore explicitly allowing him to. I can actually imagine Ron taking it more personally than Hermione too. This one does not allow him to go 'full Anakin' on Harry, as the lines for the conflict are already drawn, but he will no longer be friends with Harry and things might get more ugly after Voldemort is out of the picture.

If you want it to start it earlier in the story, you would have to imagine a completely new plot point, because the timeline until the 4th year doesn't have anything that would justify such a radical change. The same goes for Ginny in general, who is, for most of the books, a complete non-entity.

** People here are overdramatic, there is no need to have such drastic events cause the changes, when subtler ones could bée far more effective.

Take Ginny for example, let's say she has great difficulty making friends at Hogwarts which combined with the Diary's influence leads her to befriend some slytherin students. Then just give her the standard dark!harry plotline and boom done. I'm sure some Slytherins would love to 'corrupt' a pureblood member of a family of blood traitors into the dark. Of course, there are plenty of ways that this could realistically work or fail, but that's up to the author's discretion.

** I don't know how you'd corrupt Ron but with Ginny just use left over diary magic. I read a Ginny/Bellatrix fic with this premise and it was good.

** If we're doing a fairly canon accurate run up, I don't think we can turn Ron into a Death Eater. We can, though, probably make him into a villain in his own right, assuming what we mean here is "Ron is an obstacle facing Harry":

1. have the Triwizard Tournament be only marginally more dangerous than Quidditch with events that force Harry to show off
2. Ron starts taking studying more seriously as a way of avoiding Harry
3. have Voldemort use Cedric to assist the cover up by implanting false memories, so the whole resurrection thing is much more ambiguous
4. the Weasleys still go to Number Twelve so Ron's entire life is now subsumed by Harry... when Harry turns up, Fred & George should be used to have Harry vocalise his expectation of becoming the male fifth year prefect... also, Harry should be there first (so, no Dementor attack)
5. Harry /does/ get the prefect badge and, remember, this Ron has had a very different and more academic fourth year so actually deserves it in a way canon!Ron doesn't (and for that matter, neither canon!Harry nor this version of Harry deserve it... the difference this time is that Dumbledore gives Harry the prefect badge specifically /because/ Ron's not his friend any more)
6. Umbridge is not a cartoon villain but, instead, Arthur's third cousin and how Arthur originally got his job at the Ministry... but she still takes Fudge's side strongly and still does the inquisiting. Thus, Ron becomes a member of the Inquisitorial Squad and uses it to show off that he should've been the prefect. Harry lashes out claiming the only reason Ron likes Umbridge is because they're related. Umbridge should also teach stuff that's practical but not relevant to Defence Against Voldemort (so... let's say lots of vampires, goblins, centaurs and so on... "being defence" as it were), meaning Hermione still encourages Harry to create DA
7. have this non-reconciled Ron buy into the horcrux!dreams as attention seeking
8. (as I can see for sure is already suggested) have Arthur be killed by Nagini (because Harry and Ron now sleep as far away from each other as possible in the Tower... and the delay is critical)
9. Ron now /hates/ Harry and is aligned with the Ministry... just like Percy (whom he's actually not that different to even in canon; just like how Petunia and Harry have surprisingly many similarities)

While Ginny nominally seems easier because we know less about her and we've got the Diary, with those events she'd probably be closer to Harry than usual. Indeed, point (8) should cause her to blame Ron not Harry. Thus, if we want to do this in the same universe as the Ron above, I think we need to look at villain!Ginny as being a dark!Ginny who goes /way/ beyond what's necessary. To this end, it'd be useful to still end up in the Department of Mysteries to conclude Harry's fifth year. The thing is... it's not /just/ Death Eaters that throw around unforgivables like they mean it: Ginny does, too.

So... if Ron becomes Umbridge/Percy, Ginny becomes Crouch snr.

Frankly, I'd use the Ron situation and Mr Weasley's death to make Hinny happen in the weeks following the latter. This then transitions into Harry's deliberately lying to protect Ginny from Azkaban, which legitimately does create frictions with Dumbledore as well as creating angry Harry (remember: Dumbledore doesn't distance himself from Harry in this AU). Thus, Ginny is a villain in the sense that she embodies all the "worst choices" Harry can make and she encourages Harry to fixate on what's meaningful to him personally (i.e. their relationship), which has the side effect of making him less altruistic than in canon.

Of course, Voldemort's not a total idiot so he's going to learn things from this state of affairs. And I think the chief lesson is this: if he ignores Harry, everyone will eventually become like Ron. Voldemort can be patient.
