Can anyone recommend a novel length (200k+) dark, gritty story, with a ruthless Harry. I don't really care for any tropes (WBWL can be nice at times), though please no harems. Bonus points if the story is consistently updated.

Complete, 194k. Harry is not the bwl =if I recall correctly), his brother is. Harry and his sister are ignored in favour of his brother and this lead to the death of his sister. Harry decide to bring her back at any cost. It was a good read and the story was original.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

** I must say, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird]] trilogy is the most disturbing, dark and gritty story I've ever read.

It's three books, all complete. An AU that completely overhauls the way magic works and takes place in a dystopian world.

Trigger warnings: Read at your own risk.

It does have a harem of sorts, but trust me. It's nothing like any other story and it's part of the dystopian world the author wove.

*** Agreed. Firebird is the most horrendous, horrifying take on the HP-Verse of any fic I've ever read either. Definitely worth the read for the uniqueness though, if you can stomach it.

Also, yea, off the top of my head... Trigger Warnings For Rape, Reverse Rape(female forcing male), Major Character Death, Child Abuse, Forced Marriage, Torture, Sexual Torture, and Underaged Sex at an absolute minimum. Definitely a dystopia.

***** Look on the bright side, it has a unique take on the magical power rating idea, that shows up ever so rarely in fanfics. It's one of the few that doesn't dead end immediately, that goes into detail about how ‚Äòweak' and ‚Äòstrong' magicals are divided.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding?
