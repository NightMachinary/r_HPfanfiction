*** By the same author: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) He gets a pet rattlesnake and uses the Chamber of Secrets as a hideout. Really, I think any fic that has him use the CoS as a hideout would probably count.

** I always had this idea...Harry is a parselmouth and brings a portrait with tons of snakes to Hogwarts (I am assuming that everybody can bring a portrait to the castle and once it's there the "people" (or beings) in it can go to the other frames in the castle!), as a kind of information gathering network (if it's very tiny snakes, but hundreds (or thousands!) then Harry might really know almost everything that goes on in the castle, especially if he hooks up a dicta-quil to his snake portrait!)

Well, just putting it out there because over all parseltongue is not that usefull (parsel-magic isn't canon and speaking your incantations in parseltongue only works against deatheaters (and maybe ministry flunkies!), Voldemort can understand you just fine and other players on the field, like say Dumbledore will still be more than a match for most incarnations of Harry Potter)

#+begin_quote
  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

  Harry discovers Parseltongue a little earlier. As magic goes, it's not very useful. It's enough to make a few friends though. And isn't that enough? (Fem!Harry)

  AU. Time Travel. Snape goes back in time, holding the knowledge of what is to come if he fails. No longer holding a grudge, he seeks to shape Harry into the greatest wizard of all time, starting on the day Hagrid took Harry to Diagon Alley. No Horcruxes.
