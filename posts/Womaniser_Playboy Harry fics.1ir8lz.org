** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] by nonjon is the first that comes to mind.

#+begin_quote
  Two years after defeating Voldemort, Harry falls into an alternate dimension with his godfather. Together, they embark on a new life filled with drunken debauchery, thievery, and generally antagonizing all their old family, friends, and enemies.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] by joe6991 is another, though Harry's less a hound dog than in nonjon's story.

#+begin_quote
  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

You might also enjoy Harry's portrayal in Heather Sinclair's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4323036/1/Gentleman-Usher-of-the-Scarlet-Rod][Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod]]

#+begin_quote
  Every seventy years members of the Order of the Bath, a British order of chivalry, are being killed off. That is until Harry is brought in to hunt the killer or killers down. Harry/Padma.

Also, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/10/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][this one shot]] and [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/11/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][sequel]] have Sirius preparing Harry for such.

**** ABC is one of the gems of the fandom and I'd recommend setting aside reservations about time travel if you can. (It's more a dimensional traveling thing anyway, really.) Joe's Wastelands is all about time travel, though done in a different way from what you normally see. Heather's piece and my two one-shots aren't time travel.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish][Make a Wish]] by Rorschach's Blot doesn't exactly fit the bill, but it's close enough and very good.
