** Reminds me a bit of linkffn(5777316), Hedwig and the Goblet of Fire- oh, Hedwig isn't controlling Harry as far as we see in the fic but... Hedwig absolutely dominates everything.

But as it is an owl, it cares about more material things than mere world domination, bacon of course.

What I'm saying is the super smart Hedwig's already a staple, so wouldn't be out of place to see a fic like you describe, and tons of fics make the "joke" that Harry is Hedwigs pet more than the reverse.

  Harry uses Hedwig to test the restrictions on the Goblet of Fire. Obviously, they're not good enough to stop the smartest owl in Britain!
