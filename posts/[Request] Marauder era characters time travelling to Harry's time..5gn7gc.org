Hi! I'm looking for some fanfics where the Marauders, Lily, Severus, and/or other characters from the Marauder's era time travel to the time the books take place in. Tried to look for one to read, but most of what I could find was just Harry time travelling fanfics.

Other criteria I'm looking for in addition to the plot:

- Preferably NO ROMANCE focus but if it is I don't want to read Harry/Ginny, Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, Severus/Hermione, or any harem fanfics. Fine with Lily/Severus if it's canon-compliant (read: doesn't end happily). Slash is OK, but no teacher Severus/Harry. Rare pairings would be cool.
- No character bashing. Please. Even the Dursleys---I want them as close to canon as they can get. (Keep in mind: no character bashing =/= ignoring canon actions like the Dursley's neglect or the Willow Prank)
- If they're the time travelers, then Lily and James not being on board with the whole future kid thing right away would be nice. Not necessary, just nice.
- School era, not epilogue era or after-graduation Marauders.

Thank you for any recommendations, hope my request isn't too unreasonable.


** I only know of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261750/1/Misplaced-Moony][Misplaced Moony]] in that category, which is arguably the most well known one of them.

*** Skimmed through the first and second chapter, seems like a good read! Definitely intrigued by the idea of current Remus and past Remus co-existing in the same time.

I never read a Remus/Hermione fanfiction before, but I'll get around to reading it properly when I have time. Thank you very much for the recommendation!

** linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge) isn't exactly time travel, but is kind of like what you want.

  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.

*** I've read that one! It's pretty good--actually, it's what made me request this! Since reading it, it gave me a bit of a craving for Marauders in Harry's time.

** Both that were already rec'd was what I was going to rec and are really good. For something kinda similar but not exactly right, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846417/1/Choices][Choices by Aebbe]]. In this fic Lily Luna briefly time travels back to marauder era and then Sirius travels forward. It's really well done and canon compliant. Linkffn(5846417)

  Thrown back nearly fifty years in time, she has the chance to change the past. To right wrongs and correct mistakes. But in doing so, could she change the future? And is it even possible to change things that have already happened? Choices can be very hard to make. Canon compliant...? Read and find out. (Part of the Dark League story arc, but can be read as a stand alone)

*** Oh boy, Lily Luna/Sirius? I like rare pairings, yet that's actually one I never even thought to expect a fanfic for. Shame on me.

Honestly, it sounds like a wild ride of a pairing to read about so I don't even mind that it kinda goes against most of my criteria. Seems like a pretty intriguing concept by itself.

Thanks for the rec! I'll get started on it after Misplaced Moony.

**** Yeah its a pretty good pairing especially bc they are the same age in it but Sirius is technically her grandfathers age. And the time travel is really really well done. Plus some interesting muggle and squib OCs. I don't remember LOVING the writing but the plotting was pretty much flawless with how she interwove it with canon.
