I noticed a lot of similarities between lost fics that bash Dumbledore or the Weaslys like "Dumbledore is preventing Harry from learning about his heritage and reaching his full potential for a nebulous and nefarious "greater good"" or "Harry ending up with Ginny is a plot by Molly to get her hands on Harry's money" where do people get this stuff from? Most of it is completly ridiculous on closer examination, like evil!Fumblemore's plans beong so convoluted and overcomplicated that they are either counterproductive or simply just asking for Murphy to mess them up without MartyStu!Harry and his allies having to do anything.


** Some of it is stuff invented by fans. Some is the result of trying to make sense of the various inconsistencies in canon.

For example, Fumbledore making convoluted and overcomplicated plans that a) a child can see through and b) rely on a chain of coincidences to work is simply the result of people taking canon as an example - Book 4 and 5 show exactly the same kind of plots done by Voldemort.

Dumbledore bashing stems in part from the fact that canon Dumbledore is a plot device as much or more as he is a character. He can't be effective in the first books, or the kids couldn't be heroes, for example. Add in parody elements and charicatures, and any attempt to make sense of all of it without cutting a lot of it out will lead to weird convoluted stuff.

*** In Year 1, just admit Dumbledore was trying to trap Voldemort in a place with hundreds of defenseless children. But then Harry had to meddle to spoil the plan. On the bright side, it proved Harry's strength and resourcefulness.

In Year 2, Dumbledore was truly stuck. His past talks with Moaning Myrtle yielded nothing over the years, and he couldn't clear Hagrid as a result. Ginny apparently wrote in the Diary against all common sense taught by her parents because there was a compulsion charm on it. Harry, distrusting authorities as usual, didn't think of showing the Diary to any from the staff.

In Year 3, the evil and incompetent Ministry was running the show. Time Turner really adds nothing to the Series and is a highly overpowered and easily abused plot device.

Year 4 Moody impersonation scheme is probably the worst plot device in the entire Series. It would be a lot more credible to have Barty Jr impersonating his dad and avoiding detection that way. He could still have easy access to the Goblet and in addition, important Ministry officials.

**** Indeed. Seeing as Voldemort managed to Imperius the Minister in year 7 and year 6 showed that chain-Imperiuses are possible, he could have taken over a lot of the Ministry in book 4.

***** That would make a much scarier Year 4-5 story.

If I were to do a canon rewrite, this would be my plot for Year 4. In addition, I would have Barty Jr surviving the year and causing more trouble within the Ministry. It would have explained Fudge's behaviors a lot better and gave Dumbledore a much better excuse to ignore Harry's plight the next year.

** Take 'what if to the nth degree'. Where does any conspiracy theory start? You start with what you think is a plot hole or something that doesn't make sense and you search for an explanation. If you make one up then it has to make some sense, if it doesn't you either admit it or you go deeper down the rabbit hole and warp everything to fit your theory. Does Mrs Weasley potentially breach the Statue of Secrecy to attract Harry's attention of because she's a bit dense at times. Does she ask about the station to get Harry's attention or is she treating Ginny like the child she is and trying to make her feel involved and clever. If you take the worst of every scenario and twist everything to become 'evidence' you end up getting further and further away from sanity so it doesn't seem like a stretch go go even further. If people want Harry to be richer then they have to give him money or he has it and doesn't know about it. Isn't it strange that nobody ever tells Harry about the wizarding world and none of the goblins talk to him about the details of his inheritance? Take that and then suggest who could be to blame, then you need to give them a motive. Then since you're so deep you just keep digging.

**** Sometimes. But often they're about greed. They're often set up around the premise that if Harry had to die what would happen to his stuff and Dumbledore and Molly taking measures to ensure they controlled it. Or at least the ones I tried to wade through. Just because they're dumb motives doesn't mean they're not there. Simplifying the idea that defeating Voldemort is a motive in and of itself and if they believe that Harry dying is the only way then obviously they are going to want him to die. Now how they go about this can lead to basing. If they someone wants him downtrodden and feeling worthless so is willing to die then bashing is easy. If you want Harry to have a good life and hope that he will live then you have almost canon. You want Harry to live and think that the idea of dying for everyone is stupid you have indyHarry.

** If you read one fic with an idea, it might seem fresh, so you put it in your own story. Meanwhile, you're ignoring five thousand other fics that include that same idea.

For greedy plotting Weasleys, consider that Ginny is briefly shown it the first book, is more prominent in the second (though mostly in the climax), then disappears for a bit. The same book when she reappears, we get love potions involved in two different subplots (Romilda Vane and Amortentia). I think that was also the book where Molly Weasley makes an offhand mention of using a love potion to get involved with Arthur. If it had been revealed that Ginny were using love potions, I'd say the foreshadowing were a bit heavyhanded. And once you get there, what's the motive? Money is an obvious one: Harry has piles of money, and the Weasleys barely have enough to do the school shopping.

** As with many conspiracy theories, you take a ton of apparently innocuous coincidences and chain them together into a nefarious plot. Dumbledore sending Hagrid to collect Harry and holding onto the invisibility cloak is evidence that Dumbledore wished to imprint Slytherin bias on Harry, stole from him, and tried to keep him ignorant of his heritage.

Molly's questioning of Ginny, Ginny's relative absence from the story, and Molly mentioning love potions are all evidence of a Weasley plot to trap Harry in a marriage contract and steal his money.
