Are there any stories with that premise, preferably focused on Harry and not about Death Eaters switching sides because a/their child died.

No slash or Severitus, please.

*** What does it matter what would happen in canon? This is what the original poster wants to see in a fic. Do you know of one where this happens, No? Neither do I. Still, no need to be contrary. I'm sure someone knows of atleast one fic like this.

  Is that really what would happen though.

Isn't that contradictory to

#+begin_quote
  I doubt Voldemort would come out and say to the Malfoys, "sorry for killing your boy or w/e", so the death would probably be attributed to some weird forest creature.

?

Also, I meant that as in the narrative focus is somewhere else. Just because Lucius suddenly resents Voldemort, things might not change at all for Harry. L might still dump the diary on Ginny, the one change is no "Buckbeak" arc during PoA, the 6th year is too far out to really consider the changes as Theo Nott might be the one who has to do Voldemort's infiltration and have Harry trying to spoil it (not that this would be a suggestion for a six-year story).

You could go all kinds of places with Draco dying, from the Ministry intervening at Hogwarts up to the public deciding that it was just Karma for the "imperiused" Death Eater.
