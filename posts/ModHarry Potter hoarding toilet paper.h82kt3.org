Its a fic straight out of quarantine.

Master of death Harry Potter travel through time to be part of 'apocalypse aversion' and raises kid Harry who often comments about Mod!Harry toilet paper hoarding. I think in mod!Harry post apocalyptic world he got killed over it or something.

***** I dunno what's up with the AO3 bot. I did a bot link a few days ago that never popped up. Luckily, as long as you have the story ID you can fake it.
