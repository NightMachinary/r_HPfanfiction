** How can you bash a character who is only mentioned once in the entire series and never got as much as a sentence of description or interaction? She is nothing but a canon name.

  The student of Slytherin House were born with everything: wealth, prestige and pure wizarding blood. Now it's Severus Snape's job to help them find the one thing they don't have: careers.

** Not exactly bashing, but in What's Her Name In Hufflepuff, Daphne is just a weird girl obsessed with turtles.

Slytherin Career Day is simply Snape bashing all the Slytherins in Harry's year, but Daphne is about the least bashed one.

** Due to the general expectations of the fandom, I try to give Daphne some minor antagonistic role whenever possible. Yet I also don't feel the need to waste pages just to mock a fanon concept.

That being said, the best "subversion" of the Ice Princess is a fic called "Ice Princess", where her persona is the result of brain damage. Chapter 2 is a parody of its self.

  Building a romance from a fanon cliche turned on its head.

** Depends on your definition of bashing and on your opinion about turtles.

And also rocks.
