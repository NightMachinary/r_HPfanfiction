Hit me with some nice stories where purebloods learn to handle doing muggle stuff..


** There's a fic set in the 1920s that features purebloods interacting with muggles: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13013582/1/In-the-Bleak-Midwinter][In the Bleak Midwinter]]

It's got a great plot and humor, but it also stands out as a beautiful period piece depicting muggle culture at the tail end of the "Roaring Twenties." I particularly loved the scenes in which the main character takes unworldly purebloods to a traditional private gentleman's club and a jazz dance hall.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
