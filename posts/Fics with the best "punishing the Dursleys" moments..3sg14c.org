#+begin_quote
  More than just Sirius died that night at the Ministry. Harry is left strangely empty, driven by one thought, a burning desire for revenge on the witch who killed his Godfather. But the further he goes, the more blurred everything gets. HPBella done right.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

** linkffn(8233291;9937462)

Black Princess Ascendant has a good one in chapter 4 but if you intend to read the whole story then you should know that it is a sequel to Princess of Blacks and should read that first (it does get better than the first few cringe-worthy chapters)

** The best punishment for the Dursley's would be living in poverty and having society scorn them, two things which the Dursley's fear the most.

Simply torturing and killing them isn't good enough, and a lot of authors miss that opportunity. :(
