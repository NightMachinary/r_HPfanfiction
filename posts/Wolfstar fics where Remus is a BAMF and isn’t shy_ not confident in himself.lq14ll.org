I've been reading a lot of Wolfstar recently, and i really love fics where Remus is really confident in himself and is a bit of a bad boy. Any recommendations??

I'm open with any side pairings and it doesn't have to be magical


** Well I assume you have read All the Young Dudes. He's rougher in that one...grew up in a boys home, has some run ins with crime...does get down on himself tho but def isn't soft.

Linkao3(All The Young Dudes)

The same author has Dress Up in You....he comes off confident but does have insecurities just like holds his cards close. Linkao3(Dress Up in You)

I recently started Marauder ink which also has a sequel. It's Sirius POV and Remus comes off more confident and has Sirius kind of panicking but we don't per se know what Remus thinking yet. Sirius is tattoo artist and Remus is piercer who lived in Papau New Guinea and has all these scarification tattoos all over linkao3(Marauder Ink)

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Sirius Black and James Potter are successful and famous tattoo artists. Their manager Lily insists they hire a piercer to cover their busy schedules, and Sirius does not approve of that idea even slightly.This fic is now completed, but there's still sequel action going on at Marauder Ink 2: Black and Grey(if you think there's a tag missing/something I've overlooked, please get in touch - either comments or on tumblr (jennandblitz) and I can update things!)
