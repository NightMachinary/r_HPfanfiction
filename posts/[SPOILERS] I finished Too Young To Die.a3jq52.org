Now I'm seriously depressed. :(

Of course Harry got what he deserved for his crimes, but I just wish he could get to see Natasha one last time. I also wish we could get to see how Natasha was doing after the revival. It's just so sad.

It was a good fic, but I think the harem thing ruined it a bit. It would have been better without all the silly harem scenes.

Now I'm interested in Necromancy. Any recommendations?

** Huh, I don't remember any harem scenes. I do really want a sequel written about Natasha, and her devoting herself relentlessly to freeing Harry, as he did for resurrecting her.

*** For some reason he is extremely popular in this fic and basically every woman wants to sleep with him, which I found annoying.

Yes, a sequel with Natasha would have been great.

** Despite what the narration claimed, I doubt Azkaban would be able to hold the demonized!Harry that he'd become.

** I thought it was decent as well. My biggest complaint was really with the author's notes and I guess the "twist". Like one third of the way through the story, the author was still making notes sorta explaining away the bad things Harry was doing, like she wasn't even aware that by that point Harry had already been irredeemable in the eyes of the reader. Because he does some seriouslt fucked up stuff by that early point in the story and I was already thinking, "he needs to die, if he wasn't the protagonist this character is already clearly evil enough to die". Or something.

** My story revolves around Helene (fem Harry) being a Necromancer. It's not /as/ dark as Too Young To Die, but it definitely hits those notes.

  I took a flying leap through the Veil of Death. Gonna' be honest, not the smartest thing I've ever done. It doesn't help that Death seems to be a bit of a prick... and what's this about me being sent back in time? OOC, fem!Harry, dark!Harry. Elemental and Black Magics. Femslash. Rated M for language, violence, and mature topics.
