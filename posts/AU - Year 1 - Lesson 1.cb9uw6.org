Good morning first years. I am Professor Tom Marvolo Riddle. I teach Defence Against the Dark Arts as well as an elective called Magical Theory. My class will be one of the most strenuous and challenging that you will find offered at Hogwarts, or any other school for that matter. You will take your O.W.L.s at the end of your 3rd year, and your N.E.W.T.s at the end of your 5th year. If you continue on beyond that, you will be recognized with an official Mastery at the end of your 7th year. My Magical Theory elective is only open to those who continue to their sixth and seventh year of Defence.

Occasionally I will bring in guests who are experts on specific aspects of defence, some are former students, some are masters I myself learned from.

As a general outline, at the time of your O.W.L.s you are expected to be able to classify and neutralize common spells and creatures that the Ministry has determined that the average witch or wizard may encounter in their daily lives. At the N.E.W.T. level, you will be expected to be able to handle a wider range of spells and creatures, as well as some rituals. At the Mastery level, you will not only be expected to identify and combat common and danger spells, creatures, and rituals, but also have the general theoretical knowledge to safely deal with unknown threats. Those with a Mastery is Defence, and at least two years in the Dueling Club are all but guaranteed a position as an Auror, or an invitation to interview in the Department of Mysteries. Some of my graduates have even gone one to work for Gringots.

In addition to my roll as a teacher, I am also the head of house for Slytherin, of which i was a member while a student here. That said, i will tolerate no bigotry or discrimination in my presence. I am a half blood, orphaned at birth, adopted and raised by muggles. I came to this school, to Slytherin house, and proved the blood and parentage mean nothing. If you still suffer from delusions of grandeur, speak to me privately. I have allowed some of this school's most staunch blood purists to re-educate themselves before their graduations. In this classroom, I see no blood lines, no houses, no divisions. You are my students, and your only merits will be your own achievements.

It may surprise you to learn, I am extremely busy most of the time. You may not always find me when you need me. I encourage all of you to look to the sixth and seventh year students for help. They all started where you are now. For urgent matters, write what you need and slide it under my office door, and your note will find it's way to me shortly.

Now, let's begin your first ever Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson!

The Dark Arts, broadly, refers to a category of magic considered to be dangerous to both user and victim. Over the course of history, the specific definition and requirements for something to be considered "dark" have changed, growing and shrinking, sometimes contradicting. Today we will explore what it means for something to be "dark" by today's standards, as well as things that have noticeably changed categories over time.

The original division between light and dark magic occurred just over 1000 years ago, when the founders of this very school were deciding what should be taught to young witches and wizards. Before that point, most magic was passed down, master to apprentice, and the effects and purposes of some spells were viewed as malicious or distasteful, but ultimately, magic was viewed as a tool, no more good or evil than the person wielding it. The founders, having lived long decades already, learning from many masters, and together bearing much of Europe's magical knowledge, decided that some magic simply caused more harm than good, and should be cut from the curriculum of their fledgling school. Salazar Slytherin and Rowena Ravenclaw were of the opinion that it was their duty, as educators who had acquired so much knowledge, to pass on everything they knew, without censorship. They believed it was the right of every witch and wizard to use their magic responsibly according to their own morals and wisdom. Godric Gryffindor and Helga Hufflepuff both believed that it would be irresponsible to put tools of abject destruction in the hands of children. They believed that while knowledge should not be lost or denied, it should not be made available to those who had not proven themselves capable of control and sound judgement. This was the first and two great disagreements between the founders, and it lays the foundation for classifying "dark" magic for the next 1000 years.

Helga proposed that the spiritual plane should remain beyond a wizard's touch, as the soul is sacred. Godric added that the mind, too, should be off limits to novices, and most masters. To tamper with another's mind and free will was a malicious act, that could not be justified. And so, the first ever definition of "dark" magic was written. Magic which affected the spiritual or mental planes of our our world would be classified as "dark", and "dark" magic would not be taught within Hogwarts. Eventually, Rowena gave in, on the condition that while "dark" magic would not be taught, they would ensure that the knowledge survived. This was the birth of the Restricted Section of the library, where Rowena and Salazar accumulated the magic that was considered to be off limits, but which they would not allow to be forgotten.

Later on, as the tensions between the magical and mundane worlds began to rise, attempts were made to restrict any magic meant only to do harm. This is when most definitions get muddy, with the introduction of such a subjective requirement. With the introduction of the statute of secrecy, many magics, specifically those acting in the mental plane, were removed from their categorization of "dark", so that the wizarding world could better hide itself.

Today, "dark" magic is divided into multiple categories, some of which are subject to a life in Azkaban, while other won't event get you a detention.

Category 1 covers magic which is by technicality "dark", but which in practice serves no particular purpose to any dark agenda. The Confundus charm, which acts in the mental plane, and leaves a person temporarily dazed, confused, and disoriented, is technically "dark". This is also used as a harmless way of making muggle wander away from wizarding settlements, and is a part of many community wide security measures.

Category II covers magic which is destructive by nature, but which is not specifically built around malicious intent nor permanent damage. Most hexes, jinxes, and curses fall into this category. Some you even learn here in this classroom.

Category III is where magic become inherently illegal, regardless of context. Use of these spells will typically not have you sent to Azkaban, but will likely have some disciplinary action without a VERY good reason. These spells are intended to cause lasting harm, and are usually only used when attacking someone, or when defending against an attack.

Category IV is where most people will begin to get wary of acknowledging that they even know about such spells. Magic in this category is what you will find in the Restricted Section, or down the likes of Knockturn Alley. This magic is usually full of malicious intent and lasting damage. Fiendfyre is a Category IV dark curse.

Category V contains only three spells, although technically many things can fall into this category. The use of any Category V dark magic on another person in anything short of a last resort to preserve a life, will send you to Azkaban for life. The three unforgivable curses, to deliberately transfer an infective curse to another, to perform a ritual requiring human sacrifice, or to tamper with the nature of reality are all part of this Category.

Within this class, you will learn to deal with Category I, II, and III by the end of your fifth year. Those who stay for year six and seven will learn to deal with Category IV and V.

For Friday, I would like each of you to research a spell which has been classified as "dark" at one time or another, but which is Category I or below today. Be prepared to share in class.

That is a good reason. I typically recommend starting with the alternate/expanded introduction, linkffn(Daystar's remix of HPMoR).

Also, the best preface is actually found at the start of chapter 22:

/Something, somewhere, somewhen, must have happened differently.../

PETUNIA EVANS married Michael Verres, a Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford.

HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES grew up in a house filled to the brim with books. He once bit a math teacher who didn't know what a logarithm was. He's read /Godel, Escher, Bach/ and /Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases/ and volume one of /The Feynman Lectures on Physics/. And despite what everyone who's met him seems to fear, he doesn't want to become the next Dark Lord. He was raised better than that. He wants to discover the laws of magic and become a god.

HERMIONE GRANGER is doing better than him in every class except broomstick riding.

DRACO MALFOY is exactly what you would expect an eleven-year-old boy to be like if Darth Vader were his doting father.

PROFESSOR QUIRRELL is living his lifelong dream of teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, or as he prefers to call his class, Battle Magic. His students are all wondering what's going to go wrong with the Defense Professor this time.

DUMBLEDORE is either insane, or playing some vastly deeper game which involved setting fire to a chicken.

DEPUTY HEADMISTRESS MINERVA MCGONAGALL needs to go off somewhere private and scream for a while.

Presenting:

HARRY POTTER AND THE METHODS OF RATIONALITY

You ain't guessin' where this one's going.
