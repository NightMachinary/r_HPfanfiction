I want to preface this by saying I'm not looking to start an argument just genuinely interested in what other people's opinions.

Basically I want to know where you think cannon went wrong. What you think should think should not have happened or should have happened.

I have two

1 - not so unpopular but I don't like Harry and Ginny together for three major reasons. 1 - it's repeating his parents failed lives to the point where Harry has married someone who looks like his mother. 2 - it is INCREDIBLY rare to marry your high school sweethearts and to have that happen for the main characters just seems far too clean cut. 3 - Ginny was head over heels for him before she even met him. Harry hates the hero worship that he gets so why would he go there. Hermione even told him that she was only dating other guys in the hopes that he would notice her.

2 - I feel like either Ron or Hermione should have died. I can't eloquently explain why in any other way than to say it seems like that what should have happened. Harry is the tortured hero and it seems to me that losing one of his best friends would have fit is narrative. Not a nice thought but one I have thought for a long time.

*** It's staggering how many people in this sub have read so much fanfiction that they've forgotten what's canon and what isn't. Especially when it comes to character interpretations of Sirius or Draco. People here think Draco is an unredeemable war criminal who should be locked up for life, and have no idea why other people might like him or like reading shipfics with him. Well, there's actually canon reasons for that.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy's voice on that Tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents?

**** They also think he's a dreamboat who's just misunderstood. The reality is that it took the prospect of him and his parents being murdered to realize Voldemort might not be such a good guy, and after that he's still roaming Hogwarts trying to catch Harry to turn him over.

Malfoy isn't redeemed in the story, instead he's set on the road to it. We see in the epilogue that shouldn't be mentioned that it worked out for him. That Ron is comfortable enough with him to joke about Malfoy's kid and his daughter.

****** [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/22/jk-rowling-unnerved-by-girls-who-fall-for-draco-malfoy][According to JKR,]] Draco Malfoy had a hidden heart of gold all along.

#+begin_quote
  “His strange interest in alchemical manuscripts, from which he never attempts to make a Philosopher's Stone, hints at a wish for something other than wealth, perhaps even the wish to be a better man. I have high hopes that he will raise Scorpius to be a much kinder and more tolerant Malfoy than he was in his own youth,” she writes, ending: “His Christian name comes from a constellation -- the dragon -- and yet his wand core is of unicorn. This was symbolic. There is, after all -- and at the risk of re-kindling unhealthy fantasies -- some *unextinguished good at the heart of Draco.”*

****** I've been thinking quite a bit about Draco. He's no demon, but I doubt he would ever be a saint.

In my upcoming story, Draco was required to pay 1000 Galleons to St. Mungo's and was forced to live in a separate house for a year while the Malfoy properties were searched thoroughly for dark objects, of which there were some. Draco put up no fuss about their removal and soon moved back into Malfoy Manor with his fiancee, Astoria Greengrass. The Dark Mark on his arm has largely faded, but it is still there. Draco always wears long sleeves for that reason and has slight nerve damage to that arm due to him trying various desperate methods of removing the Dark Mark.

Draco is on the Hogwarts Board of Governors, but his role is mostly interviewing job candidates and conducting performance reviews. He's also the liason between the Board and the OWL and NEWT testing authority. He makes it a point to stay out of the public eye as much as possible, though he is still active in pureblood circles. He visits his father and mother in Azkaban twice a year (the maximum visits allowed). Neither of them approve of Astoria.

Lucius was given life in Azkaban for twenty-three counts of murder, fourteen counts of attempted murder, repeated use of Cruciatus and Imperius Curse, possession and use of illegal substances (class A, B, C, AA, and D), possession and use of illegal Dark objects, and aiding and abetting criminals. Narcissa was given twenty-five years in Azkaban for three counts of murder of Muggles, five counts of murder of Muggleborns, four counts of murder of half-bloods or purebloods (all four of them were fellow Death Eaters), seventeen counts of use of the Cruciatus Curse (fifteen of them on fellow Death Eaters), and aiding and abetting criminals.

Draco marries Astoria Greengrass. He meets her at one of the Board of Governors dinners, during his first year on the job. She was there on the arm of some old guy that she was using for information of items that had been stolen from her older sister by the Ministry. Draco and she hit it off quickly. Draco was looking for someone largely apolitical, who was just looking for the quiet life, and Astoria was looking for someone with financial security, had good looks, and made her laugh. Neither of them want anything to do with politics, and quietly raise their son to be elegant, aloof, and very intelligent. Draco and Astoria spend their free time reading, doing the Daily Prophet crossword, reading various newspapers, attending various dinners, taking long walks on the Malfoy Manor grounds, raising their son, doing things for the Hogwarts Board of Governors, and trying to forget the past. They still feel superior to Muggles, but are mostly accepting of the rights of Muggleborns to magic. He grills Muggleborns more intensely when interviewing them for jobs at Hogwarts, but if they demonstrate clear competency he will reluctantly recommend them for the position.

They have another house-elf named Ribbette whom they treat fairly, if not affectionately. They host a Halloween party every year at their manor and invite the Board of Governors and their families, the teachers of Hogwarts and their families, several 'friends' and their families, etc. They travel abroad a lot during the winter. Astoria volunteers every Sunday afternoon at St. Mungo's where she visits people who are forced to live there for the rest of their lives due to being cursed by the Death Eaters. She does this partly because she wants to make up for her parents' Death Eater activity, and partly because she was forced to stay in St. Mungo's for an extended period of time due to illness as a child, and remembered it being very lonely. She befriends Gilderoy Lockhart and attempts to help him regain his memory, with limited success.

**** I don't mind a good redemption story featuring Draco, I don't think he himself actually ever went so far as to be actually unredeemable, however at the same time I simply can't enjoy a story that features Draco in a relationship with someone he spend 5 years bullying relentlessly.

I get that it's a kink that some people have, falling in love!lust with someone they shouldn't, but to me the relationship always feels either forced or they change the characters so much that they might as well be original characters.

** - Bellatrix paired with Harry is as dumb and unrealistic as Snape paired with Hermione. If you hate one, by all rights, you should hate the other. And no, the "insanity excuse" doesn't mean anything. Bellatrix did her crimes /before/ she went to Azkaban for 15 years. And even if she was cuckoo before the Dementors got her, that still doesn't absolve her. Plenty of mentally ill people don't go around torturing police officers for the laughs.

- Canon Voldemort paired with, and having a baby with anyone, is OOC. Voldemort treats all his cronies, even his best ones (Snape, Bella, Lucius) as tools, not love interests. He didn't care when Lucius went to prison, he killed Snape for the Elder Wand, and he mocked Bella in front of all the Death Eaters because he's petty as fuck.

******* Nah, the time skip to the future was the big problem in itself. The author took a lot of time and effort to build up the characters and the setting of the first half of the story, and then threw it all away and tried to introduce a whole /new/ set of characters that the reader was supposed to be interested in. It just doesn't work. And furthermore, by going back to the future, Harry should have lost all his relative advantage against Voldemort - yet he somehow magically maintains it. It doesn't make any sense at all.

No, the story should have stayed in the past. Harry should have just fought Voldie in the 70s.

******** The time skip could have worked wonderfully, and when it happened I was excited to see how it could turn out.

What should have happened during the time skip is that Voldemort should have won and been completely in power, due to the lack of a boy-who-lived scenario disembodying him. This would have been the proper followup to the foreshadowing of Harry building up and sequestering away warchests full of semi-disposable wands and other necessities.

The second half of the story should have been Harry / Bellatrix building up and supplying a resistance to a dystopian tyrannical government. A government that decided who gets wands and can practice magic.

Instead, what we got was a story that retconed all the tragedy in Harry's life, and an antagonist who provided no real threat or struggle.

*** I think the only reason he wasn't banging his Death Eaters is because HP is essentially a children's book. If it weren't, I do think he'd have done whatever he wanted to with them. Not because he loved them or anything like that. But just because he could and because that's another way for him to have power over them. Him raping a death eater or a prisoner or him making another death eater do so doesn't seem terribly OOC to me.

But him being paired with someone and making love and babies with them is a different story, tho. I def agree that him having a baby with Bellatrix isn't really plausible. The whole pairing part aside, like, when was she supposedly pregnant? None of that makes any sense. I'd be surprised if his weird resurrected body could even make a baby tbh.

I'd argue that it's /possible/ that canon voldemort would use one of his followers as a tool to conceive an heir... but given that his goal is to live forever, it doesn't really make sense there. But if, instead of horcruxes he'd just been looking at being as powerful as possible, I could certainly see him needing a successor to have on hand.

Eg, if he focused more on revenge than on wanting to personally live forever (a fair twist), he could have tried to have a child to avenge him or to hold the fort down if he got turned incorporeal again.

Or, instead of making Nagini into a horcrux, he decides to make his heir/child into one. The imagery of the 'heir of slytherin' is a big one for him, so seems like it could be fitting for him.

I think if we're going off just the parts of the main 7 books, it wouldn't make sense for him to need an heir. But it's not something I see as particularly difficult to twist into existence ;)

***** The difference between me and other Draco lovers is that I'll freely admit that he's a right twat in the early books and when I first read the series I couldn't stand him. After reading it more and more though there are parts in the later books where I can't help but feel for him.

He was forced to either join the death eaters or watch his family suffer. Draco had always viciously loved his family so if course he would choose them.

He wanted to be Harrys friend from the get go and Harry turning him down for Ron (a family he was raised to believe was worse than him) would have hurt badly. A boy refused his hand when he was 11!

The facts are that he refused to acknowledge Harry at the manor despite it being clear who he was. He also tried to stop Crabbe in the ROR.

Draco is a prideful coward but not a bad person.

****** I'm going to respectfully disagree with you.

Throughout the series Draco is shown to be an objectively awful kid. Now, we can argue how much of that was his upbringing versus his core, but regardless he was awful. Consider the following:

- he regularly insulted the Weasleys for being poor
- he insulted Ron's mother for being fat and Harry's mom for being dead
- he regularly cheated at Quidditch
- he held bigoted views about non pure-bloods and regularly dropped the equivalent of the n-word
- he frequently joked and seemed to be giddy over the idea of others being killed
- the reason Harry didn't accept his friendship was because he revealed himself to be a little twat at Malkins
- in book 6, he actually seemed proud to have been chosen by Voldemort, not scared. It was only as the year progressed he realized the trouble he was in.
- During the final battle, Draco still tries to capture Harry. At the moment we are supposed to believe Draco maybe it's as bad as he was made out to be, he is still actively working on helping Voldemort win.

The thing about Draco is not that he was morally conflicted about supporting Voldemort or killing Dumbledore. He simply didn't have the stones to do it. Just because someone isn't willing to commit murder doesn't mean they are automatically a good person. Draco didn't kill Dumbledore because he is a coward. He didn't ID Harry at Malfoy Manor because he was a coward and couldn't decide if helping Harry was in his best interest. Remember that when asked to identify him, Draco didn't say yes but also didn't say no. Draco only cared about himself, up until the very end.

Killing off Lupin and Tonks is too neat and unnecessarily cruel to Andromeda. (I suspect JK forgot she'd killed off Ted already and then was stuck so just left it in.)

For a series about muggleborns being just as good as wizards there's seriously not good enough representation of that or any positive portrayal of muggles. Hermione is the only muggle or muggleborn I can think of that gets some decent narrative focus and doesn't also suffer or get killed, and even she gets tortured and scarred by a fantasy Nazi.

Having the 'Ron deserts Harry' plot in 2 of 7 books was a mistake, esp if we're meant to take PS/SS as a primer for the trio's key characteristics throughout the series.

**** Okay, actual answer: because the plot said so. But realistically:

Most muggle-borns who were old enough to do that on their own had minimal records and education in the muggle world past the age of eleven, and they identify more with the wizarding world than the muggle one. It would be difficult for them to get by in the muggle world and maybe even to travel by muggle means.

Muggle-borns who were still in school probably didn't tell their parents what was going on for the same reasons Dean and Hermione didn't. Even if they did, they might not be able to convince their parents that they really need to uproot their lives and flee the country, and they can't use magic for fear of being tracked.

A little confundus to the conductor and of Eurotrain could get them easily to France without buying tickets and any paperwork necessary. I don't know how difficult it is to cast confundus in canon, but then you could also fly or apparate to France.

I'd like to think that there's literally no other options for muggleborn to escape to. They're discriminated in europe since most of them supports Grindelwald, Australia is full with native aborigins that's not welcoming to foreigner, and most wizard in America is a bigger racist than Britain since wizards that migrate to America in the 16-17 century are the purebloods that has a lot of money.

******* Oh, I highly disagree with this.

Yes, she's ambitious, and yes, she is intelligent, but if those were traits she valued most in herself, she would have been a Ravenclaw.

Hermione, at her core, is a passionate, caring person who wears her heart on her sleeve. She has a strong sense of morals, and will fight for what she believes is right and just. She respects people who do the right thing, who can see past themselves and help others, and be a force for good in the world.

She's smart, but she's not some great innovator or scientist. She just loves to learn. She loves knowledge. She loves magic and wants to learn everything about it. As an end result of this passion for learning new things, shockingly, she knows a lot of things.

She didn't sign up for every elective because she was trying to get 13 OWLs and fast track her way to become Minister of Magic. She just wanted to learn anything and everything that she could.

Yes, Harry and Ron are not intellectuals, and yes, Hermione isn't an athletic person or interested in sports; but she recognizes and respects their passion for Quidditch, and she admires both Harry and Ron because they've shown themselves to be brave and selfless and caring.

The fact that they don't share the same passion or same interests or hobbies, ultimately does not matter to her.

*** I understand as I can't stomach Hermione, almost all fics I read either don't have her as one of the main, or she is completely a non factor to the story.

However, when its well done, Ron/Hermione can be one of the funniest and most loving couples I've read. One example, though I'm biased considering I love the author, she's just that wonderful, is from linkffn(Grow Young With Me).

This is coming from a Hermione hater, and I love her there.

Edit: There's a quote from Hermione there, paraphrasing it, (context: Harry asks something "shady" for Hermione to do but doesn't think she'd do it for him, considering its almost illegal) "You're an idiot, Harry. I'd do anything for you." I don't know why that has always stuck with me, but its really the summary of their relationship, where Harry is oblivious to something obvious and Hermione willing to help him out, whatever it takes, with no strings attached.

Another one where I found the chemistry fairly good and funny at times, though very much realistic, is from linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw) even though its really on the background.

On a side note, I love Ron when he's funny and loyal. And not a lot of people write him that way. I can also hate him in certain fics, if the author is good. Like the Ron from Sarcasm and Slytherin (another fic that if it becomes H/Hr, as has been alluded to, I'll stop reading it.)

Like he was meant to be friends with the Marauders, but was always shoe-horned in as the worst of all, who was cowardly and not that bright and not attractive like his friends and not good company and it just baffles me. How are we supposed to feel this great betrayal when it seems like he should never have been friends in the first place? As it is in canon, it's like we were given no redeeming qualities of him and that frankly, the Marauders couldn't have been that attached anyway. So yeah.

There's the summer before that too, in Grimmauld Place. Then they were on the same Quidditch team and likely talked there as well.

They get to know each other plenty. We just see too little of it. I would've liked to see JKR include Ginny more here and there. Perhaps have Harry and Ginny be the last two standing at the Department of Mysteries, or have Ginny sneak herself and Harry out of the Burrow at night to play Quidditch, or have her take Harry seriously about Malfoy.

Or come with Harry to get Slughorn's memory. Ginny might not look like Lily, but perhaps seeing Harry and Ginny together would've brought up Slughorn's memories of James and Lily. I dunno, just /something/ more.

I also seem to remember the chest monster roaring in moments where he was feeling particularly jealous? It's been a year-ish since I finished my last re-read, so I don't necessarily remember too many interactions, but there's definitely at least the fifth book (potentially the fourth) of them moving around each other with an air of romantic interest.

Once Harry gets tacit permission from Ron to pursue Ginny, there's a part where it is mentioned that in the evenings Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione sit in their couple pairs in front of the fire and simply exist. I remember Harry acknowledging that he was making the most of this time, and other quiet alone times with her because it felt like their time was finite and the end of this time was rapidly approaching.

There are a few things in /HBP/ and /DH/ that are good and right to have been included in the series (e.g. Dumbledore's death, the /idea/ of horcruxes [but definitely not the way they were implemented], the Deathly Hallows [same caveat has horcruxes], and maybe a few others), but by and large almost everything about those books and everything that JKR has produced since is pretty bad.

** I don't read into the Cursed Child canon (frankly I have no clue what's it about) and I also don't have too much to say in the way of what should or shouldn't have happened to certain characters in the original 7 books. However, if I had the ability to wave my wand, so to speak, and add something to canon, it would be that there should have been more duels between wizards. Like, I want to see what two or more experienced wizards/witches can really do in terms of dueling capability.

One of my all time favorite sequences, both in the books and the movies, was the duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort at the Ministry of Magic. (I still think Voldemort pulling out a giant, fire snake is the coolest fucking thing ever).

Aside from that, I just hate hearing about how all these wizards/witches are extremely skilled in the Dark Arts or whatever and then NOT seeing that capability in action. A prime example of this is that fabled duel between Dumbledore and Grindelwald that supposedly lasted for hours and featured incredible feats of magic. I WANT TO SEE THAT FIGHT (or at the very least read about it in detail).

Don't get me wrong, I get that this might be seen as something totally superficial but it's definitely something that is lacking in the series. Again, you have all these competent wizards/witches who are proficient at Defense Against the Dark Arts yet most of the duels shown on screen were all "ours wands are doing that connection thing" and not much else. I WANT MORE FIRE ANIMALS.

** These threads are sways the same: opinions that may be unpopular in the whole HP community, but pretty popular here. I know that I have some opinions that are definitively unpopular here:

1. Nicknames - I don't mind them at all, I don't get why so many people have problems with them

2. "White-Washing" of Death Eaters - Making the "Dark Side" more human makes more interesting villains and can make stories not read like children books (I know cannon was written for kids so I can understand why JKR wrote the villains so one-dimensional, doesn't mean every fanfic has to follow that path)

3 - Draco is redeemable. I know he is a POS in cannon, but even in cannon he shows that he isn't really evil. So given the right opportunities he could turn out not being a completly POS.

4 - Using "established" dann on things in your fic isn't bad. Why change the name of Hermoines parents if everyone already feels like they are named Dan and Emma? Same goes for a lot of other fannon characteristics.

** I have to disagree with you there. 1 - I'd hardly call being murdered by a terrorist "failed lives." 1a - Ginny doesn't look very much like Lily, as others have said. 2 - Almost ANY pairing in a Hogwarts-years fic will be high school sweethearts. 3 is probably the fairest, but I read that more as Ginny getting shafted in terms of character development in the second half of the series.

I do agree on your second point, more in the sense that it's unrealistic that only one Weasley died in the war. (I struggled with the same kind of thing in the Arithmancer series.) Harry himself lost a lot, but the people around him honestly didn't, given the small number of named character deaths.

Anyway, here are my top unpopular opinions:

1. I'm actually okay with the Epilogue, even though it's not my top ship(s).
2. I think Cursed Child was only mediocre, not terrible, although I agree that it's too OOC to be canon.
3. +I enjoy politician!kids as long as it doesn't veer into Super!Harry territory. I know it's unrealistic, but it adds an interesting dimension that we hardly see at all in canon.+

Edit: just realized this is supposed to be opinions about canon, so here's another canon one:

1. It was totally realistic for Molly to ask "What's the platform number?" in Book 1. All parents play the game of asking kids questions they already know to make sure they remember them. Also, "packed with muggles" would not stand out nearly as much in England, where "mug" is slang for a gullible person.

Wizarding britain is a pretty small and insular community. Since Hogwarts is pretty much the only school in the entire country, it makes sense that two magical people of around the same age falling in love would have gone to school together and probably fancied each other back then.

** It's never explicitly stated that Ginny looked like lily. She just had red hair. And a completely different shade at that. It's thr fans who are trying to create this weird oedipus concept for Harry that's just never implied in the books. This one really annoys me as a redhead myself because everyone always tells me how much I look like Sophie turner, isla fisher and Amy Adams. No I don't like any of those women and all of our hair colours are different. Also my boyfriend gets the piss taken out of him because both me and his aunt have red hair. Coincide? I think so!

Also on a less personal note, I think given Harry's history it makes a lot of sense that he would crave familiarity and comfort. Marrying his high school sweetheart who's been by side since the start is logical. I think it would be strange if he married someone outside of the D.A because they wouldn't have a notion about what Harry's been through or how to help him recover. Also Harry and Ginny are extremely similar. They have similar sense of humor temperaments, and interests.

Ginny was in essence crafted perfectly for Harry by JK Rowling. Every attribute she has is exactly what Harry likes: no-nonsense (she doesn't put up with Harry's moping and doesn't mope herself), funny, brave, loves Qudditch and is attractive. My favourite moments between them are actually in Order of the Phoenix, she really gets through to him in ways Ron and Hermione couldn't and it's why I love their relationship so much. I think Harry and Hermione would be okay though, but Ginny is genuinely perfect for him.

JK Rowling did consider killing Ron, so she was also sought of thinking the same thing. I am personally very glad she didn't. Harry Potter is a children's tale at heart and it would really rip the heart out of the series to kill Ron. Fred was enough as it was.

** A bit late but here it is:

- The only reason I like Harry/Ginny is because Ginny is basically an empty character with not much character development in canon. Authors (like JKR) could make her literally the best girl that Harry could be with without him OOC.
- Even with the time turner, Werewolf McWerewolf, and some other plothole, PoA is the best book in the series.
- If Harry/Tom soul bond reincarnation could work in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11907443/1/Full-Circle][Full Circle]], any other absurd pairing could also be turned into a great fanfiction. Give me your best Hogwarts/Giant Squid please!
- Some people takes things in HP too rationally. They analyze how magic works, how society is backwards in Magical Britain, how Hogwarts is a bad school, how wizarding economy works, and even how Quidditch Rules is unfair; those things doesn't really contribute to the story. I mean, doing research as an author is great and you should do it, but you don't need to put your result into the story. You could've make an off-site post or even a something in social media. I blame HPMOR for this.
- Harry is bisexual and Cedric is his man-crush.

This may not be unpopular

- Harry/Hermione will not work in canon settings, Harry never has any romantic feelings towards Hermione at all. They're not as comfortable around each other in comparison to Harry/Ron, Harry/Ginny, or even Hermione/Ron, the tent scene after Ron left is a very uncomfortable scene to read even after years later. Harry/Hermione could work in AU where Harry is more academically inclined and Hermione is less self-righteous.
- Dumbledore isn't some evil manipulator or a Machiavellian figure, he just have no idea how to raise children. His childhood is in late 1890s with a father in prison, he have no idea what a normal loving family is. He doesn't realise he need to train Harry, Dumledore's a genius and he thinks Harry is one too. Harry cast a patronous at 13 to repel hundreds of Dementors, slays a basilisk at 12, outfly a dragon, and escapes a dark lord at 14. Defeating Voldemort shouldn't be a problem, he should focuses on Horcruxes, the thing that (hopefully) Harry has no idea of.

Ginny's described with brown eyes, flaming red hair, lots of freckles, and being short (compared to Hermione and Luna). She almost definitely has an athletic figure too, since she's a pro Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies.

Lily is described as having dark red hair and bright green eyes. There is no description of freckles, so we can assume that she is un-freckled. No mention of her height is made when James, Sirius and Snape are with her in those scenes, which means she's of comparable height to them. And James is described as being tall, which means Lily is close to his height.

** Point 1 I agree on so much, the biggest thing for me is the hero worship, if they made sense as a couple then them being school sweethearts would be fine for me, but I just don't understand why they're together at all. I'd expect her to annoy him, but him to put up with it because she's Ron's sister, until she grows up and meets someone who is maybe heroic but without the reputation of it and she can be the one who really sees that in them, rather than one of the many buying into the legend, maybe if at some point she started paying attention to Neville and they're friends then in book 7 they're both looking out for the younger kids in school, kinda running things together and get together at some point through that, they might make sense together? Dunno, but I'd want her to be with someone she sees as special on her own rather than just sticking with the one the world told her was special her whole childhood.

*** One thing that help me accept how Ginny worshiped Harry at first is his reputation. We have a focus on Ginny because she is Ron sister and she is near, but the way it's presented, almost every magical girl , or even child , "knew" Harry before meeting him.

Either your parent weren't supportive of Voldemort and you grew up hearing about the "Boy-Who-Lived" and how heroic he is, or your parent were Death Eater sympathiser and either you still grew up worshiping him (not good to flaunt your past allegiance if he is dead) or your heard about the Dark Lord and how Harry put an end to the cleansing of the world and the begging of a Golden Age, and hate him on principle.

So the past hero worship would probably have been a problem for almost every girl Harry met. Even Muggleborn seem to follow sheep mentality once at Hogwarts and listen to the rumors (with the exception of Hermione but probably because she is always with him and know rumor are wrong).

The only way to have 0 worship would be for Harry to be with a Muggleborn (and not even sure) or a Muggle, kinda limit the choices.

Ginny makes Harry laugh, and he makes her world safer. They can catch each other's eye and know that they understand each other.

****** But he describes her in very non-brotherly ways. I think Harry and Hermione are portrayed far more like brother and sister. Hermione tends to nag Harry and try to serve as a protector rather than an equal. They often butt heads but when push comes to shove, they have each other's complete loyalty. It's very much like a younger brother/older sister relationship where they might not even get along most of the time, but that familial connection is always there.

Harry and Ginny actually get along as friends and show attraction to each other. They are incredibly compatible, sharing similar interests and a very similar sense of humor. Ginny also has an uncanny knack for knowing exactly how to treat Harry depending on the situation.

*** Except Ginny clearly got over the hero worship thing, which is overstated by the fandom anyway. At first, she is no more hero obsessed than her brothers or anyone else. Then her interactions become more of a young girl with a crush on a cute boy than him simply being a hero. Then he actually saves her life, so yeah, I think its fair for her feelings to grow from that. But by 4th year, while she is still into him, she acts normal around him and then legitimately it seems she doesn't care in the slightest that he is the boy who lived. Compare that to someone like Colin Creevey who practically stalks Harry and never really settles down from his hero worship.

I seriously don't understand this point of criticism when the whole point of Ginny's character leading up to them getting together is her getting over her crush and becoming his equal.

Large parts of canon are written for children, and thus don't really make much sense. Fixing those up seems like a must to me for 'realistic' fics.

Quidditch is incredibly boring and needs to have its scoring fixed/looked at. It works if all you're doing is following Harry, because he plays the only position that really matters in the books - but in fics they tend to be really boring.

I like magical cores as a generally understood concept of magical power that seemed to clearly exist in canon to me, but a lot of fics don't seem to be good at using it.

I default to Hermione as the best/normal Harry pairing, but for some reason prefer secondary or tertiary characters if there's a specifically romance focused story. I like Ginny but don't really find her good with Harry, probably because of how I read the books.

As is answered almost every time this is mentioned. Game Score vs Final Score is something they have to take into account. I don't recall which game it was. But in Book 2 or 3 Harry had to keep the snitch in play until they had scored a lot otherwise they'd win that game but still not have enough points to win the Quidditch cup. And of course in the World Cup Krum got the snitch, but Ireland still won since they had such a huge lead.

That's really bad rules. You really need to have a terrible team to get down fast enough that the snitch doesn't win you the game - and that's basically through author fiat.

The snitch being ~50 points and used as a halftime (with 2 snitches per game) makes so much more sense as a quick fix, for example. But there's no other team sport I've ever heard of that's so clearly designed for the main character to be the only important player :P

She got a summer job after presumably after the Goblet of fire the goblet of fire was in 1994 yes, but the beginning of the school year meaning by the time it was summer it was 1995. Flyers birthday is in October so yes she was still 17. Wizard are allowed to use magic outside at school at 17 which maybe is there equivalent to adulthood, but you were talking about our legalities because you referred to the British age of consent so by law she still was not legally an adult. But even with that tiny difference in her being 18 vs 17 it wouldn't be a big deal if Bill simply dated someone closer to his age.

** 1) I think JK got too over zealous in Hermione being the antithesis to pureblood rhetoric trope that she ruined the dynamic of the Trio. Like in the beginning the Harry, Ron, and Hermione could all check each other on their respectively flaws (Hermione being insensitive in POA, Ron's insecurity and Harry's savior complex in GOF as examples) but as the series progressed Hermione got way overpowered to the point where the boys couldn't do that anymore, but she could. Like in OttP, HBP, and DH, Ron had to seriously deal with his inferiority complex and attitude, and Harry had to deal with his savior complex and obsession and trust issues. And Hermione could point them out because of course she is all knowing. However when her bad traits started coming out (jealousy, stubbornness, lack of accountability) Ron and Harry can't check her, because Hermione is the brains and therefore can't be in the wrong.

2) Everything about house elves was done completely wrong and the lack of information we have about them and how their situation came to be, is an embarrassment. And the fact we don't know what becomes on them is lazy and a bit infuriating.

So I'm really late to this, but I don't think any of the Trio should be shipped together. To me I think it's way too unusual to have best friends move into romantic relationships, especially at that time when they're all still trying to find themselves. I just imagine that for them it'd just be two awkward to change the dynamic of their previously-established platonic relationships with each other to a romantic one.

I actually feel that Lavender/Ron complemented each other well (even though, outside of gossip and divination Lavender is a fairly blank slate). I also feel that Harry/Luna would've been interesting since they could relate to each other as outsiders.

I really feel that Hermione should have been shipped with another muggleborn because I think it'd be cool to have the two of them bond over the shared muggleborn experience. (In this particular AU in my head, Hermione, who had been crushing hard on Dean, teams up with Harry to break up the Dean/Ginny relationship so they can each get with their desired partner.)

**** Notice I never said anything about the beginning I said towards the end of the books. Teens are gonna be teens and of course they're gonna snot each other I don't care about that. And from what I noticed from Tonks and Remus was unhealthy which doesn't give us the reader much to go off. And yeah I was sad when they died but I feel like I loved both characters separately. And I definitely don't consider Remus a minor character. And that's it though a 40 and fifty year old are matured they've lived a life. I think it's a bit like if when you're 20 in college and there's a high schooler technically your similar in age and whatnot but technically it's getting to that point where it's weird

***** I did notice that you said towards the end of the books, which is why I explicitly asked for an example from the start seeing as that implies that there were relationships in the start.

What makes you think the relationship between tonks and Remus was unhealthy? I can't think of any examples from the book. I mean the fact that Remus was a werewolf was a problem for them but that doesn't make it an unhealthy relationship.

A 20 year old dating a secondary school student is wrong because the student would be underage which would make it pedophilia. There's nothing wrong with a 27 year old dating a 37 year old which is the age difference in this instance, because they'd both be consenting adults, They're both in the working world, laying down their lives for other people and fighting in war. It's not like tonks was 16 and Remus was 50.

****** Tonks was 24 when she died, 21 when she met lupin. Lupin meeting her and falling in love with someone 10 years his junior is a little weird.

And their relationship was very unhealthy. Instead of talking to her Lupin avoided her, saying that he was too old for her and too dangerous. She gets depressed, he continues to pretend she doesn't exist, and finally he admits his feelings and marries her. Shortly after she finds out she's pregnant he runs away again. He's too scared his baby will be a werewolf and so decided to not deal with it and leave her. All alone. Pregnant. Horribly in love with him and incredibly excited about her baby. All because he couldn't talk to her.

******* But that's because he was terrified about the werewolf thing. It's a special circumstance, I don't think that makes it unhealthy. They had a hard time but I just don't think there's enough evidence in the book to show that they had an unhealthy relationship. It's entirely logical to want to be scared about the very real possibility that you could lose control and kill your own wife and child every single month. An unhealthy relationship to me would be if they were somehow abusive to each other. Remus leaves because he loves tonks and wants to protect her, the same way Harry leaves ginny. They don't leave out of spite

******** A relationship can be unhealthy for a million reasons besides one hitting the other. It is absolutely possible for two people to be bad for each other even though they're not throwing punches at each other.

And while it's understandable him being scared, but he married her. Married her when she was 22 while tensions were unbelievably high because they're at war and then immediately got her pregnant. And then instead of taking responsibility he then immediately breaks up with her an runs away. She's pregnant, alone, and stuck in a warzone. That is not a healthy relationship

********* I didn't say physical abuse. Abuse can be physical, emotional, mental, verbal etc. I just said abuse.

Also I don't buy into this idea of so and so got someone pregnant. It takes two to tango and tonks wasn't a child. I'm not even twenty two yet but I would still take responsibility for my own decision to have a child.

Also Remus didn't break up with Tonks he just left. There's a difference. He went to help Harry because being with her was dangerous as he could bite her or the child. And he was worried about the social stigma that would surround his wife and child if he stuck around because everyone would know that they were in a family with a werewolf. Obviously the right thing to do would be to stick it out and not care what people think but people make mistakes when tensions are high. Like when Ron left Harry and hermione in the woods. He thought he was going home to look after his family but on further reflection realized the right thing to do is to continue the horcrux hunt. Like Remus realized that his love for tonks and teddy was more important than his condition.

********** Ron wasn't a full grown 33 year old adult with a wife when he left harry and hermoine. He was still a child who wasn't allowed to be a child because he was stuck in a war. But Remus was a grown adult man.

And you're absolutely right, tonks also contributed to getting pregnant. But that doesn't change the fact that her husband shouldn't have ran from her like he always does. I understand that he's a werewolf, that he's terrified of himself and hurting those he cares about. But that still does not make their relationship a healthy one. The relationship can be unhealthy without it particularly being someone's fault. Lupin wasn't comfortable with himself because he was a werewolf and never dealt with those issues. He entered into a relationship with someone while having his own issues and wasn't able to deal with the added pressure of the relationship. He ran. That is not healthy. That does not mean it's his fault. He didn't choose to be a werewolf and it's not particularly easy to get therapy to talk through these issues in a warzone. But that is still not healthy

*********** I still don't see how the relationship is not healthy. Everything he did he did for Tonks and Teddy. Yes he ran which was wrong, but it wasn't done out of spite or malice. He did it because he wasn't in the right mental state at the time. It wasn't like he used it as an opportunity to leave. We see later on in Deathly Hallows how absolutely ecstatic he is to be with teddy and tonks. Everyone does stupid things when they're emotional, that doesn't make their relationships unhealthy.

************ Yes but being a fully grown man running away from your wife instead of talking to her like a reasonable adult simply isn't healthy no matter how you wrap it. Picture being a young girl just getting the one you think is the man of your dreams you immediately become pregnant in a war zone and he up and leaves you. I also do think fans fail to mention that where Remus was struggling with the news Tonks was the one who was pregnant. Her life is now bound to this baby she has to carry him inside her and nurse him. If anyone should've been afraid of the stigma around werewolves it certainly did fall on the pregnant woman carrying the potential werewolf. Not to mention in spite of Dumbledore being killed and her own cousin being killed the only thing that's contributing to her depression is Remus not loving her back. She spends Christmas alone in hopes he notices. That's not healthy and it sounds a bit more like infatuation rather than love which is something very very commonly in younger people particularly in that age range.

************** Your using the term abusive I never said that but he was definitely not a compatible match and yeah I would say leaving your pregnant wife you consented to marry and then sleep with without talking to her is indeed selfish. And I believe you said you were younger than 22 believe it or not many older people would see you as just one step above a child same with me. There people far older and wiser than one 22 year old. No ones saying she didn't also agree to it but she chased so hard for Remus because I'm her young mind she thought he was the perfect man for her and in return he betrayed her trust. There's also some selfish things Tonks herself did in the relationship that contribute to t being toxic. For example, airing their dirty laundry out in front of everyone and everyone collectively pressuring Remus into a relationship he clearly wasn't ready for and yes definitely pressuring someone into something there not ready for certainly toxic, as well as leaving your pregnant partner without so much as telling her why. That's not intimacy, because he wouldn't explained properly how he felt and both would feel comfortable talking and respecting each other's feelings.

*************** But don't you see that most of your argument is pretty much just your own head canon? Like it's based loosely off the actual story. Yes Remus left tonks and yes tonks was depressed when he rejected her. But saying that the relationship itself was unhealthy and toxic is a bit of a stretch. J.K Rowling herself said she put them together to minimize the stigma surrounding couples of different ages. You didn't say the word abuse, but you're making it sound like there was some involved. The age of consent in a lot of countries is 16. Tonks was an adult, working woman. She made her own choices and was happier because of them in the long run. Just because Remus initially rejected her out of fear it doesn't mean that their relationship was inherently unhealthy or toxic. Just that it didn't begin on the right foot, which could be said about a great many healthy relationships

**************** I didn't say that's why it was toxic because of simple rejection but realistically if you pressure someone into not only returning your feeling but have a serious life together that is not respecting their feelings and that parts toxic not the rejection. And Jk Rowling certainly didn't have that effect, this couple was awful from the get go and were simply two different forces. And Remus leaving her and her pressuring Remus into a relationship isn't my head canon though because it happened in the book. I'm not understanding how leaving your pregnant wife without so much as a goodbye is a stretch in the testament to a healthy relationship. In fact I think it's a stretch to consider that not a toxic relationship and healthy because it just isn't. If I had just gotten pregnant with a man I went through all that trouble for and he left without saying a word I'd be devastated. No person would be okay with that.

************ You just repeat the same argument over and over so it seems you're not really listening. He did not run away for tonks. Tonks did not benefit from him running away. He ran away for himself. You can't be a 33 year old man and run away from your actual child when they need you over a fear you've had your entire life and have never done anything about and consider yourself in a healthy relationship. No matter if you were scared of your genes does it make it okay and healthy for you to leave a 22 year old wife to give birth alone in a literal warzone when it's clear she emotionally will not be able to handle it, which we see from when he first starts avoiding her and she immediately gets depressed and literally can barely do her job anymore because her transmog abilities don't work. That is not healthy!!! It doesn't matter that he's scared!! That does not make the relationship healthy!!

************* Ditto on the repeating the same argument thing mate. I'm not defending Remus's decision to leave, it was completely wrong. But we know that he didn't do it out of malice. I don't believe you can say that it was an unhealthy relationship at its core because of circumstances. If they hadn't died and had gone on to live long lives together they would have been very happy. But if they had an unhealthy relationship that wouldn't happen. My point is that we can never really know but I don't believe there's enough evidence to say it was unhealthy. Shit happens, that doesn't make the relationship unhealthy, just the environment
