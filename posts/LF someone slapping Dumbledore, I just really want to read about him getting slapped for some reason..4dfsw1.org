** "But Gellert!" Dumbledore staggered back, holding his reddening cheek.

"No means No, Albus," Grindelwald pronounced unapologetically. "If we are to build a new world together for the Greater Good, we need to set clear boundaries, and I just don't swing this way."

  When the Dursleys go to Japan, Dudley accidentally activates a security in MBI's locals that kill them. Now, what will MBI and Karasuba do with the child they found when they checked the Dursleys' car? Rated M for mention of torture and child abuse, and future language and gore. There will be some Dumbledore, Potters, and some Weasley bashing. You are warned. Alive!Potters
