** But, surprisingly, having an unfulfilled prophecy stating that "Either must die at the hand of the other" also extends Harry's life indefinitely so both he and Voldemort end up as two terribly old men that occasionally get into slap-fights in Saint Mungo's senior care center.

** So when I was reading your prompt an idea from star wars popped into my head. In star wars there's this sith lord Darth Nihilius who used the force to drain the life out of people, but it caused damage to his own body to do so. Eventually the guy's body faded away to nothing until he was just a spirit bound into a mask and a set of robes, but in return for this damnation he became the lord of hunger and was able to devour the life from entire planets in mere moments. I can just imagine Voldemort realizing that organic flesh is failing him despite his spirit remaining intact, so he decides to pursue a more advanced form of the wraith existence he had after his defeat. He finds a way to retain his powers in his spirit form, and then to possess physical objects in addition to living creatures. He eventually has his servants give him all their most prized resources and through his own ingenuity creates a magical vessel, a hollow shell almost like a horcrux in its own right, enchanted with the darkest of magics to amplify and channel his power. He abandons his mortal shell and transcends to a new existence wherein he surpasses the limits of the mortal body. Tireless, ceaseless, sleepless, unfeeling and cold, a twisted avatar of dark defiance, the body he makes is an insult to the laws of nature. It is at once a crown and a throne in which the Dark Lord's spirit dwells, and the bindings and magics within it connect to all who bear voldemorts mark. As long as those who bear the mark live the vessel cannot be destroyed, and when they die they are consumed by the vessel further fueling its strength and the strength of the black soul that is seated within it. Eventually, having learned to possess physical objects, Voldemort's presence stretches beyond his physical shell. Struck by the realization that he is not limited to his body he begins to expand his consciousness and binds his spirit to first his throne, and then his throne room, and then his manor, on and on enthralling those within the bounds of his influence and feeding on them to increase his strength. Eventually his black shadow looms over the earth itself and everything in it, all the while his presence permeates the very air and his mind is seated in his twisted crown, a hollow puppet of death and steel, cold as the grave, molded in the shape of a man. Eternal.

*** His manor long since rotted and crumbled, still hosts his throne. And upon that throne, an ancient skeleton sits. Upon its head, a gleaming crown, the only object within many lightyears that is not tarnished, rusted, eroded. The Earth is shrouded in shadow, Sol long since dimmed under a cloak of darkness that covers the star and suppresses its light, though keeps it alive as a twisted anchor. the planets permanently misaligned, their orbits twisted and erratic. Mars, if it were illuminated by anything but the dim brown light of the sun, would be permanently in zenith where ever one stood on Earth. Endless war. A war waged, a war lost, the Earth's life extinguished, its magic chained and prevented from fleeing with its demise. It flowed into the crown, now - all lines of Earth, the once-blood of nature, the magical channels, were bent and twisted towards the crumbling manor, lifting upwards slightly to converge into the crown. The channels of gravity, light and magic spanning the stars, forming the galactic web, long since re-oriented towards the dead star that had once been Sol. There was a hole in the galaxy - large, ever-growing. Within that hole existed a shadow, if one knew how to look. It loomed, twisted and roiled. One by one, the stars surrounding the hole lost their power, had their magic drained and their fusion engines extinguished, their spark of infinity stolen to fuel a dark god the likes of which had never been seen in this universe.

** I actually always kind of imagined that the horcruxes don't prevent your body from aging and eventually it will die of old age but you can prepare yourself a new body every time and posses it once the old one becomes useless.

**** In my mind, all Horcruxes can do that if they find a victim who gets overly attached to it, but that would seem unfeasible because every time your Horcrux comes to life, it becomes mortal. And considering that no other wizard than Voldemort had more than a Horcrux, that would mean that you only get to live twice and then spend the rest of eternity in limbo as a flayed baby.

** "You dare defy the Dark Lord Voldemort?" Voldemort creakily whispered. He took a step forward, only to trip down the stairs and break his thigh.

"I've fallen down and I can't get up," Voldemort rasped. He feebly grasps for his wand/cane.

Eddie Potter great-great-grandson of Harry Potter raised his magical iBlaster, and incinerated Voldemort's head while moving along with his day.

Anyways... I read somewhere that dementors are wizards that turn into with them having a horcrux, that after one would naturally die is turned into it, which is why you can really kill a dementor.

** I think there was a Greek myth with a similar thought under it - an oracle (?) was asked what she wanted and she pointed at a pile of dust and said she wants to live as many years as there are dust in the pile and her wish was granted, but she forgot to ask for youth. Years later when she was so old that she was nearly as small as a dust particle herself, she was asked what she wants the most - and she replied /''to die''./

I kinda imagine that centuries later in an undying but ever-aging body Voldemort might wisen up and arrive to the same conclusion...
