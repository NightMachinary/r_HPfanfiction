Like the title said, I've reread a couple of older Frozen/HP fics recently, and it's got me craving some more Harry x Disney Princess pairings, in their movies/worlds/stories not at Hogwarts if possible.

Hogwarts AUs just sorta bore me.

Anyways, thanks in advance!


** I've always enjoyed the idea of a Frozen/Harry Potter crossover set in the early 1800s (technically Frozen takes place in the 1840s but there's room to manouevre). Basically instead of locking Elsa up, the King and Queen of Arendelle send her to Hogwarts where she can learn to control her powers. In so doing, Elsa would be the first royalty to attend Hogwarts in centuries, which would garner a lot of interest.

The fic would pick up in media res when Elsa is in her 6th or 7th year. She's a very powerful witch but still has problems with control, with her magic strongly tending towards making ice etc. Napoleon is on the rise and Europe is choosing sides. Suddenly Elsa, heir to a small but wealthy Kingdom and a powerful witch besides, is not just a curiosity but also politically relevant.

Is a good crossover fic, that mixes with a bunch of different shows. Not sure if Lilo is considered a Disney Princess, but Harry looks after her in Hawaii, and ends up working for Five-O. Its a fun story I've read a couple times, that at some point crosses with Five-O, NCIS LA and DC, Bones, and a couple others.

*** And I just finished it after binging the story.

It was just as fun as his other stories in that same vein, I only know the bare bones about the crime dramas used, characters and basic bios of them, but I loved every second.

Not surprising considering it's the guy that wrote Harry Potter: Geth.

**** Yeah, found it to be a lot of fun as well, and I really liked how Harry was able to complete most of cases easily by himself, with the help of stitch. I really liked how they got into more of the psychological issues Harry would of likely faced after the war. It was nice knowing he had Dinozzo, Sully, the psych and others to look after him.

**** Sorry, just an idea I think could work.

Another idea is the Trio helping Snow White overthrowing the Witch Queen.

***** If only these stories existed.

A more violent ending to Snow White with her falling in love with Harry rather than actual Prince Charming coming along and kissing her.

His reaction would be priceless though.
