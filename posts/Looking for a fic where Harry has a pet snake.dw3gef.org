:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for this specific fic that starts during fourth year. Harry has a pet snake and I believe his friendship is still strained with Ron, possibly Hermione as well. Because of this, during the second task the thing he would miss most that gets chosen is this pet snake. I specifically remember him being angry because the water in the black lake is quite cold and could've hurt his pet. It might be a long shot, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to look! I've had a hard time trying to find it on my own lol

In the meantime, any other fics that have Harry with a pet snake are ace if y'all have any recommendations. :)


** Thanks to a Snake linkffn(6926581) is a good fic.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
