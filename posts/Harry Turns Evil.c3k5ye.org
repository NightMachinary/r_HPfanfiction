So, I have read quite a few stories where Harry starts out dark or evil and eventually repents. Or Where he is betrayed but then forgives everyone. What I am looking for is stories where he starts out light and is seduced or turned evil and stays that way. Looking for any non slash recommendations that fit this.

** linkffn(Echoes in the Fog) features a truly Evil!Harry...along with a Grey!Harry and Canon!Harry, who end up in Evil!Harry's universe and try to escape. The Evil!Harry comes from the author's Downward Spiral Saga, Which I've not read, but was reviewed here:

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.

#+begin_quote
  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Canon compliant until the end of DH, but Harry had it enough afterwards. What began as vigilante justice ended in a new dystopia run by the dark Trio.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): I would say all of them got pretty evil by the end, although Harry is still trying to moderating them to a certain degree. But he enjoys looting and war profiteering too.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407): Not necessarily evil, but this Harry is manipulative as hell. Just read how he booted out his immediate boss should give you an idea.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): He can be considered a benevolent tyrant. He brought peace, prosperity, and security to hundreds of millions of Muggles and Wizards. On the other hand, assassination, blackmail, genocide, sabotage, and torture are all among his policy tools.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...
