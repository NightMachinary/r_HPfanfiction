Hadley here! A few of you know me from the Daphne Greengrass editorial I did a few months back. Now I'm back with more HP FanFic analysis, this time taking a look at some of the most cursed content you guys had to offer me!

** Nice video! Honestly found it entertaining, particularly the editing. Although I think that I've found the worst fanfic for a long while. It's called Mother of the brood by FCTSyndrome. Not gonna link because of rule 8. Has Young Harry/Dobby/Kreacher and other awful crap. Literally only read the warnings and got out there quick. Not that you could of shown it due to YouTube regulations.Got to cleanse my soul now.

*** Jesus.. wish I could have included that! Honestly, its a shame about YouTube guidelines, like half of the content on that thread I've had to cut out! That would have definitely made it in
