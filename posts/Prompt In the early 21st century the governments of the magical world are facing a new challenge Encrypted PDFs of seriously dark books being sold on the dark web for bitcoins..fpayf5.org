What will happen if any magical crook with a bit of money stolen from muggles and some digital know-how can get their hands on Magick Moste Evile, Secrets of the Darkest Art and worse?

Can magic get around the challenge of 256-bit encryption and if they do find a way, is anyone going to cause chaos abusing the method?


** I gotta top that; At an uncertain point, /someone/ will just spread the text for free. And then someone will spread *incorrect* version, and it all might turn into three kinds of a mess.

*** Yeah the magical Anarchist Cookbook would be fascinating to see.

/"did you hear that if you drip gorgon blood into the Draught of Damnation it halves the brewing time?"/

/"no way man everyone knows that's a scam, it totally makes it explode"/

/"nah dude that's totally the extra stirs in step 4, some edgy necromancer wannabe added it a few years ago"/

** Maybe a scene of an old auror or unspeakable trying to pass the cryptography using an alohomora and having the computer explode? After this he just convince himself that he needs a more powerful unlocking spell and the rest of the (more sane) agents just ignore him?

And what about muggleborns kids finding the books and daring each other to do the spells, just to become stunned (and horrified) when one or two actually succeed. Kind of want to see a 10 years-old muggleborn child trying to make a horcrux with a terrible amount of success and the dark wizards deciding they were a dark lord and they would follow them. And thus start the adventures of the ten-years-old dark lord billy and his loyal followers the terrible dark-nannys!

** Have you read The Laundry Files by Charles Stross? It's not a HP Fanfic, rather a Civil-Service Cthulhu novel series, but this idea is literally the opening scene of the series.

** But some of them are cursed like the Ring tape, especially if you try to pirate them.

*** Not sure how someone would curse a digital file. After all the file gets completely reconstructed during the decryption process, and the encrypted version that is actually sent over the internet is different for everyone. If it was possible to put a curse on a file like that what else would be possible?

It might completely revolutionize the broom industry, instead of enchanting each broom individually you put the enchantments on a file, copy it to hundreds of micro SDs and put those in the raw unenchanted brooms. Rapid copying of magic allowing for automatic mass production and drastically cutting manual labor, replacing wizards performing enchantments with computers copying and installing them.

You could build "spell guns" where you curse a file to contain a spell like Stupefy, copy the file a thousand times on a card, put that into the gun and it can read one file at a time and essentially has plenty of ammo.

Mass producable devices that allow muggles to download files with spells on them from the internet, place them into their spell guns, and use them. Imagine if your phone had an app that could download and execute household charms. 1 pack of 50 Accios for $4.99 on Google Play Store, spells section.
