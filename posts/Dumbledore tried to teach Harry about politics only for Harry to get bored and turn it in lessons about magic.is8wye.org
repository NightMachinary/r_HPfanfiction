One of the most frequently used plot devices on the Lord WTF Harry trope is that Dumbledore was supposed (for some reason) to teach him about either economy or politics but neglected to do so to make him easier to manipulate (many falls on the reasoning but to each their own I suppose).

Looking for the opposite, in which Dumbledore (either from the goodness of his heart, to fulfill a commitment he assumed or even in some kind of scam) /does/ try to teach Harry about those things but Harry himself is much more interested in learning magic from the greatest wizard alive and promptly does his best to change the lesson plan.


** “Harry my boy, now that you know you're a wizard, you must learn of our world. There are many who would seek to harm or exploit you, so I shall be educating you in the ways of wizarding-“

“Spells? Can I shoot fireballs? Can I turn people into toads? Can I turn /myself/ into a dragon?”

“...customs and politics. Er, yes to all, with enough practice, but we really should talk about your future place in the Wizengamot, and your responsibilities as... why are you making that face?”

“I'm trying - to turn - into a dragon - is it - working?”

Albus deeply regretted not thinking to bring any fire whiskey to this meeting.

*** "Politics? What's is politics to those who can turn into a dragon?"

-

"So, Harry, let's do a little test, you are in the room with another Lord, and you must negotiate with him to support a bill that's going to be voted-"

"I cast Fireball."

"That's not-"

"Middle of the room, Fireball."

"Urg."

-

"Draco, you are going to wake the Dragon! You don't want to /wake the dragon/, do you?"

"What the hell are you talking about, Potter? Have you finally gone insane?"

"*YOU WOKE THE DRAGON!*"
