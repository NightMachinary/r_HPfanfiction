Personally, if I see like 1-2 in a single chapter, that's fine. If the story is really good, I tolerate more, but there's a limit where I cringe and just leave, however.

Worse is when authors don't capitalize names or pronouns.

How much do you all forgive grammar mistakes in fanfiction stories?


** I used to fairly laid back, because we are amateurs, and doing this for fun. And of course, English isn't everyone's first language.

However, after I began writing my own story, and trying extremely hard to get things right, and taking care with my prose, I've gotten much less tolerant. I'm kind of sad, because it has led me to dropping very interesting stories, because of lousy grammar/prose.

I find it's the simple things that annoy me the most. There/their/they're. Your/you're. The wrong use of apostrophe in general.

And using laying, instead of lying, irks me to no end. If Harry's laying on the bed, I'm expecting some eggs!

Tense hopping is a major problem for me. Take care of your s's and d's! Reading a story which keeps switching from past tense to present, drives me up the walls.

Overuse of the ellipsis. There's an author whose constant/compulsive use of the ellipsis is infuriating. They use it like six times in every paragraph. It makes the characters sound like invalids who cannot form a coherent thoughts.

And finally, using words incorrectly. Essentially, not knowing what a word means, and shoving it into a sentence, trying to make a character sound intelligent and well read, and wielding a large vocabulary, by having them use complex words. It almost always fails, and looks even worse when the words aren't correct.

***** Luckily for myself though, I happen to know a professional creative writer who agreed to beta my story for me. Honestly, my writing really is not bad for someone who never has done creative writing before, but after he got through the first bit of the first chapter, and I made the changes he suggested, it really does read so much better.

It was really humbling realizing that, simultaneously, I was better at creative writing than I thought I would be AND worse than I thought I would be. Quite the conundrum.

******* Oh I read a lot. A lot of my mistakes we're switching between passive voice and active voice, using both blonde and blond, which, while technically correct in both cases, blond should be used over blonde in more currant literature.

My other problem was setting up for description without getting descriptive in some cases. An example of what I mean would be I could say a character grimmaced, but I would fail to show how that grimmaced look would look. Things like that.

Most of my mistakes were little intricacies that an experienced writer would know and an inexperienced writer would not know. And making those corrections honestly didn't have me editing the story very much at all, but it really did improve the quality of the the material in question. Edit: and they were all corrections that a program like word would absolutely not catch for you so they are mistakes that would be easy to make for someone who doesn't write for a living.

************* To preface, I'm going fairly AU here, because I'm trying to avoid all the things that fanfiction and canon has beaten to death. As such, Harry's parents were not the good guys. They were both death eaters (won't say how that happened, you'll have to read). They were conspiring to overthrow voldemort and take his place, and were caught for it. When caught and they were killed, they managed to neuter voldemort by using blood magic to seal a large portion of voldemorts power causing him to go into hiding.

The story begins in year 4, with a harry potter that is deeply unpopular in both sides of the political isle. Hated by many for having death eater parents, and hated by death eater families for them trying to mutiny against voldemort. Voldemort wants harry dead due to his parents mutiny, but also needs to take him alive as Harry's blood is the key to reversing the seal on voldemorts magic.

The story will span years 4-6 at Hogwarts and then will move into an open warfare period which will be the final portion of the book. Unlike canon and fanon, Slytherin isn't the only house with death eater families, they are spread out fairly evenly between all houses (always found it odd that canon/fanon made only slytherins death eaters) and all 4 houses also have non death eater families. Harry was sorted into Slytherin and has a very unique mentor.

Harry will be paired with daphne greengrass, and it will be a semi-slow burn. Harry will be very, very intelligent, and also gifted (I have an interesting take on how he is gifted!), but he will /not/ be phenominal cosmic power harry.

Edit:: There will be /no/ horcruxes or prophesies. Voldemort is not immortal, and as such, he will be smarter and more dangerous as he won't be as complacent as an immortal voldemort

*** I want to speak to the large vocabulary thing, because this is often overlooked, and there is a way to do it right. If you want to show off your vocab as a writer, excellent. I love learning new words and playing with them. The best place to use them, however, is outside of dialogue. Use them to describe the scene, the battle, whatever. Your characters can be intelligent without using big words that distract from the story. Intelligent characters can still very much just say “bloody hell” and “Harry, you dolt” when things go wrong without transforming into morons.

** (I'm lumping together spelling and grammar, since usually an issue with one comes with the other tagging along)

Ehhh I'm not sure where on the spectrum I fall. I filter for English-only fics so I do expect them to be written in English with an understanding of English spelling and grammar (even if there's regional differences, those are fine!). An individual error is one thing, consistent errors is another.

I will leave a story if they consistently spell canon names wrong - Alistair, Delores, Lilly, Severous, and Luscious are examples I've run into often enough over the years to remember. Same goes for other canon terms - grab your book or find a copy online to see how it was spelled, look it up on the wiki even.

Editing is a thing, having another person help edit helps a ton. If I'm actually noticing the grammar issues, that means I'm being mentally pulled out of what I'm reading, so if it happens often then I'm not having a good time.

** Depends on the mistakes. Genuine mistakes between two words that could be a simple mistake (in fact just saw this morning using exuberant instead of exorbitant) or the occasional error, fine, no big deal. Willing to deal with more if the story itself is good.

If the story is good, I am willing to even let slide the occasional more egregious error. There was a story I was enjoying despite the constant incorrect use of listing of subjects in a sentence. For instance, they kept saying things like "I and Neville went to ..." or "I, Hermione and Ron ducked ....". These hurt my brain reading but the story was good enough that I just mentally forced myself to read it correctly.

I also do this when people keep switching tenses. That one really annoys me. I dislike present tense to begin with ("Harry goes to the door. He opens it to find Hermione standing there where she then ..."). It just feels wrong narratives speaking. But it is worse when they swap between present and past within the same paragraph. Had one story I gave up on because it was constantly doing this. "Harry goes into the room. He saw Ron sitting there and played some Chess with him. Harry gets up to talk to to Hermione ...." it was unreadable.

** Honestly I'm much more intolerant if it seems the errors stem from sloppy writing and not reading things through than actual mistakes.

Things such as leaving letters out, missing punctuation or a lack of capitalisation drive me up the wall. I also tend to drop fics written in a way that makes it seem translated - the pacing, word order and even expressions tend to be understandable yet very jarring or irksome to read.

** Im fairly laid back, because we're not professional writers at all.

However, I do have a limit.

Using words incorrectly, consistently spelling words wrong, lots of punctuation and grammar mistakes, and capitalization of random words. And when I say this, I mean that it happens many, many, MANY times over the chapter.

It's understandable if English isn't the author's first language, I just can't read the story without wanting to copy it onto a google doc and fix all the grammar mistakes.

And even then, it's mostly gotten a lot better after the first few chapters (the author apparently re-edited a lot).

I used to tolerate a lot, especially because the PJO fandom at its height had SO MUCH terrible writing but some fanfic plots that were actually hella intriguing, and I was younger so fanfics in general seemed cool enough for me to ignore that part of it. But now I'm older, and can't deal with it at all.

** I tolerate wrong homophones and incorrect use of apostrophes more often than foreign expressions (little Harry lives in Surrey, England, not Louisiana, USA, so he doesn't take out the trash) and overall textual mistakes e.g. forgetting quotation marks, lines from different characters in the same paragraph and excessive use of elipses.

Elipses annoy me so much because people replace full stops with them... Sometimes even commas... Or any other punctuation that isn't an interrogation or an exclamation point... It takes conviction away from everything the characters say... Just write like a normal person... This irritates me even more when the line is supposed to be delivered with assertion...

Anyway, everything sort of irks me, but I think structural mistakes are more off-putting than bad grammar.

** I'm pretty pedantic about spotting errors, which means that they tend to stand out to me in a way that disrupts the flow of my reading. However, if it's not too bad - if I don't have to regularly stop and decipher what it was actually saying - and the plot is good, I often go through and do a full proofread of the story (if the author wants that kind of thing, which many of them seem to). I have several stories I'm following that way, including one where I'm an official beta reader, and I'm one of the maintainers for the Nightmares of Futures Past eBook.

So, it's not really a hard and fast rule about which types of errors I allow; it's "How much does this interfere with my reading experience?"

** It honestly kills me when a writer does not put the correct tense for third person or for first person. It's grammatically incorrect, I cannot read this because it's wrong.

Like it infuriates me because if you're a natural English speaker you know what this is. You know how English words are spoken and what their meanings are. It's also really annoying because even if you don't really know how it should be formatted it's such an easy and quick Google search or even a YouTube video, it's like I don't understand why people don't realize the difference between first person and third person.

Not only that but most people learned this in school, so like I don't understand how people can't remember this as well.

I don't know, sorry for my rant but it just bugs the hell out of me.

I can understand minor spelling mistakes or maybe a , wasn't supposed to be where it was put or whatever, but to have the narration of the story so wrong that you can barely read it and is illegible is just ridiculous to me.

I also find it as lazy writing, I mean like come on, you couldn't even be bothered to understand what past and present tense means. I just don't get it.

** It depends on what I'm reading, really. If I'm reading a crack fic, humor or just a general feel good type of thing then it doesn't bother me when there are 2-3 mistakes per chapter (when a chapter is between 7-10k that is). But if it's a fic that is novel-like (that being good plot, range of emotions, good side characters, multiple arcs) then it really throws me off. I can tolerate a couple mistakes here and there throughout the whole thing, maybe 5 to 10? Around that number, but that is only if the mistakes are obviously just that - a mistake. By that I mean if the author has consistently spelled a word correctly but then you come by it again and it's misspelled. It's fine, it happens. Especially when they don't have a beta reader/editor.

But if the author keeps messing up the same word over and over again then, I'm sorry, but I'm dipping. The worst is when they have multiple words that they fuck up constantly.
