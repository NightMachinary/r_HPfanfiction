:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic I read many years ago, at some point Harry inherits an island near Britain when his parents will is finally read. The island is considered an autonomous region under the crown,band Harry's grandfather used the island in WWII as a military base. The manor has an airstrip and hangar containing many aircraft and cars. I think it was a fic where Hermione's father was an SAS officer and that helped harry somehow...
