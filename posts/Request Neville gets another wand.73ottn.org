I never understood why Neville used his father's wand when Ollivander said the wand chooses the owner, I mean okay I do understand why he used it, but still!

He should have gotten another wand, a wand that would have fit him better, maybe he would have been better with magic sooner and became more confident sooner as well.

I'm looking for any and all fics that has this idea, where Neville ends up getting another wand, that works more for him.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash. Neville doesn't have to be the main character, I just want to see it happen in the story.

Would rather not have character bashing.

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing but any other pairing is fine, sorry I just don't like those pairings very much.

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

The story can be as canon as possible or as AU as possible or anywhere in between.

Why should Neville visit a wand shop if he already has a good wand? He would know nothing about wandlore and needing a personalised one.

*** Well his wand from what I remember in the books never really was the greatest, and I think it was because it belonged to his father. Ollivander said that the wand chooses the owner, and the wand didn't choose Neville. I just think if he had gone to Ollivander's earlier and gotten a wand that was suited for him he would have done a bit better with magic. And that in turn would have helped him be more confident.

**** His grandmother was so insistent on him emulating his father that she made him use his wand. He didn't replace it in canon until HBP after it was broken in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.

**** Yes, he would have done better with his own wand but he would not get Ollivander's advice because he never needed to visit that shop.

** Well, this goes more into Neville's personality and the nature of his relationship with his Grandmother. His grandmother is a stern woman who probably misses her son, and projects him onto Neville. She sees it as a legacy for Neville to use. Neville at this point, goes along with what she says, and I can see him wanting some sort of connection with his dad.

In general, Neville's incompetence in fanon is greatly exaggerated to make him seem that much better at the end of the series. He's not good, but he doesn't quite seem like Crabbe and Goyle.

Neville is one of the characters in the series that grows the most. He gains confidence, becomes his own person, and his prowess at magic really reflects that.

*** Oh yeah definitely agree with you on that, he's one of my favorite characters just because he grows so much. I just kind of thought that him having a wand that would fit him better would make him feel more confident sooner rather then later which is why I asked for stories like that.

**** I think that Neville wanted to use his dad's wand. We see how much Harry values his cloak, mostly because it was his dad's before his. I think Neville wanted to use his wand, both to be close to his dad as well as try to live up to him. Also I think it matched him somewhat. If it really didn't connect with Neville at all, I don't think he would have used it.

***** That is a fair point and I agree, I just kind of wish that he had gotten a wand for himself as well. That way he could carry his dad's wand with him while having a wand that was more suitable for him as well.

** Neville got a new wand after the fight in the ministry when his dad's was broken. I think it mentions that his magic improved in some cases in half blood prince

*** Yeah exactly! That's why I thought him getting a new wand earlier would help him, because after his dad's wand is broken he gets a new one and it works better for him.

Also I just love how this has become a discussion instead of people giving me stuff to read that has this, lol.

  The Founders found a way of putting powerful safeguards into their bloodlines. Now, as Harry faces off against the shade of Tom Riddle and the basilisk inside the Chamber of Secrets, the Sorting Hat causes one of those safeguards to activate. The result means Harry Potter is now Salazar Slytherin and the most misunderstood Founder is the Boy-Who-Lived.
