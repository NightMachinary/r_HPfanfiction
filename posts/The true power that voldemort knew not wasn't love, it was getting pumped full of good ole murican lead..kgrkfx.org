Harry takes a gun to school and all the teachers are like "oh? Whats this silly little muggle device?" And harry bullshits them and then he just fucking shoots his way through important events. Troll? Shot to the eye. Stone in the mirror that quirell wants? Liberal allocation of bullets to both said mirror and quirell. Dementors? Patronus is a gun. Goblet of fire? Shoot the fucking goblet. Umbridge wants you to write in your blood? Try writing in her brains on the walls. If you can't beat something with a gun then your gun isn't big enough.
