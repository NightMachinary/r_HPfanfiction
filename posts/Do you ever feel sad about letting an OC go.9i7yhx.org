  it wouldn't make sense for such an OC to show up in other stories.

Why wouldn't it? Unless you have to kill her off, write more stories for her! Or make her a character in an original story. I don't understand why you think you can't. It would probably be more interesting than the same old tired characters who are trotted out over and over again.

** Its part of writing. I write novels in my free time and one of my greatest problem is that I struggle with character deaths. I don't want to kill characters I painstakingly "rose" from a name to this complex, intricate fictional person, even if it would make a great scene - or get the protagonist to really grow/change through the loss.

But on the other side, they are, technically, immortal. Miss 'em? Go back a few pages and there they are, forever "alive" in your text.

And you get the chance for another character to get attached to. A different story, a different set of people, a different adventure.

** In your particular example, you can always continue writing stories in the reality you have created, if the OC is still alive in the end.

OC deaths are different, simply avoiding it if your intuition says that things will go a certain way would just feel off.

** You start to truly love your OCs because they are your characters and you know everything about them. There is story lines to them that's not in the writing cause it would take too much time, but you know them. They become these babies to you, even the bad ones in a way. When I write I don't actively decide things it kind of plays out in my head like a movie, so when there is a death I can't just decide no I'm not letting them die. I literally can't write it another way if that's what happens. I've tried to kind of fight what's in my head on some things in my fic/the book I'm working on and it just keeps circling back. I think the worst part of an OC dying is writing it. You love that character, you made it and are proud of it, and now you're going to end it. You brought them into that world and they won't get that happy ending. I do like happy endings though and for the most part I like to believe a majority of my OCs get their happy endings.
