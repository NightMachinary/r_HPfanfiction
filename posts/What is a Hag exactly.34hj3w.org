The only canon line we have is that

#+begin_quote
  "The hag is a child-eating creature of human appearance, though likely to have more warts than the average witch."
#+end_quote

We also know hags:

- can cast rudimentary magic (like trolls)
- move freely in diagon and knockturn alleys
- move freely in Hogsmeade

So is there any fan cannon to draw on here?

Are there male hags?

Why do they let child eating beings wander through their shopping districts?

What sort of spells can they cast?


** I know this is going to sound nit picky... but I just felt I should share because the mental image is hilarious.

fan canon: source materials and such.

fan cannon: A large bore artillery piece that Harry uses to deport groupies from his lawn.

** Now, I don't know about officially in Harry Potter, but in D&D and Pathfinder, they are adult's of a beautiful female exclusive race called changelings. Changelings stay young forever, unless they become evil, which turns them into hideous old hags, and in return gain great magical powers.

*** You know, I might just use this as inspiration within one of my fics (maybe even make a new one just for it), though Harry Potter already has a beautiful temptress human sub-species with the veela (I'm using sub-species in the scientific sense, since veela can breed with humans, at least magical ones, much like goblins and giants are able to).

**** In pathfinder this is a changeling: [[https://alzrius.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/changeling_girl.jpg]] And this is a Hag: [[http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2014/121/d/9/storm_hag_by_rhineville-d7gr3qe.jpg]]

Just to give you a picture reference.

** Not a creature often considered, there is a nifty bit in one of the Alexandra Quick stories where a hag gives Alex some trouble.

They are magical and can be mistaken for witches, but I don't believe they can cast spells. They are known for having sharp teeth and claws like iron. I imagine they're allowed in magical shopping areas to keep an eye on them.

** I /think/ hag is one of those stereotypical witches with the green skin and warts. Maybe they can't use wands and that's why they're always depicted brewing potions or flying on brooms.
