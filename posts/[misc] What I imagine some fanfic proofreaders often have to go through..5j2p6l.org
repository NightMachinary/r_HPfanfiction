** I have never been as frustrated with humanity as I get while proofreading for competitions. I give them all the credit for actually writing something, but omg it makes my brain bleed. There's been a few that I've had to almost entirely rewrite.

*** I was a beta for someone a long time ago and it basically wasn't even English. I think he spelled Dumbledore as "Bublefore" for something equally as ridiculous.

**** Sometimes the particular form of the misspellings makes me wonder if people aren't writing by computer dictation.

It's either that or a lot of this fanfiction is written by people who have only seen the films and just can't be bothered to look up how names or in-universe terms are spelled.

**** I have huge respect for betas, but I learned pretty quickly after I started writing fanfic that it's definitely not something I could see myself doing and enjoying.

** I've gotten to a point where I can recognize ffnet authors based on the mistakes they make and their horrid formatting. For the love of god, I appreciate the effort, but if you can't even properly create a plural noun...
