Are there any good Tom Riddle centric fics that aren't slash nor Hermione/Tom? Can be time travel or just an AU, doesn't really matter. Preferably any fics with Harry in them as well, but if not it doesn't matter. Thanks!

  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

Some of these like Civil Disobedience and A Mentor's Burden are fun and light hearted, but if you read Diablerie you might want to check the tags first because it gets pretty dark.

*** Thanks a lot, I actually read the beginning of Diablerie and liked it which is why I'm posting this. Usually I have no problem with extremely dark fics but reading about Tom paying for some dreamless sleep potions using his body, even though it's not in detail, bugged me a lot. Maybe I'll give it another try but that's just something that ruins fics for me.

  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around. Series of short drabbles and snippets into the life of Tom Riddle, star pupil, future Transfigurations master, and president of the Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore Fan Club (the APWBDFC, for short).

  Moody reclined in his chair, his prosthetic scratched over the floor. “What year is it, Riddle.”It wasn't phrased like a question, maybe that was why Tom finally answered.“September.” Tom clipped out coldly. “1942. You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.
