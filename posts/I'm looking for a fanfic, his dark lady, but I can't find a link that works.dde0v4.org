As stated above I know the story existed once but any link to it I can find is dead, either removed or doesn't work


** Do you know who was the author? what pairing? was it on ff.net at any point? Those would both be helpful in finding it.

** also, the right flair for your post would be "What's that fic?" as you are looking for a certain fic

requests are for requesting recommendations like "give me your best hp fics"

*** I would say that maybe this flair fits better. They know exactly the fic, they just are trying to find a copy. So "What's that fic?" doesn't fit because they know what the fic is called.

** You can download it somewhere, safely. I think you can find it on fictionhunt or something and download via the epub option. If you then download an app like lithium you can read downloaded fics in said app. Spoiler: it's really not that great of a fic.

It has like a single smut scene with an oc and uses the neglected harry for his brother the BWL trope with a lot of bashing.

Oh and Harry is a stereotypical Slytherin as a Gryffindor would see them and he's friends with Snape (yuck).

I know what it's like to wonder about the quality of a deleted fic. Don't waste your time on this one. The only potentially promising thing this had is a female Riddle but it got nowhere before the story got abandoned.
