** I wouldn't call any troll fic 'the worst' as it's intentionally written to be bad. And I though Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles was extremely well done.

I'm always a little uneasy about threads like this, fearing that one day I'll see one of my own in a 'worst of' thread. But I saw this one yesterday (for reasons) and truthfully I would like to burn it with fire. There are worse out there no doubt, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12505751/1/Hermiones-desire][THIS]] one is a diabolical waste of the internet on so many levels. And I don't think it's a troll fic. The only good thing about it is that it's mercifully short. And it's not MA though it claims to be.

*** I've only got as far as "I am Lord Ragok Mr Potter. King of the Goblins of the United Kingdom. Have a seat," Ragnok says.

Then I had to take a break.

Now, on the plus side, the speech is at least quoted properly with its comma and all. Skipping down to get to 'a goblin says' instead of 'Ragnok says' and 'Harry says' (or asks, or at one point clarifies), we see they have the capitalisation down.

But Ragnok, bless him, signs his letter 'King of Britain's Goblins', then introduces himself thusly. I think the goblin has issues.

So, going on then.

That's quite a.... long list of vaults there.

And a long list of... other things. I'd tell you what other things those were, but then I'd have a long list.

Mainly, the problems are that the author's notes have made it into the story, a lack of emotional expression in dialogue - I do not mean synonyms for 'says', I mean ways of putting words together that convey excitement or worry or happiness - and a lack of pacing. The main plot point of the books is wiped out in a paragraph. And Lucius Malfoy just steps in with a lack of reaction. It's very flat in style.

I feel the use of present tense is also off-putting but that's a personal preference. And, get this, it's consistently used.

I get the strong feeling this is either a teenage writer (in which case, good luck to them) or someone just having fun writing word vomit power fantasies because they can. The strong impression is in fact of a teen. The lack of emotions other than very barely described anger and the lack of facial expressions, body mannerisms, all of that scream 'teen' to me. Though the username suggests not?

I, too, did not make it to chapter two.

The writing is fine. It even has its moments of transcendence and artistry. But from a plot perspective, it is a straight canon rehash from a pointless perspective that drones on and on. I found the plot so dull that I skipped around in it so I suppose I can't say I've really read the whole thing but for the last 30 chapters or so. I came for the Snily endgame and found it.... Fine, I guess? But the characters feel like they are just being put through their paces to arrive at this unsurprising end.

**** Sorry, but I REALLY think that fic is a bad one.

It's not like "My Immortal" or anything like that, but the entire thing is poorly-executed, badly-paced and lifelessly written, with characters that don't act believably at all, really blatant author-rants, M. Night Shymalan-worthy plot twists, and ideas that sound cool and clever at first glance but don't hold up to thirty seconds of actual thought. Add to it that the main characters are all horribly unlikeable, and that parts of the story are used to mock canon -- canon that the author admits to not having bothered to read properly.

Worse is that the storytelling is severely lacking: as a MANIFESTO this might be more entertaining than most but as a STORY it falls flat.

** Harry Potter and the perfect 4 stories of HHr ships by Anonymous3675. Here's the summary: "This is about my versions on how I would prefer H/Hr ships to be happen and no other events should be necessary because what you H/Hr shippers don't realize is that THERE ARE NO DIVORCES NOR ANNULMENTS IN THE WIZARDING WORLD.. AT ALL, THEY ARE STUCK WITH THEIR FIRST HUSBAND AND/OR WIFE FOR LIFE. GET THAT THROUGH YOUR THICK HEADS. Sorry for yelling and forgive me for doing so."

The author then explains that it'd be impossible for Harry not to have a soul bond with Ginny due to their ordeal in the Chamber of Secrets and that in order for Harry and Hermione to get together, Ron and Ginny must die. In the first story, the author has Ron and Ginny die in which Harry and Hermione go to the Burrow afterwards. And you know what Mrs. Weasley's reaction is to her youngest two children being killed? She says that Hermione is Harry's "best girlfriend"! During this, Mr. Weasley chuckles. Mind you, their two youngest children just died! I'm not sure of this is a troll or not but good grief!

#+begin_quote
  It's a Harry Potter fanfic, just like My Immortal. It's So Bad, It's Good, just like My Immortal, it has extreme Canon Defilement, just like My Immortal. However, the two are different in one key detail: whereas My Immortal was (ostensibly) written by a Wangsty 13 year old girl, this was (ostensibly) written by an Ax-Crazy 13 year old boy.

** "Its all about Hermione" linkffn(3230534) is truly horrible. Let's see--Hermione is a Mary Sue who is super popular and after Ron and Ginny hurt her feelings, leaves Hogwarts (but not before buying all her friends--which the author refers to as "the females"--lots of gifts). Hermione goes back to her original school (I swear it was originally called Manchester United, but now seems to be Birmingham Manchester) where she takes dozens of magic classes because the whole school uses a giant time-turner. Massive Weasley bashing ensues and Hermione comes back to Hogwarts to find some mates, because this is also a creature fic.
