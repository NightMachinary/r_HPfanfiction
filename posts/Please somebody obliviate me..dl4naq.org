I had misfortune of reading a shit. I never read something so awful. I read half of first chapter. Please somebody erase those 2 min from my mind. P.S. Don't dare to read it. linkffn(13356947)


** As much as I enjoy this subreddit this sort of post bothers me. Criticizing someone's writing is fair. Even having a laugh at the expense of popular stories can be okay.

But pointing and laughing at someone for no real reason besides the lulz and sending others to join in the jokes isn't funny. There is enough punching down going on these days. No reason to drag this person who seems to be trying.

** Wow. If this is a genuine fic, you have stumbled upon the masterpiece of "so bad, it's good." This is the first story I've read with Harry/Winky sex scenes.
