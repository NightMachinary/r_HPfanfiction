Dystopian in a way where being associated to anything ‘dark' will land you in Azkaban, or something of that variety.

Basically ‘Anything but Slytherin' but longer and not a one shot.

**** George Orwell wrote a book called 1984 which famously describes a country with extreme one party control where everything is regulated and thought crime exists.

Since then, that type of society or government is called an Orwellian State (North Korea is an example. It's been said of North Korea that they used 1984 as a guidebook).

Highly recommended reading.
