Voldemort's warped sense of honor? Or self preservation maybe?

Or maybe they know that's a line no one will accept?

--------------

Any fics with evil (truly evil) death eaters will be well received. Completed fics even more so.


** Wizarding world is far too small. They can't just go around destroying societal institutions. Lot of fanfics like to imagine it as huge & epic war, but in canon there are less than 10k witches and wizards (including kids and the elderly).

So no - everyone needs medical attention.

** It makes sense though. Death Eaters need medical care too, and since their goal is to take over the magical world they hardly want to destroy its infrastructure needlessly. They're evil, not stupid.

  Post HBP. HHr. Harry and Hermione's odd behavior during their 6th year explodes into a maelstrom of chaotic, bitter emotions, caused by a strange 'illness.' Help comes from a young, orphaned girl who is much more than she appears.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
