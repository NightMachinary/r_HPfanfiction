Title says it all. Can't remember much else.

Edit: Might have been fem!harry and she had long hair... or maybe that was Hermione... I think Bellatrix who also had long hair (mentioned by Sirius, I think) was somewhat sane in it because of magic adoption... or the adoption part might have been some other fanfic.

As you can tell, I really can't bloody remember and every fanfic I've read is working against me.

*** My memory is very muddled, so I'm not sure if it's this fanfic or another, but I think I remember someone commenting/mentioning/narrated about Dumbledore's beard to prove a point about how great of a wizard he is. But yeah, I really can't remember much except the magical power = hair bit.
