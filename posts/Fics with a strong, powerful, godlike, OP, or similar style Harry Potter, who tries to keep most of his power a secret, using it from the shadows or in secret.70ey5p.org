Interested in finding fan fics that have the whole strong, overpowered, godlike, super powered Harry, except that I am specifically looking for ones where the general public, friends and acquaintances, and even perhaps his close friends, do not realize he is so strong. He keeps his talents and abilities hidden and uses them in the shadows, or behind the scenes, or in secret.

Perhaps people think there is some other strong wizard out there (when its actually him). Perhaps people are simply confused or astounded by what has happened when in reality he worked the situation from the shadows. Perhaps he uses a secret identity. Or maybe he just uses his power to prank people for shits and giggles. He's still strong, but no one has any true idea how strong and he keeps it that way if he can.

Point is, he's OP, but not openly so. No slash if possible. Romance preferred but not required. Lemons or M+ rated themes fine, and even welcome.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the game)

Harry levels up and becomes stronger in certain types of magic (mainly wandless). He tries to make sure nobody knows how strong he is and even adapts a vigilante alter ego of sorts.

*** Sounds good, although I have a question. It says only year 1 and 2 complete and yet is at 317k words. I don't mind super long fics but I also don't like sluggish fics that take FOREVER to get Harry old enough to allow for romance or more interesting aspects of life, not to mention it's sounding like it's not remotely close to complete and may take ages to get there. Any feedback?

**** No romance yet, but it wasn't too slow for me. There are some less interesting parts, but Harry does not become overpowered to quickly. I have to say that the start is more sluggish than the rest.

** One that sort of fits is the Travel Secrets series by E4mj. It's not finished, and the updates are scarce, but there is quite a bit up already. The premise is that Harry goes back in time to try to fix everything with really OP memory, skills, and magical power, but he has to keep it a secret from everyone. I enjoyed it. linkffn(9622538)

With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing.

**** It's because this story is the current third rail in fanfic. People love it or hate it, for the reasons you mentioned.

I would say that linkffn(2107570) fits the OP request, as well as the oft mentioned Make a Wish trilogy. Blot writes a bunch of fics that fit this general mold, of varying quality.

However, if you want true Vizier style "power behind the throne" fics, I don't know many. Search up "grey Slytherin Harry" fics and you will likely have a strong correlation.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
