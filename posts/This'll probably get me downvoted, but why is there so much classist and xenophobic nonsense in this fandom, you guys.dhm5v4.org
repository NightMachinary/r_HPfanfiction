Like, I doubt the mostly teenage or college aged writers in the HP fandom are all a bunch of right wingers, so I don't understand how they don't recognize the toxicity of certain ideas that are so prevalent in fics, like those with generations of privilege being better by default, or Muggle persecution being acceptable because of "reasons", or preserving ones "culture" being more important than somebody else's persecution.

These arguments that are used constantly by real life racists and xenophobes and people who think the poor should just stop being poor get thrown around in so many, many fics completely unironically, and this particular fandom seems to give rise to such fics more than literally any other.

Not to shame or anything, because this is fandom and fans should be allowed to engage with the material anyway they want. I just want to know where all of this is coming from.


** I've never liked Pureblood Culture^{TM} fics for this very reason, but I understand the appeal for some people. It's a fantasy of becoming rich and powerful and one of the select few, having unlimited money, properties and titles that make you better than everyone else around. Rap and hip-hop industry made billions selling this dream. "Started from the bottom, now we're here". Harry started from the cupboard under the stairs, but now he's Hadrian, dressed in the finest acromantula robes and accepted by cream of the crop, sneering at the mudbloods and the poor. He still remembers who he used to be, though. He might, for example, help poor Weasley twins financially if they are completely loyal to him over their own family. That means Hadrian is generous and just.

There's an injustice, but the fantasy is not to change the unjust system but benefit from it.

** I'd assume a good part of it is due to many fanfic authors being rather young and/or not familiar with classism as a concept.

Also, as many authors and readers are US based, their main association to “Lord” and similar titles is fiction, because they don't have a long history of royalty shaping society. In a way, US society seems to stratify mostly based on wealth, whereas in Europe family and heritage plays a bigger role.

Finally, most fanfiction is very derivative of other works of (fan)fiction. People read something, identify with the character in the more powerful position and insert similar scenes in their work, without relating it to their own position in society.

Bingo. They also don't even understand the subtle ways that classism is written into canon, and just map American ideals onto the story. The understanding of the Dursley family is an easy tell. The average American reader sees them as staggeringly middle class. Whereas the Dursley's are, at most, pretending to be middle class but would be rejected as such by their peers. The Dursley's being so /incredibly common and normal/ is an actual indication of what their status is: commoners.

Rowling wrote class divides into her stories incredibly well that fly over the head of everyone who thinks the British class system is just the character page of Downton Abbey.

** Some fanon tropes that people like to play with would have shitty real life implications. Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor, "family magic," etc. Who would want snot-nosed little Lord Potter being able to tell them what to do just because of who his dad was? It can be fun to read, though!

Part of this is canon, too--like, canonically, some of the arguments that real-life slaveowners historically made against freeing slaves happen to be true for house elves ("Hermione you moron, house elves are happy being slaves! They wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they weren't!"). So that's... kinda just there.

Then there's the Slytherin problem. If you want to use Slytherin characters and not have them just all be jerks as they are canonically ("Time to fight Voldemort! Not you, Slytherins"), you can either go with The One Good Slytherin approach ("Hi Harry, my name is Daphne, I only act like an ice queen because I don't want the others to find out I'm not racist!"), or you can try to rehabilitate the house as a whole.

Which means either changing their canon attitude, which can be a tough sell, or trying to make it sound more reasonable. If you go for the latter, well, it turns out most of the arguments you might use to try to make Slytherin attitudes sound reasonable also get used in real life. Really the one exception I can think of is the occasional Statute of Secrecy-based argument, since it doesn't correspond to any real-world thing.

** This is going to make me sound like Nagato, but oh well.

As a rule, people don't generally have a problem with power and unfairness unless its directed at them. The cold hard truth of human beings, whether magical or not, is that they only understand and oppose such behavior when it has been turned against them in some form or another (this is a generalization, but empathy is the name of the game).

As an example, Hermione is strongly opposed to the house-elf situation (which admittedly is a bit vague on certain characteristics I would want to know). This is almost certainly a reflection of her own anger towards the classicist nature of her blood status and being lesser merely no matter what her qualifications. Contrast that with Harry - frankly, he only has a problem with the werewolf situation because he is friends with Remus Lupin (i.e. my dad was his friend, and so I am too, plus he is really nice to me and more competent). Look at his problems with Snape's memories though - Snape was bullied, ganged-up on, and mocked publicly very much like what Dudley and possibly the Dursleys did to him as a kid. And Harry for the first time lost confidence in his father, possibly the only time we ever see that occurring.

To quote Plutarch: “Prosperity is no just scale; adversity is the only balance to weigh friends.”

Ron in that scene was 12-years old if I remember correctly and he simply mentioned, when the topic was on squibs, that he has a squib relative, who is accountant and who his family do not talk much about. That does not necessarily say those three facts are actually related (that they don't talk about him because he is a squib). There isn't any context on that given and you don't know.

Also, my point was that you can find bigotry in the most shocking places sometimes, and the Weasleys, the example given for the most progressive purebloods in the story, sometimes use very problematic language, because their progressive nature seems to come from curiosity and innate kindness, but in many ways they're also ignorant and happy to continue so.

** I agree - there's a surprising ratio of "Harry embraces Pureblood Culture" to "Revolutionary/Major Change in Wizarding Society" fics. Frankly, canon has some major failings when it comes to the problematic status quo - yes, there's the obvious bigotry towards muggleborn/half-bloods, but we also see a ton of it towards those that aren't fully human (half-giants, werewolves, house elves, goblins, etc), there's no indication how much of the power is held by the old pureblood families vs the 'common' people, and there's a stunning amount of darkness in the society (eg - Azkaban, the way the government behaves, etc). The conclusion of the series involving no real upheaval to society and instead seeming to think that the status quo was really fine all along doesn't really sit right with me.

So I'd have expected more fics where instead of accepting that, there were more sweeping changes - breaking the power of the rich and entrenched pureblood nobility, for instance, or actually doing something to free house elves. Instead, the default is more "actually, hereditary power is good if you're not evil, so it doesn't matter that it's structurally unfair! Oh, and the house elves love being enslaved so you just have to treat them a little better and it's all good :) ".

Part of it might be a power fantasy - to be fair, the series does include that from the start (he does discover that instead of a nobody, he's actually a rich, famous, and important person in this wonderful new world). Combining that with ideas of historical british nobility make it easy to want to add to Harry's power by giving him a powerful position in society - and at that point, taking it away would be counterproductive for some. But the sheer number there is kinda surprising - I wouldn't expect most people in the fandom to think that hereditary power to that degree is /good/, and yet that's the message many of the fics have (stated or not), because of how Harry acts/does things.

Just a long winded way of agreeing with you ;)

And frankly, the kind of people willing to do it are frequently not the kind you enjoy having over for dinner, or having long discussions with, unless you have similar views. It's almost invariably a violent process, messy, unpleasant, and often a horrible failure or a short-lived and equally horrible success.

Starfox does a decent job of it, I think, in Divided and Entwined. Which I gave up about halfway through, because although it was well written, I wasn't enjoying reading about realistic war. And it's no coincidence that bossy, forceful, black-and-white-morality Hermione is leading the revolution.

Methods of Rationality has a protagonist who's dissatisfied enough for revolution, but too young yet to pull it off; it's likely no coincidence that many readers can't stand him.

The current Book Club entry has a relatively minor revolution, and I say "minor" because it doesn't upend the treatment of house elves, werewolves, etc, but rather restores a bunch of old traditions. And it still involves a lot of nastiness.

It's pretty fucking hard to learn why something is bad if you don't even look at why it exists, so these people are just writing it into their stories because ‘That's how it is in JK's world' even though the whole point of this exercise is to change JK's world.

** I agree with the opinions already mentioned but I think it's also partly attributeable to the fact that the pureblood ideology plays a big part in the whole book series and if you want to include the Death Eaters as people who associate with Harry they have to have something in common. Grey!Harry usually depicts a Harry who is neither on the light side nor on the dark side (even though he tends to be on the darker side most of the time) but for that he needs to agree with at least some of the views Death Eaters have, which most of the time is that "pure bloods are better" since torturing people sounds even worse. And in many fics, people don't want to make it sound as racist as it is in the books, therefore they base that ideology on made up facts. Like pureblood wizards have more powerful magical cores, or only purebloods can lay claim on a lordship title for reasons. Or that muggleborns don't understand the old ways which are very important to keep because otherwise the wizard population loses power or something like that.

HP is a completely different world with completely different rules, the whole thing is fantasy. Some of these stories may be people writing to get an idea of how it COULD work to see if they really believe in it themselves. Some just think there should be more explanation to WHY purebloods think they're better than others. That isn't actually explained in the series beyond the fact they've all been magical for so long. I've seen a lot of stories with a focus on the way Purebloods live resulting in magically weaker children, usually due to inbreeding because they have a much smaller pool of potential partners to choose from. As far as I can tell there are just as many of them as there are stories about pureblood culture. These authors are trying to expand on the world Rowling created, but to do that they need to explain it, whether they choose to change it or not. I see a fair few stories trying to come up with reasons for the blood traitor slur as well, there are various explanations for that but they all tend to tie into pureblood culture in some way as it's an insult given by purebloods to purebloods. We know in HP that the Malfoys consider the Weasleys blood traitors but it's never actually explained why. It's implied that it's because of their acceptance of muggleborns and Arthur's fascination with muggles, especially as it's used for others as well, but it's never actually explained. There are a lot of issues with how Rowling created the Wizarding World, and I think it's just easier for some writers to try and explain things than change them, especially younger writers who don't actually know how these ideals would work in real life.

They will definitly look down on someone who is the first person in generations who attempt to study at a university. My biggest problem is with the argument of preserving the culture.

And if it did have such a narrower range, I wouldn't necessarily consider that a good thing. Echo chambers are dangerous things and it is healthy to interact with and be confronted by political viewpoints which are different to one's own. Such experiences are an important means to avoiding the situation where you think everyone with a different opinion to you is "toxic" etc.

**** What HP has that makes it unique is the sheer /mass/ of works written for it. Last I checked on FFN it blew the next most populated one (Naruto) out of the water by a wooping ~400.000 fics.

Next is the mostly demographic agnostic presence of Harry Potter in our cultures. Harry Potter has more books printed than the Bible. It has been the most read YA novel of my generation (born early 90s) with no contest. There are so many demographics in this fandom because the base of readers and writers has such a broad spectrum of people.

Next I would question if it truly is a “vast majority“ of fics, or if you just fell into one of the many bubbles of genres and themes within the fandom to get to this conclusion.

It may also depend on which ideas and ideologies you mean specifically. It starts with the Death Eaters, of course. Unapologetic, genocidal fascists with incredible potential for violence. It ends with the casual acceptance of love potions and the enslavement of an entire species by the entire society. There is a great article somewhere that talks about how fucked up the world of HP actually is. Moral grey areas are quickly found within it.

Its not a far stretch to build onto the grimdark that sleeps under the veneer of a YA series. I'm mot suprised fanfiction would do so regularly.

  I'm not sure why you would expect the HP fandom (or any fandom) to have a narrower range of political viewpoints than the population at large.
#+end_quote

I would argue that the HP fandom /does/ have a narrower range of political viewpoints than the population at large, at least in what's written - and in a much more conservative direction. Now, there are a few fics that stand out of course - but as individuals. If we look at the larger trends, what do we tend to see? In my experience, there are two main approaches that pop out of the fanfic community.

First is the canon adjacent - in this one, we tend to see less of a look at society and to take the 'status quo is fine' from canon. I would classify that world as fairly conservative, given what we see from canon - but it's not that obvious or important to the work, of course.

The second is those that look to expand the WW a bit - and those tend to have a focus on pureblooded culture. There are a /ton/ of fics that have Harry gaining a hereditary house seat on the Wizengamot, having society be dominated by the ancient pureblooded houses, experiencing that older culture - and having him get closer and closer to that.

In contrast, there are much fewer fics that have a large societal change/upheaval aspect to them. There's a lot of obvious deficiencies in canon there - not just muggleborn and half-bloods, but magical creatures of all sorts are heavily discriminated against, and the government/society has massive issues (eg - Azkaban, a lack of legal protections, summary executions, etc). Those lend themselves easily to reform - but in my experience, that's a much smaller minority than the Harry Power Fantasy and Pureblood/Noble FF.

That's not a wide range of political viewpoints - that's representing (and not in a negative way, if Harry embraces and does good things) a society that we would consider quite reactionary. Most readers/writers of HP FF would, I assume, not be in favor of a world filled with hereditary nobility holding most or all the power and wealth - and yet that's often what people have for Harry, without reforming it (or only making tepid reforms). Is that problematic to have as a setting? Of course not. It can have some fascinating implications and conflicts - but I wouldn't agree that it doesn't portray (in the aggregate) a rather narrow viewpoint, even if unintentionally.

** I have never seen or heard these arguments before, which is odd, since I've read lots and lots of things. I'll hazard a guess and say that it's probably that I insta-drop anything with stupid reasoning or logic (something I treasure a /lot/ in fanfiction, right behind consistency).

I will say, even if I would never go as far as actual persecution, the need to preserve the culture is something that is very real (in the real world) and something that many authors just brush off as unimportant. It is a very true fact that when bigger cultures start "invading" (metaphorically) smaller ones, it's usually a one sided fight, with the small culture being completely decimated at the end.

*** Sure, but generally when the people who are clearly in power in a society are saying things like "we only want to preserve our culture", what they actually mean is "go back to your country, hur dur!"

And it's very clear in canon that if Malfoy et al hadn't been stupid enough to go around getting caught being all murder-y, they'd have held onto their power for generations and generations.

*** It's the fact that its for fun that baffles me. Rich aristocrats wanting to preserve their culture by putting down the underprivileged masses are generally not the average person's idea of a protagonist. Like, there's no automatic association between "hero" and person who disses someone because they didn't call them "Hadrian" or "Lord Potter Peverell" in the exact tone or voice that's socially acceptable in that fictional universe. I'd understand if a few stories were like this, or if the story had the antagonist as central to it, or even if the MC were an actual grey character whose motivations we're supposed to empathize with while still deploring their actions, but that's not the case with most of them.

**** Potentially pertinent quote:

#+begin_quote
  “Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.”
#+end_quote

Fanfiction is escapism (as is HP generally), and people generally enjoy imagining a life for themselves where they gain access to the elite. In a way, that's what HP canon is: imagining being one of a privileged few who get to be born with special powers and get inducted into this amazing world which is so much better than the world everyone else occupies. A huge part of HP's appeal is the "wishing you got to go to Hogwarts" element.

So it's not surprising that some fanfic extends that same theme to wealth and social status, not just magic. It's a fairly popular theme in fiction generally. Fundamentally all these Lord Potter fics speak to the same impulse as people who enjoy reading Jane Austen novels, only with a focus on power rather than marrying well.

I have read many offensive shit that was/is being recomended in this sub, but I also noticed the backlash too, people actually coming out and mentioning the problema with said fics, etc...

What I am trying to say is that I believe what you mentioned is Just a reflection of The world we now live in...tem years ago people would think twice before voucing some disturbing opinions, but now not only they think It is your problem If you are offended, but they also feel free to either gaslight you ir attack you...

In ASOIAF people writing fics usually are hardcore shippers and the main political problem is slut shaming.
