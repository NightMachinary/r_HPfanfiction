:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I don't remember all the details but no matter how much I look I can't seem to find this fic! I would have read it probably around 2010 on fanfiction.net

Plot was that Harry was diagnosed with a rare form of magical terminal disease that is extremely rare and genetically passed down. Snape was familiar with it due to losing his... I think both Mum and sister? To the disease in the past. Harry then has to live with Snape so that he can monitor his condition.

This may or may not be the same fic but I think at some point Snape gives Harry a dragon egg which hatches to be a crystal or glass dragon? I believe it was slow burn SS/HP but I can't be 100% sure.

In the last chapter, Harry sits on the steps to Hogwarts and writes a letter explaining that he managed to survive to adulthood but Snape had passed away from the same illness that Harry has, but that Harry has managed to live a fulfilling life and is ready to accept whatever happens.

There's a final additional chapter which is a note from the author's friend (I believe the author used their first and last name) and explained that in a twist of fate, the author of the fic had passed away from cancer not long after finishing the fic. They said that they wanted to update people so that they would understand why the profile was inactive for so long, but also that they (the friend) would try to take over the account a little and post some of their own fiction to keep the account alive, even though it would be in a completely different fandom.

If anyone can help me find this I would be eternally grateful!! I try to find it every year or so and yet have never been able to find it again!


** Was it linkffn(Had I Known by Kayly Silverstorm)?

Btw Harry is friends with vampires, centaurs, and some secret assassin organization if that helps.

** linkao3(5372018) is not it, but it is pretty close. Fem!Harry has a terminal brain cancer. Not half-bad, but unfinished.

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.

** I don't think this is it, but it has some similarities to what you're describing ... I know the current author adopted it from another author who abandoned it.

** Hi! Just saw this thread and Milgarion's At The End of All Things certainly reminds me of what you're looking for.
