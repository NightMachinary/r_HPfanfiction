So, pretty much a continuation from my post here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/kl0710/harry_not_being_a_simp/gh8woo9/?context=3]]

Does anyone know of any stories where Harry is rejected by a girl he has an interest in, but said girl, whether it be years after or still during their Hogwarts years, comes to realize she lost out massively?

Alternatively, are there stories where the girl is jealous and is trying to keep her emotions in check? IIRC there was one where Harry began dating a normal Daphne Greengrass --to the point where his social circle accepted her and they were going on dates in the Three Broomsticks-- but Hermione was envious? I remember one scene where she was disappointed that Harry was asking for her advice on asking a girl out in the library, hoping he'd ask her, and that resulted in Harry and Daphne's dating.

For obvious reasons, I think Cho and Ginny would feature a lot in stories like these, but the more lesser-used the girl, the better (Ooh! I can imagine a story where Katie Bell is trying to flirt/ask out Harry, and Alicia and Angelina run background interference for her to better her chances, much to other girls' collective annoyance).

I expect Reptilia28's challenge will have a few of these elements, but unless there's a lot of trope subversion going on, no recommendations from that pool, please -- it's really just the same, unoriginal hash.

So... do any of you kind folks have any suggestions?


** linkffn(Casting Shadows; Surroundings; Blame it on me by Dorothea Greengrass; Novocaine; His angel);

Casting Shadows has what you asked for but it is a very small part of the fic

Surroundings is the fic that you mentioned with hermione

Blame it on me is part of a series that revolves around the exact premise that you asked for and I recommend that you check out the authors other works

Novocaine sort of has this but its more Ginny realizing that she doesn't want what being with Harry entails

His angel again sort of does what you asked for but it applies more towards Ron and Hermione's friendship with Harry though it is hinted at being a bit romantic in hermione's case

I would say that you should dive into haphne fics as they usually have some sort of jealous ex involved be it Harry's or Daphne's

  Starts off from the Quidditch world cup, Harry finds a more important reason to fight for and that sometimes, a fairytale or legend is a lot more than it seems. Discontinued. Sorry.
