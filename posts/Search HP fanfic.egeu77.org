Hiya guys ! I need help to find an HP fanfic I read long ago. Hope you can help me !

So like I said, it's a HP fanfic where Harry is locked up in Azkaban for (I think) having killed the Dursley. Some years later, (5 if I'm not mistaken) Dumbledore comes in Azkaban asking for help in order to defeat Voldemort. Everybody is still convinced Harry is guilty but they don't have a choice in the matter. So Harry accepts to help them if he can stay in Grimmauld place.

I also think Ron became an Auror and there is an OC. Young Aurors need to learn the Unforgivable by practicing on Azkaban prisoners. Harry gained the respect of the others prisoners by never giving up and not wanting the others to suffer the Doloris curse.

Well, I think that's it. Not much but I hope you'll be able to help.

Btw, sorry for my very bad English, it's not my mother tongue... ^{^}

Thanks guys !
