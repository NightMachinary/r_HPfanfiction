I recently read a story where one of the characters (an auror) had the ability to bypass Occlumency shields and put the person in a mindscape where the two view the person's memories (in the story the auror was an interrogator and he was interrogating Harry, who was a death eater). Luna also had this power in said story, albeit unrefined.

My question is, if there were to be more magic powers like this (and canonically there are, with seers, parselmouths, and metamorphagis' being a thing) what would their powers look like, how would you counter them, and would they be genetic, earned (by maybe a ritual that requires a big sacrifice?) or completely random, like a mutation? I'm writing a story, and one of my ideas is having an auror team filled with Aurors that have random abilities


** I would imagine they're both, and it also depends on the writer. A lot of the traits we /do/ see in canon seem to be explicitly genetic(being a seer, parselmouth). IIRC, Tonks is the first metamorphmagus to appear in her bloodline for generations. Some exceptions appear to be Harry's parseltongue ability, which is apparently from Voldemort, though some fanfics change that to be a misinterpretation of events, and that he was naturally a parselmouth, and inherited it from one of his parents(e.g. one fanfic I read had the Potters as secretly parselmouths, but hid it because of the public view of parselmouths in Britain, and another had it from the Evans line, with Lily actually being Voldemort's cousin from a squib, and James reacting incredibly violently to the revelation that both she and Harry were parselmouths).

*** There's a really weird sort of dissonance in canon where it comes to this imo. On the one hand, it presents pure bloods as bigoted idiots who hate muggles/muggleborns for no reason, but on the other hand we have examples of powers that are directly inherited in bloodlines, which is a measurable reason for their hatred. Doesn't justify all the murder and whatnot, but it's still odd.

**** To be fair, most of the traits we see in canon, even though linked to bloodlines, are hardly comparable to a "family magic" that would kinda justify the hate :

- Even if the Black did have some Metamorphmagus in their history, Tonk is the 1st one to appear in generation (is it still a family trait if it happen once every 200 years?). Worse, since Andromeda married a Muggleborn, it could be argued that adding new blood may be the reason why the gift appeared (which is pretty much the opposite of the blood purist philosophy).
- Concerning the Seers, I'm pretty sure that Sybill Trelawney having the gift (just like her grandmother, Cassandra) is just a coincidence and is not really some Bloodline Magic. At least it's what I understood of Dumbledore explanation of Divination and his job interview with her.
- The only power that seem truly linked to the bloodline (at least seem in canon) is being a Parselmouth. And to be honnest, it's a power that seem kinda lame. Sure, it's a proof to be a descendant of Slytherin, and fanfictions made a lot of stories with Spy Snakes that help Harry to learn every secret of the plot or help him during his fight, but in canon, snakes are a little dumb. The only snakes that are usefull to the plot are the Basilisk (that is really really rare), and Nagini (that is more intelligent than other snakes thanks to the Horcruxe according to Voldemort, and not really a snake accord to Fantastic Beasts).\\
  The Gaunts still became paupers even though they were the best Snake Charmers around.

**** At least in cannon almost no one from the DE side has this powers, only one I can think of the top of my head is Voldemort.

** My personal HC is that this powers are the result of the person or some ancestor having acquired the ability through blood-magic by literally weaving the magic in their bloodline (not genetics though, would take to much time to explain but genetics simply don't work that way). This would also be from where curses like lycanthropy came from (an attempt to make a natural born animagus in a family, or even just having some characteristics of wolves like better hearing), or things like the Crabbe and Goyle families having become universally stupid by having tried to make occlumens inherent to their lineage and getting it wrong. Alternatively it opens the possibility of wizards and even non-humans cursing each other's bloodlines.

Maybe some ancestor of Salazar Slytherin tried to make all his descendants snake animagus and also blotched it up creating parseltongue. And maybe some Gaunt decided to use some ritual that makes X generations of the family become malformed squibs in exchange for making the one that comes after this generations extraordinarily powerful, would be a better explanation for how only TRJ is shown to have control of his magic before Hogwarts.

** Some goofy ideas 1) A spider man powerset. Not necessarily Peter Parker's. 2) Conscious control over hair. This extends to /all/ your hair, including eyebrows. Unfortunately eyebrow manipulation isn't very useful. 3) Hollow bird bones. You can fall farther safely and jump higher. 4) More languages, but weird ones. Maybe your eyes can flash like a firefly's and you understand their "language." Cricket song. Starfish communication. The possibilities are endless. Go wild. Talk to a fireplace. Maybe magical houses are sentient.
