I have been trying for a while to find an old fanfic I was reading from years ago, it was so good I have to know how it ended. Its about a girl named Christina who is a Gryffindor dating Harry and is from a pureblood family of Slytherins DE who don't know she is dating Harry. The Trio has never met her family and knows next to nothing about her life outside of school and Hermione is determined to figure out her secret. Christina is informed by her mother during a school break that she is to marry Draco and that she is the Dark Lord's daughter. Christina of course has been friends with Draco for years, but can't fathom being with him since she is involved with Harry. She spends the break with Draco and part of the summer and falls in love with him and when they take a trip to London Hermione finds out that Christina has been cheating on Harry eith Draco.

After that Voldemort is brought back into her life (since he is her father) and I think after their 6th year that Draco and Christina start training with Bellatrix. The pair left school and it had been a year of training and loving each other, I think they got marriwd first and then during that time Bellatrix finds out that Christina is pregnant with Draco's child. Christina accidentally makes a horcrux out of her cat and shortly after goes into labor. They end up giving their child up for adoption before Bellatrix knows, they wanted to give their child the best shot at a life outside of the darkness.

Christina's father sends her to kill Harry and in turn Harry kidnaps Christina. He holds her hostage for a few months and she misses Draco, but at the same time kinds rekindles her bond with Harry. Harry later kills Christina on accident when he attempted to kill Draco (when he came to rescue her). Christina ends up in the limbo land with Sirius Black as they watch their lives in attempts to see what they did wrong. After they watch their lives they are released from the limbo land and go forth in the future as ghosts until they get some blood from the person who killed them to come to life. Christina manages to pick Harry's finger and appears in front of him....Hermione and Ron adopted her child.

Okay I'm not going to go on any longer I promise, I just figured if I gave you enough to help me find it that would be helpful. Sorry that I rambled, but I hope I can finally find that fanfic.


** A google search found this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9175204/1/Slyinderella]]

Havent read it, so no idea if it really matches what you are looking for. And it isnt that old. So probably not the correct story.

** I pulled that up when I was Googling for it as well, thank you for at least trying to help me out. I started reading it in 2006/07 so it might be long gone by now.
