Preferably without time traveling back for fix its, harems, ridiculous ships e.g. Fleur/Harry, Tonks/Harry or smth like that, no smut/lemon. Other than that I'm absolutely fine with everything.

Edit: I prefer completed fics, but unfinished + well written ones are fine too


** The arithmancer verse, With a math genius Hermione who tests into arithmancy in 1st year. Minimal/no bashing to my memory. There is an ship, Hermione/George, but that only comes into play in the 2nd book in the trilogy. Its just great.
