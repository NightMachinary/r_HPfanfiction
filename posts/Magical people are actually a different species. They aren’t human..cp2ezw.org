:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it a long time ago and I can't remember what it was!

Other things I remember: Magical people glow or something, and have to learn a glamour to cover it up during the summers. Muggleborns get to meet each other before school starts, with one or two teachers supervising? Muggleborns tend to have a very physical reaction to meeting another like them.

I don't even remember if it was well-written or not. Or whether it was complete. Help?


** Is it The Firebird Trilogy??? Linkffn(8629685) What you're describing sounds like the first few chapters. It Harry that has a “strong” reaction to the muggleborns when he meets them and other magical folk.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** It's probably the Firebird Trilogy. It's complete, the writing is decent, the plot is original, but some of the stuff is kind of age-inappropriate.

** Definitely Firebird. Some people like it, some people hate it, it's well written, it's completely AU, it's complete. I loved it, when I finally managed to get past the first few chapters.

*** It's Darth Marrs, it's bound to be equally gruesome, gory and fluffy.

That man has the ability to both be extremely original and incredibly cruel to his characters.

Still, a good read, if only it wasn't such a downer of a series for the most of it. Don't misunderstand, I love it, but I understand why people can dislike it. Firebird's Trilogy is probably the epitome of Darth Marrs writing style. It took Broken Chains up to eleven and then some.
