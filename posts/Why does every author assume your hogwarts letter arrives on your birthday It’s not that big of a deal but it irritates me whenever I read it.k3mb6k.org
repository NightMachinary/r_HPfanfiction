** I believe that JKR may have implied that they received an introduction letter on their 11th bday and received the booklist with the rest of the students. However if you reread the first book you can find that Harry got his first letter at least a week before his birthday so I think you might be right.

** The reasons might, oddly enough, revolve around Hermione, thanks to her September birthday.

1. The fandom has perennial debates about precisely how gifted Hermione is. A big argument for "very" side is that she goes from never having seen a wand in her life to casting many, perhaps all the spells in the first-year textbook in a bit more than a month, without any assistance. But, if she's had most of a year to mess around with a wand, that weakens that argument, so the "not very" side has an incentive to believe that letters are sent on birthdays.
2. In the many fics in which Harry and Hermione are friends, adopted siblings, etc. before Hogwarts, Hermione's early birthdate gives them an extra year to prepare for Hogwarts. Then, it becomes a plot device.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means.

(Specifically, it's more than a bit sue-ish, unnecessary anti-Dumbledore, fanony, and brings in some extra-canonical setting elements completely out of the left field and to no clear purpose. Linking Hermione to some prophecy detracts from her self-made witch ethos. It would have made the story a lot more interesting if the whole New Blood thing actually /were/ a bluff that she has to work to sustain with talent, hard work, and not a little skulduggery.)

**** Muggleborns don't get letters. McGonagall came to inform Hermione that she was a witch. The only reason Harry got a letter is because both of his parents were magicals, so they thought he already knew about magic. Also, Ginny got her letter at the same time everyone else got their supply list, which means that every letter is delivered at the same time. Because of that, we can safely assume that Hermione had McGonagall explain the wizarding world to her the summer before she went to Hogwarts.

*** Wouldn't it be fairly easy to verify, though?

If she got her letter in the summer before her 11th birthday and started Hogwarts while still being 10, it would make her still 16 at the beginning of Deathly Hallows, which is important because of the trace. We know that the order did think that apparition would be detected by the trace which means that, unless they were wrong, with the Death Eaters only finding them once they triggered the taboo in chapter 9 of Deathly Hallows she couldn't have been 16 at the time, giving some credence to the theory that she got her letter too late for her to go to Hogwarts immediately.

Of course, ultimately it doesn't really matter, because Rowling is close to infamous for how commonly she missed things of that ilk when writing, and because Hermione is the kind of person who would have read enough books in a month to be capable of doing at least some magic on the Hogwarts Express; it would, however, explain her being a complete chatterbox with way too much enthusiasm at the beginning of Philosopher's Stone.

***** The point is, the argument about the Hogwarts letter as pertaining to Hermione is that either she got her letter before her 11th birthday, during the summer, and should have started Hogwarts while 10, or she got it around her birthday and due to it being too late for her to get to Hogwarts now had to wait almost a year.

I was making a point that, unless there are other options that are not being considered or it is blamed on Rowling's ability to miss things when writing, there is a scene in Deathly Hallows that supports her being 11, close to 12, when starting Hogwarts, which can thus be used as tentative proof of the latter theory. I was also making a point that ultimately it doesn't really matter.

******* Considering that I don't really thinks it matters because ultimately Rowling is going to do whatever and any fanfic authors will think up his or her own take anyway, it's at least partially a hypothetical exercise. There's mixed information in canon, to the point of actual lack of consistency, and at this point it's just easier to make your own version while making it internally consistent than it is to try to work with canon as it is.

As for what's the problem with that, it depends on whom you ask because canon isn't very consistent in this regard. We know that supposedly people get the letters during the summer before the 11th birthday, or at least around it, but then there's also Minerva's case and she got hers on her birthday which wasn't during the summer, and supposedly getting the letter to Harry on his 11th birthday at the latest was important because ... no idea why. It's something of a mess.

******** It's not the summer before their eleventh birthday.

It's the summer before they are /eligible to start Hogwarts/. Which requires that you are eleven before September 1st of that year. Harry just happened to turn eleven during the summer.

And it wasn't that Harry's birthday was important so much as getting Harry his Hogwarts letter before the enrolment period was over. Harry's name was put down by his parents, yes, but presumably he also had to agree to go and he had to do so by July 31st 1991. Not because it was his birthday but because Hogwarts staff do need to know what size the incoming first year will be. After all if the Dursleys had been adamant about sending Harry to Beauxbatons or home-schooling him (both legitimate options) then he could have ended up not going to Hogwarts.

**** Well, I just said it is canon because it says so on the HP wikis, most using HPatPS chapter 4 as a reference. Didn't check myself what it says exactly in the books.

For example: [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_acceptance_letter]]

"Date of writing: Around the wizard's eleventh birthday"

Again, I am not saying it is canon that they come on the birthday. I say it is canon that they are written somewhere around that time, meaning if an author has it arrive on the birthday, it is totally in the realm of very likely possibilities and a weird thing to be upset about.

EDIT: Found this on the above linked page:

#+begin_quote
  It is a wide misconception that you receive the letter on your 11th birthday as Harry received his first letter about a week before his birthday and most of the subsequent ones between then and his birthday, he happened to receive his final letter that he actually read through Hagrid on his birthday.

  At the very least students who have August birthdays would need to receive their letters prior to their birthdays as the cut off date for confirming their places is July the 31st and they would also need time to get supplies.

  It is confirmed on Pottermore that Minerva McGonagall received her letter exactly on her birthday, meaning it does sometimes happen, though not always.

The letters will arrive, staggered, throughout July. This is because:

- Hogwarts does not have enough owls to send out all letters at once
- The letters include required books for i.e. DADA, and prior to having a booklist, you need to have a curriculum and thus a new teacher.

So they can't send it out very early, since they don't know what they /would be/ sending out then.

I'm not inclined to have that debate, so we can just disagree on that part. Two, in this instance, the wiki actually got it right, I think you just misinterpretated it. Assuming you are referring to the part

#+begin_quote
  A special quill exists, which writes down the name of every magical child in Britain at the time of their birth. This allows Hogwarts letters to be sent to all magical children at the appropriate time, even those who are Muggle-born.[4]

then this simply means that their names are recorded in the book, and the "appropriate time" is something to be determined. The excerpt you quoted afterwards notes itself the misconception regarding birthdays.

Or reading something, seeing it sourced, and later realising there were conflicting sources of which the wiki had helpfully (.../not/) chosen one for me. And this is /not even/ including indiscriminately using ridiculous sources such as the LEGO video games or the /HP Theme Park/ (ffs!) alongside the books, and presenting a garbled mix of movie and book canon, without clearly noting (in the article) what goes where.

The factual inaccuracies and speculative articles aside, the latter is the greatest issue.

As an author, this means the wiki is useless for me for anything other than inspiration. For hard fact checks ("where in the books does it say ...?"), I use the hp-lexicon, and anything from cj_whitehound, because she sources her essays impeccably. Answers from scifi.stackexchange often are good as well.

  your theory is 100% non-canon

Depends on what you consider canon. Strictly speaking, canon is the books.

*** Canon, Harry's first letter arrives /well/ before his birthday. Harry's birthday is when Hagrid comes to hand-deliver it.

**** There are also three other persons who can't have gotten the letter for their birthday in Canon:\\
Ginny gets her letter in CoS at least a week late - her Birthday is on August 11, they get the letters on August 18th.

Draco Malfoy doesn't have a Wand when he first met Harry - on July 31. If the letters were send out sooner, he would have his Wand and Books much earlier because his Birthday is early June. Draco Malfoy wouldn't have waited nearly two month. He is a spoiled brat until at least HPB.

It rains when Dumbledore visits Tom Riddle. His birthday is in Dezember. If it had been Dezember when Dumbledore visits there would have been snow.

** Tbh one of the things that makes me want to quit a fanfiction immediately is when letters arrive on the birthdays. It just so doesn't make sense. If Hermione (a Muggleborn) knew about being a witch for almost a year before going to Hogwarts, she would be such a danger to Status of Secrecy. A year of living as a muggle but knowing otherwise with no supervision? Unbelievable. Moreover, they would need to sent another letter with books in summer anyway so it's quite meaningless? Let's not forget hypothetical unfortunate Muggleborn kid who has birthday on 31th of August with less than a day to get over the news and buy supplies (not to mention that you have to send letter of acceptance till 31th of July)

I think that letters are sent during the summer, first to Muggleborns (together with a teacher who wouldn't have time to do so during school year, I suppose?) and then to other children. I think it's quite possible that children with older siblings already in school may get their letters last, because they don't really need to accept? (or Weasleys had already paid Ginny's tuition fees before she got her letter so she was accounted for and they wanted to use less owls for all Weasley's letters?)

** Probably because Harry finally got to read his letter on his birthday despite the fact that he actually got it a week beforehand. It tends to drive me crazy, too.

** Pottermore itself is guilty of this, Minerva got her letter on her birthday.

My headcanon is that they used to be delivered on your 11th birthday, but it was changed at some point before the Marauders entered Hogwarts (because Severus and Lily gets their letter at the same time, and their birthdays are 3 weeks apart).

*** My new headcanon is that it was because of the DADA curse: when you have to replace your DADA instructor every year, you can't plan nearly as far in advance.
