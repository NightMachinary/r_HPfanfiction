** I'm going to ignore the "like Hogwarts Battle School" criteria, because I don't know what part of the fic you like (AU setting, combat focus, etc). So I'll just give you fics involving a powerful, smart Harry.

*** IIRC, there have been long periods of time where Shaydrall hasn't updated, so I don't think it's abandoned. Could be wrong, hope I'm not.

*** I'm just as lukewarm on MoR as the most of the rest of this sub, but man, how do you downvote this? The question is "fics where Harry is relatively powerful and logical," and whatever else you think of MoR, are you really going to say it doesn't fit that description?
