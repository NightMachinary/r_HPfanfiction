:END:
Here's what I remember:

- Harry ends up in an alternate timeline where Voldemort was defeated earlier and everyone survived
- He has to battle internally with his alternate self
- He works as a journalist with Lavender (and Pansy I think?)
- He was in some relationship with Draco but was an asshole about it, and I'm pretty sure Draco has a sister?
- Neville is famous and Harry ends up being his PR rep

Would really appreciate any help finding this fic :)
