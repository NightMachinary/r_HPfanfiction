Is there a fic where Harry defeats Voldemort as a baby but dies? And there isn't an alternate chosen one or anything and there isn't an OC main character instead of Harry. The prophecy is similar enough that it would lead Voldemort to try to kill Harry but different enough that it doesn't suggest there is a chosen one. We just see all the students going to Hogwarts and observing how their interactions would be different if there was no Harry around. The only character who would have any excuse to be OOC would probably be Snape if he is there since he doesn't have the motivation of protecting Lily's son.

Voldemort is still lurking around.


** "Harry Potter Without Harry Potter" should fit your request.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)

  A true single point of departure leads to a world without Harry. Changes compound- and no one is safe.

  The Boy Who Lived didn't. Now 13 years after Harry Potter was murdered by the Dursleys, magical England is on the verge of collapse. So Luna Lovegood wishes for someone to come and make it all better.
