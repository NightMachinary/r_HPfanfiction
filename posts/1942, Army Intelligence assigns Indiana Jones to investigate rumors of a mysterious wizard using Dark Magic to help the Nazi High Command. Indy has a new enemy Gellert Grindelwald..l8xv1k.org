** Lol, he steals a robe a fakes being a wizard for like three days, because unlike his Scottish accent, a robe and a working knowledge of runes, hieroglyphs, and sandskrit is all you need to convince wizards you didn't flunk out of illvermorny.

After that he blunders his way out of nuemengard on the back of a abraxan and with a bag of illuminated scrolls by herpo the foul. And a kid. Well, he thought he was a kid for like an hour, but filus flitwick got annoyed and corrected indy.

****** There was that one time Grindelwald and his buddy broke into the Orphanage where Tom Riddle was staying alone (all the staff and other kids went on holiday and forgot about him), and he had to defend the place using all these traps and things - he even hit the guy in the face with a frying pan one time! :D

And yeah. It's an odd movie, no doubt about it. Gotta wonder what movie executive heard "Okay, kid gets left at home by absentee parents, then two burglars break in, and he basically murders the shit out of them with hijinks." as a pitch and thought that was worth greenlighting and making sequels to. :D

**** It'd have to be serious levels of getting the drop on them, given that they can conjure a shield with a thought. And keeping in mind how wizards are physically far sturdier than muggles (bludgers being the prime example of this), would a shotgun blast anywhere other than directly to the heart or head be enough to kill them before they could apply emergency first aid and apparate to St Mungos?

***** Yep. Without a direct headshot or heartshot the wizard would live. As for getting the drop on them, I use the same logic as when Batman kills reverse flash in flashpoint paradox. Even if you can, it won't matter if you can't react fast enough. If the wizard has a gun fired at their head, they wouldn't be able to react fast enough to shield from a shotgun blast
