I'm in the mood for some lighthearted teen romance. Crossovers and OCs are fine.

The main requirement is that Harry didn't already know the girl before he left. Maybe try to keep recs above 2.5/5 stars if possible.

  A slightly different take on indy!Harry. A summer vacation leads Harry to do some exploring someplace not so far afield. Sixteen, bored, and faced with the newest threat to his sanity - the cute waitress. Music and a little mayhem. Post 5th, slight AU.

** I don't know how to feel that the only story I remember reading that fits this description was one where Harry went back in time and romances a Teenage Lily.

I think it is because I generally skip OC stories, I recall reading several summaries where an OC was introduced this way.

**** I am really just surprised I cannot think of any more. Seems like a pretty common theme to do. For crossovers, Usually new characters are injected into the HP world (rather than him visiting the other series world). Guess it fits with the 'hidden wizarding world' dynamic.

I can think of a lot where Harry gets stuck after leaving (in time, another dimension, whatever), but not so much him going on a trip and coming back...

I don't think the one I mentioned was good enough for me to follow/fav it :(

**** How is it "canon rehash as fuck"? Most of the fic's scenes weren't even at Hogwarts. And all in all it was more about emotional struggles of growing up then about fighting dark lords. I won't comment about "bland and hollow" since it has been a couple of years since I've read it and therefore it is quite possible that my mind remembers it being better than it actually was.
