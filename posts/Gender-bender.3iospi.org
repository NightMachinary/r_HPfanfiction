  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  There were only a few things in Harry Potter's life that were absolutes. He was the son of Lily and James Potter and that he was born male. What happens when he discovers the truth. AU Strong/Independent, Gender-Switch, Fem!Harry, Fem!Slash Mature Themes

*** JUST about to recommend Jamie Evans. We never get to see him/her as male; I like to approach it as Jamie being a different person than Harry, even though there is contiguity between them.

**** But what's the point of a gender bender if the story spends zero time focusing on the actual change in gender? Might as well be a fem Harry AU.

  Harry Potter in a new way. A young Harry, raised in an orphanage feels strange in his own body. The caretakers realize this, and help him to remedy this. Trans.Harry, probable homosexual situations, possible lemons. Rated M for mature content, don't like, don't read. No pairing as of yet, please read and review.
