- Since Albus's hundredth birthday, he'd started taking his health way more seriously - and found the adrenaline rush from exercise quite invigorating. His newfound love for weightlifting earned him the nickname Dumbbell-dore.

- Unbeknownst to many, Albus's school performance wasn't great in his first year due to outside influences - he set the record for lowest grade in Charms class due to a faulty wand and poor eyesight, earning him the nickname "Dumb-as-a-door". It stuck among his detractors even after he got a proper wand and new glasses, and his school performance shot up to straight Outstandings.

- Albus had always been studious, and prone to bouts of giddiness at making a new discovery in the field of Alchemy. His legendarily amusing reaction at finding a twelfth use for dragon's blood earned him the fond nickname "Dumbledork" among his closest friends.

I kinda want to "redeem" all the nicknames I read in Dumbledore-Bashing stories - so if you know any more of those, feel free to make up a story around that one.


** Stumbledore? Maybe he was clumsy when younger and gets called that by old friends.

*** His nose was always slightly crooked. His glasses never quite stayed stationary, really messes with ones hand-eye coordination.

** Bumblebee - You know who produces the honey that Hogwarts uses? It ain't the elves.

*** Now I've got !IndyHarry singing the "smashing up a baby bumblebee" song stuck in my head along with some very unpleasant imagery of honey production and perhaps even Hermione's outrage at an overworked Albus?
