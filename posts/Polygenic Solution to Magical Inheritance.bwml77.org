​

This is the simplest genetic solution for the inheritance of magic that is consistent - i.e. does not rely on mutations to function.

​

(The average rate of mutation per gene is 0.5 x 10^-9 (incredibly small!) per year) - with the wizarding world being a few thousand people, squibs would be a once a millennia phenomena)

​

Magic in this system is inherited through an allele comprised of two genes rather than just one.

​

This is because if magic was determined with just one gene, as shown below, a wizard being born from a muggle or a squib having a child with a muggle or a squib (someone with a minority of genes contributing to them possessing magic, and a majority of genes of genes contributing to them not possessing magic - i.e. 50%> magic genes) (except from mutations) would be impossible.

Results:

​

- Pure muggles (0% magical genes) can produce wizarding offspring with up to 50% magical genes (AA BB) when reproducing with wizards, but only offspring with 25% magical genes (AB BB) (i.e. muggles) when reproducing with muggles with 25% magical genes.

​

- Muggles with 25% magical genes can produce wizarding offspring with up to 50% magical genes (AB AB) when reproducing with each other.

​

- Pure wizards cannot produce squibs with other pure wizards (except from mutations) - although pure bloods are not necessarily pure wizards.


** That is assuming that magic is genetic. It could also be the case that the cells themselves are magical, or that exposure to magic during embryonic development causes the magic ability to manifest. Many genes activate or deactivate depending on environmental conditions, it's possible that the reason Hermione for example has magic is that her mother ran into a muggle repelling charm while pregnant.

*** Of course, any explanation for a setting is acceptable so long as it ensures that the story is enjoyable to read.

** Wrong. Anyone who's anyone knows that Griphook is in charge of magical inheritance.

** Trying to fit magical inheritance to Mendelian genetics is like trying to fit magical spells to Newtonian physics.

*** Some people want to do it anyhow. Magic is inherited, so obviously it must be genetic, their mind goes.

** I think your trying to mix oil and water

Magic and science are not friends

I think magic does as magic does and there is no magic gene

*** Magic could be anything, as it's a fictional concept, but the polygenic explanation works similarly enough to canon to be acceptable.
