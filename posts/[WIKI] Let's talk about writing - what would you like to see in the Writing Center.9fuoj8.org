* Calling the writers of [[/r/HPfanfiction]]!
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: calling-the-writers-of-rhpfanfiction
  :END:
I know that we tend to talk about the fics we read more than the fics we write. But I want to make the Writing Center a place where we can go when we need help.

** The Old Writing Center
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-old-writing-center
   :END:
The old center contained the following:

- link to the Lexicon

- "How not to do redo fics"

- Characterization of the Characters

- Naming OCs

** The NEW Writing Center!
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: the-new-writing-center
   :END:
Do you want to see any of these things carried over?

What new items do you want to see?

What do you think of these ideas?

- technical information on /where/ and /how/ to post fanfics

- general writing tips (paragraphs, formatting, grammar, etc)

- information on tropes and how to avoid them

- links to various writing resources /not/ specific to HP fandom

--------------

I want to know what you want in the wiki. If you have a good resource, let me know! Tell me what you want to see. Thanks!


** A link to the [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ogrx6d9oohf6D42G44j1A][Terrible Writing Advice]] youtube channel which is really applicable to fanfic writer and has several VERY pertinent videos to the HP fandom.

** Three things which would be useful to include

1. A summary of the pet peeve/hated trope threads and an explanation why something is bad (eg harems suck because the girls usually are interchangeable, lack any own agenda and feel like collectables for the MC).

2. A link to a small selection of stories which excel at a certain aspect (eg /Dignity in fear/ for writing emotions, Taure for worldbuilding and independent stories which require no canon knowledge)

3. A link to the prompt page or a special "wish list" thread where we can point out which kind of story we wish there would be more of (eg Lavender Brown as an important character, more Harry & Hermione friendship fics).

For the tropes, a link to the TV-Tropes page would do the trick since you can click on them for further explanation: [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FandomSpecificPlot/HarryPotter]]

Not sure about the OC naming thing. I usually just google the common names from that country and period and mix them together (even if that required learning some basics of Lithuanian grammar once). The results are usually more authentic than any name generator.

** Proper capitalization and formatting for spells and other HP-specific words. For example, is it house-elf, house elf or houseelf?

******* Probably would've been better to say, /It's a house-elf/. I was confused too, tbh.

But it also appears even JKR was confused on these sorts of things, so now I don't feel too bad :)

** Pertaining to OCs, I use this site to come up with surnames:

[[http://www.britishsurnames.co.uk/surnames]]

For first names, it's /usually/ something traditional and more than likely out-dated for a Slytherin, and something common for anyone else.

** A link to the official HP wiki and Pottermore would be useful to those trying to look up canon facts for their fics. Likewise,the HP Lexicon and the [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/Location_Location.htm][White Hound breakdowns of canon locations]] would also be very useful!

I'd also suggest links to Purdue Owl.

*** Supported. Linking to the /Lexicon/ but not to the Harry Potter Wiki or /Pottermore/ seems like an artifact from before either of those were really a thing at best, and bias at worst.

** I thought of another one. This might fall into pet peeves or tropes, but a resource on what people think is canon that is actually fanon I think could be helpful.
