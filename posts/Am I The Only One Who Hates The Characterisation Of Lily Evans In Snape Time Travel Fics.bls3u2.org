I've been reading as many Snape time travel fics as I can get my hands on and I noticed a most irksome trend- The deification of Lily Evans.

For some reason, fanfic writers feel the need to assign all the faults to Severus while conferring saint status on Lily Evans. Then the whole fic devolves into a whole lot of apologies on Snape's part and thowing temper tantrums/pointing out Snape's faults on Lily's part.

Can someone link me to some well written Snape time travel fics? The ones I've read caused a bit of my brain to dribble out of my ear. I'll probably keep reading 'em in spite of this 'cos Snape time travel fics are in such short supply.


** I think that there is a general tendency in fics to deify the protagonist's absent mother. Compare the /HP/ fandom's treatment of Lily with with /Ranma 1/2/ fandom's treatment of Nodoka.

Personally, I haven't seen any fics of this kind that I've particularly liked. In principle, I'd love to see a fic in which Snape goes back in time and, with benefit of hindsight and what little maturity he had managed to acquire over the prior two decades, realises that his obsession with memory of Lily wasn't healthy; that even if he manages to seduce her this time through, their relationship will always be tainted; and that while he was dealt a bad hand the first time through, he now has a chance to make something better of himself and the world around him.

Also, in light of the recent Slytherin!Lily thread, I still want to see a fic where Lily gets sorted there and ends up going Dark even harder than Snape, because you don't survive as a Muggleborn in Slytherin with one friend during Voldemort's first rise by being a good person. Ideally, it would avert the Dark is Not Necessarily Evil trope and actually see Lily lose the reader sympathy somewhat over the course of the story.

** Because it's Snape's fault.

Lily didn't force him to go Slytherin, becoming friends and forming a gang with junior death-eaters, bullying others, using dark magic on students, calling others mudblood and joining Voldemort.

Lily forgive him for years for calling her friends mudblood and (iirc) harming her sister (when they were children) and calling her names.

**** This has become my headcannon for Lily's teenage behavior.

​

Petunia had laughed at her, to Lily's astonishment.

"So the pretty cheerleader is finally dumping the embarassing, ugly, unpopular friend from her childhood so she can hook up with the handsome team captain, then?" Petunia had taunted. "You must have been so relieved when he finally did something to give you an excuse and make it his fault instead of yours?"

Lily's red face had been answer enough. She had sputtered more excuses at first, then said, "You don't understand how hard it has been for me to be friends with any Slytherin. They've been after me to drop Severus since first year. Even the Headmaster disapproves."

*** I don't doubt that the majority of the blame was on Snapes end. He was an awful, bitter person, and being bullied is no excuse for any of his behavior towards his students. Quite honestly, the only character who disgusts me more than him is Umbridge. (he's also my 3rd favorite character tbh)

At the same time-

Lily is also the type of person who would date a boy who bullied and publicly humiliated her friend.

Now, I love a good maurader fix as much as the next person, but James was an asshole. Honestly, they were all probably assholes imo. But with James and Lily, I can understand befriending him once he changes, but dating and eventually marrying him? That takes a type of trust that I just don't see most people developing with a kid that bullied her friend like the mauraders, and specifically James, did.

However I can see her starting to date him to spite Snape. To get back at him and hurt him where it hurt the worst. (And then maybe fall in love)

To be perfectly honest, I'd say that Snape was probably just as angry at Lily, if not more so, than he was at James. To Snape, James was a bully, and a pathetic swine not worthy to lick his shoes. For Lily to date and marry James Potter was the ultimate act of betrayal.

Actually, if anyone knows any snape lily fanfictions that plays that up, I'd love to read it. If not, I'll probably just write it myself.

***** I don't really defend James either. But I do kind of view him on the same level as a pre Death Eater Draco Malfoy. Just, kinda a twat face. Attractive to a certain sort (me) and likely slightly or a lot elitist.

It wasn't the dialogue. I haven't read the seventh book in so long, that I can't remember the dialogue. My views might change if I read it again, however. But for right now it's the simple fact that she even started dating him.

Now, don't get me wrong. I do think that she was ultimately a good person. But good people can have serious flaws that they struggle with.

Like, she's shown to have a temper, and that she blushes at the idea of James Potter liking her. Say that it's Seventh Year, and Snape does something to piss her off. Then in the heat of the moment she has had enough and just goes 'fuck it' and goes out with James because she should be allowed to do something purely for herself... but maybe also she's mad at Snape and wants to piss him off?

Idk. It could also be that time has skewed my perception of the books.

I see James as some kind of jokester spoiled jock that loves attention all the time. It's established that he used to bully people when Lily wasn't paying attention (or took a blind eye as always). I believe most of his "jokes" were apparently innofensive though, at least in his mind. He had his good side like not being racist, being a militant for good causes, etc...

​

Snape was no saint though. He was racist and part of the deth eaters, which is the equivallent of a creepy cult and nazist or any racist terrorist group

******** The first and the most important thing you should know is we know James and Lily married in the first chapter of the first book and they have a child. Later Rowling wrote their personality, how they looked etc. Authors of novels, games, plays, TV Shows aren't write their work linearly (I imagine they are some exceptions).

The second thing is Snape is not innocent. He bullied other people and laugh other his friends who bullied and used dark magic on others.

  “Of course he was a bit of an idiot!” said Sirius bracingly. “We were all idiots! Well --- not Moony so much,” he said fairly, looking at Lupin, but Lupin shook his head.

  “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”

  “Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes. . . . That was something. . . .”

  “And,” said Harry doggedly, determined to say everything that was on his mind now he was here, “he kept looking over at the girls by the lake, hoping they were watching him!”

  “Oh, well, he always made a fool of himself whenever Lily was around,” said Sirius, shrugging. “He couldn't stop himself showing off whenever he got near her.”

  “How come she married him?” Harry asked miserably. “She hated him!”

  “Nah, she didn't,” said Sirius.

  “She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.

  “Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.

  “And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin.

  “Even Snape?” said Harry. “Well,” said Lupin slowly,

  *“Snape was a special case. I mean, he never lost an opportunity to curse James, so you couldn't really expect James to take that lying down, could you?”*

  “And my mum was okay with that?”

  “She didn't know too much about it, to tell you the truth,” said Sirius. “I mean, James didn't take Snape on dates with her and jinx him in front of her, did he?”

  Sirius frowned at Harry, who was still looking unconvinced.

  “Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.”

OOTP/CH:29

The conversation you mentioned. Snape isn't bullied at all and *I* won't count racist bullies who want to join (did he joined in his 7th year time or later I don't know) a (magical) Nazi organization bullied at all especially when they start it.

She thinks he is ''arrogant toerag'' a bit after Werewolf event happens and she thinks him as ''arrogant bullying toerag'' in their fifth year and prefer Giant Squid over him.

I recommend you read SWM again for how Lily despises James.

I was speaking about this as I generally don't read to the past time-travel fics so I ignored the fic part.

All faults are already Severus's. He did call her and others mudblood, he did bully others and other things...

What Lily gonna do?

''Severus, you bullied others, called me and my friends mudblood and you want to join DEs whose purpose is to kill every one of my birth but they aren't important and I forgive you.''

Do you want her to say something like this?

Of course, he going to apologize, do you want Lily to apologize?

She makes excuses for him for years and calling her mudblood is the last thing that shatters the glass.

Does that mean that she would end up with Severus? It's /possible/, but hardly guranteed.

Fanon generally has 3 views on this relationship romance-wise in a canon compilant context, all somewhat equally popular:

1. Severus' feelings for her was entirely unrequited
2. They had reciprocated feelings for each other, but never knew about it
3. They did have a temporary romantic relationship that broke down alongside the friendship.

I find #3 highly unlikely. Canon makes no explicit mention either way, but never implies Lily having feelings for Severus -- so there's no reason she "should" end up with him.

**** Well, there's some angst, but it wasn't the point of the fic. I think the 4 main characters, are Snape, Lily, Harry and an OC, and the name may have something to do with Time.

Imma check ffn and see if I find it.

EDIT: well, that was easy. Its this one, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7265440/1/Turning-Time]] hope you'll enjoy it.

** Or the opposite. Either everything is Lily's fault, or it's Severus' for their disagreements and ultimate estrangement. Really though, they're both to blame.

There is little defense for Severus joining in on Slytherins' Muggleborn bullying (Mary incident was almost certainly not an isolated case), and is outright hypocritical of him, supposedly being friends with one, and also for being a victim of bullying himself. However, him uttering Mudblood in a moment of weakness is generally given far too much weight alone. Yes, it was what broke the camel's back on the ruin of their friendship, but it did /not/ cause them to go from close friends to indifference -- it was on the brink of ruin as-is. The word is deplorable, and while it's understandable that it was said in a moment of weakness (just like Lily's response), it shouldn't have happened in first place.

It does not, however, justify Lily's utter dismissal of his attempts to apologize. Yes, she is hurt, but putting him on the spot the way she did, without at least trying to calmly let him explain his reasoning (he has plenty without resorting to admitting personal feelings, so /that/ isn't the problem), solves nothing. Also, Lily can't expect him to openly antagonize his housemates who sleep alongside him in the dormitory. Yes, outright joining them is going too far, but he can't openly oppose them. She puts too much weight on the words of bullies against her supposed best friend -- for example, in the aftermath of The Werewolf Prank. Potter and his friends really is no better than the Slytherins, whether they use Dark Magic or not -- harassment is harassment.

Severus isn't blameless. Lily isn't blameless. They're both human and made human mistakes leading to the events of canon. Ultimately, the blame on their estrangement can be put on the lack of adult control over the bullying situation between Slytherins and Marauders, who allowed it to go as far as it did.

She owes him no chance to apologize tho. If something is broken beyond repair, there is nothing left to say. What good would let him explain himself do if she has no plan of becoming friends with him again anyway?

**** You are correct. But the way she badgers him kind of implies that she wanted to give him one last opportunity to explain himself -- except that she didn't, really, which is a flaw she showed more than once thorough the friendship, not just at the end (really, they both had issues with truly explaining their issues with each other -- a proper talk about their issues before the breakdown could possibly have fixed things).

**** Thank you for your kind words! :)

I've tried to do Snape justice for as far as possible, but I'm actually feeling OPs problem regarding Lily's character. I'm always extremely cautious of her dialogue because cannonically she already as a bit of a Mary Sue (Pretty, talented, already well liked by others. Not to mention her heroically selfless death etc.) In so many fics she is portrayed as sort of a Hermione 2.0, and that bothered me so I'm trying my best to actually avoid that. I hope I made it happen. :)

** I really have to stop reading the comments of threads dealing with Severus. I always end up feeling that something is really screwed up with me because I empathize with Snape and want him to have some happiness with Lily.

Edit - Forgot to do a rec. The Peace not Promised by Tempest Kiro is a pretty good one. Yes, Severus is really, really hard on himself and Lily is a bit of a saint in the initial chapters but after Snape apologizes (obviously) and a few other things happen, Lily becomes a nice, layered and believable character once more. Also I really, really respect the author for giving an update schedule and strictly sticking to it.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** Canonically, Snape's Worst Memory comes before the Werewolf incident.

That means that after Sirius nearly got Snape (and Remus) killed, he and James carried on bullying Snape. Which tells you something about what they were like.

Couple that with Snape's status as a half-blood who is likely already on shaky ground in his house and views success in the magical world as his only escape from his abusive muggle father, and is it any wonder he became darker and darker and more Slytherin, eventually exploding at the girl who was supposed to be his best friend but would happily pal around with some really cruel bullies?

Honestly, Snape was in a terrible situation from birth and handled it badly. James Potter was in a blessed situation from birth and still became a mean spirited shit.

Lily had a choice between two shits, and she chose the handsome and wealthy one, forgiving crimes far worse than those a 5th year Snape had yet committed.

Everyone's at fault here.

*** we don't know how much time is between those incidents and what other things happen between those moments that maybe relit the rivally between them.

We know that Snape apparently went around and called muggleborn (other than Lily) mudbloods regulary... At a time when being seen as a mudblood was a death threat/sentence.

The mini-death eater were the more dangrous bullies and Snape waspart of them

Now out of every muggleborns point of view, the friendship with Snape was probably something other muggleborns dispised Lily for, because you hate the collaborator with the enemy. To me that was always the much bigger flaw of Lily

** I like Snamione time-travel stories, because they generally don't deify Lily Evans but often show her as a fundamentally good but also maybe slightly naive or idealistic person. But I guess it's not Snape travelling in time in these stories. So probably not what you're looking for.

*** Which is basically how 90% of HGSS time travel go. Severus is burnt by the friendship loss, is badgered into a friendship by Hermione, and ultimately realizes that maybe the loss wasn't the end of his life after all and in the end romances HG.

I've always been curious of the ultimate aversion -- him reconciling with Lily and eventually becoming more than friends with /her/ rather than Hermione in the end in a HG time travel fic which starts the typical way. But I suppose it wouldn't be as satisfying a plot (and would leave loose ends).

**** Eh, I think he remains friends with Lily in some of these fic. Personally, I'm pretty much never fond of Lily in fanon, either because she's deified or a bitch or anything in between, so I would probably never read a story where Snape ends up with her. I've tried reading Snily fic and I just...can't.
