I mean writing-wise. To me, it's muggle world integration. I mean, why wouldn't you? Right? You need all the help you can get against Voldemort. And muggles have some serious weapons that can make the highest powered spell look like a nerf gun. But it feels so weird when someone goes this route. I was reading a story where Harry gets trained in firearms. And of course, guns would be extremely helpful against death eaters an Voldemort. But it honestly felt cringy as hell to read. Like, it just isn't Harry Potter world.

Have you come across something like this?


** If you mean "Ha! Wizards are so stupid and antiquated! Muggles are more superior with our technology!" kind of thing. Then, yes, it is cringy for me to read too. The author is probably simplifying the complex issue of wizard-muggle integrations.

** You mean the one where he is trained by the French in how to shoot pistols because the French Minister for Magic is his father-in-law twice over, YES, it felt weird for me too, it began with some Romance and then it turned into Harry Potter: From France with Love, with a side of Tom Clancy's love of including military hardware whenever it could.

** Without opening the full can of worms, the main problem I have with "muggle integrations" fic is that, in canon, Wizards /are/ superior to muggles. In all the Wizard/ Muggle interaction we see, the wizards always come out on top (from Dumbledore who ensure Mrs Cole cooperation with a flic of his wand, to Fudge and Scrimgeour who explain the situation to the Muggle Prime Minister more as a courtesy than anything else).\\
So to make this scenario work (if barely), author have to either buff the Muggles to godhood (bullet can break shield charm, magical enclaves can be found by looking for the "white zone" on a map . . .), or nerf the Wizards to oblivion (wizards have no logic, most are so behind with technologies they think Muggles still use one round mousquet . . .). Except doing either of this thing (even though most authors do both) rarely lead to a good story.

Also, just to comment about the Muggles "serious weapon" you mentionned. In my opinion, the only "truly" dangerous weapon from the Muggle side is arguably the Atomic Bomb. Except that using it would still probably do more damages to muggles than wizards (considering their ability to teleport), and I believe an angry wizard could still do more damages in retaliation. Hell, a sufficiently talented, and motivated wizard would use Fienfyre to make the 1666 London's fire look like child play, and could probably repeat the same feat in most of Britain's biggest cities in one night.

â€‹

Personally, the plot idea I have the most problem with is the "Manipulative Dumbledore". I mean, I understand how someone could reach this conclusion after reading canon (though I personally prefer the Doylish explanation of "he is a plot device that would destroy the plot and leave nothing for Harry to do if he was not holding the idiot ball most of the time").\\
But my problem with that idea is that in most of the "Manipulative Dumbledore's stories" (who decided he was manipulative because there is no way Dumbledore would be that incompetent), Dumbledore ends up even more incompetent than in canon, and is reduced to nothing more than a mustache twirling vilain who always see his perfect plot destroyed by the hero (who usually do so by yelling about how he is the Heir/ Lord of 15 Most Ancient and Noble houses and using the 50 Wizengamot votes they bring with it).

I have yet to see a Manipulative Dumbledore's fic they Dumbledore actually had a good reason to be manipulative ("I wanted Harry's money to pay the Weasley' with" actually seem pretty poor), and where he is really Manipulative and competent.

*** I will always think it would only be logical for the MI5 to have an Arcane Division that much like HK-42 does to Jedi is specialized in killing wizards, with things like sniper rifles and explosives.

We however never see an actual Wizard actually going against a competent armed muggle(Hagrid pulling a Superman on Vernon's shotgun barely counts), so we don't know if their shields could resist automatic fire, or even if they are fast enough to consistently dodge bullets, we don't know how fast spells move, if we go by movies it's something like an arrow more than a bullet for most of them(could it be like SW blasters, as in, only done that way for the audience)? Can they even react and apparate fast enough to dodge bullets?

Some people assume Wizards have faster reflexes and greater endurance/agility, that's okay, but some people them make them be bulletproof with the reflexes of Spider-Man.

I always imagined that the best weapon against a wizard is a surprise attack, with long-range silent weapons, because unlike Jedi, they lack the precog to "sense" imminent danger.

I also don't like when people just wank Muggles and have them solve everything easy with bullets, I too don't think guns mesh well with HP but I can look past it.

I did enjoy that fic where Harry writes The Queen in the Fifth Year and she steamrolls Fudge, dissolves the Ministry and sicks the SAS on Voldemort and his Death Eaters, it's a kind of a guilty pleasure.

I personally disagree with this idea. It is very heavily implied that, outside of Muggleborns families, the Prime Ministers are the only people, in Brittain who are told about the Magical World. And I don't see the utility of a Arcane Division. I mean, it's not like both worlds interact that much and when they do, we know that both the petty and heavy offences are handled by the Wizarding size (Arthur's office at the Ministry and the "officially" the Aurors). I also have a lot of reasons about why I think any average wizard should be able to just destroy a highly trained Muggle.

But this is fanfiction so everyone is free to have his opinions.

***** Who's to say some of the members of these divisions aren't muggleborn loyal to the Crown or Squibs?

How could any world government let another state composed of powerful beings run inside their own borders without any form of control? Don't you think these governments who are much better at fighting Shadow Wars than the mostly naive wizards would do something?

Yes, apparently the Statute of Secrecy actually works in that things are actually secret in canon, but realistically we know it wouldn't be so.

An average Wizard doesn't even know what a television is, I doubt they know how to deal with a sniper rifle, an average Wizard would also probably mess up their reaction upon an attack, there's a difference between knowing how to fire a Stunner or transfigure a shotgun into a salmon, and being able to do it under pressure at the drop of a hat.

I am not saying the muggle can win in a fair fight, but Special Forces don't fight fair. We know wizards can be surprised, and we know surprise attacks work on them(they rarely have passive defenses always on) so what stops one from being ambushed at long range?

The duel amongst the two most powerful wizards we see in the books( Dumbledore vs Voldemort) doesn't show superhuman reaction speed to transfigure hypersonic bullets in mid air, and we never saw a wizard have an accurate duel at more than low-midrange.

Say we place some bombs in a WW2 plane piloted by another wizard what stops him from bombing a cluster of wizards from high in the clouds, depending on the bomb they wouldn't even know before it was too late.

Imagine a Wizard fighting a Sith, an average Sith, what stops him from choking the Wizard or frying them before they can react, Wizards may have a bit faster reflexes, Force Users have light precog and it doesn't make them unbeatable.

EDIT: Yes, realistically a competent group of Wizards with the right knowledge could take over the muggle world quite easily, but the thing is that canonically Wizards are pretty ignorant of basic stuff, even and maybe especially the richer classes, Arthur was supposed to be an specialist and I doubt he understood the muggle government or that any wizard at all was trained in stuff like modern counterintelligence tactics. Grindelwald knew about Nuclear Weapons and Airplanes, he could have probably done, Voldemort was never that big of a threat outside of the UK after 10 years.

****** I'll start by mentioning that all of your "Arcane Force" rely on some Wizards loyal to the Crown, which already means it's not a Muggle Vs Wizard fight anymore but let's ignore it.

The point is that the average Wizard has no reason to ever fight a special force. Wizards thrive in the secrecy. For most witches and wizards, their live is probably spend in a handfull of selected places such as their house, the place they work, the Ministry for Magic and Diagon Alley. All of these places are enchanted in such a way that a Muggle would not even be able to enter there (except potentially the house but pretty much all the magical houses we see in canon have some sort of protection).

So whatever reason your sniper has, he will have a hard time to even locate a wizard. But even if he manage to aim for a wizard, he better not miss his shot. We know that Witches and Wizards are more resistant than the Muggles (just the bludger in Quidditch should be mortal risks). We also know that the Wizards can (once again) teleport. So there are only 2 scenarios from there :

1. The sniper miss his shot and you have a perfectly fine wizard who can flee to wherever he wants. Or a hurt wizard who will go to the hospital where he will perfectly healed or what supposed to be a grievous wound in a matter of hours
2. The sniper does not miss. And congratulation, you killed one wizard. Whoever is with him flee and you have now a bunch of angry wizard who will very quickly learn about "sniper" and will search for the sniper to punish him with extreme prejudice. Said wizards can teleport, impersonate anyone, make people forget about them and read mind, good luck escaping them.

As for the wizards "loyal to the crown". Between the magical world which educated them and gave them a job (in most case), and the muggle world they left at 11 and only saw for a handfull of monthes every year, I doubt a lot of muggleborn chose the latter. But even if some did, the ones who did are probably the one who are unhappy about their life in the magical world (so the ones with the less opportunities, the less talented one). The problem is that talking to a muggle about the magical world is a Breach of the Statute which, if found, would make them wanted by the Aurors.

Basically, I not only find it unlikely that the Muggles managed, in less than 100 years (there were a lot less of "counterintelligence" to speak of before the WWs) to create a counter organization right under the nose of the Wizarding world. I find it especially unlikely when you take into account how tiny the Wizarding world is (everyone know everyone). And finally, even if they did, said organization would need to rely on Wizard to even have a tiny chance to do anything, but, in my opinion, said wizards would transform the Muggle Vs Wizards fight into a Wizards Vs Wizards with some muggle puppets which would defeat the point.

** Integrating the muggle world into the magical one (or introducing it fully) is something that takes on a life of its own - even if the author doesn't think about it in the first place. Basically, it's opening up such a can of worms that they /have/ to write in a secondary plotline about it, or it'll just feel useless.

For guns, they have the downside of also likely taking over a fic. If you make guns too strong, then as an author you'd just have Harry around shooting people, which isn't that fun to read about. If you make them too weak, they're useless and why even introduce them? Striking a middle balance is difficult - and, IMO, should boil down to 'firearms are dangerous to wizards, require different shields to block the physical projectiles, and are deadly in ambush because of it' - and shouldn't be the default weapon of any wizard characters, save perhaps a few minor ones (like I could see Arthur Weasley doing so, or Mad Eye taking a liking to them).

But even in a muggle world meets Harry Potter story, the magic is still more of the draw than the guns - so ... it should stay that way ;)

** I mean, having muggle weapons in a story can work. It's just that the vast majority of these stories end up bashing the Wizarding world and making up rules about magic that aren't canon in order to make Wizards weaker.

** And believing that the governments of the world don't know about a magical society doesn't pass the laugh test considering computers/cctv etc. I mean cctv started in the late 40's and in the 1970's saw a major change in the technology. The UK saw widespread trials throughout the country in the early 90's. So there was a good chance that Wizards were captured on camera in the 90's. So I believe that most governments know that the magical side exists. In fact considering that the muggles knew about magic prior to the Statute of Secrecy being enacted and that bureaucracy loves paperwork evidence of a magical society exists in most countries.

I actually prefer the fics that use techomancy eg the combination of magic and muggle.

I think in a battle of magic versus muggle i think magic would eventually lose though there would be some horrific losses. Quite frankly I can't see a wizard's shields holding up to a sustained burst from a mini-gun (considering that shields will fail under multiple spell hits, multiple bullet hits should do similarly). Let alone missiles, bombs etc targeting from a distance that spells can not cope with.

Like I said I prefer the combination better. Eg pistol magazines charmed for hundreds of rounds versus the standard 10-15 rounds. The rounds being actually spells (eg reducto, diffindo, etc) then standard lead rounds. Hell even lead rounds with engraved shield breaker runes etc. If non magic knives and swords can injure wizards then obviously so can other weapons. It's how the story creates a believable backstory and how it weaves the use of muggle technology that will help to decide if the story arc is enjoyable.

Though i'm quite happy with fics that are pure magic.
