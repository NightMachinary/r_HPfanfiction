This is one thing that is common throughout a lot of Fanfiction but I just can't see it.

I mean Quidditch isn't like Rugby or some other intensive sport, they quite literally sit on a broom the entire time and throw the quaffle in the case of chasers, but Harry doesn't even do that. He just extends his arm and catches the snitch.

So have any of you seen this a lot or is it just me?


** While it /is/ probably overdone, have you ever seen an overweight competition equestrian? It is important to be fit because excess weight is obviously a bad thing and even though they're 'just sitting down' there's a lot of work involved in actually controlling the horse.

Something similar could be said for Quidditch, though I admit it seems unlikely that it would lead to the broad-shoulders-rippling-pecs look that seems to be common. It would almost certainly result in a fairly decent level of fitness to perform well.

*** It might be the tossing and catching balls at high velocities, holding onto the bat to hit a bludger going in the opposite direction, and simply holding them, if they're heavy enough.

Which doesn't cover seekers, of course, but there, 3 of 4 roles will require fitness, and every member but one will be fit.

***** Teenage characters are pretty hard to write for me, actually. I don't remember much from my puberty, other than that it was chaos. No control of my emotions and incredibly lazy at the same time. I don't even know when I first started noticing girls and how that progressed. One year I was playing football and rolling around in the grass carelessly, the other year I couldn't stop thinking about my crush. It's empty in between that. So that makes it pretty hard to write about a boy in puberty.

** I can imagine that actually training to fly could strengthen ones leg and butt muscles. It's probably also good for endurance. But no Quidditch player gets six-packed by flying alone.

** Probably not as much as romanticized as in fanfiction but considering leg muscles and core/ab muscles need to toned, yes. It's not inaccurate to say Quidditch makes you fit.

Also, it's sort of canon? JKR never really mentions overweight professional Quidditch players, and considering the craze over how good looking Cedric and Krum were, it's not too far a stretch that these boys were stereotypically athletic jocks just for playing seeker.

  He, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together on Saturday and set off through the cold, wet grounds toward the gates. As they passed the Durmstrang ship moored in the lake, they saw Viktor Krum emerge onto the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. He was very skinny indeed, but apparently a lot tougher than he looked, because he climbed up onto the side of the ship, stretched out his arms, and dived, right into the lake.

** I could see Quidditch being a lot of core muscle work. It would be a lot of leaning and twisting, not to mention having to keep yourself balanced on the broom while flying through the air and sometimes pulling off acrobatic stunts. Especially if you're a seeker or keeper; a keeper would be stretching out and tossing himself in front of the hoops all the time, and a seeker would be shifting his weight and leaning to gain speed, dodge bludgers, pull out of dives, etc.

You probably /would/ amass a healthy physique playing quidditch. Probably won't gain large, rippling muscles or anything like that, but I'd imagine riding a broomstick would be a lot like riding a horse. Believe me, after a day spent maneuvering one of those your thighs and abdomen are /so/ /sore/. On a broomstick you would be twisting your torso this way and that, working that particular area on your body (and gripping the broomstick with your thighs, etc.).
