Hello all.

I hope you can help. I'm looking for a particular fic but I can only remember one or two bits. I think Harry realises that he has to be the one to kill Voldemort and tries to get involved in the war effort. There is a particular scene wherein Harry is with Ron & Hermione. They run into death eaters and one of them is in danger. Harry casts 'Sectumsempra' repeatedly and kills three (I think) of the death eaters to save them. Harry doesn't feel remorse as he has already killed before (I think by knocking some death eaters off a cliff or by cutting a rope they were climbing up somewhere near Voldemort's old orphanage), but is worried about their reaction. I remember it being well-written.

If anyone can remember what fic this is and has a link, they'd be my hero!


** Do you recall the pairing/ships? That would help identify it, maybe.

*** Thanks for replying. I think it was Draco/Harry but I could be wrong.

** Remembered it! It was The Dark Side of the Light by Maya. Unfortunately she removed all her fics from the internet when became a published author.

Would love to read any others where Harry (realistically!) takes part in the war and kills death eaters if anybody knows of them.
