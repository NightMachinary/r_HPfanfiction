** Harry's twin gets a second chance, fucks up and Harry goes back in time preventing his twin's mistakes without telling him. Story doesn't cover the first two timelines. Only the one where Harry goes back in time with explanation for the other two. Don't stop reading after the first few chapters. It has a very cliched beginning, but it gets better.

Warning tho, WBWL, Dickhead!Dumbles, Asshole!Twin, Harem.

  Harry Potter has been banged up for ten years in the hellhole brig of Azkaban for a crime he didn't commit, and his traitorous brother, the not-really-boy-who-lived, has royally messed things up. After meeting Fate and Death, Harry is given a second chance to squash Voldemort, dodge a thousand years in prison, and snatch everything his hated brother holds dear. H/Hr/LL/DG/GW.
