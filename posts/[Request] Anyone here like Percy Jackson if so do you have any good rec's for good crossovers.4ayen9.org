** Easy answer.

1. Yes

2. No

Seriously almost all of them are rubbish in my opinion. They tend to follow the same trope over and over. Percy and all the other demigods go to Hogwarts for "Insert reason here" They are mostly badly written and boring.

*** It's the fandom. Preteens and teenagers /everywhere/. There's probably 10 fics or so out of the lot that are worth reading, and that's just the main fandom. Surprisingly (or maybe not, if someone goes from HP to PJO and not vice versa) there are a few decent crossovers out there, though they hardly update regularly.

***** ...Um. I was generalizing, honestly. I only have seven in my favorites, myself, but I'll admit I haven't trawled the PJO fandom like I have HP (cuz' it's /shit/).

/shuffles through favorites list/

Ok, revising my statement. If there are ten good fics from the main fandom, I don't have them. What I do have is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5884448/1/A-Goddess-s-Lament][this]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9499278/1/Percy-s-Bullies][this]]. I also have some crossovers with the Kane Chronicles 'verse, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5953965/1/The-Death-God-Alliance][this]] (and its sequels) and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7430159/1/call-me-on-and-on-across-the-universe][this]] which I suppose don't really count as a crossover if I nitpick. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8402839/1/Demigod-Project][This]] is an AU with a fairly interesting premise, and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7059001/1/Touch][this]] is in my favorites because I ship Percy/Thalia /so hard/.

If I had to recommend one, though, it would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10043079/1/Son-of-the-Western-Sea][this]]. Son of the Western Sea is basically a mythological expansion pack, very informative, and extremely well done. Sadly I don't know if it will update again.

Errr...the PJ books take place today. As in, even later than the Potterverse. Even the original Greek myths have monsters and enemies that would call for up to a kiloton of TNT to put down. And that's not counting the further explored powers monsters have in the Percy Jackson world, or beings like the Giants and Titans being fair game.

Never mind how supremely ironic this whole statement is. As if the infamous RMwS has not been demonstrated to be able to put down most wizards. As if there is any wizard in HP that would survive an RPG to the face.

And you're just proving my point. Almost all the great feats you can pull up in the HP verse are backstory, and backstory that's talked about as extremely rare, extremely dangerous and/or unrepeatable things done by singular people, but you make it sound as though any Hogwarts graduate can do them. Unless you want to do a crossover with the Founders' era, again there are like ten people max in the present-day wizarding world that are semi-competent enough to rank with the present-day /children/ in the PJ world. Children who have done such things as /hold up the entire sky/.

Time manipulation isn't a stranger to the PJ verse either.

And you're exaggerating what happened with Eloise Mintumble. /One/ day passed by in a few hours, counterbalanced by another having more hours than usual, and the Ministry had "great trouble" sorting the whole thing out. On the other hand the Mist casually and passively keeps mortals ignorant and/or forgetful of magic, with no need for difficult fancy spellwork.

Bold statement, when "modern weapons" includes such things as the Tsar Bomba.

And no, they were killed with superhuman strength /and/ magical weapons /and/ magical abilities /and/ (in many of the original myths) divine/semi-divine intervention. But hey, feel free to take up your rifle against Typhon or Scylla and Charybdis. They /could/ theoretically be killed by superhuman strength after all.

Also I really don't get this argument, because it's not like HP people and creatures are immune to bullets in the head. Or being torn apart with superhuman strength. Unlike creatures like the Nemean Lion, whose schtick is that it's impervious to attack.

They're not zombies so much as the literal dead. They cannot feel pain, cannot /feel/, and are armed with actual munitions (so much for your overhead wizard, and by the way since when could every wizard turn invisible and fly /consistently/?). Even inferi could only be stopped by fire and Dumbledore's fire at that; Harry's spells were barely slowing them down.

And oh, he can heal them. Because they're dead and he's part master of death. Which, unlike possessing the Hallows, means his temper can freeze giant caverns, he can summon any of the creatures of Hades (this includes such beings as the Furies), he can forcibly claim souls that have cheated death and send them to Hades (sorry, Voldemort), he can invade dreams and force dreams on people (which forcibly sends them to sleep), he radiates fear so intense that armies have backed away from him, and he can manipulate shadows and use them as weapons. But sure, it's all just "hit things really hard". Because as we all know Rowling invented magic and it only exists in the HP verse in the form of pseudo-Latin spells. /s

Never mind that demigods have resisted mind control and manipulation /by actual gods/. Wizards are going to turn them into imperiused tools using a spell that can be resisted by a fourteen year old with zero training. Yup.

This is exactly the problem with crossovers; no sense of balance whatsoever. I mean it's not like you have to stop and go read the entirety of PJ and the Olympians and Heroes of Olympus before you can have a conversation, but at least do the minimum of Googling if you want to talk about it. Or perhaps I should start judging the HP verse on Philosopher's Stone alone.

Rowling didn't invent magic, but anyone who played D&D for example knows that the ability to mind control beats the ability to destroy stuff.

*************** Ok lets get this straight. The PJ series will ANNIHILATE the HP series any day of the week if we're going by canon. In the first books both characters learn what they really are yet Harry learnt how to use his powers before Percy did e.g Apparition to get away from dudley or when he grew back his hair. all Percy knew was that he really like the oceans and anything to do with water really.

Over the course of each book Harry learns how to do magic due to professors and his friends and even takes out a troll early on and then proceeds to stop the PS or SS (depends where you were from) from being stolen by killing Quirrel and having Voldemorts soul fly away.

Percy on the other hand didn't know who his godly parent was until Capture The Flag when he was fighting Clarrise and the water gave him a power boost. Before this we see him take down a Minotaur while he's on his way to camp, he has no experience fighting but was able to move fast and had the slight power boost because of the rain. Skip a bit and he goes on a quest to find Zeus's lightning bolt not much really happens apart from him you know... Fighting fucking ARES on a beach and fighting him to a STAND STILL and I don't know TRAVELLING TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL to save his mum. And then FINALLY being able to use his water powers to stop Luke stopping him from getting to Olympus.

There is a 1 (Percy is 12 Harry is 11) yr age gap but Percy was at a disadvantage because he wasn't really able to use his powers until the end of the book and had bare minimal when it comes to fighting over the course of a summer. Meanwhile Harry is getting training over the period of a year in magic that can do like [[/u/Starfox5]] is talking about like; apparation, obliviation, transfiguration, fidelius and much more (well not that stuff in year 1 but does learn it).

Easily the PJ series trumps the HP series there even when the main character has less training and guidance.

I'm not going to do each of the books but over time the HP series barely makes any headway into being as strong as the PJ series. By the end of the series for HP as well all know Harry kills himself to end the war, he ends up living and he beats Voldemort simple. But he's 17? 18? when he does it. Percy Is 16 and he defends Manhattan from TITANS and MONSTERS as well as CHRONOS you know the guy who helped his mum kill his dad by slicing and dicing him up? Yea that guy who Luke revived and is acting as a Vassal for as well as the guy who bathed in the river Styx and only has 1 weakness. Now lets not forget how Percy Summons a wild pig (Wild boar from Pan essentially) and uses it to help him beat 1 of the titans by turning him into a giant tree. He also bathed in the river Styx so there is that weakness gone from him and he also creates Hurricanes and Tornadoes and flooding.

Now [[/u/chaosattractor]] Nico was only able to ShadowTravel in the 2nd PJ series after being taught by his dad (I believe, either way he could only do it in the 2nd series) and when It came to raising the dead in the 2nd series he needed to be the position that Reyna of Preator was so that he could control and summon the higher ranking soldiers, otherwise they'd just lumber around being shields.

Lets not forget how there's probably like 1/100000 amount of half-bloods as there is wizards and witches (not including squids)

The wizards and even humans would get utterly trumped by the half-bloods alone not even including the gods. Like it took a half-blood AND a god to beat a giant but the gods had to give the finishing blow meaning the half-bloods had to do a lot of the work to weaken them first.

And this is why crossovers suck. Because people who haven't even read a series will sit and claim that beings who are /greater than the gods/ are the same as lumbering semi-sapient creatures on the border between beasts and beings. I mean, by that logic demigods don't even exist because after all the Greco-Roman gods don't live in the US in the Harry Potter world. By the way, it's amazing how it's the PJ verse that automatically gives way to HP, isn't it?

I have no idea why you're making assertions about the PJ universe when by your own admission you haven't even read the books. At this point it isn't even annoying anymore, just plainly a bad-faith discussion.

*** Sure.

Linkffn(Legacy of Asgard)

Linkffn(The Queen's Champion)

Those are favorites although all of his work is great.

Linkffn(9991011) Again this my favorite but all of hers are great.

Finally linkffn(8762282)

I could probably find a few more in my favorites if you don't like them.

**** I love anaklusmos14! It's been awhile since I've read is more recent stuff I need to catch back up. But even the early works are great, though coming back to them I see that they've really improved as a writer. Don't get me wrong, I love, love, love, queen's champion, but Anaklusmos does get better in technical skills and plot elements with the later stories.

  The war is over, stopped when a sacrifice was made. Percy ended the war with his life but what if he wasn't just a demigod, rather much more. Percy is the unknown and now he watches over his family and friends. But he pays special attention to the only one to capture his heart, the goddess of the moon.

  Percy Jackson is a demigod. But he is not a son of Poseidon. He is not even Greek. A Norse goddess has her sights set on Midgard and Percy is the last of his people left on earth as he awaits his destiny. To reach it, grudges and prejudices must be forgotten and he must find acceptance in a world in which he does not belong. AU of Percy's life as a Norse demigod.

  Percy is betrayed by the person he trusted most. Not what you expect, you'll see. Lost, he vanished without a trace. He returns a different man with a close relationship with the least likely goddess. No HOO...yet. What will happen when new threats rise. Will he fight? No percabeth whatsoever in this fic. Complete!
