I come across is surprisingly often. I get that lots of people out there are transphobic, but it always catches me off guard when an otherwise lovely fic is interrupted with making trans people the butt of a joke. How do you folks deal with that - review, stop reading, read all the reviews beforehand on the off chance that someone else cared enough? Something else?


** For me, if I see something that suggests the world view of the author and myself are incompatible, I just close and move on. There are plenty of enjoyable authors out there who I can give me time and kudos to.

**** I think that's just the hazard of reading fic in such a large fandom. To be honest though, I can't recall seeing much transphobia in HP fandom, and as I'm trans myself I usually notice that sort of thing. Fandom can vary wildly based on pairings and types of fic though.

** Do you have examples? In 19 years and many hundreds of millions of words in HP fanfiction that hasn't happened to me once.

Sure, they are made fun of by the expected characters, like the usual Slytherins, but not by the author. Wouldn't be very good writing if Malfoy wouldn't make fun of Harry for being trans. But it sounds like you are complaining about transphobic authors and not transphobic characters, which are a must have if the fic wants to reflect the reality. Sad, but true.

**** Ah ok, yea the old metamorph gender switch theme. True, now that you mention it that happens more often. When I read your post I only thought about fics that actually had a trans character.

In the case of the metamorph situation, it is often such a small part of the fic, that it will be very hard to know beforehand sadly.

I think the only way to make sure would be to read many pages of reviews in the hopes that someone else called the author out on their bullshit.

I was obviously not talking about total AU fics but about fics trying to show how a trans character would fare in the magical world when that world reflects the current real world. Thats what like 95% of the trans fics I have read do after all.

***** I agree that if we're positing that these particular Muggle biases exist in the Wizarding World as well, Draco would likely display them. And I'm not, mind you, making a value judgement about whether it's a /right/ move to posit a Wizarding World that's free of all Muggle prejudices and only has to deal with its /own/ flavors of bigotry; certainly I wouldn't want to prevent trans folk from using a HP fanfic as a way to express their own experiences.

But I'm going to have to disagree about which position is more likely to be the AU, compared to what we can glean about the canonical universe. I would find it more surprising than not if there /weren't/ a biological-sex-change potion easily available at St. Mungo's, Divination techniques to find your true self, and so on and so forth.

(As an extrapolation of what the Wizarding World is like in the books /per se/, anyway. If I start to ask myself what J.K. Rowling would answer if asked how trans people are treated in her world, the answer might be as different from the above as it would be... unpleasant.)

**** omg yes this like yes its totally possible the wizarding world super transphobic. But it doesn't have to be or it can be significantly less so. This is a magical world gender reassignment could be done in like a day and boom no time period needed for hormones to work or like to recover or even have scars. I mean you can make it be more of a transition. But you don't have to. Its a magical world its a fanfic you can do anything.

I saw an argument once with gay romance in hp fic. There doesn't have to be a stigma even in high class pureblood society. There can be but you can definetly make it so there isnt or much less. And it can be really cool world building

There is definetly bigotry in the wizarding world. But its still a different world its entirely possible that some forms of bigotry that exist in our world don't for them. And it doesn't mean the more elitist purebloods stopped being bigots. They just arent bigoted in the same exact ways bigots in our world are.

**** Depends on how it affects magical inheritance. There could be something at play that with the way some ancient magics work family magic can only be passed down through a child of a marriage between a man and woman. It could lead to some purebloods being very anti-transitioning even if it wouldn't affect most people. Once you have a cultural belief creeping into a society that way, it isn't weird for it to spread.

Note, I'm not saying you /have/ to do this. Just that it could work as a narrative reasoning. It is already established in canon that purebloods are irrational bigots about some things, so it isn't a big stretch to make them bigots about other things.

We do also know that magic is inheritable and that hybrids between witches/wizards and other sentient creatures maintain traits of both. So, specific magical themes running along family lines isn't that much of a stretch.

I always got the feeling that the Wizarding World held /more/ prejudices than the muggle world. Maybe not necessarily all of the same ones as the muggle world, but certainly more in total. I think it makes for a fair vehicle for exploring other prejudices even if they aren't ones addressed in canon.

I've actually played with the idea that family magic involves two separate threads. One is a family line of some sort of affinity for an element or concept while the other is the presence of magic in the individual. The former would be present in all families even if the family didn't have magic. Then, when a muggleborn entered existence they do have a tie to family magic, but they just wouldn't know what their family magic is because without a family history of general magic there was no manifestation of whatever the family affinity was. It lets you play with the concept of family magic while keeping the idea that the Death Eaters were still just plain racist.

In particular, I was thinking of using the concept for a Frozen crossover where Elsa is a muggleborn and has her ice powers because the Royal Family of Norway has a connection with ice as an element. She would attend Hogwarts without announcing herself as royalty, so the purebloods would all assume that she was from some pureblood family from Norway that they just hadn't heard of while meanwhile she would think of herself as muggleborn and get offended every time they started being racist. I thought it might be an interesting way to explore the idea of racist people relaxing and speaking their mind around "their people" and not realizing that they are being racist right to someone's face. It is something I have encountered myself IRL being Jewish but not looking like a stereotypical Jew.

Unfortunately, that story idea is currently stuck in development hell and exists only as an outline with no drafts. I have been bugged by some friends who want to read it, but it needs to be a longfic and I struggle getting those rolling.

***** I mean its not like I don't see why people do purebloods as being bigoted in all ways. My argument is you don't have to do it that way all the time.

They can be racist as classist but not homophobic and that doesn't make them secretly good if they are Death Eaters who are actively trying to start a genocide. You can have bigoted chatacters while still making homophobia essentially non existent. Race bigots existing doesn't mean homophobia has to too.

My personal headcanon is that it very common for Purebloods to get arranged marriages they get as buisness ventures while having lovers who they openly acknowledge as lovers who they don't have kids with.

The kids they have in marriages are essentially magical test tube babies. It's not necessary they live together and most often live with their lovers separate from their spouses while the child goes between the two.

That way their blood purity is ensured and gay romance isn't necessary frowned on. And now you got this less common culture for purebloods to explore which still fits into book canon

I think it's good to see posts like this one that can help spread awareness of the existence of such fics so that I can be on the lookout for them in the future, and even better, be sure not to become such an author myself.
