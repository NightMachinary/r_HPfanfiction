Assuming that he doesn't have any blood relatives close enough for Lily's protection, I think that Dumbledore would have raised him himself within Hogwarts. By the end of the first war, the only surviving members of the Order were himself, Madeye, Aberforth, Arabella, Elphias Doge, Emmeline Vance, Lupin, Mundungus, Hagrid, Sturgis Podmore, Dedalus Diggle and technically the Longbottoms and Sirius. I don't really think any of those would have really great parents. Although we don't know a ton about Elphias, Emmealine, Sturfus and Dedalus.

Bonus points: how would the books have played out?


** Assuming the Dursleys don't have a means to get a message to Dumbledore, they call the police to report an abandoned child - they, of course, burn the letter Dumbledore left without reading it, to ensure there's no evidence linking them to the brat. (Dumbledore, assuming Petunia was as nice as he thought Lily was, didn't bother putting any magic on the letter to prevent this. I mean, seriously, he thinks, orphanages are terrible places and nobody would willingly dump a child in one. He, of course, doesn't know the Dursleys and also doesn't know that orphanages haven't been a thing in years.)

The police, while canvassing the neighbourhood for any witnesses to the abandonment, call in Surrey County Council's childrens' services social workers, who call around their roster of emergency fosterers to see who has room for a little one. Police enquiries appear to be going nowhere, but childrens' services aren't going to return the child to whoever dumped him. So they're notifying adoption and fostering agencies to get the baby placed long term.

By the time his Hogwarts letter arrives, he has a different name - he'll have gone through the courts as Baby A or similar - the benefit of being brought up by the kind of decent people who offer foster homes, and may well have been adopted by his new family. He'll have no memory of ever answering to 'Harry' at all.

*** That's definitely a very literal interpretation. I like it.

I think Dumbledore would have intervened had they refused though. He is powerful enough to figure out the muggle foster care system.

Using magic it would not be that difficult to find an infant who has a strongly distinguishing scar in the foster care system.

*** i think it doesnt matter, if his name was changed. I would imagine, the magical Society/government would find the Kids with something similar if not the same as the Trace. Remember when the Dursleys left their Home and the Letters always found them?

​

What im more concerned is, how the Muggle society would behaved, if multiple "accidents" happen, because the Baby is Crying. If they would call it "random accidents" or if they would link these with the Baby.

***** This. The interesting question is: when it comes time to send out the invite letters, does the quill write Harry Potter or his new name? It's an accurate enough divining tool to get which room he's sleeping in, or at least last slept in (headcanon: the letters go out in summer and a fair few each year get addressed to Treehouse or Tent In Back Garden or similar.)

The Hogwarts quill clearly doesn't record births, or Neville wouldn't have got the ration of shit he did - doesn't matter if he lacks accidental magic, clearly Hogwarts thinks he's worth an invite.

****** not the Hogwarts Quill, but the Ministry. The Letters come from them (if i remember correctly). And i dont understand your Point with Neville. If you are saying that Neville wouldnt have got his Letter, if he wouldnt have been Forced to perform magic to save himself, then you are Wrong. Remember: Hogwarts is a School and these institutes teach something that lies within the individuals. Some are aware of their talent and are eager to find and train it, some are just cool about it and be rather lazy about their training and some others are totally suprised and just have lack of self-confident to use their Talent properly. If his Parents wouldnt have died or his Grandmother would have treated him better, he wouldnt be a nervous Wrack and better in what his nature is.

​

i think, Nevilles report about his Family was desperate to force the Magic out of the Son was just an exaggerated moment from the Author to create a funny/hilarious scene (as anything in Book 1, it was the entry and a childbook after all). Sure, there might be such People out there in every Society, but their desperation was without any need. If Neville would have been a Squib, he wouldnt be invited by Hogwarts, he he had magical Potential, the Letter would have come. If his Parents would reallly be like that (or rather his Grandfather as he was the one threatening his life), then i must say, they are snobbish.

***** the thing is: muggleborn are no "bulk Freight", they are produced and live scattered in the whole Country and World. I would say, it would be a coincidence if the Parent of a Muggleborn randomly witnessing the same "supernatural things" happen, when the Baby is in the mood. Ok, no muggle would ever pose that his/her child is Magical to the normal society, but i guess the correct treatment would still be out of reach.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

** The first comment sums it up quite nicely. But you seem to focus more on the Magical side. Assuming Dumbledore doesnt move on with his shoddy excuse of safety and blood protections and dumps Harry with the Muggles, I doubt he would go to any of those you listed. The kid /had/ blood relatives in the Magical world, Narcissa and Andromeda. The first one is pretty much out of the question, so he most likely would have ended up growing with the Tonks family.
