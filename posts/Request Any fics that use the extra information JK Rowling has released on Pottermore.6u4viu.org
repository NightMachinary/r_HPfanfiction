I'm fascinated by the extra world information Rowling has released on Pottermore; the Quidditch World Cup that no one can remember, the African wizarding school that has an anamagi school team, the unassuming boy with the mouse Patronus that held off an army of dementors, etc... it's just full of wonderful plot bunnies.


** linkffn(6337450) It goes into great depth of trying to reconcile the Pottermore Merlin stuff. So much so that it pretty much derails the entire story. It's not a bad story up to that point (chapter 30 ish), but it is quite wordy without anything of real note happening.

** Matou Shinji Series: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Philosopher-s-Stone][Matou Shinji and the Philosopher's Stone]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10918531/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Heirs-of-Slytherin][Matou Shinji and the Heirs of Slytherin]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11407944/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Master-of-Death][Matou Shinji and the Master of Death]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11686212/1/Matou-Shinji-and-the-Broken-Chains][Matou Shinji and the Broken Chains]] - It's a crossover between Harry Potter, Nasuverse, and the Assassins Creed, but it doesn't require knowledge of either. Matou Shinji, the protagonist, is unable to become magus and that makes him a failure to his family. He would completely break, but he gets a letter from Hogwarts. Wanting praise and attention he focuses on giving his best to succeed at witchcraft. Will he obtain what he seeks? What will come with his friendship with Boy-Who-Lives? And why Hogwarts? Featuring two Voldemorts, rapist tanuki, Draco Malfoy working part-time at Saint Mungo and assassin creating elite school club. Nice blend of obscure elements of both settings with author's original ideas.

There is really a lot of Pottermore stuff here, despite it being obviously AU setting because of it being crossover.

Example:

#+begin_quote
  "Why, from my late father, a distinguished member of the Wizengamot who fought beside Lyall Lupin for the extermination of the weres," Umbridge said with saccharine sweetness. "He was a brave man, but was heartbroken when the blood-traitor turned against his ideals, and we were left with this blight against wizardkind. The work I do is in his memory."

  "And you are a pureblood, yes? Descended from the Selwyn family?"

  "Hem hem," Umbridge coughed yet again. "You seem to know my history well, Professor. If only you knew your lessons as well."

  She gave Lockhart a smile -- one that froze on her face when Lockhart smiled in turn, his expression seeming entirely too casual for Shinji's comfort.

  "But Dolores, I seem to recall speaking to your father - Orford Umbridge -- just the other day."

  "Hm? Oroford? I don't know such a man," the woman replied, her eyes hardening. "Even if you---"

  "Funny," Lockhart interrupted, his smile broadening even more if it were possible, growing somehow sharper. "He says he knows you, and that you owe him quite a bit of money."

  "Hem, now now, Gilderoy, we mustn't tell lies now..."

  But Gilderoy Lockhart was not to be dissuaded.

  "You know, the money you pressured him into retiring early for, so you could hide the records that your father was merely a low-level worker in the Department of Magical Maintenance...and yourself a half-blood."

  "I'm sure the man was quite confused," Umbridge replied with false sweetness. "My father is dead, after all. But again, Professor, you shouldn't repeat the lies others tell you. You never know when you might anger some rather important people."

  Ladies of Eternity, magi of the past hiding in the present. Those words describe Witches in the Moonlit world, with their daughters inheriting their role without exceptions. But this is a story of a Witch's son -- a boy tossed aside by cruel fate. A boy who dreamed of becoming a magus, but failed. A boy, who carves his path through blood and wand. A Boy, a Potter, and a Thief.

** For the moment, the only thing I can think of is the excellent linkffn(Barefoot by Zaxaramas) using the Ekrizdis backstory for Azkaban as a plot point and expanding greatly upon it.

** Linkffn(against my nature by Araceil)

I think it does that, since the information on magical creatures is more extensive than what we see in books. But I am not sure how legit it is. Well, some of it is... Very interesting fic nonetheless, with all of the action happening in places other then Great Britain.
