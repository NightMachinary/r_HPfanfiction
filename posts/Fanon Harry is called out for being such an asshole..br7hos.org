** The request is a bit self-contradicting, since practically any writer who would write a fanon Harry would also buy into the fanon and therefore consider anything that Harry does to be above reproach. Though, I guess if the point is to bash the character doing the calling-out, it might work.

​

A while ago, I wrote a snippet that plays with the idea. Here's a repost:

​

“Even if Molly tried to use a Love Potion on you, what were you /thinking/, using Dark Magic on Ron?! Do you realise how hard it must have been for Dumbledore to keep you out of Azkaban?”

“That old coot? When did he ever lift a finger to help me? No, I merely claimed my title as Lord Potter-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Black, and invoked the ancient law of sippenhaft to administer a proper chastising to the offender's family. Pray that I do not administer one to you!”

Hermione couldn't help but take a step back. Just in the past week, the world had gone mad. Harry had discovered hitherto unheard-of tools, powers, and inheritances---and she was glad. Then, Molly Weasley had tried to potion him into love with Ginny---and she was surprised and disgusted. With Molly having fled, Harry had cursed Ron in her place and told off Dumbledore---and she was terrified. She took a deep breath.

“What's gotten into you, Harry? You've discovered some ancestors, some money and artefacts, and you're suddenly acting like you're better than everyone, insulting Dumbledore, cursing Ron, and threatening me.”

“Dumbledore hid my birthright from me! He suppressed my potential!”

“That's ridiculous!” Hermione /did not/ say, instead forcing herself to take another breath. /Someone/ had to be the adult in the situation. She phrased her reply carefully. “He did? How did you discover it? Dumbledore has forgotten more about magic and scheming that either of us have ever known.”

Harry nodded. “I'll show you.”

He took her hand and led her through the hallways of 12 Grimmauld place, past the mounted house-elf heads, down the stairs, and into the small dungeon that made up its basement. Hermione cringed as the already grim ambience of the old Black house was amplified tenfold, but Harry seemed unaffected.

They stopped in front of a door, which Harry opened with a wave of his hand, before pulling Hermione inside. (Casual wandless magic, Hermione noted.)

In the centre of the room floated a sphere about two meters in diameter, in Hermione's estimation. It was perfectly black, yet it pulsated with a colour that Hermione could see but could not name. Web-like tendrils of the same colour spread from the orb to the floor and to the ceiling, running up and down the walls.

“She came to me the night I came back to the Dursleys', and she explained everything. Everything.”

Harry was grasping her arm both both hands, his green eyes wide open in his excitement. She barely kept from recoiling as she saw that, in his eyes, the same tendrils could be seen pulsating in time with the orb. “And then, she offered to help. And she did.

“I can't believe I used to be so excited about things like Quiddich and the pitiful war between Dumbledore and Voldemort. I am the Chosen One, the heir of every important wizard line, the apex and the nexus of human magic. Dumbledore, Voldemort, the Malfoys, they all pretend to be fighting each other, but really, they are all working together to use me and to suppress my potential...”

Hermione tuned out the rest of his speech, because the orb---it was talking to her---had more important things to say.

/Purebloods get their family's secret knowledge and tutors, even Harry gets a magical cloak, his mother's protection, Patronus lessons, and Occlumency lessons from a master---which he throws away over a petty personality conflict, while/ */you/*, /everything/ */you/* /know, you have to work for. And, in the end, you work harder than anyone else, but all you get is a pat on the head from the teachers, and a solid reputation as the reliable sidekick of the Boy Who Lived./

/You've spent so much time helping others get better at defensive magic, you've gotten an EE on the Defense OWL. An EE! Even now, you are putting yourself into unknown danger, just to help Harry out of his latest mess./

/But, you wouldn't mind helping, as long as people would/ */let themselves be helped/*, /but it never sticks, does it? Merlin forbid they actually exercise some patience and caution, and maybe even crack open a book that they weren't forced to on pain of death. Merlin forbid they do something because it's the right thing to do, like free their slaves, even if it makes their lives just a tiny bit harder. And those people are supposedly/ */on your side!/*

/Why can't people be more sensible?! If they were more sensible, they would appreciate all that you have done for them, and they would agree with your ideas and advice./ */Someone/* /needs to make people more sensible, but nobody but you seems to be interested in the project. Together, though,/ */we/* /could do it./

*** Simple, have the book characters meet their fanon selves.

Also, that was quite a good segment. Interesting to see where it leads.

**** I think that characters meeting their fanon selves is bit too meta, though it might make sense as a one-shot to explore the concept.

I'm glad you liked the snippet. I don't currently have any plans to continue it, but the idea---to the extent that I have a coherent one---is that the entity is some kind of a reality-bending parasite. It doesn't have much will of its own but piggybacks on the the desires and insecurities of its victims, bending reality to both validate and placate their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Id][id]], and ultimately driving them to self-destruction.

  AU. Harry, just another normal Hogwarts student with no evil whatsoever plaguing his life, really likes Hermione Granger, who won't even give him the time of day. How is he going to win her heart? By being a complete tosser, of course. Boys are idiots.

**** That awkward moment where Harmony is your favorite ship but you don't much care for Jily and aren't sure if you're excited about a new recommendation or skeptical about that relationship dynamic being imposed.

***** Jily doesn't come in to it very much. The Harmony is Jily-esque but done reasonably well. And the whole thing is only 40K words. It works as a quick and silly romance and actually has a few nice moments in it.

And I hope to hell TE7 doesn't see me using those pairing terms or I'll never hear the end of it.
