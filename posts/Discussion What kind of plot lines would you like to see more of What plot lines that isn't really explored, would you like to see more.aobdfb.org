Just as it says in the title, could be something that was touched on in canon, but wasn't fully developed, could be something from a fanfiction that you once read, that you found really interesting; and wouldn't mind it explored more, or what have you.

*** Pretty much this. 99% of all ff has Harry either becoming an Auror (after the "I've had enough trouble for a lifetime" line in DH), a teacher at Hogwarts, or sitting around in his house getting drunk.

Very few have Harry travel the world and explore other areas of magic.

*** Same. Though I understand that it's unappealing to write as that kind of story demands a lot of world building and original characters. It ain't easy.

I picture Harry, freshly done with the war and the immediate cool down period afterwards, just deciding to get out of Britain for a bit. Nothing dramatic, he says goodbye to everyone and he keeps in contact, but he needs a break from the Ministry and being the Boy-Who-Lived and all that.

It starts simple; he visits places that are off the beaten path and less likely to recognize him at a glance. A little while passes by and honestly he's getting bored - considering going back home to settle down - when he hears something interesting. Whatever it is, it seems fairly innocent, but digs up a different shade of the curiosity that drove him to try and solve mysteries when he was 11. It's a bit dangerous but not much, rather thrilling, and he ends up encountering something really cool. His interest in traveling is revitalized.

This sort of thing repeats a couple of times, and he begins to run into more dangerous and challenging obstacles. He reaches out to his good friends Bill and Fleur, who are more than happy to give advice and show him some of the cursebreaking ropes. Maybe if he finds something particularly interesting they'd join up with him for a bit. I can imagine him doing the same with a more grown Neville, if exotic and dangerous magical plants are particularly relevant. Hagrid too, come to think of it, but obviously for magical creatures not plants.

Other times Harry may be stuck in a way that they can't help him, so he consults with the deviously creative geniuses that he knows - Fred and Hermione (and maybe George, you wouldn't find me complaining if he survived). Over time they end up providing him with a variety of interesting and unique magical tools, and he reciprocates by telling them all about anything he finds.

Harry's saving people thing flares up from time to time of course, just to spice things up. I basically imagine him becoming something that resembles a magical Indiana Jones.

I'm not sure where Ron would really fit, because I don't imagine him wanting to leave Britain and Hermione behind, nor does he have the expertise to be relevant to the story. I suppose I'd probably keep George alive, have Ron die in the war, and use his death as one of the factors that leads to Harry choosing to start his traveling.

I mean, the idea is shot to hell because others know he's Fred during the moment of his death, plus the whole missing ear part, but I guess you could AU those out of the universe.

But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** I'd love to see more short-form mystery fics that could take place during the weeks or months that Rowling skips in canon, a la The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks. I've always felt that canon was a lot more engaging when it revolved almost completely around the yearly mystery, rather than the increasing war stuff in the later books, and the idea of the trio getting into little mini-mysteries during the "down-time" in canon is pretty cool.

And in the exact opposite direction, I'd love to see more fics where the fantasy aspect gets dialed up to 11. More world-building, more inventive spells and artificing, going out on dangerous adventures to exotic and fantastical locales; basically I'd love to see someone write their HP fic as a D&D campaign.

*** Quite possibly my favourite fic of all time is an HP/D&D crossover called Harry Potter and the Natural 20. The protagonist is one of the biggest munchkins to exist, and the plot is really engaging and doesn't stick too closely to canon like other fics (especially with a big twist at the end of book 2). There's a sideplot involving a Muggle policewoman who discovers she was obliviated multiple times which could very well be a story in its own right, it's that good.

Plus, I think I bit off way more than I could chew with a pretty dense plot about wizard drug dealers, Department of Mysteries spycraft (which was lifted wholesale and transplanted into Midnight Blues), and melancholy postwar romance angst. As for Midnight Blues, I want to get back to it, but that requires getting into the right headspace: as you might have assumed, I'm a massively boring cunt in real life and MB's humour doesn't come natural.

** I know it's been mentioned by others on this sub, but I'd love to see an exploration of aurors that doesn't make them bureaucrats or magic!cops.

I know that's what canon eventually turned them into, but seeing aurors as badass bounty hunters, tracking down dark wizards, disrupting dark rituals, fighting beasts and ghosts and dark creatures....all that would be really cool.

I would love to see the aurors as a small, exclusive, and rather disparate group. They're technically part of the ministry--they're on the payroll--but they're not reduced to guard duty or desk work. Aurors have got shit to do. Let the DMLE or Hit Wizards take on the magic!cop role and be the cogs in the Ministry machine.

*** Northumbrian's series (most of his stories are in this series) is a post Hogwarts cannon compliant (up to end of book 7) shows the auror corps as more of a "hunting the dark wizards" and not a basic policing force (even goes into some detail about the differences in one of the stories). You might enjoy that series for that, however be warned, its long, and can be boring if you don't like "slice of life" fics.

- Harry/Hermione time travel to the early 1970s, but instead of the usual shenanigans with Marauders, they first used to their advance knowledge to make billions in Muggle stock market, while building a massive paramilitary organization at same time. In 1978, after the Marauders finally graduated, they made their moves.
- The sequel of “The Sum of Their Parts”
- After viewing Snape's memory, Harry sneaked upon his enemies as in canon, but instead of offering himself for execution, he brought along at least a ton of C4 explosives in his enchanted bags and blew himself up in a blaze of glory, killing every Death Eater within a radius of 100 meters, Nagini, and Voldemort.

***** Part of the problem with fics as in-depth as this is that sometimes it feels like an entirely different story. If the setting is unique, why not just write a unique story with your own characters? I imagine that is why there aren't many fics that diverge from canon settings, either in crossovers or otherwise.

HP-style magic isn't all that unique to begin with, it's just presented in a way that feels unique. It's basically urban fantasy told with a fairy-tale-esque reverence. There are a lot of stories like that.

Nah, it doesn't have to map completely one on one, but I have a little scene written for the "Skeeter Conspiracy of 2014":

The background comes from the [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/quidditch-world-cup-final-live-report][Pottermore Article about the Quidditch World Cup Final]], in which Rita Skeeter mercilessly attacked the DA to the point where Ginny hexed her into St Mungos.

#+begin_quote
  *(Office of the Deputy Director of the Department of Law Enforcement, British Ministry of Magic)*

  Hermione: Well, Ginny, it seems you have gotten yourself really into trouble this time.

  Ginny: You got a problem with that, Hermione? I thought better of you. This Skeeter bitch stepped over the line and I taught her a lesson. I regret nothing!

  Hermione: Calm down, Ginny. My staff told me that several opinion pieces calling for your head appeared on Daily Prophet as soon as the game was over. Almost too fast in my opinion, as if they had anticipated your response.

  Ginny: What? You mean that I had been set up?

  Hermione: Possibly, so far we have no proof, and Skeeter hasn't woken up yet. Your really put some power into your hex. It could have killed her.

  Hermione: Anyway, I have already mobilized our Network to stage a rally outside the Daily Prophet's Diagon Alley office later today. They will be calling for Skeeter's head instead and demanding an end to her slanderous pieces. Luna and Lee will soon publish their articles about possible conspiracy. They will encourage her slander victims to make a stand. Once the accusations are coming in, we will have a valid pretext to bring her in. Harry, you need your Aurors to put Skeeter under ‘protection' soon. We couldn't afford some of our radical followers to harm her, and we couldn't let whoever are behind her to silence her.

  Harry: Thank you Hermione, you are always a step ahead of me. I love you.

  Harry: So, you believe there is a conspiracy behind her sudden attack against us?

  Hermione: Again, no proof yet. Once she wakes up, you will be conducting your standard procedure. It's better to be overcautious one hundred times than to let our guard down once. Constant Vigilance!

  Ginny: If there was a conspiracy, I doubt her backers would have exposed their true identities. They would be all polyjuiced anyway.

  Harry: Then we just have to be clever about it. I'm sure Hermione had already put her thought into this matter.

  Hermione: First, we need to establish that Skeeter is part of a conspiracy, which I'm very certain about it. This will change the public narratives and give us the initiative. I will coordinate with our friends in the DoM to step up our surveillance effort, and we will make a big splash in the press and on the street. That should hopefully scare off our enemies into doing something stupid, so we can catch them in the act. Harry, you know what to do.

  Harry: Well, let's get started then!
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  *(DMLE Interrogation Room #4, the Next Day)*

  Skeeter: You can't do this to me! I shall expose you all! This is a blatant abuse of power...

  Auror 1: Cut the crap, Skeeter. We know everything about you. Let's see what we've got here... Yes, 157 accusations of slander and defamation, more coming in by the hours. Well, you already confessed under Veritaserum that you were bribed by certain subversive elements to set up Mrs Potter. Of course, we know you are an illegal animagus too.

  Skeeter: Granger. She kidnapped me back then, held me captive for two weeks, and then still had the nerve to blackmail me. I will let the whole world know what she did...

  Auror 1: Nobody cares. Madam Granger is a great war hero and reformer, and you are just one yellow press journo who lied, slandered, and pandered to the lowest of the rabbles. Whom is the world going to believe? Besides, what happened during the War is all covered under Minister Shacklebolt and Wizengamot's Blood War Exemption Act. You were conspiring with Lucius Malfoy back then to commit character assassinations of Headmaster Dumbledore, Mr Potter, and Miss Granger. So you were basically one of them who had escaped justice for too long! But no more, we now have enough evidence to send you to Azkaban forever.

  Auror 1 pulled out a jar and a let a beetle out, and crushed it with his fist.

  Auror 1: Skeeter, now it's time to carefully consider your options. Fully cooperate with us for leniency, or end up worse than this beetle.

  Skeeter after a long pause: If I fully cooperate, how much leniency can I expect? And how do I cooperate?

***** I mean, yeah, the other primary adult characters lose a lot of faith/trust in him after Harry's situation is exposed and make their displeasure clearly known to Dumbledore, but I didn't think their reactions were unwarranted or unrealistic. Also, Dumbledore is old and set in his ways. He /wants/ to do better, but changing decades long behaviors is hard, and he does backslide sometimes (and get called out for it by the aforementioned adults when caught).

If you're the dude in charge of /all/ of society's children and it comes out that you left the most famous of them in an abusive home, never checked up on him (or allowed anyone else to), and then missed/ignored the signs of abuse for /three years/ after he was your direct responsibility, I don't think you /should/ be let off more lightly than Dumbledore was in the story. Ultimately, Dumbledore fell into the trap of starting to believe that he was smarter and wiser than everyone else after being praised as such for so many years, and it came back to bite him in the ass when it turns out he's human after all.

** These are mostly fanfic related "wants." Some are more serious than others, and there's no particular order.

- More Founders fics. It's got pre-built drama, but other than the few bits of info there is about that era, it's wide open for exploration. (There should be some backwards-aging Merlin thrown into the mix, because that's my favorite kind of Merlin.)
- Harry in Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw. (Who doesn't befriend his canon friends.)
- Slytherin Ron fics.
- Slytherin Harry fics where he's not a complete edgelord. (Who doesn't befriend his canon friends.)
- Post-war fics that ignore the epilogue.
- Marauders era fics that aren't full of shipping and "but I am Sirius!" jokes, but actually follow the damn war going on.
- More "elsewhere" fics, stuff that takes place at different magical schools or in different magical countries.
- Related to the above: overhauled world-building AUs.
- More fics where the Bad Guys Win.
- Fics where someone other than Harry or Neville is Voldemort's equal. Candidates I'd like to see: Dean Thomas (his backstory would def. make this interesting), Luna Lovegood (her birth year isn't right, but it's AU, so ...), Draco Malfoy (talk about awkward), Ron Weasley, Percy Weasley (he's my favorite Weasley), Cho Chang (she's completely under-explored in fic and canon did her dirty).
- Goblin fics. Full of mean goblins.
- An AU where Tom Riddle is psychologically sound, but still terrifying and ambitious.
- That Trump-as-Ginny AU that someone on this sub promised to write.
- (I'd read Trump-as-Harry, too. Or Ron.)
- (Fuck, I might actually write one of those.)
- (I'll probably have zero time to update it past a few chapters though.)
- (So someone else do it. Pretty please?)
- Probably controversial, but I'd love to read a fic where Grindelwald was right about Muggles and ruling over them. It'd be difficult to pull off, and people would probably claim that the poor writer is somehow supporting fascism (because apparently writing something means you support it or have done it, and aren't just using your imagination), but my God, it'd make for an amazingly dark AU.
- Hermione being in-character.
- Gen fics.
- Sci-fi fics.
- /Star Wars/ crossovers. (Preferably Potter characters go into the Star Wars universe, not the other way around.)
- A well-written, in-character romance fic with a pairing involving a Death Eater and a most-definitely-not-a-Death-Eater character. That's not a popular thing around here (or on DLP where I lurk), and I *actively avoid* those types of fics since they're crap ... but if one was done well? If it actually explored all the juicy psychological stuff and character development that would be necessary? If it showed the ugliness and desperation with such a dynamic? It might actually hold my attention for more than half a chapter.
- SI-OC fics where it doesn't feel like the main character has memorized the contents of the books.

Edited to add:

- Competent Lockhart. But still egotistical.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** Fics exploring some of the more obscure branches of magic. Outside of the traditional fic recs for those categories, cursebreaking/enchanting/healing/advanced transfiguration are all relatively untouched in the fanfic world. Personally, I love fics that focus on the magic, on having Harry build himself up in a field, explores possibilities and takes him on travels/adventures based around those careers. They offer such a cool premise, but there are only a tiny amount of readable fics that have any type of focus on them (and I've been reading for over a decade at this point).

*** There were actually departments, like the department of charms, and transfiguration, and the castle was huge. However, if Rowling is right and there are 1000 students in Hogwarts then it's really understaffed. I always thought that there was other staff but after the war the number of students decreased and so did the need for that much staff.

Unless they use time turners to manage their classes.

** There are a ton of things that I personally would like more of or hasn't been explored by good writers much.

- Time/Dimension travel that focuses on Harry establishing relationships with people that died. Bar almost none these sort of fics always start of from the premise that Harry keeps his true identity a secret from Lilly/James, friends, etc. With broody, powerful Harry working alone to kick ass. While those fics can be a lot of fun, they also largely stay away from the relationships (aside from a ton of angst). Give me Harry meeting Lilly and instantly approaching her and establishing a relationship. I am anxiously awaiting to see if linkffn(From Ruin) will finally end up taking this route.

- Year 8 fics where they go to Hogwarts without slash or Dramione is rare. I'd like to see more Harry/Daphne or Harry/Hermione in this category. There are some good oneshots and shorter stories in that genre, but I feel there's unexplored territory there.

- In general, stories where the fighting becomes more gritty from both sides. We, of course, have plenty of stories where Harry decides to fight fire with fire, which generally leads to protests from the "light" side. I can imagine a fic where after the ministry has fallen the Order/remaining Aurors adopt the guerilla style warfare that the Death Eaters used before officially establishing themselves in the government. And through that style going for raids and assassinations on high profile targets without taking prisoners.

- Also more a general thing I want to see in fics is interesting magic. Too many fics, in my opinion, take the route of them casting reducto, stupefy and protego 90% of the time which makes magical duels very boring to read. Sectumsempra is too often the most powerful spell used. There is so much you can do with magic (and a ton of inspiration you can get from pop culture) to make it interesting. Have Harry (and Hermione) explore new branches of magic and make creative use of it. I often find myself skimming dueling segments because they simply are repetitive and boring.

  It all went wrong. Harry is locked away in Azkaban for decades as Voldemort destroys and conquers the magical world and beyond unchallenged. However, Voldemort's greatest strength will be used against him, and Harry is sent back in time with one mission: to kill the Dark Lord before he rises again.

** Harry after the books. Disregard the epilogue. Then put him in a bit of extreme. Not just happily ever after auror boring blah... Let them grow again, because they have to. Let him grow to an adult who is capable and cares. Maybe let him turn the world upside down. Give them purpose and an adventure and not something old from the boom that comes again (find all the deatherters...)

Second. A well done anti hero. Not a necessarily as a villian, just bad person fighting for the good. A brutal fighter. Not for the sake of brutality but the effectiveness in combat.

Third: Hermione gone mad. Always thought the following could be a very cool story (maybe short) Hermione went crazy mad for something (maybe Ron dead?) And tried to develop something ill convinced (like world breaking time travel). No one can or dares to stop her. Then Harry as an now older auror walks in, stepping around the aurors Hermione already killed and talks calmly to her. In the end creating an understanding that no one will stop. And he can and will take her down... Such drama ! ;-) Hope you get the idea...

** I think the ones I've enjoyed but not seen much are where Harry is dark not because he's a Slytherin, but because of the circumstances in which he has grown up. Most of all, he is not OP. A lot of Harry Potter's popularity is that he is average, but given the circumstances, he does his best.

I like stories of Tom Riddle, but I believe it is difficult to write about him. Most of the time, people make him too human, which takes away from his character. It is only in being outmatched by Dumbledore, for example, that Riddle suddenly becomes human. But I don't think he should care about Harry or want to protect him or etc just because of how Harry makes him feel.

** - Talented Harry fics which draw on his strengths and characteristics as shown in canon to depict his development into a wizard of the same kind of calibre as his parents/Snape (think Patronus Charm writ large). There are lots of talented Harry fics out there, but they tend to completely abandon his canon characterisation.

- Magical genius Harry fics which understand the difference between intelligence and maturity, where magical talent doesn't entitle Harry to undermine the authority of his teachers (and the author doesn't reward him for trying), and which take a path of magical development which avoids Harry casting NEWT-level magic by second year.

- Political elements which are about leaving behind the naivety and rebelliousness of youth and which take as their central theme the adult discovery that problems are complex and there are often good reasons why people haven't been able to solve them before.

Also, I want Sirius post-Azkaban to be unforgiving to his former comrades and friends, especially towards Remus and Albus. The guy goes against everything he's known growing up for his friends, and they completely forsake the man and leave him to rot in Azkaban for over a decade - but canon Sirius seems fine with it all, which is just baffling.
