I unfortunately do not even remember the name of the author or any of the stories but of the bits I remember is that one of their stories was Harry/Twin sister they were both in Ravenclaw. they both lived with Sirius Black, that Neville was the BWL, one of the later chapters had them going at it after Harry defeated his dueling opponent(she had been flirting with him), and that Hermione after eying Harry in the great hall and being caught by the sister "It felt like i was being judged by not his sister but by his girlfriend" . Another thing I can remember about them is that they had multiple Harry/Daphne smut/lemon stories as well(thats how I found them favorite pairing). For a time frame the last time I had read a story of theirs was a month or two ago. Anyways sorry if something was incorrect about this post first time using a site like Reddit(Made this account to search for them after spending an hour looking by myself). Thanks for all the help.
