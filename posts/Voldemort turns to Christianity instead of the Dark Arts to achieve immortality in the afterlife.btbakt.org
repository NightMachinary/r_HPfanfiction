Essentially, Voldemort becomes a very good Christian boy who strictly follows the ten commandments and loves everyone. He goes to church every Sunday and seeks penance every time he commits a sin.

I'm about to start a new trope y'all: Christian!Voldemort


** Lily Potter is an exfundie who escaped her family's branch davidian like cult, only to wind up in magical Britain's first holy war. Let me know when this a 200k+ AU that's now on Tv Tropes!, that after a five-year hiatus, is Up FoR AdOpTiOn!

*** Wow, so I hadn't really gotten past thinking about this through the lens of Voldemort's life, but this adds a whole other dimension. This could be an amazing story in itself can that 200k+ AU just exist now pls??

Makes me wonder about some of the other characters in that time period. How does the House of Black fit into a different time of looming war, in which the conflict is centered not around the purification of wizarding blood, but the ascension of the Church? Do they ally themselves with either side? Do the pureblood families of Europe identify themselves with the arguably similar ancient religion of the world, or do they oppose this upstart movement?

Who is even good and bad in this world? Is there such a thing? In Voldemort's quest for world domination via horcruxes and terrorism, it's pretty clear, but I see a lot more potential for moral complexity here.

  Shy and abused, Iris Potter slowly uncovers the truth about the magical world, despite the warnings of her brother and father. What are the Old Rites, why is numerology a dark art, and why does she keep blushing whenever Blaise and her bond-mate look at her? Prepare for magical theory, politics, paganism, creatures, a twin, romance, and above all, self-discovery.

** This seems like such a wild idea, but honestly, thinking about it, it could be so good if it were deeply explored. Voldemort's childhood was spent in dire conditions. As we know him, he was pretty cold and calculating from a young age, and he lacked any formative influence that might have externally imposed morality upon him. In fact, given that he was raised on the charity of an orphanage, one can well imagine some bias against the values around which it might have allegedly been founded being implanted in him.

What sort of an event could have changed his reaction to his formative years from his ruthless pursuit of power and immortality to a path founded on the precepts of Christianity? Assuming we are dealing with the same essential personality, it wouldn't be the kind of conversion generally upheld by Christians that he would undergo. It wouldn't start with recognition of sins and repentance or a recognition of the glorious love of God. I imagine that the necessary mechanism would be some event which would convince him that the precepts of Christianity, strictly followed, would indeed lead to immortality. And that such immortality would be more worthwhile than that gained by creating horcruxes. Perhaps because it would be guaranteed and wholly dependent upon his own actions, where horcruxes may be, as we know, destroyed. That initial conviction might eventually lead to some attempt at true reformation of the self, were it to extend to the necessity of genuine faith or love. Which would open up a very interesting examination of the possibility of an intrinsically immoral person manufacturing morality, love, compassion, within themselves for purposes of self-interest. Is that a paradox? Would it be possible?

I imagine the initial discovery might not come through the usual channels of conversion. Perhaps young Tom Riddle, only a boy, but already aware that he has powers those around him do not have or understand is searching for answers. He was learning to cause things to happen around him. He had no way to know how, or why but his own instincts. He was magically gifted and exceedingly clever, and he had no guidance.

What if he happened upon a Bible? One of the staff left it on a chair. It was old and worn, thick soft black leather on the cover, inscribed in flaking gilt with the single word of its title. It would have looked ancient and mysterious, and to a young boy overflowing with rabid curiosity as to the nature of his should-be impossible powers, perhaps it would have looked /magical/.

The Bible is full of miracles and supernatural events. Had it come to him before the knowledge that he was a wizard, what different conclusions young Tom might have drawn! He could do things he shouldn't be able to - he could do things like the people in that book! The people chosen by God!

Perhaps he himself was one of God's chosen, here with a purpose. Perhaps this book came to him with a purpose too - as a manual, so that he could attain the power, and the immortality, which were, by rights, his!

Tom Riddle was hostile, skeptical, spitting with suspicion when Dumbledore first came to offer him his place at Hogwarts. But how quickly he believed when the word magic was offered him. He knew he was different, and he had been looking for an explanation all his eleven years. How different that moment might have been, had he already found it in that most unexpected of all places - religion.

Would he have come to Hogwarts then? Perhaps he would have renounced Dumbledore wholly, or perhaps he would have come and led a very different life there. What if Tom Riddle's class had been populated by his first circle of minions, but in his first converts to his faith? What fun to imagine the machinations which might have gone through his mind as he determined how best to apply the teachings of Christianity to his quest for his rightful fate!

The Bible isn't all sunshine and rainbows either - it describes some of the most horrific events imaginable. This could go in so many different ways.

The wondering is getting away from me now. I rather want to do a great deal of research and write this. What a wonderful, fun idea! Does anyone want to collaborate??

*** I feel like Catholicism would be the sect of choice for this au, mostly because any witch trial that directly involved the Vatican ended with /the instigator/ being found guilty of heresy rather than any supposed witch. The logic being that Satan is imprisoned in hell by God itself, and so is in no position to be getting out any time soon, let alone granting supernatural powers to random peasants. So from that point of view, the Catholic church could very well have a strong presence in the magical world if only just because they didn't persecute their magical followers like the Protestants did.

**** Ooh, very good point. I was actually just recently reading about how the Catholic church surprisingly would originally only ever persecute those accusing others of witchcraft rather than the alleged witch themself. We tend to imagine witch hunts as a part of the dark middle ages, but they actually came into full swing around the same time as the enlightenment, which is a connection I had just never really made.

Total tangent, but wow, what a spectacle a magical Catholic church could be. Muggle cathedrals being what they are, what happens if all that art and architetcture and crazy dramatic lighting and acoustics is laden with charms and enchantments? Hogwarts has nothing on that, really.

Furthermore, witchcraft wasn't made explicitley illegal until after the Protestant Reformation. Before then, it was only illegal to commit crimes with witchcraft.

**** Yeah, because all witch trials involved the Vatican? Seriously, if we want to play that game we could just as easily argue that, since most -if not all- witch trials in areas that were predominantly protestant fell under civil authority and thus both Roman Catholic Churches as wel as Protestants Churches were completely innocent.

Bullshit, the persecution of witches was a disgrace that involved clergy and laity from all sides.

But, if Voldemort would still be the main antagonist, it could make sense. The boy that felt betrayed by his fellow countrymen decides to become Roman Catholic and the quintessential English Harry Potter decides to fight against the evils of foreign papalism with a wand in one hand and the Book of Common Prayer in the other...
