:END:
That's pretty much what I remember. It was the beginning of a fic. Harry locked in his room at Privet Drive.

Passes out and Hedwig tries to feed him only for a piece of chicken to rot on top of his chest.

  After Sirius dies, Harry is isolated and feels betrayed by everyone who's been around him recently and leaves to figure out what he should do. An "old friend" is sent to look after him and try to bring him back. Together they search for a way to kill a Dark Lord and maybe fix society too.
