Recently I read a fanfiction and my sister wants to read it as well but I can't find it anymore. In the Fanfiction Harry goes into heat during his second year because Ginny used a potion on him to make him like her but he instead goes to the Forbidden Forest where Voldermort finds him while Voldermort was a snake animal thingy. They also have mind sex (which I never understood why but its a fanfiction and I'm just gonna go with the roll) if any one can find it I would be very grateful.


** And this is what you want to use to introduce your sister to ff? Fair enough, but I'd suggest HPMOR for a first FF, or maybe the Arithmancer
