Instead of stopping a single object, it stops everything in a certain area, including each and every molecule. Can be used against shrapnel from explosions, but that's not the main use.

If used on a theoretical ideal gas, it reduces the temperature (average kinetic energy) down to absolute 0. If used on a non-ideal gas, temperature goes down but not to absolute zero since only 3 degrees of freedom (movement in space) of each molecule are arrested. The smaller the molecule, the more significant the cooling effect. Still works as a very efficient cooling charm, and causes an implosion as a side effect of the drop in pressure.

The extreme cold doesn't get along well with biochemical processes, which it effectively interrupts. On living beings with innate resistance to magic it's less effective, but it can still liquify the surrounding air. Might be useful against Dragon's breath.


** If you killed all the motion of non ideal gases you could also stop the swinging and stretching of bonds... But in either case zero point energy is more about amplitude of the wave-features of stuff so still no absolute zero even for ideal gases

** Wait, I dont understand. From which reference frame? If you take the example of using it to slow/stop shrapnel from an explosion, does that mean that it comes to complete stop from your POV? Because in the shrapnel's POV it is you who is hurtling towards it, and from the sun's POV, you, the shrapnel, and the entire earth are in motion. In which case the could you not just kill people by adjusting the spell to mean "stay in this exact point in space" and watch them go flying off into space?

*** That's a pretty major exploit in Arresto Momentum. If it were possible to freely choose the reference frame, the spell would be very useful to accelerate things in arbitrary directions. If it's somehow locked to Earth surface, it'd be useless in any moving vehicle. If it's the caster's frame, then if the caster is moving it'd cause some interesting behavior.

*** Wizards tend to always use magic directly to achieve the desired result. But sometimes using magic to manipulate physics to do the job might be more efficient. For example a troll's skin is pretty resilient to most curses, but a massive physical object moved by a simple levitation spell results in a pretty decent amount of blunt force, thus allowing a group of firsties to knock a troll out.
