*** So, I'm fairly certain (somewhere between 80-95%) that I know chemprof in real life. As in, took classes s/he taught, and have dined and/or wined at his/her house. A very nice guy/gal.

Gender's obfuscated to keep his/her privacy, if I'm right.

**** No need to obscure that. From the ffn profile: I really am a chemistry professor, and the father of three daughters.

***** I forgot he mentioned he was a /father/. But yeah, the details all match up with the professor I know.

**** Good to know that he's a nice person IRL. Shame he doesn't seem to be into fanfiction anymore, though, he's one of my favorite authors.

***** Well, about 5/6 years ago he got promoted to department head, which is a ton more work. Add in some rather major changes I won't go into because it would be too much info, he doesn't have time for it.

** (For those who haven't read it, Hermione realizes they need funds to survive during the Horcrux hunt and sells the HP stories to a publishing house. The muggle author hired to adapt the stories eventually decides to start rewriting 'what actually happened'. It's a minor part of the story but I thought it was a clever way of explaining the divergence from canon.)
