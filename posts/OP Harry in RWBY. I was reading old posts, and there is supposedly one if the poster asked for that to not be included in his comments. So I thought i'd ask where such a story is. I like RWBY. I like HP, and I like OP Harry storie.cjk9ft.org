#+TITLE: OP Harry in RWBY. I was reading old posts, and there is supposedly one if the poster asked for that to not be included in his comments. So I thought i'd ask where such a story is. I like RWBY. I like HP, and I like OP Harry stories.

** The one story that comes to mind is linkffn(12292532) It's already past novel length, but hasn't been updated in a couple of years and is likely/possibly abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  After the defeat of Voldemort, life for Harry Potter hadn't gone as expected. The Auror life wasn't for him, and his relationship with Ginny had failed. Now, as an unofficial Curse-Breaker, a more skilled Harry has found himself on Remnant saving the life of a certain Atlas Specialist. With magic returning to the land, will Harry succeed where others have failed in combating Salem?
