I know it's hard to pin down because no one reads a perfect sample of fanfic, and your interests change over time.

But I think there are certain tropes/trends that have risen and fallen in HP fanfic.

Marriage law is a good example. I feel like marriage laws were very popular for certain pairings, but I haven't seen a sincere attempt at a marriage law plot line in years. Soul bonds seem to have peaked after marriage laws, but they're not written as much these days either.

It's not just cliches, it just seems like there are certain pairings and characterizations have risen/fallen in popularity. I suspect that it's partly because as the fanbase ages, the characters/themes/pairings that resonate with people change.

Slytherin character-centric fics seem to be especially interesting. I'm sure it still exists but I hardly ever see "Draco in leather pants" being written anymore. The fandom seems to have kind of fallen out of love with Draco as a romantic lead.

Harry/Hermione fics have probably had a bit of a roller-coaster popularity-wise.

To be clear, I'm NOT saying "Oh, these fics don't exist anymore," I'm sure I could find an example of each of these tropes from fics published in the last 24 hours. But they do seem kind of out of fashion.

What do you guys think? Anything else that seems to be "the latest thing" or has fallen out of favor?


** Pre-2005 was all about the in-canon continuation fic, with people writing the next Hogwarts year in a way that tried to stay true to the tone of the books.

That seemed to largely disappear after HBP was published, probably because, as the series approached its end, there was less flexibility in events for people to take things in their own direction.

Then you had the post-OotP independent Harry trend which started around 2006, had its golden days in 2007/2008 and still lingers on in largely derivative fics that are just copies of ideas from back then. This was largely split into two camps: the "Power of Time" derivatives, which featured an independent but "light" Harry and Gryffindor girl pairings, and the "Scorpion Sorcerer" derivatives, which had a dark independent Harry with (what would become known as) bashing and Slytherin girl pairings. The dark, bashing fics have continued to be reproduced but the lightsided ones seem to have died out.

One variation of this theme was the "inherited memories" fic, normally Harry gaining Voldemort's memories.

Overlapping with this trend you have the post-S'TarKan NOFP peggy sue rehash/fixit fics, which lasted a long time but now look to have finally died out.

A variation on this was dimension travel where Harry goes back in time to his younger body but things are different (eg. Neville BWL).

The current big trend is fem!Harry. Five years ago there were about 3 fem!Harry fics of length in the entire fandom. Now you go onto FF.Net and they make up a good plurality of the new fics. Largely they seem to have replaced slash as the means by which people write a feminised Harry paired with male characters -- they're written in much the same way, full of drama, hurt/comfort and angst etc.

*** Damn this is a pretty fucking good summary.

I'd also like to point out that the one sentence you gave to S'TarKan NOFP seems a bit understated. After that fic there was a veritable flood of peggy sue fics which probably made up 80% of the FF I read in that time frame, which for me culminated in The Wastelands of Time, and slowly died out thereafter.

** Severitus fics were huge a few years ago. They're still about but definitely diminished in number compared to when they were practically the biggest thing in fanfiction.

EDIT: thought of an obvious one, Next Gen fics were huge after the 7th book. All canon compliant for that matter was but seems to have almost dissapeared.

** Interesting point! I definitely agree that Harry Potter fanfiction has "seasons". It does seem to me that slytherin-centric fic fell out of fashion after the seventh book, but that resorting Harry and/or having one of his kids go to slytherin has become way more popular.

Also Remus/Sirius used to be a really popular pairing, not as many fics being written there. Dark!Harry and Powerful!Harry had it's moment in the sun with some great reads coming from there.

Harry being abused by the Dursleys seems to be an old trope that many writers fall back on. The clich√© manipulative Dumbledore seems to be having a moment right now to, but it might just be selection bias on my part.

I'm not sure weather it is an ageing fanbase or maybe more a revolving one? Compared to other fandoms I've followed Harry Potter skews younger to me on both readership and authorship. It is super curious why people get an itch to write what they write and what the next new classic idea is going to be.

** Since the horcruxes were mentioned, there are far fewer original takes on Voldemort, his quest for immortality, and how Harry or anyone else can defeat him. I really miss the fic written pre-HBP that finished off the stories and didn't require a quest to find the horcruxes. Basically, anything that went in a new direction, but didn't still make Harry or someone else go find all the horcruxes and destroy them. Because whatever crazy scenario was created in a fic, you can be sure that it will also include horcruxes from now on...

** I remember the days when we were still speculating on what horcruxes were and how to destroy them. Though I still enjoy the ones where people speculated on how Voldie survived. I still appreciate authors who dont include them (Off the top of my head Bobmin356 and Muggledad are there). So I appreciate when people are more creative with Voldie and we can avoid the horcrux search.

There's also the trend of Harry being a DADA professor aide and learning how to be a teacher.

** There seems to be more than a few fics where Harry's brother is the BWL, and Harry is neglected, unloved, or even hated by his parents. This gives him a burning drive to prove himself and / or get revenge.

I'm not sure which fic introduced this idea originally, or when it began. I mean, there's Santi's legendary Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived, but James and Lily are actually good people there. Most of fics of this type make them ignore Harry to the point of forgetting his existence, which I find completely unrealistic, even though I'm a sucker for indy!Harry.
