I've exhausted most of the popular fanfics and recently have began to lose interest in reading, as everything now seems so similar. I am looking for something that makes you question your point of view on things, but at the same time is written well. I'm not really into Slash, but if its written well enough, I can deal with it.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7108864/1/Memorium][Memorium]] By Aesop

The use of memory altering spells is common in the HP books. Protecting their secrecy comes before everything else, and justifies any action. Or so they believe.

A muggle woman finds out her brother has been blamed for something done by wand-waving weirdos, and she struggles to get justice from them. Grim but believable and has only a little to do with the canon conflict.

** This post actually reminded me of a whole slew of fanfiction that I haven't favorited yet. In any case, here are a few that I felt would be applicable to your request...hopefully you enjoy. I didn't include descriptions because I felt the provided summaries at the start of the fanfics would give a better intro.

** After reading so much fanfiction, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8215565/1/Knowledge-is-Useful-But-Power-is-Power][Knowledge is Useful But Power is Power]] was a really nice deconstruction of the powerful!Harry trope. Your milage may vary on how thought provoking it is but it was quite a bit for me. DisobedienceWriter is an excellent author so you'll be getting a great story either way.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7985741/1/The-Descent-of-Magic][The Descent of Magic]] delves into magical theory and really fascinated me. It is slash, but that is not the focus of the story at all.

Harry befriends a local family, the father has cancer and Harry uses a spell to transfer it to himself. It made me cry.

*** Eh, I can't say I like these tear jerky fics with no real substance to them. They just feel manufactured to make you sad instead of being actually thought provoking like OP said.
