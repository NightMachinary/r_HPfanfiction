No wolfstar please. I've already read The Story of Four Friends, You Want to Make a Memory?, Forever Alive, New Beginnings, and The Year of the Wolf.


** Any popular ones you've already read so we can know what to rec?

linkffn(Against The Moon) is one of my all-time favorite stories. Sadly abandoned, but tells the Marauder's first two years through Remus's eyes.

  The odds were stacked against him: a child from a blended home with no friends, no social skills to speak of, and a terrible secret. Yet slowly Remus Lupin began to realize there was a place for him in the world, if he could find the courage to claim it.

** I'm very fond of linkffn(Dark Marauder by BajaB). (Slightly non-canon in that James survives Voldemort's attack.)

  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

  Before the boy who lived, there was another story. One of a monster inside of a man. One of a hero inside of a child. One of a traitor inside of a friend. And one of an angel inside of a demon. COMPLETED.
