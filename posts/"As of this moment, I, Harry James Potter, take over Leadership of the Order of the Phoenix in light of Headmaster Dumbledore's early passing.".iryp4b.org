*** Well, the reaction to Canon!Harry doing this would definitely be laughter. But I was thinking more of a Dumbledore-trained, powerful Harry.

**** Even if Harry had the magical stature to take a position of leadership, I don't think a statement like the OP would be met warmly.

Firstly because it's very pompous.

Secondly because I don't think the Order has a strict hierarchy, but rather acts by consensus where everyone's opinions are valued.

Thirdly because even if it does have a leader, declaring yourself to be the leader rather than being /chosen/ as the leader is the perfect way to alienate everyone.

***** Plus no matter who trained him, or how powerful and stuck-up he is, he would still be a sixteen years old going over the heads of many war veterans to declare himself their superior. This kind of shit would only fly if he had many more feats under his belt /and/ many of the other members of the order had realistic reasons to put so much trust on him, Hell, even then it likely wouldn't be taken well.

** To me, this feels like a very threatening, like a mobster (after killing all of his competition) sits down with all the capos and is like, "due to unforeseen and erm... /tragic/ events, I will be taking control of the family."
