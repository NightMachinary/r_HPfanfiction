So I was browsing this lovely thing that is the Internet when I got in on a bit of a sidetrack and somehow ended up getting the urge to watch the Harry Potter movies, after getting through Philosopher's stone I followed it up with the Chamber of Secrets. Got to the booksigning scene in Flourish and Blotts. This is when I got the feeling that I recognised the actor playing Lockhart decided to check up on the cast and low and behold there it was Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart. Once I found this out it made it weird to watch the man who played the main character in Shakespeares Henry V going around flashing smiles and swishing a stick around. Don't know why i decided to post this? Maybe I just feel a bit lost right now.


** The sheer amount of A-List talent rendered completely unrecognizable in those films is astounding.

Kenneth Branagh is a big one but Emma Thompson as Trelawney, or John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick always blew my mind. I don't think I realized Gary Oldman plays Sirius until OOtP lol.

I also experienced the reverse of this when I watched Killing Eve and Fleabag and realized that Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) appears in both. She has a dialog in Fleabag that goes, "Do you wanna fuck the priest, or do you want to fuck God?" and honestly I still don't think my mind has recovered from that bit of cognitive dissonance.

*** Didn't know John Cleese played Nearly Headless Nick. Never gonna be able to watch him play Q in James Bond again without thinking about that. Also I can understand the mental blow that the quoted dialog from Fiona Shaw would have on a person. I think I would have needed therapy after something like that.

**** Ironically enough she spoke that line as a therapist for the main character

Absolutely. Mr Weasley as Father Brown in the TV series. Also, Maggie Smith is many many other famous roles. E.g., Lady Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, on Downton Abbey (2010--2015) or I loved her as a governess in A Room With A View (1985) next to Helena Bonham Carter, i.e., Bellatrix Lestrange (or many other roles she mastered).

And the story goes that Kenneth Branagh got the role only because Hugh Grant decided to make [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Weeks_Notice][“Two Weeks Notice”]] with Sandra Bullock instead (it is probably better not to ask him how happy he is about that decision). See [[https://is.gd/UcKvGF]] for other famous actors who missed the role in HP universe.

** On a vaguely related note, I just watched the Queen's Gambit, and Dudley showing up as a Kentucky Chess Master was pretty crazy and unexpected. I immediately began formulating the fanfiction in my mind: clearly he picked up wizarding chess while on the run from Voldemort, then moved to Kentucky and changed his name to Harry in an act of rebellion against his parents. (He also plays a poet without limbs in the Ballad of Buster Scruggs... I'm thinking it was a time-turned related accident).

*** He also plays a preacher in The Devil All The Time - that one's self-explanatory

** Branagh also directed one of the MCU Thor movies. That's quite a wide range and I've seen jokes about it (he obliviated the real director and took credit, etc).
