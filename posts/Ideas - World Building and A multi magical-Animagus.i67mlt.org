Alright, so these last few months of quarantine made me do a /lot/ of Harry Potter (movies, audio books, fanfics, and more interesting videos on YouTube). Since I'm basically unable to not do a HP story, I wanted to spin some ideas to work with.

First being an SI-OC born into a powerful family (undecided but need to have some influence). The first few Chapters, which will be dedicated to World Building and each Chapter a year passes to spend some time before Hogwarts. World Building in HP is so creative and have so much potential and interesting things, like different types of magic and culture. While traveling the world, Magical Creatures came into mind, but also to be an Animagus of some them. Wanna do something different and this idea caught my attention, but wanna hear an opinion from people who have more experience for help.

Also, any preference for locations with different kinds of magic? Wanna do as much research as possible since I plan to do a total of 5 of them.

Anyway, if any of this works lemme know, been keen with running with this.
