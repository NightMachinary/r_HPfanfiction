I know you can just say “he's a coward who wanted to save his skin,” but I'd love a deeper exploration into Peter's psyche and his thoughts during this time. I don't really want Peter to be excuse for his (vile and traitorous) actions, but I'd love to get a bit deeper than we get in the book.


** I like seeing a version of Peter that attempts to spy on the Death Eaters for the Order, so he initially joins with that intent... but just like a CI or undercover detective working for a criminal organization... he just gets in too deep. He spies for Dumbledore, but has to give some information to Voldemort as well to maintain cover. Bit by bit, he gets closer and closer to Voldemort's inner circle.

When he becomes the Secret Keeper for the Potters, it's just too much responsibility. He probably sees it as a way to end the war, all the death and loss and destruction. So what if it's Voldemort that wins? At least the war is over and everyone can move on. I'd like to think that if Peter found out about Voldemort's horcruxes, he'd have gone to Dumbledore for the exact same reason. Peter wasn't married to either side, he just wanted to "win."

Then Voldemort dies. Sirius knows the truth about his betrayal, but so does Voldemort's surviving inner circle. Which Black would you rather confront? Sirius or Bellatrix? So Peter fakes his own death and dips, pinning it on Sirius.

** Sirius said it best. Pettigrew wanted to attach himself to the strongest group. In school, the strongest group was James'. And then by the tail end of his school year, Voldemort became the strongest group in the "playground," so to speak. Aside from attaching himself to the strongest group (possibly for survival or prestige for siding with the winning group), I don't think there really is any way to say it other than Pettigrew being a coward to save his own skin.

*** The depth lies in WHY Peter attached himself to the strongest group. I'd say the answer lies in fear and possibly past bullying. Alternatively, it could be admiration, and in turn self-loathing and an ability to see his own strong points.

Also, I'd surmise the crew peer pressured Peter quite a bit, usually in that "nice" way, but as he grew older, that may have chafed. He may not have looked on those days as fondly.

*** Sirius says many things but I would take the subjective view of a man who escaped from the prison no one's escaped before just to kill you with a grain of salt. No one says what Pettigrew did was right, but Sirius had just as much information about his turn as anyone else (considering he even suggested him as the secret keeper) and only figured it out the moment when he realized that Voldemort broke through the secret.

*** There may be more to it than what Sirius sees. Otherwise, why did the Sorting hat placed Peter in Gryffindor in the first place? It can't all be cowardice, maybe he had grown into the embodiment of cowardice by the time we met him, but he must have been a different person back in school. At least to some extent

**** Peter is not a coward. If he was truly so cowardly, he would have just run away from the first war when it was getting too much for him--leave Britain or enter the Muggle world or something to avoid the fighting. He doesn't do that. He instead defects over to Voldemort, becomes a Death Eater, and spies on the Order, which is just as, if not more dangerous than fighting for the Order against Death Eaters, and certainly not a task that can be performed by someone cowardly and timid. Peter's problem isn't really lack of bravery. I do believe Sirius is accurate in saying that Peter is motivated by a need to be on the winning side. He's just a really malicious and shitty person.

***** Hermione and in Ravenclaw? Not a snowball's chance in hell. Sure, she had the smarts, but she lacked the imagination and the vision, the inventiveness.

Luna and her dreamy quality and her quirks and believing whatever just because it is nice is a much better representation of the Ravenclaw spirit.

Hermione is a stickler for rules and a justice warrior, which are typical Gryffindor qualities.

****** I disagree. All Ravenclaws were different in that aspect. And Luna was even bullied because of how she was so that's an indication that she was only one that acted like that.

And where does it say that Gryffindors are stickler for rules? Our main trio breaks rules left and right.

** Honestly?

It was because he sought power. I reckon he did love his friends, and he was talented in his own right, but Peter is portrayed as sort of a coward, a kid who was probably bullied as a young child. His friends were powerful, in magic and personality. They were charismatic, smart, likeable. He benefitted from that. People ask why he was sorted into Gryffindor, rather than Slytherin or Hufflepuff. I believe it was because the hat saw how Peter wanted to be brave, and that was brave in itself.

When in the chaos of war, I suspect he thought they would lose, that it was unlikely the "light" side would win, and so he turned to power. Voldemort, or Tom riddle, was powerful, charismatic and his magic seductive to those who are or feel weak. Peter probably felt it was his best bet in being on the winners side. Other things may have attributed, such as feeling insecure within himself, jealous of his friends and the ease they feel within society (perhaps James and sirius moreso than remus).

Honestly the best way to summarise is that it was war, people were dying and Peter was unprepared to die so he turned tails. He was overrun by cowardice

** I have seen one verion of it, I can't remember where, when it came out in the trial that he was captured and tortured by Bellatrix over several months and basically broken. After he had betrayed the Potters, he realised that he couldn't go back as it would mean life in Azkaban/death by Sirius and so he was stuck with his new master.

I always felt that Peter was the weak link because he was the only one of the Marauders with something to lose. James obviously couldn't really betray himself, his family was already dead and he had enough money to be comfortable for at least a while, if not for life.

Sirius had been thrown out of his family, and James seemed to be the only family he had left, so of course he would die for him. Similarly Remus had no other friends or life prospects due to his condition, so he had nothing to betray the Potters for.

Peter however not only had living family that could be used as leverage, but wanted to live his life. I feel that it is heavily implied that a combination of no longer being stuck at school together and the pressures of the war meant that the Marauders had drifted appart somewhat. So I feel that Peter was probably planning for a future that may not have involved the rest of the Marauders anyway, and had hopes and dreams and maybe a job and a house that the death eaters, or their sympathisers could easily give or take away as leverage.

Pettigrew being left behind during the third escape of the Potters, Voldemort going for his mother, Voldemort playing on his lust for Lily who never noticed him and his secret hatred for James for always overshadowing him... but you can always go by what we're told... he either wanted to be on the winning side or he was a coward who caved in the first time he came face to face with Voldemort (and considering how Voldemort talks to him in GoF, I wouldn't think that that's far from the truth).
