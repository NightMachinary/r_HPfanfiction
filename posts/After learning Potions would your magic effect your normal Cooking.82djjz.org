When making Potions I assume that a Wizards magic reaches out into the potion other wise a Muggle would be able to do potions.

Would A persons magic after learning potion Reach out and effect the making and cooking of normal food giving even normal food some magical effect even if its just make it taste better?

also any stories were harry gets into magical cooking ? and does things like making his own Cheese,Bacon,ham,Pancetta,ect(sort of harry being a person who uses magic to make foods that he sell at farmer markets)

what way could you see magic being used in normal cooking?

like could use use conjured Sugar so you get all the flavor with non of the calories ?

vanishing bones and Entrail-Expelling Curse(I could see how quite a few cooking spells could end up being dark arts if used on a living person)

using the Flagrante curse on a Frying pan or Hotplate


** Is there any canon hint that muggles cannot do Potions if they had magical ingredients?

*** I checked the wiki page and it says muggle cant make potions.

but they can use them

then again it says nothing about it in the books so it can go either way depending on how an author want to take a story(and Snape does say that there is no wand-waving need in harrys first class so take of that what you will)

*** Rowling said you need to use magic to be able to make a potion.

** I don't think so, any more than saying an incantation without the slightest intent behind it and without waving your wand would produce the effect. Not to mention Potions only really work thanks to the magic in the ingredients, even if the potioneer's own magic is necessary to kick things off; it's not as if you can just mix up any old brew while /intending/ to get a potion, and get something that actually does anything. The whole point of Potions is that it's very precise, and if you steer just slightly off the recipe or add your powdered asphodel just too early, the whole thing's either going to explode or turn into useless goop.

*** At lower level sure potions in just about following instructions. but at Higher level it sees a bit more intuitive than that.

**** I look at it like advanced mathmatics --- there reaches a point in potioning where considering every ingredient interaction the normal way becomes such a colossal waste of time that really great Potioneers are those who develop a good instinct for predicting the low-level interactions so that they can focus on just the important ones.

** The Gemino spell means the entire country can eat the same food. A collective of farmers each competing to be the best at producing one type of produce. This year, Agnes Prewett has the best honeycrisp apple, while for tomatoes, Yvette Lestrange won the national contract for both sweet and tart varieties. If you aren't a fan of black krim or green zebra, don't worry; Lily Luna Potter's got her sudduth brandywines available at select locations in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Meanwhile, on the citrus front, Teddy Lupin's lemons have a real bite to them.

Bluebell flames would probably be better than /Flagrate/ -- safer, certainly. I could see them being used, depending on how they work, as a decoration, or a way to slowly sear something, or as a primary means of cooking.
