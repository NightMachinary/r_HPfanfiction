** The Harry Potter series is a disinformation campaign and propaganda piece initiated by Hermione Granger, but ultimately approved by Harry Potter.

In the real version, the line between good and evil was far more murky. The real Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World. One major point of the conflict was the government form of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn the Ministry into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Wizard Britain, silenced most critics, and used propaganda heavily to legitimize their cause. To their credits, the overall living standard and opportunities for the masses have significantly improved under their rule, and they did eventually earn their legitimacy.

** Harry is a very powerful wizard that grew up in a cupboard. Hermione is a child-prodigy who only follow rules when she deemed them right. Them becoming friends was a recipe for disaster from the start. Both of them aren't as well adjusted as they make it seem in the books.

That's where Ron Weasley comes in. In the books he seems a little bit medicore, a little bit blank between those two war heroes. But between Harry who is powerful and also very oblivious about it (seriously - who banishes a hundred dementors with just one spell?!) and Hermione who toed the line between genius and madness since age twelve when she stared brewing a highly restricted potion in a girls bathroom they would have landed themselves in Azkaban before reaching age twenty.

So Ron (together with the very helpful writer Luna Lovegood) published the biography for the sake of justifying some of their more questionable decisions that came to light after the war. It wasn't easy by any means. It's hard to justify a murder at age eleven. Or a kidnapping at age fourteen. Harry killed Quirrell and Hermione kidnapped Rita Skeeter, they couldn't wrap that under the carpet. And that was just the beginning. Rules are sometimes a very foreign concept for them. Nobody ever talked about what happend to Umbridge or the Carrows who wither away in St. Mungos after their encounters with them.

Ron knows that. And so he does everything to keep Harry and Hermione out of prison. They are good people at heart. And if it means that Ron looks like an idiot and Luna like a loon they will do it. For the sake of their friends and the wizarding world.

** Harry, Ron and Hermione knew darker spells to defeat the Death Eaters, then what is protrayed.

Ginny's mental health was never quite the same after her exposure to the diary. How she is protrayed in the books is wish fulfillment by the trio.

The Slytherins were a mix of wanting to follow in their parents' footsteps, wanting to protect themselves and their friends, and wanting to be left alone. It wasn't so black and white with the Slytherins. (Or the other houses).

Sirius was a lot more insane after 12 years of Dementor exposure, even with being an animagus, the animagus form can only do so much. The Sirius that is portrayed in the books is an adult figure that Harry had always wanted but never got in real life.

** All of the trio, not just Harry, were brutalised (in the sense of having been made more brutal) by the events in DH.

Ron didn't just steal his wand back and run away from the snatchers. Two of the Snatchers would never hurt anyone again.

On the other hand, did you really believe that ridiculous story that Ron opened the Chamber of Secrets by imitating a Parseltongue phrase he heard once half a decade prior? It was Hermione: from her reading of /Secrets of the Darkest Art/, she knew of a bit of Dark magic that granted temporary Parselmouth abilities. It involved the larynx of snake (that she had with her, just in case) and a larynx of a living human (who was a random Hogwarts student whose gruesome Death was later blamed on the Death Eaters). After opening the Chamber, she Obliviated Ron and implanted a False Memory of him hissing at the sink.

** Ron and Hermione? They never made friends with the lonely boy in hand-me-downs. Ron sat with his siblings, adn Hermione found it most appealing to sit with Neville, whom she found extremely silent and very good for holding books.

That night in GoF? Harry never saw his parents. He fought through it himself. He also suffered a few more minutes of torture. Did you really think Voldemort would be that merciful?

Ginny Weasley? After Harry tried asking her to the ball, and she declined. Harry never tried courting her again, instead settling down with Parvati happily.

As for Parvati? Not a gossip at all. Instead, Parvati was a lovely girl, yes interested in small talk, but also astronomy, mystery, and runes. Harry loved her for it.

Auror? No, Harry is a healer. A healer and a philanthropist. He donates to magical orphanages every single month.

Amorentia? No, Harry smelt warm chocolate chip cookies, a fresh autumn breeze, and the faint smell of a hospital. He wanted love, freedom from his burden, and to be able to heal anyone who had gone through trauma as he did.

And Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore? All dead in fifth year, before they could help the ill-fated boy with defeating Voldemort, and gaining just a little love.

** The events of the Harry Potter series actually happened 22 years earlier than stated in the book (so for example Harry was born in 1958, started school in 1969 and defeated Voldemort in 1976), however the editors insisted on moving events to contemporary times to make it more approachable to readers. However, this was done clumsily, resulting in lots of errors and inconsistencies, from mistaking the date when Playstation first appeared up to John Major's predecessor being described as a man instead of a woman. Also, by moving Grindelwald's defeat from 1923 to 1945, an association between him and the Nazis was implied, which never existed. Finally, the Epilogue was moved to the future rather than happening shortly before the first book was published

** The editors, publishers and ministry officials overseeing the publication demanded a heteronormalized relationship between Harry and Gilbert (Ron's younger brother, 7th Weasley son) and so Gilbert was turned into a girl in the books and given name Ginny.
