:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, Arthur is home, I think molly attempts something, and Arthur strangles(?) her. Anyways, he ransacks the house I think and then goes to work like normal. He comes home to the aurors or maybe they contact him, and he acts devastated. Later though, Percy reveals to him that he witnessed what his father did, and this actually brings Percy closer to his father somehow due to some ongoing plot in the book. That's all I really remember, just that scene in particular.

Any and all help, suggestions, thoughts, or ideas are welcome! Thanks!
