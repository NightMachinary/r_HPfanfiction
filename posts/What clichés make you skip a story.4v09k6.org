I generally skip stories when they are very obvious Mary Sues. I also skip Harry-reads-Harry-Potter type of stories, Harry-sorted-into-another-house-but-I-have-no-imagination-so-I-copy-pasted-Rowling's-story type of stories.

There are a few others, but these are the few off the top of my head.

I'm writing a new story where Harry befriends Malfoy and a few other Slytherins, so I thought it'd be good to know what clichés to avoid when writing. :)

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.

This one's a pet peeve for me as well: no matter that Harry is a different person and/or is Sorted into a different House and/or does not come to Hogwarts in the first place, and no matter that Harry, Ron, and Hermione don't get to have the shared experiences that mislead her into thinking that they are friends, Ron still somehow manages to send Hermione to her appointment with the Troll on the very day it happened in canon. It's even worse when Ron is portrayed as deliberately bullying her, as opposed to being overheard by her justifiably complaining about her hectoring.

It's not an auto-close for me, but there better be an interesting twist on it. (Harry being more badass, defeating the Troll singlehandedly, or in a manner more dignified than shoving his wand up its nose does not count as "interesting".)

I've read the damned books (ok: I didn't finish the last one...didn't like it one bit) and I know what happened and it's very unlikely that say a Ravenclaw book-worm-Harry would go to confront Voldemort at the mirror (no way: Such a guy would get a teacher and if they can't help: He might send for the Aurors even!)

Without Harry, there's no flying lesson and Remembrall --- or maybe Hermione just tells on Draco, and she and Neville become friends --- no duel, no Fluffy; Ron and Hermione would have no shared experiences, so Hermione would have no reason to care what Ron thinks about her. Even if Hermione had a breakdown anyway, the chances of it happening there and then and to the same extent, would be astronomically small.

Even if that contrived coincidence were to happen, Harry would have no reason to even notice that Hermione in particular is missing, so Hermione would probably be on her own, though not locked in as in canon. The consequences of that are left as an exercise to the writer.

******* That's the thing: hectoring people to keep them out of trouble and correcting them is how early-canon Hermione expresses friendship and affection, and while it might be observer bias, she seemed to be focused on Harry and Ron in particular. Those bad social skills also keep her from noticing that they don't feel the same way or not taking Ron's words to this end seriously most of the time. Notice, for example, that, regarding the duel,

#+begin_quote
  ‘I almost told your brother,' Hermione snapped. ‘Percy -- he's a Prefect, he'd put a stop to this.'
#+end_quote

but she didn't. Instead, she goes directly to them, and rather than going straight to McGonagall, she finds a reason to go with them to keep them out of trouble. Or,

#+begin_quote
  Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
#+end_quote

Hermione seems to think that not speaking to them would effect change in their behavior --- that it was some sort of a punishment for them. However, that only makes sense if she thought that Harry and Ron cared about her opinions.

She might dismiss Ron's words prior to Halloween as just friends fighting out of pride most of the time, but when she overhears his words to Harry --- which has to be his honest opinion, since they aren't just arguing --- the fact that he doesn't even mean for her to hear finally gets through to her that no, they aren't friends, not even a little. She's wrecked those relationships, and the worst part is that because she has been approaching the matter completely incorrectly, /she has no idea where to start fixing that/, which is doubly painful for a planner and problem-solver like Hermione. /That's/ something to cry about all afternoon (even though other Gryffindor girls possibly try to comfort her --- it's ambiguous).

Again, remove Harry, and there's no duel, no flying lesson, no broomstick, no Quiddich seekerdom --- Ron and Hermione barely interact, and the whole groundwork for Halloween is missing.

******** I might be biased, but if that's how she shows affection I don't want to see how she shows contempt and hatred :D

Also: They didn't want anything to do with her, so why would she want to be their friend (I mean keeping them out of trouble is IMHO more her strict adherence to the rules rearing its ugly head, so she reasons that she better go with them (she can't really stop both of them))? I mean why not try Lavender and Parvati first (ok from her POV they might be airheads/bimbos but Ron and Harry aren't anything special at first either, they aren't attractive (yes, even 11 year olds can have crushes after all), they aren't great at school and hanging out with them doesn't protect her from bullies either!)? Makes no sense IMHO!

Did they care? They liked it that way! (at least that's implied IMHO!)

Maybe - but she didn't only ruin those relationships, I mean no one else seemed especially keen to spend time with her either!

The groundwork isn't those specific things IMHO - would Hermione still be lonely without those things happening? Probably (very likely even)! Would Hermione be criticised and ridiculed by others? Probably! Would she cry because of that? Likely! Would it happen on that very same day? Now that's up to the writer ;) (IMHO it can still happen!)

Not completely, the writer just needs to show that Hermione doesn't have any friends and that someone (doesn't have to be Ron!) was mean to her (yes mean, despite not agreeing with her approach to helping people saying that was mean - not that it was meant that way, after all she wasn't meant to hear it!) and that she cries because she's got no friends and it's a repeat of primary school all over again (I am just guessing, but I don't think she had many - if ANY - friends before Hogwarts...she was just to driven to excel, to driven to learn, too much of a teacher's pet and over all probably not all that fun to be around!)

  I might be biased, but if that's how she shows affection I don't want to see how she shows contempt and hatred :D
#+end_quote

You already have. In loosely chronological order, she sets them on fire; hexes them; kidnaps and impersonates them; punches them; kidnaps imprisons, and blackmails them; very visibly and irreversibly disfigures them; and manipulates them into mortal danger. Harry and Ron both are very fortunate that they never earned her contempt and hatred.

Let's just say that if you had a choice between having canon!Harry and canon!Hermione have contempt and hatred for you, choose Harry, unless you are Voldemort. (I'm pretty sure that you aren't Voldemort.)

#+begin_quote
  Also: They didn't want anything to do with her, so why would she want to be their friend (I mean keeping them out of trouble is IMHO more her strict adherence to the rules rearing its ugly head, so she reasons that she better go with them (she can't really stop both of them))? I mean why not try Lavender and Parvati first (ok from her POV they might be airheads/bimbos but Ron and Harry aren't anything special at first either, they aren't attractive (yes, even 11 year olds can have crushes after all), they aren't great at school and hanging out with them doesn't protect her from bullies either!)? Makes no sense IMHO!
#+end_quote

For whatever reason, she liked them more than the rest of her cohort in Gryffindor; that much seems to be clear. Part of it might be that they stood out --- their behavior was a problem she thought she could fix, and Hermione likes to fix problems and people and problem people.

#+begin_quote
  Did they care? They liked it that way! (at least that's implied IMHO!)
#+end_quote

I agree. Apparently, Hermione missed that, since she attempted the silent treatment.

#+begin_quote
  Maybe - but she didn't only ruin those relationships, I mean no one else seemed especially keen to spend time with her either!
#+end_quote

Indeed. Too bad Percy wasn't in her year, and she was too eager to Change the World (whether the world wanted it or not) to go to Ravenclaw. She would have probably been happier there.

#+begin_quote
  The groundwork isn't those specific things IMHO - would Hermione still be lonely without those things happening? Probably (very likely even)! Would Hermione be criticised and ridiculed by others? Probably!
#+end_quote

Improbably. Why would others criticize or ridicule her? Ron is no more likely than Seamus to say a word if she left him alone --- which she probably would, if Harry didn't keep dragging them both into adventures --- and the rest of her cohort in Gryffidnor seems to be indifferent or favorably disposed.

#+begin_quote
  Would she cry because of that? Likely!
#+end_quote

Depends. If someone --- say, Draco --- actually did try to bully her, see above for how she reacts if sufficiently provoked.

#+begin_quote
  Would it happen on that very same day? Now that's up to the writer ;) (IMHO it can still happen!) Not completely, the writer just needs to show that Hermione doesn't have any friends and that someone (doesn't have to be Ron!) was mean to her (yes mean, despite not agreeing with her approach to helping people saying that was mean - not that it was meant that way, after all she wasn't meant to hear it!)
#+end_quote

No, it has to be someone whose opinions she values --- even if she wouldn't admit it to herself --- and also not obviously trying to bully her. Notice that it's not Ron's insults to her face that get to her; that sort of thing gets her to escalate. It's when the "insult" is an honest expression of his feelings to Harry, that's what gets her. Someone like Draco being mean to her would probably make her angry, not send her wallowing in self-pity.

#+begin_quote
  and that she cries because she's got no friends and it's a repeat of primary school all over again (I am just guessing, but I don't think she had many - if ANY - friends before Hogwarts...she was just to driven to excel, to driven to learn, too much of a teacher's pet and over all probably not all that fun to be around!)
#+end_quote

That's my guess as well.

However, ultimately, it's still the fanfic author choosing to contrive events so that Hermione is put into peril so that she is in need of being rescued by their (typically new and improved) version of Harry Potter; well, that, or hurt so that she is removed from Hogwarts so she could be together with their (typically new and improved) Harry Potter who isn't at Hogwarts, or however else the author wants to use that plot device.

Just because JKR uses a bad plot device doesn't mean that everybody else should. We are stuck with the canon characters and settings, charm and warts and all, but there's no obligation to use the same plot --- quite the opposite, in fact.

#+end_quote

Maybe; again, we don't see any evidence of malice from anyone else in Gryffindor, and here's how we see her roommates talking about her: "Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls' toilets and wanted to be left alone."

Now, that could be them gloating about how pathetic she is, or something like that, but I would think that even Harry would have noticed that, and, also, they seem to be sympathetic and respectful of her wishes, if anything.

The only person in Gryffindor that we see expressing dislike was Ron, and that was entirely in reaction to Hermione's hectoring and condescension. (The Harmonian habit of portraying Ron as a bully does a disservice to both Ron and Hermione.)

#+begin_quote
  She's coming along to the duel to mitigate the damage (read: loss of house points) the "trouble-makers" cause
#+end_quote

The justification she gives for coming along is as follows: "D'you think I'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me? If he finds all three of us I'll tell him the truth, that I was trying to stop you and you can back me up." Taking that at face value, she was trying to avoid getting herself caught, and was planning to throw Harry and Ron under the bus to save herself if she were, in fact, caught. However, when Filch and Norris pick up their scent, she doesn't follow through on that, but runs with them and helps them hide, so her original line seems to be more of a self-justification. (Throughout canon, Hermione is /very/ good at coming up with justifications for doing what she actually wants.) This is consistent with the fact that she could have gone to Percy, which would have gotten Harry and Ron into trouble but before they did anything to actually lose points, but didn't.

In some sense, one could view her decisions as a pretext/self-justification for hanging out with them, because she actually did like them for whatever --- not necessarily rational --- reason, and it also explains why she thought silent treatment would work to effect a change in their behavior: it was unpleasant for her, so it must be unpleasant for them too, right?

No, standing up Draco would have been to call BS on his "wizard's duel" challenge. They instead got themselves provoked and manipulated into trouble by the bully --- which, by the way, bullies and abusers often do to their victims. (That was, by the way, the most Slytherin thing Draco had managed over his whole Hogwarts career.)

#+end_quote

Firstly, I think you mean "Hermione is the best in her year in /everything but Defense/." :P

On Ron dragging the other two down,

1. Ron is almost as good academically and in terms of magical skill as Harry --- possibly better in some areas. (Remember how much difficulty Harry had learning the Summoning Charm?) He does not have Harry's physical abilities and the emotional disposition to be as good at DADA, but he earned as many OWLs as Harry (7) and is in all his NEWT classes, so he earned at least Es where Harry earned at least Es.
2. Do keep in mind that for his first year, Ron was using someone else's wand; and for his second year, he was using /a broken wand/, and he still passed all his classes. Nor has he had the opportunity to hone his reflexes and situational awareness as a part of Quiddich practice like Harry. He is far from dragging them down in terms of raw talent.
3. Ron can and does work hard when he has a clear goal that actually means something to him and that he believes he can achieve, such as becoming an Auror. When he doesn't, he doesn't. As it happens, that's pretty much how Harry works as well: when it's do or die, he does, but when it's just the long slog towards getting better at magic with no end in sight, he does the minimum that Hermione would let him get away with doing.
4. Ron has self-esteem issues worse than the other two's: he is sixth of six sons, followed by a daughter everyone dotes on, with his three older brothers being big overachievers and the next two being Siblings from Hell to whom he owes his arachnophobia and who knows what else. He can't conceive that he could ever be as good as his older brothers, so why try? Add to that that Weasleys are poor --- and have for a long time, if Draco is any indication, and those around him, including Harry and Hermione, aren't.
5. I am not one of those who blow his chess skills out of proportion, but stupid people don't get good at chess.

So, when Ron gets overshadowed by the Boy-Who-Lived and a hard-working near-genius, that's not saying much.

#+end_quote

The important bit is that she tires to mitigate the damage not just to herself or to Gryffindor, but to Harry and Ron as well. And, at least judging from her behavior, she wanted to come along with Harry and Ron, but had to invent a self-justification for doing it.

May I remind you that everybody involved is an 11-years-old ickle firstie, and therefore their "duels" would not be taken seriously by anyone except for other 11-year-old ickle firsties? Here are the likely reactions of various Hogwarts demographics to this amazing new revelation, at least as I see it:

*Gryffindors:* Haha! That just goes to show you that those slimy, slippery snakes are dishonorable cowards! This is totally something we didn't know before and will affect future inter-house relations.

Actually, no, that's not how most Gryffindors would react. It'd be more like:

*Gryffindors:* So Malfoy provoked you into breaking the rules, then got you into trouble? Yeah, Slytherins try to do that sort of thing all the time, so don't feel too bad for falling for it. Just don't fall for it again.

As for the other demographics,

*Hufflepuffs:* Oh, look, those Gryffindors and Slytherins are at it again. So violent! Aren't we glad we are just one big happy family, who aren't interested in inter-house rivalries?

*Ravenclaws:* Oh, look, those Gryffindors and Slytherins are at it again. So brutish! Aren't we glad we keep our rivalries and bullying in-house?

*Slytherins:* Good job, Draco. You totally punked those Gryffindorks! Very cunning and ambitious of you: only a first-year, and already a credit to Slytherin!

*Teachers:* Miss Granger, thank you for confessing to being in the hallways after curfew and endangering yourselves and others. Fifty points from Gryffindor --- each --- and two weeks of detention with Snape.

*Lucius:* Ha! The kid's all right. Reminds me of something I pulled on Arthur Weasley in our second year...

Harry can 100% be jealous or possessive of Ginny and get angry at guys who hit on her (that's canon and shown in the books, it also goes both ways) but Ginny should probably spot why he's jealous and Harry should be logical enough to at least talk to Ginny before running off.

********** For /ages/ it was the only decent DA 7th year fic (thanks for that btw! :P) and it was dark enough that it made their experiences seem different to Harry's etc whilst not being like the Darth Potter type fics that have Harry raping bunnies. I read it like 5 years ago and it appealed to me as a teenager but on a reread it is just appallingly awful. Also one of those fics where once you recognise the flaws (e.g. sexism, awful scaling on punishments, the DA going from graffiti to prison break) it just becomes impossible to not notice them.

****** I disagree, if we took that approach than nothing in the past 100 or so years would be used in fiction (even original fiction, much less fanfiction!) at all!

You have the right to be offended, sure! But somebody else has the right to oversimplify or even stereoptype something (or somebody!) if he or she thinks it's usefull to advance their plot (or if the plot revolves around that event or person - as long as the author is not claiming to write a damned scientific book or the total truth it's all fine and peachy IMHO!)

Note: Telling someone "you can't do that, say that, write that" is in no way helpful (free speech and all that - sorry, but hate-speech-laws etc. are too close to censorship in my book to be acceptable, same for accusing comedians of slander etc. if they write or speak about politicians etc. (look at that German guy Erdogan is after...sure his poetry was offensive, but Erdogan is a political figure, so that is/should be ok!)) or even acceptable!

I understand it if somebody who's offended doesn't want to read it (I've got my own peeves and things I don't want to read - slash in general for example (doesn't make me homophobic, but I don't want to read about it) - and that's ok, too!), but claiming that your oppinion is the only relevant one etc.? Nope!

ps: Yeah, being racist etc. against majorities is a new thing (and people aren't criticised etc. for it, especially if they belong to minorities themselves :(

- Slytherin fics where Pansy or Blaise act all nice and friendly. I get that the books are told from Harry's biased pov and that you want us to see some characters under a new light, and I'm all for Blaise, Pansy and other minor Slytherin characters getting more development, but you can't change what we already know about them ! Seriously if the author wants to show that Slytherins can be nice and kind and everything, it's better imo to introduce some student we don't know anything about in the books (Daphne for example) and/or an original character.

- Blaise being bff with Draco is a big no-no for me. They don't seem to have anything in common and I can't imagine them getting along well. Also it's obvious in the books that Draco isn't really close to anyone and hang out almost only with Crabbe and Goyle. I'm not saying that he is antisocial and don't talk to anyone (aloof Draco is another cliché I dislike), just that I personally think a Draco-Blaise friendship is unrealistic and definitely overdone in fanfics (I like the idea of Draco being friend with Theodore Nott better, don't know why it's not more popular)

** Casanova!Harry.

I get that sometimes authors want to live vicariously through the characters in their stories, but it seems really strange to have Harry Potter be the one to embody this particular character trait. Does anyone else remember just how awkward his scenes with Cho were in GoF? Harry has many strong, admirable qualities but he's no Don Juan.

** Logic jumps, stupid ball, and plot armour. I need to feel the danger your Harry is in. I need him to know that his choices logically lead to the conclusion, and there is a possibility he or his friends will be hurt or even die as a coniquence.

I can accept randomness, and the unlikely, but you have to make me believe that it's possible. Harry gets hit by a car and dies, ok. Hermoine gets hit by a car and is now paraplegic, not ok. Ron is hit by a runaway spell and is now paraplegic, ok. Harry takes over the government at 11, not ok.

As I so often repeat to myself, it's all about the small things really.

A huge part of what makes a story successful is the attention to detail on small things. Like how when you're directing a conversation between two people, you could include details about the surroundings as well. It makes the story more memorable and is a really great tool.

I often use that to convey a clue to the reader about a certain character. Like for example, Cissa and Bella are talking, and Cissa is occupied otherwise, and is merely humouring her sister by pretending to listen to her. And perhaps the most undistracting way to do that would be by portraying Cissa tapping her fingers on the table. A small thing can go a long way in setting the mood and play of the entire scene...

Also on the topic of logic jumps, I think that most fics are written as the crow flies. It's often more difficult to keep track of things when you don't have a specific story board

Heroes are forged in fire. Not made by shopping trips and having super special advantages that make them better than the villain in every way.^{1} Frodo gives in to the Ring. Luke only beats Vader by giving in to his anger. Belgarion is outclassed by Torak in swordsmanship. Voldemort is better at magic than Harry. If wandless magic is that powerful, Voldemort would be slingin' it around better than everyone.

1. An argument can be made that Greek/Roman heroes violate this, but they all get fucked over in the end (except for, I think it was, Perseus), so I'm not going to count them.

******* They aren't if say curses work without but something as precise as say enchanting still needs them :) and if they make normal casting less wasteful (less concentration needed etc.)

But wands aren't a requirement (we have WoG, Harry using it to light up his wand (without any training at all) and Voldemort (flying without a broom for example) and Dumbledore (changing the banners in the Great Hall at the end of first year!) use it, too!), they are a convenience, a crutch, a tool (just like it's easier to kill a wild beast with a gun than with your bare hands or a simple stick!)

Well, if you are shopping for stuff to train with (I did martial arts as a teenager and you need equipment for that, too and you will get better faster with propper tools) then it helps (sure it won't turn Harry into somebody to make Voldemort look like a kicked puppy in a few weeks, but it does help - even more if he got the element of surprise because Voldemort doesn't know Harry knows certain magic...I mean if Harry had some wandless magic he might have overcome Peter during the ritual and might have finished Voldemort's homunculus so that a horcrux hunt could happen without Voldemort taking over ANYTHING, because without a body the DEs won't flock to him as most of them don't know he's alive and most others are locked up!)

No, Voldemort might not because while he did travel to other countries he might not have been to Africa (and the other countries have "given in" to wands fully!)...it doesn't have to be all powerful, but sumoning his wand back when disarmed for example does sound dead useful without being a one-shot-kill on anybody! Same for say being able to get rid of magical crowd-control-spells (freezing spells, magical ropes etc.)...

I know that a traditional heroes journey works different than Harry Potter (it's one of the gripes with the books, I'd have loved something more traditional here!), but those heroes still beat their enemies without relying on chance, luck and extremely ancient lore...they do it on their own (Luke's refusing to kill Vader and bow to the Emperor was foolish but still his own doing (no cunning plan by Yoda, Obi-Wan etc.) and it makes Vader act so over all Luke did kill the emperor, just by proxy instead of cutting him into pieces himself!)

1. WoG with Rowlings is a little suspect. Things contradict each other, don't make sense (ie, anything with numbers), and almost always is incredibly pandering.

2. If you go back and read one of my earlier comments (probably that first one you responded to today), you'll note that I approve of wandless magic for small things, and I'm not sure if lighting your wand without holding it actually counts as wandless magic, since you know, the effect is coming out of the want. It's the big slingin' curses shit I don't like.

3. We don't know how Voldemort does his flying thing. Is it something you cast at first that doesn't wear off until later? Is it some variety of self-transfiguration akin to animagus transformations? Too many unanswered questions.

4. Simpler solution than wandless magic for Dumbledore at the end of PS. He seems to favor a bit of showmanship and definitely had that final speech all planned out before going in. The clap was probably just a sign for house elves to change the decorations.

5. As for the crutch thing? NO EVIDENCE FOR WANDS BEING A CRUTCH OUTSIDE FANDOM. And don't try arguing accidental magic. Accidental magic is exactly that, accidental and therefore uncontrolled and therefore not something to be relied upon.

6. No evidence that Voldemort didn't go to Africa. Frankly, given what we know of Ancient Egypt and curses (in a letter Hermione mentions something about Ancient Egyptians having fascinating curses, Bill working there as a cursebreaker), Africa was probably an incredibly likely destination for his travels.

And here you just made my point. That story (and it has been written many times) is incredibly boring. No significant conflict, and is basically just a Harry&Dumbledore curbstomp, which is both boring *and* lazy.

Of course it's a crutch - a wizard is damn near helpless without a wand (they can still apparate, but that's it...hell, here we have a prime example for wandless magic: TELEPORTATION! If that's not advanced then I don't know what is!)

Oh there is conflict: Draco is still there (and without his Deatheater angst he might actually amount to something), Lucius and Fudge are still up to no good, Snape is still alive and causes Harry etc. grief!
