  What would you do if you were reborn inside the Harry Potter Universe. Follow Alexander Fawley's adventures as he is reborn in the Harry Potter world. In this tale, he will have new unique adventure to call his own, And he will discover that the Harry Potter Universe is much greater than he had imagined. This is my first story, so please leave reviews, to let me know how I am doing

** 'Harry Potter and the Reluctant Rebirth' and it's sequel 'Harry Potter and- Oh God, Not this Guy' are SI's into Harry. Rather entertaining in my opinion, now just waiting for the third year sequel to start. Combined they're about 130k.

'The Ghost of Privet Drive' has a dead guy reincarnated as a spirit at the Dursley's with the goal of being a responsible adult in the world of Harry Potter and ensuring that Harry actually has a decent life.

If you like gamer fics, 'The Doll Gamer' is pretty good. It follows an SI-OC Ravenclaw through the first year so far (as of the last chapter the year has been wrapped and everyone is heading home for summer).

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

  When someone dies, they lose their memory and are reborn as someone else. That's how it should be."Should" is the key word.No one wants to be reborn as Harry Potter. No one wants to keep their memories while being reborn as Harry Potter. I repeat: NO ONE WANTS TO BE HARRY- Oh forget it, I'm going into Slytherin.

  One year down, six more to go. It should be smooth sailing from here on out now that Harry is learning magic! He has a strong circle of friends, a growing influence of those around him, and a basic plan for his life. All Harry has to do is keep his school years normal. Except, he forgot about Lockhart... and the basilisk... and- Oh hey! Luna! Well, the year can't be all that bad... right?

  I'm not a hero. I'm not even a functional human being. I'm just a living doll that does what it pleases without a care in the world. "Oh? Some more pots that need breaking. Is that a treasure chest? Mine now." OC SI. Gamer ability. Shameless. From the makers of Neville the Gamer is a new story of a sociopath stuck in the HP world with the gamer ability. Tada-da-daaa! Crash!

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy
