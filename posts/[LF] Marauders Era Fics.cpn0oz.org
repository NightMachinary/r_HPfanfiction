Im looking for well written Marauder's era fics. The longer the better, with a James/ lily relationship of course but not the MAIN focus.

Thank you in advance for any suggestions!


** For gen or teenage stuff I like all the works by lyin on AO3 (Glass of Water is recommended on here a lot linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9106972/chapters/20700622]]) ), linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10840977/chapters/24066027]]) Dirty Blood is good, well-written relationship drama, and Saving Sirius is a sweet and short holiday fic that I found just now looking through my bookmarks and that might fit the bill. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1727813]])

For more mature stuff, I like montparnasse (mostly post Hogwarts stuff) and LucyInTheSkye on AO3. Also linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16281977/chapters/38077013?view_adult=true]]) Into the Fire has some of the best dialogue I've ever come across in fics. The same author, wilteddaisy, does excellent AU's with the Marauders as teenagers, most recently a SKAM cross-over.

  It's 1976 and Hogwarts' N.E.W.T. Divination class can only see the homework in their future. Lily Evans and Sirius Black certainly can't foresee they're falling into friendship. What happens in Divination, stays in Divination.

  Magic was supposed to be whimsical, enchanting, fun. But it's 1975 and the self-proclaimed Dark Lord has other plans. Dark Marks are graffiti'ed across the sky as a warning, a threat. Hogwarts students try to focus on their schooling, their friends, and being a child while they can. But some of their parents remember Grindelwald and they recognize the signs. With fellow students practicing dark magic and friendships being tested, it's hard to ignore that their parents' war will soon be theirs. And yet, they still try, forcing light in the darkness and daring to laugh when others want to cry. After all, they aren't dead yet, and there's few things that would irritate the Dark Lord more than a bunch of blood traitors and muggleborns thriving in the face of his power. This is the story of those blood traitors, those half-bloods, those muggleborns, growing up and up to no good.

  Instead of going home, Sirius walked the darkened streets of central London, dragging from a cigarette and hugging his arms to his chest to fend off the cold, until he found another bar. This was it. This was Sirius' life. Until one day, it wasn't.

  While war brews on the horizon beyond the walls of Hogwarts, the infamous Triwizard Tournament resurfaces just in time for the Marauders' seventh year. It's one more reason for Remus Lupin to pull out his hair and prematurely wrinkle. And another reason? It walks, talks (too much), and chews up Remus' belongings while in dog form.

** The Last Peverell is a guilty read of mine. You may be put of by Fem!Harry. But, it is a very good Marauder's era fic. And Harry may as well be OC.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)
