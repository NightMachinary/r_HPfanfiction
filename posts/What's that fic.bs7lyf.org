:END:
Please can you help me find this fanfiction? What I remember about it was:

1. The horcrux in Harry's head influenced him in a way that when he lost control of it, the horcrux would make him slam his head against a wall
2. Harry was put in hospital and was given heavy medicines to try and stop him from hurting himself
3. Harry could not do magic because of how the medicine affected him

If you find the fic, then thanks!

#+begin_quote
  When Harry was hit by the killing curse, a horcrux was created. In this story, Harry is affected by the piece of Voldemort's soul inside his head in a more noticable way than in the books. Muggles, not knowing any better, decide he must be mentally ill. What effects might the treatment on a psychiatric ward have for the boy-who-lived and the wizarding world?

**** I find this really exciting, and I'm about to click that link to jump right in, but I gotta wonder, are the treatments 90s accurate?

****** Well, I was neither a psych patient nor a doctor in the UK in the 90s, so I would need a time-turner to really see for myself.

*** Thank you so much! I thought I put it in my favourites but for some reason it didn't appear. You are a lifesaver!
