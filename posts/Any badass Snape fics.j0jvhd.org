No abandoned fics, please!

Nothing over 125k words and/or drags on for Harry's childhood and his first couple of years at Hogwarts. Or maybe something longer that I can skip through that part and still understand the story?

Doesn't matter which era it's in.

Slash is cool as long as the relationship is realistic and not creepy (Harry mentor to smut fics rub me the wrong way).

I'm okay with a couple of sex scenes, but not smut in every chapter, slash or no.

The darker and grungier the better, but I'm up for any genre (romance, action, horror, etc).

Snape gets the “path to victory” superpower from Worm. Deadfic but was an interesting read.

It's Severus/Regulus, there's hardly any sex, and I like to think the darkness is dark and the angst is angsty :))) Let me know what you think if you read it!
