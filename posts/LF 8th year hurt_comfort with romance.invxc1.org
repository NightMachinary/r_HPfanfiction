** Hrm. The best year eight fic I'm aware of is a mixture of pairings, but dramione is one of them. If you can stomach that and a fair bit of Slytherins-aren't-all-evil-we-were-just-kids, then Rebuilding is great. Other pairings include Neville/Hannah, Theo Nott/Percy, and Harry/Ginny. (Theo, by the way, is probably the star of the fic for all that its Hermione-centric.)

I will say that for the longest time this was the only Dramione I had ever read, and didn't get the hate for the pairing. Then I read a few more and understood lol. This one remains an enjoyable read even now that I'm more jaded, and follows a bunch of returning students as they deal with their various traumas.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Follows multiple Hogwarts students through '8th year' and one additional year of early adulthood. COMPLETE.
