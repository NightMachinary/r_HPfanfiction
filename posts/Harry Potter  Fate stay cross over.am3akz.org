Looking for a fanfic where Shiro Emiya appears in the HP universe. It's a Fem!Harry fic. Shiro ends up being accepted into Hogwarts as a scholarship student.

Also has Fem!harry bonding with the invisibility cloak and able to do cool things with it.

Also Rin is a student at Hogwarts too, not sure the backstory as to why she's there but she's not the Rin from the Nasuverse.

Something to do with a rainbow/crystal/sword thing that Shiro and Rin attempt to create that shattered the dimensions and sent him into the HPverse.
