More details - Hermione/Tom Riddle - Time Travel: Where Hermione goes back in time through the use of a time machine in order to bring a young version of Voldermort (before he went evil) to her time so Harry could kill him. Thus fulfilling Trelawney's prophecy. - Evil/manipulative Dumbledore - No time turner- time machine

Any help would be amazing!
