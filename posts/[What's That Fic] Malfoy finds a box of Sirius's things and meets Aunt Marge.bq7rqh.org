I don't remember much about this story, and I think it wasn't finished besides.

After Sirius Black breaks out of Azkaban, Malfoy finds a box of his possessions in the attic of Malfoy Manor. Having a somewhat limited knowledge of what happened during the War, Malfoy realizes that it's a great opportunity to torment Harry with the latter's lack of knowledge.

As it happens, it coincides with Aunt Marge's visit to Privet Drive. She yells at Vernon for forgetting his manners and demands that Draco stay for supper as he is a guest.

Malfoy gets a front-row seat to Dursley Drama.

I don't remember anything else, though.
