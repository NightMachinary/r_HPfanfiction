Can we get a way to share Plot bunnies and challenges with each other. Maybe a long term stickied post that we can feed ideas into or maybe a new flair to use in posting new ideas. I love the community but this feels like a missing component, the ability to trade ideas for new stories


** I don't know that most people really need ideas to write from - I know some people like myself really enjoy working from prompts and requests, but there's not really any shortage of ideas in the world, and on those sorts of posts, a lot of people put up ideas for very complex, huge universes.

For those of us that like to fill short prompts, big, complex plot bunnies aren't really what we're looking for; for those who want to write these huge epics, they probably have ideas of their own.

What I'd also say is that we have a very big range of readers and writers on this subreddit, and subsequently you'll have a range of prompts from Harry being a super duper coolio Light Lord who bangs 600 women a day, to a Severus Snape-centric war fic with gay overtones and a dark universe with grey morality. Some people on the subreddit will prefer one over the other; members of the other group will undoubtedly downvote them to oblivion.

You may be better off seeking out a specific prompt community or making one, honestly. I mod [[https://hpkinkmeme.dreamwidth.org][the HP Kink Meme]], so that's an option for anonymous prompts and fills, but otherwise, I'm not sure where you'd find such a community.

*** There are far less prompts for that HP Kink Meme than I would have thought, no matter that there are no new releases (that focus on Harry & Co.)...

**** Yeah, kink memes are pretty dead these days, honestly, it's hard to keep one active! After all, it's all based off whether people put in prompts and fills, so it's up to the fandom whether they're interested or not.
