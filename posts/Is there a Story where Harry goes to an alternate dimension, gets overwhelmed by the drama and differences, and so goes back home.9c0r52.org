** Harry Potter and the Universe too Far by Rumour of an Alchemist linkffn(7833773) fits the first criteria. In this Sorting hat challanges him that the universes he is travelling to are similar and he lacks any sort of challange, then taunts him to go to another universe with a different situation, 'a hard mode setting' as the author calls it. He does not go back to his universe though, it is mostly abandoned and author listed it as a parody.

  Parody. Some horror. Universe-jumping, time-travelling Harry Potter, in search of an ever faster personal best time to defeat Voldemort, ends up out of his depth... Warning! Rated M. Multiple character deaths. ON HIATUS.

** There is a story by Lomonaaeren kinda like that, one of her less well known pieces. Harry basically discovers that the people that summoned him don't exactly have the... purest motives, and at some point decides to gtfo of there. Saying more would spoil it, it's a pretty good story, though a bit heavy on the exposition. Also features sort of mentor!Snape, but it's an AU!Snape that is not as horrible, I think.

  AU after the last chapter of DH. Harry gets pulled into another universe to deal with the problem of Voldemort there. But that is not the worst thing that could happen. Mostly gen, with Snape mentoring Harry. COMPLETE.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World as We Knew It]], linkffn(3571753): Even though he was not the BWL in the other dimension, he still picked a fight with the local Voldemort, under atrocious operational security. Things went well for awhile until that Voldemort made a key breakthrough and royally fucked them over. Harry had no choice but to limp back to his home dimension, but he managed to drag his newly found sister along. [[/spoiler][In the other dimension, Voldemort made a fatal mistake of pissing off Flamel and the French, and soon the entire entire magical world ganged up on him and finished off him for good.]]

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.

** Isn't there one where Harry goes to a world where Dumbledore is evil and Riddle is good and headmaster? Ravenclaw, and not slytherin is the house of baddies. Knowledge, not blood purism. Hermione is one of the bad girls. Plus some mix withwho married who.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?

**** The last few paragraphs of chapter 16 and the entirety of chapter 17.

If you just want to read that bit you should know that the story follows canon until the summer between 4th and 5th year, and diverges after that. The chapters take place in late spring during 5th year.
