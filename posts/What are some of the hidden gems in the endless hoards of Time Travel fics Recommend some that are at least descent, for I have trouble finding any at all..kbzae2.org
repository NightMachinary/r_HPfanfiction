** LullabyKnell is a great author for the aul Time travel. Ao3.

Two to look out for. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4472270/chapters/10164680][into the arena with your head held high by Lullabyknell]]) Nice and short. Harry and Teddy go back and meet Remus and Dorcas and Marauder people and it's just adorable and you'll cry because God knows I did I bloody love Teddy Lupin!!

!linkao3(face death in the hope by LullabyKnell) Unfinished but 63 chapters and not abandoned. Just slow updates. Harry doesn't die in the Forrest but gets sent back to Marauder times and has to deal with all the emotional trauma of that. Some really cool pensive magic and side affects üòä.

Oh!!! And !linkao3(Of A Linear Circle Part 3 by Flamethrower) Finished. Part of a bigger work but you can just read this one alone if you like. Harry is sent back to Founders era and meets the founders and damn I don't want to say anymore but it's incredible and so much excellent history with language barriers and dress and people and cultures and eugh it's brilliant!!!

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. ‚ÄúIt's a really long story,‚Äù he says finally, almost apologetically, ‚Äúand it's really hard to believe.‚Äù‚ÄúTry me,‚Äù Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Harry Potter's fifteenth birthday starts off just like all the others...for the first few seconds, at least. The gift he receives changes his entire life.
