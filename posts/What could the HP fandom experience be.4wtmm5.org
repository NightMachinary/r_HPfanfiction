Hey guys!

I've been reading HP fanfic for over a decade, and it STILL amazes me how vibrant and creative the fandom is.

But lately I've been wondering if the fandom experience could be improved. I'm trying to understand how many people feel similarly. Let's dream a bit here -

- HP fan content is spread out across so many platforms. There's fanart on Deviantart, fan vids on youtube, fanfic everywhere from LJ to FF.net to fictionalley. What if there were one "home" for all types of fandom content (and if it weren't disorganized like tumblr)? Would people prefer that?

- Fanfiction platforms seem pretty much unchanged from the FF.net of 10 years ago - basically, they're still directories of stories. What does the ideal fanfiction app look like? Would it be more community oriented/social? Would it have better search? Better content discovery? Could having contests and prompt-based challenges make it more fun? Could we let people donate to their fav authors? What else is missing?

- There are all kinds of legal issues around trying to make money off of fan content. What if we could wave a magic wand and live in world where both fans and copyright owners could profit from fan creations? Would that result in better quality content? Would fans want to purchase fandom content?

- I have yet to find a great fandom (fanfic or other) content experience on mobile. Do you have a favorite?

I'm trying to gather thoughts to see if I should pursue this "home for my fandom" project further. I'd love your thoughts. Feel free to PM me if you want to discuss in detail!

Cheers, -T

  I don't want it. I don't want that much organization in my life. I don't want other people thinking for me!

** Uh, you may want to read about [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Archive_of_Our_Own][why Ao3 (full name: Archive Of Our Own) was started]]. Because you're hitting most of the main points.

*** "Organization" aka putting every tag that remotely applies so that your story comes up on more searches

**** Doesn't mean that Ao3 does not have: a place for text, images, audio, and video; a legal arm; multiple ways of searching and organizing content; and even teams working on importing/archiving smaller archives in danger of being deleted. That covers a lot of what OP wanted. Just because some authors don't know how to tag well does not make the entire project useless.

** If the mobile FFN site saved scroll position on my phone, it'd be near perfect. If I could change the color scheme to something less eye-scorching than the white background, it would be perfect.

**** Black background white text is almost more jarring of a contrast. Now a dark green and white combo would be a lot better. Softer contrast.

***** I usually combine that with a Night Screen Mode app, and I find that its pretty good to the eyes. You could give that a try I suppose.

** --->DLP

--->Fanfiction.Net is the most popular because its doing something right. The filters in the site, when properly used, can sort out /any/ story you want. The search is a bit wonky, but honestly, not that bad at all. The app is getting /constant/ updates as well. Its heading towards becoming a pretty great hub for fan content.

--->Again, you /can/ make money off of fanfiction. I think Amazon did something like that. Didn't research this, so take this point with a grain of salt.

--->I love fanfiction.net and wattpad apps. Both are well made and are tailored pretty well to the user's need.

It would have to be egalitarian and the fandom doesn't exactly have that type of reputation. This subreddit is as close as it gets.

** Public beta, where all readers could suggest fixes to misspellings and whatnot, would be totally awesome on whichever site (FFN or AO3 I guess).

One Russian fanfiction site has it, you basically select a word or paragraph and can send in a suggestion. It's entirely up to the author if they implement it. Nifty.
