Harry was crazy OP, had 2 Masteries in his fourth year, wasn't trying in the tournament. Did the First task by conjuring food (breaking Gamps law) using what i think was a Formalcraft Circle (or whatever the equivalent was) and then falling asleep on the Dragon. I can't remember the second, but the third somehow involved Voldemort being killed by Yog-Sothoth.
