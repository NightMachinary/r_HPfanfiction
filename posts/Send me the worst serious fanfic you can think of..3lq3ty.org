I'm really in the mood to read some utter crap, so post the worst serious fanfiction you can think of. By serious I mean not a crack fic. That takes the fun out of it.


** Could always reread My Immortal since I'm never /quite/ sure if it was a serious venture.

/Masticating./

  From Chapter 9: "How did you know?" I asked in a surprised way.

  Voldemort got a dude-ur-so-retarded look on his face. "I hath telekinesis." he answered cruelly.
#+end_quote

See, if this was intentional, then "Tara" is friggin' awesome.

EDIT: The fact that he gave her a /gun/ too. Let's not forget that lol.

** I remember very little of the plot of this story, except that it's like SuperHarry travels back in time, Harry/Harem (with consorts and all that bs) fic and that it has the most ridiculous OTT sex scenes that make no damn sense. Harry's penis is "larger than Hermione's forearm and wider than her wrist" and she of course easily deepthroats (first time too, if I remember right). Worst of all, his penis is so big that it doesn't fit into the women's vaginal canals so he just goes through their cervix and into their "wombs". Not joking. Anyway I haven't read this fic in like 3 years, but I had to look it up just for this prompt because I still remember that bullshit.

[[http://ficwad.com/story/40776]] - this is the link to chapter 11 where Luna joins in and has creepy womb sex for her first time.

ETA: The story is Re-Ordered by Dr T

Better you than me. I remember this story as being the least sexy and most confused smut I've encountered in the fandom.

**** It is terrible. I reread/skimmed it last night after I found it to rec and it was just the worst. Blow jobs create magic bonds between couples and have to performed in public to signify official status. Girls just keep swooning to join the harem after seeing Harry's monster cock in the "Couples Room". Girls who keep getting their figures described with laughable measurements. Susan is "a little curvier at 35DD-23-34". Literally the most absurd male fanservice self insert crap. So it fits the prompt for sure!

**** Yeah. I can read these without cringing at horrible grammar and spelling, and if I want a formulaic fic it's great.

Sometimes I /want/ to re-read Harry Crow. Sure, it's typical Super!Lord-Harry-James-Potter-Earl-of-Somesuch-Other-Thing etc. etc. but it's fun to read. Same with a lot of robst's pics.

#+end_quote

True. But very few of those fics have even a fraction of the popularity that Robst has. Robst isn't the first person to write an angry Harmonian rant thinly disguised as a story, nor would he be the last. But he is the most popular, and thus the most obvious target for those who dislike angry Harmonian Rants and all its associated tropes (Weasley bashing, Dumbledore bashing, Wizard bashing, Twu wuv, soul bonds, Mary Sues, lack of meaningful conflict etc).

** linkffn(The Apprentice and the Necromancer by JunoMagic). Some things are best left hidden. Some secret boxes shouldn't be opened...Anyway, to start here are some Slytherin's playing /Settlers of Catan/:

#+begin_quote
  It looked to him as if the board was made up of hexagons that had been enchanted to mirror landscapes, meadows, fields of barley, woods, mountains, muddy or sandy areas and even a small patch of desert.
#+end_quote

Now that was just a warm up!.../sit back and enjoy (or don't) the darkly handsome */Snape disco dancing** with Hermione, who is a student, who he eventually pairs up with*

#+begin_quote
  skylights into the lake and flashed like spotlights in a disco. Silvery spider nets glittered above a bar that took up one entire side of the room in front of the fireplace. At the opposite end of the dungeon a raised platform had been transfigured into a lounge area, complete with green armchairs and settees. The space in between was empty, ready to serve as a dance floor...Hermione -- flustered, surprised, clumsy -- stumbled, caught herself, was pulled close to him, then pushed away again ...clearly Snape knew what he was doing -- dancing discofox of all things!"
#+end_quote

Oh, and Snape drinks a Guinness while chatting up a hot n' bothered Hermione at the fully stocked bar he installs in the Slytherin common room (He orders he a cider, if you were curious).
