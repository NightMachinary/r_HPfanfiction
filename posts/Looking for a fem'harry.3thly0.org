*** There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Miss-Potter/19146/][this]] which is far more comprehensive. No guarantee of quality though.

**** I also browse [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Fem-Harry/93136/99/1/1/0/20/0/0/][this]]. Trust me, I'm a huge Fem!Harry fan, so I've seen that one(it's on the first page of communities). But the op was asking specifically for it to be normal Harry changed into Fem!Harry. And while there are some in both of these communities, the one I first linked has a lot of those. ^ - ^

And of course Fem!Harry is full of quality problems, there are MANY that are just entirely unreadable. But every so often there is a really, really good one.
