  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

****** For me it's also because I'm not a huge fan of the historical arcs.

You know those low budget historical TV shows where everything looks like it's made of plastic, the clothes look like costumes rather than what people would have actually worn, the sets look like sets rather than real places, etc?

Well the historical arcs in Long Journey Home read a bit like that to me. There's just something about them that feels a bit... shallow.

I think part of it is the lack of real historical tie-ins. For example, the Arthurian arc appears to take place in an entirely fantastical land. There's no sign at all that events are occurring in post-Roman Britannia, nor any real sense of continuity with the nature of HP wizarding society.

Another aspect of it is the magic, I think. For some reason, the magic in the historical arcs feels a lot more "generic fantasy" rather than specifically HP in character, and that results in it feeling less immediate.

******* It is indeed frustrating how much it feels fake. For some reason a desperate coke commercial set historically comes to mind.

I won't be surprised if most historical fic authors choose a certain HP detail and cook up the most absurd way it could have been a part of HP history (like Ebenbild's Basilisk-born where Salvazsahar becomes Salazar just because the founders can't pronounce it properly)

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.

** I like linkao3(4876630) ... there is still too much smut for my taste, but comparing to some others (ehm, linkffn(11396276)) there is still something more than that. I had to skip, but there is rather decent story hidden somewhere there.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

Some say---""It signals when a soul comes back to this world from the dead."---POTC quote.The Higher Entities end up letting three souls have a second chance at life. One flash of green light the colour of death. Three souls return to the Living. History is rewritten. And Fate laughs.Or...The one story where Gellert Grindelwald takes a leaf out of Gru's book and adopts a kid despite being a former Dark Lord with no parenting skills whatsoever... And of course the kid is none other than Hadria Potter, who unintentionally drives him up the wall for all of three years. (After those three years, a number of people are driven up the wall, including Gellert, and it's totally intentional by now).
