** There's a really terrible Harry/Fleur fic that was written like 15 years ago that had a really interesting take on Phoenixes (Harry Potter and Broken Wands). New phoenix aren't "born", they are "forged" from the feather of another phoenix (freely given) who has wet the feather with a single tear. They feather is then "enflamed" with fire magic. If the feather catches fire, then a phoenix is forged, if not, then the person was not worthy or powerful enough and the feather's power is lost.

**** I finished it, but it is really bad. It's in the running for the most poorly written story I've ever finished. The author named the phoenix after himself, so that should also be an indicator of the quality.

** There was one fic wherein phoenixes happen when one's familiar is an owl, said owl is burned to ashes by a dark fire curse, and the bonded witch or wizard then cries into the ashes of their friend.

Guess what happens to who.

** My headcanon holds that the "gods" of Ancient Times were just really powerful wizards who abused Muggles' trust to get power. Thus, your whole "Prometheus" idea makes no sense in my headcanon --- though on its own it's a nice idea.

In general I just assume they're a bird species like any other, except very magical and unusually intelligent, and they come out of eggs, plain and simple. However, owing to Phoenixes' immortality, it's not ingrained in their brain to reproduce (we're lucky it's not, because otherwise we'd be flooded with an exponentially growing population of Phoenixes). Only when two Phoenixes of opposite gender happen to meet and find each other perfect soul mates, then, after decades of courting, they might finally get together and produce one single Phoenix egg at a time (most phoenix couple would only ever lay one, at least in recorded history; perhaps it's one a millenium). Because of this rarity, Phoenix eggs are insanely valuable.

If it's about their origins... I'm sorry this doesn't sound nearly as poetic as the "divine" interpretation (or them having come out of the Mirror of Erised according to /HPMOR/), but my theory is that, like most other magical species, they came into existence when a random mutation in a bird species allowed them some measure of control over magic, mostly fire-related, with natural selection doing the rest. Their increased intelligence is something we've also seen in Post Owls, and even the Ford Anglia; I'm thinking some measure of intelligence is a recurring consequence of constant exposure to magic in animals.

My headcanon for how the New-Zealand Quittich team came to own a Phoenix as a mascot is that they found an abandoned Phoenix egg. They /were/ just going to bring it back to town and sell it for a ridiculous price, but it hatched on the way and the hatchling imprinted on them; being nice folks all around, the team decided to keep him.

** Phoenixes like Dragons and Griffins and all the other Magical Creatures probably came into existence as Humans did. So depending on your interpretation, the Magical Creatures were born over time through evolution, etc... (which isn't really canonical when you think about the fact that some of them are Amortal like Poltergeists and Dementors) or most of them existed before Humans and just cross-pollinated, so we can't really be sure. I'll just go with the whole 'a Magician never reveals his secrets' route and tell you that it doesn't really matter.
