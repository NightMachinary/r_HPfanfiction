Looking for a fic where Harry becomes pregnant with Voldemorts child. I believe this occured due to several spells hitting him at the same time.

When the order found out they attempted to terminate the child but Harry's magic protected him. This led to him escaping to Voldemort.

** It was actually a very sweet fic. Voldemort was very kind to Harry. One scene had the Deatheaters buying baby clothes for the child. One of the deatheaters referred to Harry as little Lord.

I would really appreciate if someone could help me find the fic I have been looking for it for awhile.

**** Nope and it surprisingly turned out good. I initially was somewhat wary but my curiosity got a hold of me. There was no creepy birthing scene. Voldemorts aims turned out differently from book. But Im not going into detail.

Voldemort became very caring of Harry after the inital confusion.

My advise dont judge a book by its cover. I wasnt sure about in the beginning but I loved it

Read a chapter or two. Just to get a sense. You might find yourself surprised like I was.

That being said I do urge caution when you read online. I have come across stories that gave me several red flags that I in my idiocy decided to ignore. Those instances have sickened me to my core. Obviously certain instances happened early on in the reading.
