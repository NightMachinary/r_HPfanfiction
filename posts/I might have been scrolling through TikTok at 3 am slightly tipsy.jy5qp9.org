“Hey-um Harry?” Harry turned to his friend Ron, a lanky ginger who ate his weight in food for every meal 3 times a day (usually more), “There is another one.” Harry sighed; he was starting to get sick of these random teenagers claiming they knew him from another world. “I thought that the ginger that looked like you were the last one?” Harry could not remember his name for the life of him. “Rupert, Harry, his name is Rupert” Harry startled as Hermione came out of nowhere behind him.

“Anyway, they're up in Dumbledores office again” Harry huffed. He hated meeting these random people who claimed they were from some random universe where his life is written in a bunch of books. Who came into an alternate life to spoil someone else's story! Those self-proclaimed ‘Potterhead's' sure did. How did they even get here, if magic is a myth in their world as they insist then they should not be able to get here. Then when he gets annoyed, they have the audacity to tell me that he is a ‘smart, cold, Slytherin' ‘trope' whatever that means. Harry realises that before he knew it he was in front of the gargoyle that lead to Headmaster Dumbledores office. The gargoyle -somehow used to this- instantly moves to the side. He shuffles up the stair exasperated, as he begins to open the door, he sees a woman who looked to be in her early 20's become giddy.

“You're Harry Potter, holy shit I didn't actually think that shifting would work” Harry huffed. Shifting, the cause of all his problems, he prepared himself to repeat the same lines Hermione wrote down for him with the help of her uncle who was a lawyer in the know about magic, and Harrys situation. “Hello, yes I am Harry Potter. Yes, it is very nice to meet you. Please stop shifting into this world, I have work to do. Just because this is an alternate world, does not mean we have alternate morals. The laws are similar. It is illegal to harass a minor. No, I have not fought Voldemort, No I have not found the philosophers stone. You will have to go through the law to make sure you are silent about the location. No Professor Quirrell is no longer part of the staff here at Hogwarts. No Dumbledore isn't manipulating me and my family's fortunes. No, I do not want to go to your world. No, I will not marry Draco Malfoy. No, I do not know what ‘smut' is. Please remember that it is illegal to harass a minor and remember that I am 11, not an all-powerful being. Thank you for coming.”
