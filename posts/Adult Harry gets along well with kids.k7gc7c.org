Maybe he opens or supports an orphanage, maybe he's a healer for kids, a tutor, maybe he works as something with kids etc.

Maybe his home life, he's a good family man to his kids and nieces/nephews etc.

Anyone can be the main character, can be on any site, any length, old or new.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame and fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion.

If any pairings am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes etc.


** Well, he's a very devoted single father in linkffn(Grow Young With Me). The summary makes it sound like a soap opera, but it isn't at all; it's funny, heartwarming, and on occasion devastating.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

** Blackboards and Broomsticks: Harry becomes DADA professor. He's quite invested in the well-being of the kids at Hogwarts (and his own young children). Canon compliant up to the epilogue, Harry is married to Ginny.

Put Your Guns Away, It's Tea Time: Harry is a proud dad, and a good one. Or, at least, he's trying to be the latter. Cursed Child compliant, part 1 of many.

  At twenty-five, Harry Potter is at a crossroads in his life. He's achieved his dream of being an Auror, but it's not all it's cracked up to be, and with one child and another on the way, he's missing out on precious time with his family. But being an Auror is all he knows how to do - right? So he's in for a surprise when Professor McGonagall, Headmistress of Hogwarts, offers him a job as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher ...

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.
