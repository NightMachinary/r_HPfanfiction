I'm looking for a good fic where Hermione isn't the brains behind the brawn, but the big bad herself. Must be complete, over 40k words. I'd prefer something like after the final battle (or after they lose lol), a war hardened Hermione goes back in time to maybe the Marauders era. Something where this petite bushy haired mudblood can just wipe the floor with the death eaters (or whoever pisses her off). Must be at least decently written, but I don't mind if it's tropey. I've read Pride of Time and a few of the more popular (sorry, on mobile, so I don't have links), but it's not my normal genre, so I haven't read many. Romance is appreciated but not required. Pairings don't matter. Thanks in advance!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9561455/1/Spectrum][Spectrum]], linkffn(9561455), is exactly what you want, but unfortunately it's only an one-shot.

I have yet to find a single, novel-length fic in which Hermione traveled back to Tom's era, but instead of shagging him, killed the fuck out of Tom Riddle and those 'Old Purebloods'.

** Well, I have a strong Hermione in all my stories, but the one story that would fit your request best (I have no time travel at all) is just 30K words.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

  In her sixth year, Dumbledore makes Hermione a key figure in a plan to help Harry defeat Voldemort. (It's difficult to summarize this without spoilers--- HG/SS; there's a Time Turner involved but probably not how you expect; the story really gets started in Chapter Three.)

***** For the record, this fic was originally posted on GrangerEnchanted, which went down several years after the last update of this fic. From this, I am inferring that since the author didn't take the fic down in the intervening years, she did not intend for it to no longer be available.
