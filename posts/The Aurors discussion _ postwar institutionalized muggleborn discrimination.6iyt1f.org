SPOILERS IN THIS POST (is there no spoiler tag??)

. . . . . . . . . . . .

I just read The Aurors and loved it, I think it has the best analysis of the situation of institutionalized muggleborn discrimination in postwar magical England of any fic I've read. At first I thought it was going to be pro-cop bc Harry's an auror but then I was like ...Hmm

SPOILER

[The story ended, not necessarily unsatisfyingly, but disappointingly realistic in how Harry kind of dismissed Dennis's well-argued for goals by saying "I don't agree with your tactics, and I'm not gonna think too hard about the goal because your tactics already put you on the moral lower ground."

Kind of parallel to BLM-critics who refuse to think about cop violence BLM is fighting by saying "I don't agree with them blocking highways because they could stop an ambulance."

Dennis's point is that muggle discrimination is so entrenched in the system that you're never going to be able to fix it from within. It seems like he's promoting separatism as well as a kind of Haiti Revolution modeled thing, kill all the racists, even those that contributed to the violence passively instead of actively. Or those who had the privilege to choose to enact violence on others to save themselves from violence.

This isn't a criticism of how FloreatCastellum wrote the story, I think it's realistic the way it ends.](/spoiler)

Sorry it's all spoilered. Anyone else have any reactions or thoughts on the tactics of these two characters?


** The War was won by ideologically progressive purebloods who dominated the DA and the Order. While not bad, these guys still harbored lots of prejudices and a sense of superiority. Harry and Hermione were basically absorbed into that group and adopted their way of thinking.

Therefore, reading fics such [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]] is significantly more satisfying for me.

*** Yes. I like this one because I think it acknowledges that but also is less idealistic that Harry as a privileged member of society will notice that.

** I would have thought that the Aurors would have been able to use some way to force the truth out of an arrested kidnapper, especially if lives were on the line. If Veritaserum is not acceptable, then what about the Imperius? Aurors were authorised to use them in the war; I could see getting authorisation in such a case as well. Or if that's not allowed, Hermione could have rearranged his memories, make him think he wanted to confess everything. Or someone could have ripped through his mind with legilimency - he didn't seem too stable to me, and some verbal prompting would likely have made him think of his victims.

That aside, I don't think Harry did dismiss his concerns - at the time he was listening, he realised that he was talking to a madman, not even an extremist, and was still emotionally compromised by what he had gone through. The motivation might have been sound, but the means were crazy. Sometime later I think he would not really dismiss the very cause his parents and so many of his friends died for just because of one madman.

*** I think they are physically capable but I remember them mentioning that legislation was pushed through to prevent interrogation by veritiserum, which probably means imperius, legimency etc. and the ability to hold without bail or charges were included. To move away from being a police state. Idk how I feel about that I don't really see what's wrong with veritiserum besides like a right to privacy or something.
