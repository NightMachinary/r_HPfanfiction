:END:
Hey there. So I'm searching for 2 very different works.

​

1st) I only remember that Harry, together with some girls/boys rush to the SLytherin Common Room where he duels the entire Slytherin house... don't remember any more...

​

2nd) I remember Harry fighting with Tom in the Atrium of the ministry and winning (killing him with a knife). Then Dumbles gets there, is unhappy that Harry won, and plots with Fudge to send him to Azkaban.

​

Thx.


** The first one kinda sounds like Rise of a Dark Lord. Linkffn(8195669) In chapter 5 he “fights” with a bunch of guys in the Slytherin common room, and fucking destroys them.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.
