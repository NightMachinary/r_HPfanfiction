I think I've read pretty much everything under the sun at this point but I'm hoping you folks will provide me with some hidden gem.

I'll start us off with my absolute favorite HP fanfic: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life]]


** It's a dystopia, but my linkffn(The Firebird's Son) and it's sequels are a pretty hefty AU that has scenes In Europe and America with lots of world-building. I'm Pretty proud of it but I know opinions vary. Some love it, some loathe it.

*** Oooh I did read this a while ago. It was one of the best AU fanfics. Personally I felt like it dragged on at times so it felt like a chore to read, but is no doubt one of the best fleshed out worlds in a political/societal way. The matriarchy was definitely a unique and very interesting take and was explored well.

Gotta say, great work!!!

I would like to ask tho, how we're you able to out such extensive work into this fic? From what I remember it was huuuge. And this was professional quality, not just some randome "doodles" put together. How we're u able to stay motivated and dedicate so much time to this? .

** Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) has a massive amount of world building. It's mostly Britain, but some time is spent discussing other societies.
