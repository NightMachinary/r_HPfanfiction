It can be your own ideas or ones you've seen in other meta, headcanon, and fic. Mine for example is all wizards are a result of a human x some magical creature. Magic stays in bloodlines tho it skips generations occasionally and may disappear and reappear. And may disappear for several generations if those generations arent often exposed to magic. Which is what happens with squibs and muggle borns.


** It's not my favourite, but I usually enjoy a good 'The Goblins are psychopaths'. And I mean literal, 'diagnosable' psychopaths, not the usual colloquial usage. They're narcissistic, Machiavellian, no sense of empathy, lacking emotions and emotional understanding, etc.

** The floo system was invented by Santa Claus who used a time turner to deliver his gifts. When he retired after a couple hundred years of work he turned over the floo network to the ministry and his team of elves to the newly founded Hogwarts

** There were two Merlins, Merlin the Greater (King Arthur's court wizard, lived in the 5th and 6th centuries) and Merlin the Lesser (Attended Hogwarts, was a Slytherin, died shortly before Geoffrey of Monmouth first penned The History Of The Kings Of Britain)

Both were the magical titans of their respective eras and slowly became interchangeable in most people's minds as their exploits became mythologised.

It's a handy explanation for why Merlin supposedly attended Hogwarts despite predating it by about half a millennium.

** Vampires are not villified the way werewolves are in HP, evidenced in the Slug club and blood lollipops. I headcanon a well reputable bar off of Diagon Alley where vampires can order drinks.

Options include differing blood types and muggle vs squib vs magical, specialty drinks such as fattier ones from humans with high cholesterol, exotic ones from humans with various blood conditions, etc. Magical blood donors are kept anonymous by the owner and paid for their donation, which, is allowed two to three times a week as long as at least a day has passed since the donors last dose of blood replenishing potion. Muggle "donations" are taken from muggle blood banks.

Certain donors are pub favorites and become popular "vintages." There is a strict code of honor among the regulars which includes restricting themselves to donations and most definitely not killing anyone. Someone once tracked down a popular donor because they wanted to have their favorite from the source. The others killed them for their offence.

** That the Unspeakables are more than just a research division of the ministry, and act in secret to deal with dangerous magical phenomena and items. Because of this, certain members are highly trained for Magical combat with a 'take no prisoners, leave no witnesses' view on things and they consider the day-to-day dealings of the ministry, and magical Britain as a whole, as none of their business.

*** EVERY GODDAMN TIME I bring up the fact that Dumbledore is stupid for not just asking the Unspeakables for help or knowledge about the Horcrux in Harry's scar, they moan, whine, and complain about how they only do "love, time and prophecy". Which is so asinine it equals the incompetence of Fudge AND Lockhart put together.

Why would the Ministry (especially Fudge) allow the budget for a department that only studies time, love, and prophecies? That's a money sink with no conceivable benefit for society.

**** A simpler explanation would be that Dumbledore plain doesn't trust the Unspeakables. We know that Death Eaters that walked free often ended up getting jobs at the Ministry, so there's nothing to say that Death Eater influence couldn't have spread with the Unspeakables.

Or maybe the Unspeakables are all just a bunch of immoral mad scientists whose reaction to learning "I fear Harry Potter has a Horcrux on his forehead" would be "Cool! Bring him here, we'll cut his head off so we can perform the proper tests. You didn't need him for anything, right?"

***** Eh, I'm of the opinion that he believed he was infallible and his way was the only way.

To be brutally honest, murdering Harry would have been kinder than all the crap he had to go through with the Dursleys, Hogwarts, the Camping Trip, and the Final Battle.

And if you bank on the prophecy, that means that nobody BUT Voldemort could kill Harry, so it couldn't happen. Speaking of that, Dumbledore could lead on with that "Hey, you have a prophecy about killing Voldemort down there, but the person who has to do it has a horcrux stuck in him. Can you help a brotha out?" And then he banks on Harry's prophecy induced immortality or them actually helping.

******* I didn't mean that. I meant between him being killed because he's a horcrux (thus allowing a speedier resolution of everything with as little death as possible) OR 16 years of being abused at the Dursleys, being treated like shit in the newspaper, almost dying every year you are in the allegedly safest place in britain, bullied by your peers at school, your teacher (thus allowing a Pyrrhic Victory and a lifetime of guilt).

I'm not talking right or wrong. What would you pick as a "Leader of the Light"?

Now let's murky the waters even further. What if the first chance didn't have a 100% chance that Harry dies? The Unspeakables /could/ have a solution to the problem. We are now looking at a /possibility/ Harry could die vs a definite Pyrrhic Victory.

This now becomes a Trolley Dilemma.

******** First of all, "Leader of the Light" isn't a thing, because there isn't a "Light" in HP. People talk about the "Dark Arts" or "going Dark" on occasion, but in this instace "Dark" is somewhat of a blanket term for magic, creatures and people who are dangerous harmful and/or evil. There isn't, and doesn't need to be, a corresponding "Light," much less a "Leader" of it. Dumbledore has a pretty high status and several important and influental positions in wizarding society, but he doesn't LEAD it... and even the position he does have is surprisingly weak and fragile. We see several times in the series just how easy it is for outside forces to undermine him or even temporarily remove him.

"Leader of the Light" is a term that fandom made up, and it's not a term I like because it's always used as a way to bash Dumbledore... and character bashing is something I detest.

Second of all, this really isn't a trolley dilemma at all. You don't go for the solution that's LEAST likely to succeed, especially not when that solution includes (possible) child murder and the other one doesn't. And the "16 years of being abused at the Dursleys, being treated like shit in the newspaper, almost dying every year you are in the allegedly safest place in britain, bullied by your peers at school, your teacher (thus allowing a Pyrrhic Victory and a lifetime of guilt)" was not something Dumbledore could have predicted at the time, certainly not something he would have KNOWN would have happen. Again, it's NOT kinder to kill a baby because you think he MIGHT have a sucky life. It just isn't.

Yes, yes, everybody obsesses over his "dark and difficult years" line, but Dumbledore isn't omnipotent. He was going for the solution he thought had the best chance of leading to a happy ending. He knew Harry was marked for death because of the Horcrux. He tried a desperate gamble to arrange things so that Harry might not have to die after all. You might say he went about it in a stupid way, or that YOU would have handled the situation better... maybe you would. But I think you're seeing a moral dilemma that really isn't there.

** Slytherins Basilisk was never supposed to leave the pipes of the school. It was created as a defense system for the school in case of invasion. Its piping system was designed with enchanted one way windows into the halls so the basilisk could incapacitate invaders without risking death to students potentially caught in its gaze. Salazar Slytherin didn't hold to blood purity, he was just a paranoid man convinced that muggleborn students would turn on the magical world because of Christianity and would inevitably lead a horde of angry muggles to Hogwarts seeking to cleanse the world of Witches. His son was the racist bigoted Slytherin and most tales of Slytherin are based off of him, the father and son becoming merged in stories over the course of history. He was driven out of the castle by his father and Godric when he tried to turn the Basilisk on the students.

The basilisk remembers its purposes and fought against Tom and DiaryTom when ordered to kill. It intentionally petrified students rather than killing them as ordered, even then it was only driven to do Tom's bidding through magically enhanced starvation. The only time it killed a student was Myrtle, which was an accident.

** Grindelwald, and later Voldemort, targeted magical infrastructure around the world, setting back knowledge and research by 100 years each.

Imagine destroying all semiconductor manufacturing plants and assassinating all scientists with silicon knowledge. There would still be computers, but not necessarily the industry or knowledge to make new ones.

Take out engine manufacturing as well, and now cars exist, but their secrets need to be rediscovered.

Harry Potter takes place in a magic apocalypse, a dark age. Power and knowledge increased from the time of the Founders, but it was passed along guarded master-apprentice lines. To consolidate power, Grindelwald launched a global campaign to recruit or destroy masters and apprentices of all magical industries. The magical world had just begun to rebuild when Voldemort--being just a step fresher than the new, magically crippled, generation, is nearly the peak of pre-dark-ages magic--does a repeat performance.

Spells that are known are learned as a matter of technique -- "Swish, flick, say OOOH-sa, not ooSAH", rather than derived arithmantically. Just as you may learn to drive a car, and a car is powerful, even if another car will not be produced for 40 years.

School is mostly an exercise in learning techniques anyway, so the school system has endured. But adults are essentially older, working children, in terms of magic.

The world is filled with powerful, unreproducible magical artifacts.

Dumbledore is himself a relic of that bygone age. He is doing his best to perform original research, keep society together, defend against the resurfacing of Voldemort, and find more geniuses to help rebuild magic. Even if some of those geniuses are Evil.

** I enjoy these, I have so many but no ability to weave a narrative around them.

The reason that there is no continuity in naming conventions for spells, eg curses jinxes etc, is that there are actually three different naming conventions used. The first is the oldest and in some ways the most correct with different spells categorized by what they targeted and the effect they have.

Eg, jinxes target the relationship between a person and something else, like a tool that they are jinxed to not be able to keep track of or a broom that then tries to buck them off. These old jinxes are related to the concept of the "witches evil eye" and require eye contact to establish, refresh, or maintain. There is no beam of light or any visible sign from a wand when cast.

The second is an attempt by some magical theorists and arithmancers to categorize spells by the magical principles of syllable count, wand movements, etc. In this sense charms are related to the numbers 3 and 6, while hexes are related to the number four. This system didn't work really well as there is too much overlap between different spells, but it was used enough by some spell creators that there are many spells in circulation that are named accordingly.

The third is based on how the spell feels and sounds. Jinxes are minor annoyances, hexes moderate attacks, curses violent and offensive magic, charms things that are nice or positive etc. A spells are called by these names based on how they are perceived by the general populus and nothing else.

**** I'd like to think that the Killing Curse is actually an old style Jinx in this way. The whole point of the Killing Curse is that it is unblockable. Which I don't think fits well with a beam of light or a star wars laser blast that can be ducked under, dodged, or blocked with a piece of rock levitated into its path. It works best as an instantaneous spell that automatically affects its target. It doesnt fit with Rowlings Deus Ex Machinas in the graveyard and final battle, but fits better with the description of it.

** The wand and incantation method of magic was invented by the Roman's. The only places that use it as their primary magical method are countries that spent centuries under Roman control. Other countries that use wand magic do so as a result of colonization efforts of those countries and don't use it to the same level, such as Native Americans, Africans, Japanese etc who use both wand magic and heritage magic.

** Salazar Slytherin was a good dude who's family was killed by muggles for being magical. His reasons for founding the school is a safe place away from muggles for magicals to learn how to stay safe after they leave. He doesn't like muggle raised and the argument that split them up was that he wamted to take magical children away as soon as they had confirmed magical talents. He wanted to adopt them to magical families and to completely seperate from muggles.
