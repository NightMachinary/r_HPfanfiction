Can the killing curse be blocked when it collides with another spell?

During Dumbledore's duel with Voldemort, he blocked the killing curse with a red spell. In the movies.

And also Author weasley also blocked another green spell during the Battle of Hogwarts.


** In the books, it's unblockable with magic.

The HP films are not great when it comes to the magic system.

*** But i think thats with magic shields, not other spells. Think of it like an AP round vs a riot shield, it punches straight through. But that same Ap round vs another Ap round in a head on collision, they stop each other
