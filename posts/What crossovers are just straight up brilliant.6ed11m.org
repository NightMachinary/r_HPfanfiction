I've read several crossovers and most tend to fall flat getting lost in following the script of the movie or tv show, or follow the cliche of bringing everyone from one random to Hogwarts - what are some crossovers that make you long for more?


** linkffn(Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger) and linkffn(Cursebreaking Hamunaptra by Zenzao) are my two absolute favorite crossovers.

***** Not really. Currently (ch 23) is just barely reaching The Hobbit time. So far the only real knowledge you need (as far as I can recall) are that LotR Wizards are roughly equivalent to Angels, Morgoth is Satan/the devil (making Sauron more Beelzebub/Mephistopheles than Lucifer). And everyone talks... strange. Not "ye olde englesh", but not modern either.

"Such a journey is no hardship for an elf, as you well know... ...All who joined me knew the destination, and came even so. None will now turn aside."

Like that. If all of the above is acceptable, then enjoy.

** linkffn(Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon) is a great crossover. It plays both after the events of the series "Firefly" (that I never watched, but that isn't a problem) and after Hogwarts - so it doesn't follow any script.

True to nonjon, it actually has stuff happening, and Harry is less of an asshole than in the other stories of nonjon. There are plenty of laughs, plenty of suspenseful scenes, and even if Harry is pretty powerful the other characters are important, and Harry wouldn't have solved his problems alone.

The crossover between the two series is masterfully done, he merges the plot of both stories somewhat. Magic is 'realistic' and yet mysterious. I liked it, and was sad when it was over.

** linkffn(7156582)

An excellent, creepy story that unleashes The Weeping Angels from /Doctor Who/ on Hogwarts.

linkffn(4922483)

Basically inserts Harry into the background of /Doctor Who/ episodes as he meets most incarnations of The Doctor and his companions including the classic ones with brilliant characterization. The author clearly knows what they're talking about when it comes to /Doctor Who/ canon and also manages to shape Harry's early years as though he was influenced by both The Doctor and The Master. It also starts off with the endgame of /Harry Potter/ canon in mind, before things quickly become AU.

linkffn(2104141)

Out of desperation, Dumbledore turns to Darth Vader for his new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, and it actually, surprisingly really pays off in a brilliant way.

**** I don't know much of anything about Star Wars, so I didn't get much out of it; it definitely feels like the author wanted to make a Star Wars story that happened to include HP flavor. Besides Harry himself, all the HP-side characters feel like bad caricatures. The author doesn't put much research in the HP side either and is clearly unfamiliar with it. Aloholomora is not the incantation for the Unlocking Charm and Dumbledore almost certainly isn't going to spend five hundred thousand galleons on hiring a hitman. (Also, what the fuck.)

Furthermore, having the big bads of both sides of the crossover team up without considering that they have conflicting interests and (in the case of Voldemort) not that much to make an alliance desirable in the first place demonstrates that the plot hasn't been thought through that well. Witness the Emperor throwing Darth Vader away because "there are always two" one chapter before deciding that apprenticing Draco Malfoy is fine because the Rule of Two isn't really that important now that "the Sith and the Empire have won completely now that Magical Britain is conquered". (Which they decidedly would not have if the story was plotted out by an author that was half-competent. Magical Britain, as depicted in the story, should be a footnote at best in the Empire's plans.)

***** I'll admit that I'm not super picky about people being out of character or continuity errors as long as the overall story is entertaining. So of course canon Dumbledore wouldn't hire a hitman. Is it fun to read? Yeah it was. If I was looking for strict canon-compliance, well-written characters and a really good plot, I wouldn't choose the fanfiction where Darth Vader is the new DADA teacher. Considering the premise, this one was pretty well done.

***** Some of your criticism is warranted, but I feel you're being too harsh. It could have been better explained, but a Voldemort/Palpatine alliance /is/ somewhat believable. And Magical Britain would not be "a footnote", at least in Palpatine's opinion, because /they're a whole community with thousands of Force-users/ when they've exterminated or corrupted the otherwise extremely rare Force users in the known Galaxy.

****** Every story could be better written if it were better written, yes. There absolutely are ways you could write a realistic and interesting Voldemort/Palpatine team-up. The fact that a hypothetical story that was not actually written could have made a believable alliance is no defense for a story that did not do such a thing.

The author could, for instance, show Palpatine learning about the community of force-users and seeing that they would be helpful. Show Palpatine concluding Voldemort would likely triumph over the Ministry and would be a better group to support. Show cultural clashes between the two groups, like how the rank-and-file Death Eaters feel about working with a numerically much larger group that depends heavily on Muggle forces. Show Voldemort and Palpatine's goals getting in each others' way, like how Palpatine probably wouldn't be interested in alienating Muggleborn magicals he could have recruited.

And, above all, the author could have elected /not/ to show Palpatine going in person to this rinky-dink world in the middle of nowhere because he was quite rudely summoned by someone he has no reason to meet, then liking this extremely impertinent person enough to depose Darth Vader as apprentice in favor of him and forming an alliance in the course of a single meeting.

** I'm having a hard time linking to it, but *The Black Prince by cxjenious*. It's a crossover with A Song of Ice and Fire. It posits Harry as a middle and legitimate son of Robert Baratheon. It's definitely more of a crossover with the books than the show, and the author is pretty good at mimicking Martin's style. He does an excellent job at showing what it would be like to be skilled with magic in a world like Westeros. If I have a complaint, it's only that, in spite of the fact that we've met many interesting people from the series, like marwyn the mage or Margaery Tyrell, we're still in prequel mode, so to speak. EG it's been 20 odd chapters and we still haven't met any Starks, and Jon Arryn is still alive.

*** Erm, sorry to burst your bubble, especially since you are allowed to recommend whatever you like, but Fate's Gamble isn't really brilliant: the characters in it are known to act out of character, some things simply don't make sense no matter how you look at it, and it just stinks of wish fulfilment of the bad kind.

I will not say that it can't be enjoyable, because I have no doubt that a lot of people enjoy this kind of thing, but brilliant, no, it isn't.

***** While I won't disagree with that---all things considered it's a good enough reason---I just think you shouldn't put special emphasis on them when recommending it in a thread asking for “brilliant” if you know that they are subpar. It's going to make people some people biased against you for not knowing stuff and discarding your recommendations just because it was you who made them; a lesson for the future, I suppose (and yes, I've seen it happen).

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  Just as he finishes one war to save his world, Harry is literally pulled into another. The trials of living in Zuellni aren't as bad as back in England, but the Contaminoid threat will rear its ugly head. Harry has to fight to protect what he holds dear, but that is nothing new. A certain silver-haired manipulator just has to be put in his place first.

**** I honestly think he might be the edgiest edgelord Potter I've ever seen, and considering some of the horrendous characterisations I've seen, that's saying something. Also the Dursleys/Dumbledore/Generic-antagonist-here are all over-the-top cardboard cut outs. That said, it's entertaining enough for total schlock.

** linkffn(The Stag and the Dragon) is an absolute favourite. It seamlessly blends the universes of /Star Wars/ and HP in a suprisingly believable way. It goes from the cracky premise that since "anyone would be better than Umbridge", Dumbledore literally hires Darth Vader as DADA teacher. However, the story takes itself seriously from there and the worldbuilding is simply /great/. It's complete and not too long, and just about the only "flaw" I can find is that due to its pre-DHness, the story ignores Horcruxes and has Voldemort die from a normal fatal wound.
