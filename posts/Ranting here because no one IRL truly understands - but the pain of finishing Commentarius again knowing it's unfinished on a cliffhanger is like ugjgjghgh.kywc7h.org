** I am incredibly selective about even looking at a WIP. 99% of my trust issues are from dusty author's notes saying, /This is not abandoned! It's on a hiatus 2009/09/09/ and /Don't worry! I'm still here and will publish an update soon! 2015/11/1/

*** Sigh, yes :(

She does at least still post regularly and answer questions about the fic.

But really, why do I do this to myself?

*** It very possibly is, but it's definitely not finished there.

The author still actually updates her blog regularly, and posts other fic, but just nothing for this story in 7-8 years. She's posted as recently as yesterday, and still has a section about it not being finished.

*** Sure! It may not be for everyone (though still, 7 years after last update, has a huge following) - the writing style can be a bit more immature as it's written as journal entries from Lily. I originally read it a while back, and I still love it, but definitely got the Teen YA novel vibe more now. The author does have a blog that she updates and has some experts from the next chapter, though still no actual update...

** The author is in the process of polishing the existing chapters. They're being updated on ao3, but not ffn, so I'd subscribe to it there. I read that a couple months ago on their very active tumblr @bcdaily. Linkao3(Commentarius by BeeDaily)

*** Thanks! Yes, I saw that on their tumbler too. The ao3 as far as I can see ends at the same place as ffn, and not updated since 2013 for either. On her blog, her updates about next chapter pertain to where I left off in the story, so I think I'm up to date. It's just been in the works since 2013 to finish polishing. She does post the occasional snippet (though none since 2018 now I think?), so clearly has the chapter written at least in part.

Will keep checking in on her blog!

**** Yeah, it's a bummer that it's not finished. People have asked if they can finish it, but she politely said not to because it's her baby and she knows where it's going. I hope she gets around to it someday! I read it in 2013 and haven't since. If she updates again I'll go for it.

***** I can understanding as the author not wanting someone else to finish, though as a reader a feel a bit differently. I just reread it and forgot how much I liked it, and what a cliffhanger it ends on. Ah, well.

Thanks for the commiseration!

  The always ordinary Lily Evans enters her 7th-Year with a whole slew of unordinary changes. And with everything changing, Lily fears she may be going a bit mad. Suddenly, she's Head Girl, her friends are acting strangely, and there's a new James Potter she just can't seem to get rid of. [Pre-OotP]
