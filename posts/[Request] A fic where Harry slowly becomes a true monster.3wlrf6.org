I'm new to this, as this is my first request, but I'm looking for a fic where Harry becomes a complete and utter monster slowly. So many fics always talk about how he is destined to be great, either for good or evil, but whenever it is evil he always seems so... Disappointing. I don't really care much if he has other powers, or even is someone's elses son or something, I just want a fic where he isn't necessarily the better man. I don't know if it's just that I have bad luck or something, but I have never seen a truly evil Harry portrayed well. Every single time he ends up having so small a temper he goes completely insane with rage, or something else similar and it just gets boring after a while.

  The Hallows were not an ending. Harry returns to the Forbidden Forest after the Battle and finds the Stone -- the start of his salvation and the path to his damnation.

**** I just read this and can honestly say I really enjoyed it. Although I didn't specify, as it didn't occur to me, that I'm hoping for full length stories over one shots, I'm glad I forgot too as that was rather interesting.

** linkffn(Too Young to Die) is pretty much the perfect example of what you're looking for. He starts off with a noble goal and does some really really terrible things on the way to it. Just a warning, it's got some rapey themes in a couple of parts.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

***** Have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7240213/1/Absolute][Absolute]]? It's a oneshot about Harry finding a death note. It's similar to what you're asking for I think.

Edit: There's also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]] where the main character is an immortal genocidal warlord. It's a bit cracky though (in a pretty psychopathic way), so I'm not totally sure it's what you're looking for.

****** I have read both and yes stories like Absolute are what I was looking for, although I would like to see them as full length stories rather than one shots. The Nightmare Man was also good, but as you said, a bit cracks so not completely what I'm looking for haha.

** Since you've already read the two that I would suggest, maybe try linkffn(10182397)? Harry's pretty fucked up, and there's a prequel being written to show how he got there (it's not really explained in the story itself).

Edit: ah, shit, you've read that one, too. Well, I'm out then!
