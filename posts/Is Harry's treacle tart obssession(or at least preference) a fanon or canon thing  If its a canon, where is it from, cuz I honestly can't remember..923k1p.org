** ‚Äú A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tart, chocolate eclairs and jam donuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . . ... Harry helped himself to a treacle tart‚Äù (PS 125)

All the desserts in the world and this 11-year old who was rarely offered sweets reaches for the treacle tart.

****** No, but jelly fits pretty well for US on that charm anyway. Jell-o is just the gelatin flavored desserts, hence its substitution in the list for the US, but Jelly is jam without the fruit chunks in it. Not usually a dessert.

******* Well, the point is that jelly (US jell-o) wobbles, so it indicates that the spell makes your legs wobble.

Whereas jam (US jelly) doesn't wobble. It... goops.
