What the title says, how would the story change is Harry Potter was blood-adopted by the Zabinis. In other words, I want to know what would happen at Hogwarts. Will Harry and Voldemort still be enemies? Would he be Draco's friend? What about his relationship with Blaise? Who will he date? How would the wizarding world react when they hear Harry is a Zabini? Will his values be the same as in canon? etc.
