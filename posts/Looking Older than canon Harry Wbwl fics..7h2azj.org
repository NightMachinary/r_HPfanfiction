** My favourite is linkffn(Deprived). The summary is kinda stupid but it's honestly super well written and Harry's powers are super cool.

  No one knows what went wrong with Hadrian James Potter-Black. Certainly not Heath Potter, the boy-who-lived. How could his own brother be a Slytherin? Be so Dark? Granted, Heath rarely interacted with Hadrian. But it's bad enough that he's fated to defeat the most powerful Dark Lord in centuries. But is fate really so cruel that he has to also fight against his own brother?

** linkffn(7017751)

linkffn(6864381)

linkffn(5142565) Non-WBL but older than the WBWL. Highly recommend.

linkffn(5403222) Not the best story, but it fits the criteria.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.
