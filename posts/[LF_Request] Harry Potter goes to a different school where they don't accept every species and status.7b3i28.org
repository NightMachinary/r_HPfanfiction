It seems that every Harry Potter fic where Harry goes to a alternate school allows for all creatures and people alike. Anyone find a fic that doesn't do this?


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the boy who lived by santi), where Harry goes to Durmstrang.

Very enjoyable fic.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  The events at the end of the Triwizard Tournament have left Harry feeling just a little bit paranoid.
