#+begin_example
   I'm using an alt for this, but I'm looking for a very odd fic. The fic began with Harry at the Dursely's in the summer after fourth year where he's kidnapped by snape/rescued by Snape and forced to disguise himself on the way to snapes home, this involved crossdressing. Snape forces Harry to call him uncle and grooms Harry into a sex slave/lover/wife. I remember a bath scene with buttplugs (?) and also a scene where they go clothes shopping?
#+end_example


** Why the fuck

A) is all the text on a single line

and

B) does the text have a goddamn scrollbar?

Three '-' for linebreak. Start line with '-' to bullet point. Number to list.

  Press enter twice for a new paragraph

************ It's cause you put a bunch of spaces at the start, I guess to indent it

#+begin_example
   This is what it looks like when you put 5 spaces in front of a paragraph. It's meant for like code or whatever
