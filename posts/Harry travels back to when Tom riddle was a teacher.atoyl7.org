Hey, I read this fic years ago and now can't find it anywhere and can't remember the name.

It had harry time travelling to when Tom riddle was teaching at Hogwarts and them falling in love. They then both traveled back to the present and the map recognised him as Tom riddle not Voldemort as he no longer wanted to be evil. They then defeated the voldemort/older self somehow but I can't remember exactly how.

Would be so grateful if anyone remembers this :)

  After Dumbledore's death, Harry searches for answers in the Pensieve. But something goes wrong. Trapped inside a memory, Harry finds himself at Hogwarts in 1945 where an 18 year old Tom Riddle is teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts. SLASH. Complete.
