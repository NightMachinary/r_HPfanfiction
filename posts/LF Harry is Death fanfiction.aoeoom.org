I remember reading this fix a few years ago and went looking for it again but couldn't remember the name. It took place in 5th year I think where Harry somehow becomes Master of Death and summons Death which eventually turns out to be an ancient kinda unhinged version of himself. Would love some help finding this thing, it's driving me crazy!

Would also be interested in any other MoD!Harry fics if you'd like to recommend them!


** I'm fairly certain that you're talking about Linkffn(On a Pale Horse by Hyliian), but the details don't quite match up.

Normal Harry isn't the MoD, Ancient Harry is. Normal Harry didn't summon him, Dumbledore and the Order did.

If that's not the one you're thinking of, then consider it a recommendation. It's a lot more entertaining than you might think from the description/tags. Pretty sure it's the only fic I've enjoyed that describes itself as bashing a character.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

  At a young age, Harry becomes Death of the Apocalypse. Now he must find the other Riders while keeping his identity a secret while still attending Hogwarts. Features an independent Ravenclaw Harry, no Golden Trio, and an attempt to not bash characters. Book Two finished.

** As an example of another Harry is Death fic is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9911469/1/Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus][Lily-and-the-Art-of-Being-Sisyphus]]. This is also one of my favorite fics in the entire fandom. However it's even mildly similar to the fic you mentioned as in addition to the main character Harry being Death it also features an ancient Harry from another universe who is also Death (they are both the Death of their respective universes). Though that Harry is probably more hinged than the main character if anything.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
