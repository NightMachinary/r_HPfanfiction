I know this question has been asked a lot, but I've been looking around all of the fanfic sites for a good story for ages and am still yet to have any success. Basically does anyone know of any good Draco/Hermione fics that are long (or at least a few chapters) and set during their Hogwarts years? As I said before I've been looking around but haven't managed to find any that have caught my attention. Are there any particular ones that you guys would recommend?

Edit: Sorry for the punctuation fail in the title


** I agree with the recs that have already been mentioned. I'm going to add a few and specify which of the previously mentioned are Hogwarts era.

**** I know exactly what you mean! That was the story that first got me into this ship years ago, and I still end up crying at the end when I reread it. The author has started the sequel, but updates are unfortunately not as frequent as the readers would like and all too agonizingly good.

***** It's just so sad and oh my god I can't handle this ending, it's so perfect but so maddening at the same time!

** I second everything already mentioned. Especially The Bracelet, Heavy Lies the Crown, and Parade of the Sun.

I pulled a few from my favorites list on ffn:

** You might've read all of these, since they are popular dramione authors, but here are some of my favorites:

- Everything by [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=13][AkashaTheKitty]], especially Silencio and The Bracelet
- Everything by [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=2][everythursday]], especially The Fallout and Parade of the Sun
- Everything by [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=3][floorcoaster]], especially Gravity
- Broken by [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=5&warning=5][inadaze22]]
- The Revenant by [[http://dramione.org/viewuser.php?uid=457][atalanta84]]

I'm totally bookmarking this too, because I feel like I've read every decent dramione story out there and I'm really looking for something new.

EDIT: Also [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2978409/1/Beautiful-Things-Can-Come-From-The-Dark][Beautiful Things Can Come From the Dark]] by yesterday4. This one is pretty dark and deals with rape, though. So avoid it, if that's an issue for you.
