The Sorting Hat had been arround for nearly a thousand years and had put thousands upon thousands of students where they belonged within Hogwarts' hallowed halls. But it had never encountered someone like Harry Potter before.

Upon touching the boys head and using its magic to probe the boys mind for the traits it needed to do it's duty the hat was blinded by a golden light. The hat squinted its metaphysical eyes to look within the light, to see past it and see the true child beneath but what it saw surprised it.

A boy in green, sailing the sea with determination in his eyes.

A boy in green, lost but determined within a dark forest looking for a friend.

A blue eyed beast, running across the darkness to save his only friends.

A man in green, scaling the castle walls to save his Princess.

And a man in blue waking up, from a long slumber...

Before the hat could see more a voice, young but old at the same time whispered in his and the boys ear.

"Link, Wake up."

And with that the hat could only scream out "GRYFFINDOR!!!"

** I'm picturing a mute Harry cooking at the Dursley's by dumping 4 pieces of meat and a hunk of salt on an open campfire and humming as it cooks.

** There's also a kind of neat parallel between the Hollows and the pieces of triforce.

*Triforce of Wisdom* : I'm going with the invisibility Cloak here, as it was the third brother's wisdom that choose the boon in the first place. There also isn't much courage in using the invisibility cloak to hide so you can live another day, the courage comes in taking it off and passing it down the generations.

Obviously the fact that Potter's heirloom is the invisibility cloak and not the resurrection stone doesn't make it a perfect parallel, but your idea of having the memories of the past links does also fit with the 'spirits of the past' theme that the Resurrection Stone represents.

*Triforce of Courage* : While the Resurrection Stone might not be a perfect fit, the proper use of it is what allowed Harry to have the necessary courage to walk to his death.

*Triforce of Power* : Clearly the Elder Wand

Overall, with sufficient tweaking, there is potential in such a mashup of these two universes.

** this could be interesting. Is Harry Possessed by Link, is Harry another incarnation? Depending on how it was done it could be cool.

*** To add to my reply, my interpretation of incarnation will be that he has the experiences and memories of the old links available to him but he is still his own person. It will be fun because when he meets the incarnation of Zelda shes going to point out that non of her memories of Link ever had black hair

***** I know im going to blitz through first-third year and focus on fourth year in the first story and if i can make it work continue from there

****** In that case, consider this:

Write the sorting self contained as a prologue, pretty much what you already have, then start in Fourth year with Chapter 1. As earlier things become pertinent, either flashback or reference them quickly to keep the story moving.

It might be a little weird at first, but it will but the story right to the core action. Sure we might need a bit to figure out the whyfores and thereofs of all the relationships and changes from canon, but that makes the reading fun.

******* That would work really well, when spells or items become relevant i can write a flash back chapter to them like the Master Sword and Harrys Patronous as well as him meeting The Incarnation of Zelda for the first time

** Well, I guess the events of year two would be somewhat silly with a Harry who is a gryffindor but always wears green.
