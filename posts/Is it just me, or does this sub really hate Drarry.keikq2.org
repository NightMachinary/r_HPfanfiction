I'm not even a shipper, but I was surprised at how hostile this sub seems when it comes to this ship because I'm in another fandom with a popular m/m pairing and it doesn't get half as much hate as Drarry does here.


** Yes, but I think it's more accurate to say that the sub hates Draco. Dramione posts aren't as common as Drarry posts, but they also seem to attract downvotes. As do Snarry and Snamione posts, so maybe it's really the "Draco in leather pants" trope that the sub hates. Drarry is just the most common ship in the fandom, so it's the one that hate is most often targeted at.

************* Ehhhh see that's not entirely true, Their are plenty of people raised by people who were firm believers in say Communism or American Capitalistic Ideals and they flip to the other end of the spectrum. The Hippie Movement of the 1970's was literally a middle finger to what you just said.

Using my own family as an example, My dad is a Christian Conservative, he raised my brother and i will plenty of love and caring but my brother straight up hates him, gets into fights with him all the time, is agnostic at most and an athiest at best and is pretty Liberal.

People change and life events can change them, Draco could change his views, hell even in Book 6 he was slowly changing his views, specifically because Voldemort showed him that his Father was as much of a coward as everyone was saying he was for allowing his Son and Wife to basically be punished for his mistakes.

If a writer knew how to, they could easily make Draco out to be a Schinlder like character, but most writers don't want to write an in-depth character study on how an Extremist can slowly see their own views as wrong, they only want Draco to be Harry's/Hermione's little fuck buddy and take the path of least resistance to do so.

And keep in mind, I fucking hate Draco but the fact that I could at least see paths for redemption for him is something that's at least good for his character, and I can understand why some people like the possibility of a good Draco, but most stories do it half assed or just ignore that he was an extremist in the first place and that's not ok.

******* Draco is a child for virtually the entire series, one indoctrinated from birth by his family to the point where he's /proud/ to be made a child soldier.

He can certainly be redeemed - it's easiest earlier on in the series (pre-book 6), but even afterwards it's hard for me to justify condemning him for life before he's even an adult.

Childhood influences have a massive impact on people's lives - and the series ends at an age point where that's where people will often start drifting away from those influences a bit more (eg - many people raised in strict christian households become atheists during their university years).

Additionally, the narrative in canon shows us that by mid-end of book 6, Draco knows he's in over his head, and (to me at least) would be eager for a way out. But it's not like there's much of a chance of Voldemort letting a Malfoy do that, is there? Or of him thinking he'd be taken in by anyone on the other side.

Make Draco Malfoy eat a few Cruciatus Curses and a Killing Curse in a suitably impactful heroic sacrifice, and I'll be all too happy to let bygones be bygones.

Similarly, if the timeline diverges early enough, I'll be the first to say that in earlier years he was spoiled ponce with way too much pride and little in the way of moral backbone, but he was certainly not evil.

That said, if a post-book-6 Draco wants a redemption, the rule of "show your work" applies. I'll not even demand something that big, but for it to be "redemption" and not Draco In Leather Pants 2.0 Whitewashing Edition, the character would need to be shown at least trying to earn it.

********* In book 2 Draco is all mudbloods this and mudbloods that. When the message is found with Mrs Norris he openly rejoices at the thought of his muggleborn peers getting murdered.

That, from a 12 year old is a rather telling reaction because that goes beyond spoon-fed racism. The appropriate response would have been being scared shitless and by no means parading your pure blood status around like it is the ultimate shield.

The only appropriate response to a racist and/or facist regime asking after places of birth & religion (or blood status in the HP books) is clamming up on your blood status and refusing to claim or confirm any blood status. Which I believe was a actual tactic against the nazi regime.

That the HP-world still starts their getting-to-know-you conversations a decade after the dark lord with parading bloodstatus around is the inherent racism of the people who actually try.

Draco is a death eater kid that was raised as any other Gestapo kid, and if the second war with Voldemort hadn't been a thing, he'd be the chairman of the underground group that deified Voldemort and Bellatrix like the secret society of surviving family members of NSDAP party members did Hitler and GÃ¶ring.

***** Before the sixth book came out, JKR said in an interview that she was surprised that readers liked Snape or Draco at all. (Although flawed, they both were quite redeemable up to that point.)

"Coincidentally," the sixth book starts with a brutal Draco breaking Harry's nose and leaving him petrified under the invisibility cloak, and a Snape more vitriolic than ever (which is saying something).

The redemption arc can only ever be half-assed when you upgrade unlikeable characters to unmitigated sadists. The fact that she did it for the sole reason that people didn't hate them enough is just unforgiveable.

***** I saw that quote recently too... no idea in what context though. Ah, I think it was part of a collection of fanfics motivated by that quote I found on AO3. I don't think I read them in the end, though. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2330390][Yes, that does appear to be the case. And actually I did read the Pansy one... I still can't tell who the Pansy/OFC and Pansy/OMC ships are in it though: I suspect I did not pay sufficient attention]]

Anyway, there's a well known Next Gen fic (although I have forgotten the name) where Pansy's Battle of Hogwarts moment is redeemed (it's because she's pregnant), but other than that she's still basically a bitch (it just now manifests in being a terrible mother). I think Draco's quite central to this fic's characterisation though. It may be the case that they're both the bad guy in that relationship (they're not together... by relationship I mean largely how they coparent) but it also might be one or the other (I lean Pansy as the bad guy).

I think part of Pansy' problem is that she gets replaced with Astoria.

** I honestly don't think there's enough agreement on anything to really generalise like that. This fandom doesn't even agree on what Draco's character IS, nevermind what his relationships are. To some he's Magical Hitler Youth, to others he's a pretty and misunderstood soft boii, to others he's just a coward who got in over his head, to others he's a cunning and intelligent individual. Right or wrong, those interpretations do exist, so any conversation on "What do you think about Draco/Drarry?" turns pretty quickly into "Which Draco we talkin' here?". It's an interesting dynamic to watch in action. :)

There's definitely a lot of loud voices that do dislike Drarry and/or 'Draco' (whichever one they have in mind) though, I agree. But to a lot of them, he's basically an unrepentant magical neo-nazi who got scared when his more hardcore buddies wanted more than he could handle. Most people with that interpretation will probably dislike him.

*** I would agree with this. I think it's mainly because of two things: first, the fandom is divided in how they experienced the books. For those of us who grew up with them being released, we didn't know the end character arcs. We had to guess at where it was going, and for the Death Eater characters, it was a question of 'how bad are they?' or 'do they get a redemption arc?' But for those people who could read it all at once, there's less time to question and play with character motivations and to imagine how bad someone could be and how good they could be. I also think that's why there's a lot more fiction now about the Marauders and the "Next Gen" group, because fanfic is inherently about imagining what happens next and having more freedom with the characters. It's hard to do when a character has a completed arc.

Two: There is a distinct generational divide in the experience of readers. Again, for those of us a little older, we were raised at a time where a lot of the issues that are tackled in Harry Potter were hidden from us. Racism, while it's always been around, is very visible right now (in the US particularly) and people are very actively fighting against it or for it. I know when I think of Death Eaters now, I have a greater understanding of what makes them so evil. To be honest, as a kid, I didn't. Also, now Snape is getting scrutinized under the lens of feminism, and what is "owed" to a male character who loves a female character, but very selfishly and harmfully. Again, when I was younger, I thought this was more romantic and redeeming than I do now.

It's been interesting for me, as a writer, to consider these changes and see what made a character more palatable then as opposed to now. It's also interesting to see how the fandom handles aging and new perspectives and real-world issues. Do we avoid writing racist characters? I don't think that necessarily helps the issue, but we certainly shouldn't romanticize characters who hold those views. And if we do want to give those characters redemption arcs, which I certainly enjoy, we need to show where they started and how they got there, the consequences of their beliefs/behaviors, and how they get out.

But this is difficult for a lot of writers - and let's face it, a lot of us are /new/ writers, meaning we sometimes take the easy way out by ignoring our main characters' flaws. By avoiding it, minimizing it, or pulling the "main character was always good and is just misunderstood" card. I've certainly done that.

**** I haven't really been in the fandom long enough myself to really comment on your first reason. I'm definitely of the latter 'read it all at once' group, and even then I didn't read them until Deathly Hallows came out and haven't read them since. Pretty sure I've only actually seen the movies twice too. I don't tend to look at canon very much. :)

I do agree with your second reason though. Seen that a LOT in my time on this sub. Generation divide, culture divide, lots of different views across the different demographics. Definitely been popcorn-and-armchair level interesting to watch it all happen here. :)

I think the 'romanticisation' issue is a doylist-watsonian issue. If you examine the more negative issues within the narrative itself and have characters glorifying or romanticising or otherwise approving of problematic things, that can work quite well and provide some interesting elements (and be true to reality - a lot of people do like very problematic individuals), but doing it externally in a more 'doylist' sense, that can be problematic. Sort of a "Yes, I as the writer think this character is an arsehole, but the town is full of problematic people who share his views, so they like him." kind of a vibe, I guess? I'm not entirely sure how to explain the difference, since both do actually happen within the fic itself and the line is a bit wibbly-wobbly, but I do think it works.

I definitely agree that redemption arcs should actually be 'arcs'. Clap-off, clap-on is not a good method for redemption - that shit's a process, and a hard one at that. It does happen though. I'm sure we've all seen the various TED Talks type things with ex-KKK or ex-Westboro Baptist types.

And yeah, it is difficult, but doing this kind of thing is how we learn. Better to try and fail, then learn from that, than to never try at all, in my book. Pun intended. :)

****** He also managed to bypass Hogwarts' defenses with the vanishing cabinet in book 6 - that's not an easy feat to accomplish, from what I understand. In preparation for that year, the wiki also lists:

#+begin_quote
  In preparation for such a dangerous mission, Draco trained and improved his own skills, and became capable of blocking jinxes nonverbally. He also became accomplished at Occlumency through the training of his maternal aunt Bellatrix Lestrange, and was able to perform the very difficult Protean Charm,[18] though he could not yet produce a corporeal Patronus.[19]
#+end_quote

Many of those are things used as proof that Harry is a particularly skilled and powerful wizard in many super-Harry fics, so I think it's fair for people wanting a more competent Draco to also use that sort of reasoning.

Otherwise, Draco is reasonably talented in other regards - we know he scored well on his OWLs (made it to DADA and Potions NEWT level classes), he's a good flier, he's a competent/good duelist, and in early years shows a knowledge of spells beyond the norm (eg, summoning a snake in 2nd year).

All of that means that it's reasonable to take him in a more competent, more skilled direction - narratively, that's also quite fulfilling when it comes to a rival character. At the same time, it's also more than reasonable to focus on his more, ah, 'dumb', 'pathetic' moments and take him into more of a joke - which is what most fics that don't focus on him seem to do.

Managing spells beyond his years is also understandable because his dad would try to keep him above the rest.

I also understand the authors wanting to make him more competent because an incapable rival is an annoyance, not a threat.

It just seems like Dracos goto answer to every problem is either money or his Dad which makes him seem like a wimp.

Plus all of the things you pointed out don't make him seem cunning just taught.

** This sub is just a subsection of the larger HP fanfiction fandom, and it's important to remember that. I think the demographics are more like reddit's ones, vs the fandom at large having more women, just as an example.

In terms of preferences, I think the major ones are that this sub is much more pro-Ron, less pro-Hermione, much more anti-Snape and Draco, and that extends to a few ships. Harmony is less liked here, as are any ships with Snape or Draco involved, as well as slash fics in general.

*** Woman who likes women here. Anecdotal I know, but: All for anything not m/m. Huge fan of Hermione... not a fan of Ron at all. Like Draco and Snape as antagonists but dislike them as any sort of focus of the story or making them 'good guys' after the crap they have done. I prefer Harry/Hermione and not very interested in Ginny. Agree on the last few points tho.

** While I haven't been part of the discussions of Drarry, I can honestly say that I usually avoid them because I really don't like Draco. I'm sure there are plenty of fics where the author has done a really good job at making how they got together realistic (and Draco being a âgoodâ character), but I just can't bring myself to find them. ð

****** Meh, enemies to lovers is a popular trope for a reason. Draco is too young for his equivalent to be an SS officer - instead, it'd be like a Nazi youth (raised from birth to be a nazi - the amount of propaganda the Nazi youth groups deployed are really chilling) falling in love with a Jewish girl around 17-18 years old (if taking his age at the end of the book).

Obviously when it comes to something that happened in history, it would have to be handled delicately/well - but it's certainly possible to do so, and I think it could make for a compelling story if handled well. In HP, it's much easier to do so (as the events are fictional) and there's already enough variation on the characters/events that I don't see it as a major issue to rewrite Draco into a more sympathetic character (just like there's no problem to rewrite Harry or Ron as more competent characters, for example).

** I don't think it's that is an m/m pairing right? Because Wolfstar is the biggest pairing on here (at least on my radar but I do lean more towards Marauder era) and that has very little hate that I can see.

I think it's just that it's Draco and there's no chemistry or like... Inkling in the books or films of it? People have decided to smash them together despite that. Which works if you write it correctly but difficult to imagine/visualise/accept unless you're willing to forgo a lot of cannon and completely twist character motivations and plot.

Which is fun and what some people want to do but not everyone. I dunno, that's my view anyway.

*** A bit of both, I dare say. Straight men are not going to really want to read a story that focuses on two gay men. Likewise, Draco becomes irredeemable, no matter what, beyond a certain moment. There is no redeeming someone who almost murdered your supposed best friend, even if it was an accident. They say love and hate are very similar emotions with the same intensity, and therefore can easily intertwine.

Even if you take in the fact that Draco flipped sides, anything beyond or after book five is just a waste of time. If you change canon, maybe have him defect and work alongside Harry, I can see it working, even with a bitter relationship.

**** Gay woman here and similar. Some of my friends seem to enjoy guy/guy stuff, but I can't stand it. I mean, I support gay male relationships and every variety under the sun, but I don't want to read it as the focus of a story. In the one story I've written I had Sirius/Remus as a thing but it wasn't explicit (neither was the main pairing to be honest, just not good at smut, not that I want to share anyway). I Love F/F pairings and do just fine with M/F pairings from the guy's point of view... I guess I just put myself in the main character's shoes too much to enjoy any sort of romance focused on a guy from the reader/writer perspective.

And strongly agree on the unlikable and irredeemable Draco. A decent foil and an understandable/mildly interesting character, but in no way one I enjoy 'bringing over to the good side'... Maybe early on in the books if it happened naturally, but there is so much bending over backwards to accommodate his (technically) racist viewpoints and bullying attitude while ignoring friendly or even neutral classmates that I don't understand it.

** You have to remember that Draco Malfoy spends 7 canon books as an antagonist and for the last two he's basically in the SS (even if, yes, he over time comes to regret it).

Harry, in contrast, is best friend's with one the major targets of Draco's racism, is a victim himself of the dude Draco's family works for and he almost lost Hogwarts due to the whole Basilisk incident in which I must remind you Draco was on the side of the basilisk. Oh, and Draco also deliberately persecutes Hagrid /at every opportunity/... although it must be said Hagrid is one of the most under-rated characters in fanfics so this probably isn't particularly relevant when looking at the fandom's evaluation of Harry's issues with Draco and/or Drarry. It might also pay to mention the whole Inquisitorial Squad thing and how much everyone hates Umbridge... Draco clearly didn't!

What I'm saying is that t's a weird and problematic ship.

Of course, it's probably still more unpopular than it should be based on these problems (cf Dramione)... but Drarry shouldn't occur to people reading canon and shouldn't appear in fanfics with canon-like characterisations of Harry (which is, frankly, what most people do go for). It's a bit different when you look at epilogue (and especially Cursed Child) compliant Drarry, which, after all, have two marriages to end (various solutions exist) and the benefit of twenty plus years of room to make up for Draco's problems.

AUs are another matter entirely. After all, who's to say what is exactly going on in the particular AU. Maybe they're both Death Eaters... maybe Draco Malfoy is the boy who lived and Harry's just some random halfblood that likes Quidditch... maybe they're both genderflipped and it's femslash. But AU ships that have canon personalities, interpersonal relations and Draco related canon stations? They need to be careful.

** I think Drarry isnt received very well he is viewed to differently by evryone. Some think hes good some bad. Some think hes a kid in over his head(I'm in this category). Never the less draco was a death eater and not a nice person and when he finds love he just changes his mind or some other crap is wrong and cheesy to alot of people. If you wanna give him a redemption arc have some other lying cause for it.(the death of his parents by Voldemort might work).

Harry and snape I find creepy as snape was in love with lily potter Harry's mom...creepy and wrong in my point of view and probablyothers as well. Still even though snape was on Dumbledore's side he was not a good person. The only reason he try'd to help harry when his broom was cursed in the first book was because of a oath he gave to Dumbledore to help lily's son to make Dumbledore help him and keep him save lily (and keep him from azkaban later). If he didnt make the oath hed probably left harry to die when he fell off of the broom.
