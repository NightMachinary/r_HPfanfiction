Maybe Voldemort moves his Horcruxes

Maybe characters start dying sooner, or new characters that didn't die start dying

People break out of Azkaban

Voldemort comes back sooner

Or other similar things happening

As for pairings No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione please

Would rather it be completed, if not then frequently updated is fine.
