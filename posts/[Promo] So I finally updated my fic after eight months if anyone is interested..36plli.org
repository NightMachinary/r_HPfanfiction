Let me know how terrible it is so I can make it slightly less terrible.

Thanks.


** No way jose I am reading something that has such infrequent updates, I'm not a glutton for literary blue balls.

*** Can't blame you. Reading after that lengthy an absence isn't easy and I know the frustration of waiting for updates. I will strive to do better.

** Going to re-read it from the start because, and I am sorry to say this, this fic hasn't stuck in my memory at all.

Chapter 1 - Ron's thoughts were a bit wordy, I think? I don't know if Ron knows all these big words and how to string together sentences that convey what he was thinking that eloquently.

Chapter 2 - I do love how Harry's mind works. /Pumpkin Juice? Must be because oranges are weapons of mass destruction./ I also love this Hedwig, like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10370772/1/The-Mad-Scientist-of-Azkaban][The Mad Scientist of Askaban]]'s Queen Hedwig the Merciless. Beautiful.

Chapter 3 - I love Harry's thoughts on Neville. Love them.

Will the next update be quicker than 8 months?

*** Much faster than eight months. This one only took so long because I'm a serial procrastinator and I got distracted by reading some really long fics in various fandoms. I'm back in the groove now though.
