The passage to Honeydukes was constructed in the year 1472 when a nervous and shy Charms teacher, Diminious Spark, at Hogwarts fell in love with the daughter of Augustus Duxmelorum, merchant of Hogsmeade. The forbidden romance took a turn when the feverish teacher did all he could to see the golden-haired love of his life after her father locked her in the basement after he found her in the embrace of the ardent Spark.
