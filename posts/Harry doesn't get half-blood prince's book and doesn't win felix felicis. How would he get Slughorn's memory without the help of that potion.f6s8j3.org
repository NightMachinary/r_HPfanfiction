*** Doubtful. I like to think Slughorn uses the Drought of Living Death as a super hard potion for the first lesson of the year to gauge skill levels and summer retention rather than actually expecting them to succeed.

You could maybe argue that Hermione was distracted by Harry sudden skill and she wouldn't have become flustered without Harry having the book, but still... she didn't brew an acceptable potion.

Felis Felicis isn't something Slughorn hands out to the best attempt. They have to succeed with the super hard potion. Slughorn also states only one student has ever won it, and he's been teaching a long time. The Prince's book might imply that one person might be Snape, though bear in mind Slughorn also taught Tom Riddle.

*** Given what was at stake and that Slughorn's refusal to talk came very close to treason, this would hardly be questionable since even canon used reality altering substances to get that confession. What's a few drops of Veritaserum compared to the lives of thousands, if not millions or billions?

*** Oh that would be interesting to see. But Slughorn avoids Harry as much as possible so it would be hard to get him to stay long enough. He'd just run away before Harry got the chance to say more than a few words. But of course here you mean slipping him a potion. That would have been the best thing ever. Only Dumbledore said he most probably has an antidote. But does he take it every time before drinking anything?

**** You'd need a somewhat more rutheless Harry to do this, but I could imagine it going along these lines: Harry sneaks up behind Slughorn while under his invisibility cloak, stuns him, drags his unconscious form into a disused classroom, secures him to a large flat surface, and then breaks out the toothpicks.

****** Yeah, Harry has no chill there.

"Give us the fucking memory. You fucking useless excuse for a Potions Master. I should kill you right now. Give us the memory and we'll let you live"

He tried to smile, tried to turn it into some form of a joke, hoping that if he just ignored it he would wake up, and this would all have been a terrible dream.

And he heard what Harry said next.

"Crucio!"

*** I believe For Want of a Beazor has Harry and Hermione use enhanced interrogation.

Not sure the fic, but I've also seen Dumbledore take off the kid gloves and rip it out of Slughorn's mind using legilimancy.

** I mean... have you ever seen The Big Lebowski? Moaning Myrtle does have a bathroom Harry could use. :D

Personally, the best way I've seen is in chapter 35 of Faery Heroes. The Ghost of Christmas Past kind of method that takes advantage of Slughorn's stated affection for Lily is probably the way I'd see most likely to actually work without the liquid luck.

** Maybe Hermione would be helpful and come up with some kind of plan that involves swiping the Felix Felicis and using it anyway (As she wouldn't have gone full bitch mode because of the HBP Book, she might retain her badassery from Book 5)

I'm pretty sure Dumbledore that knew he was dying anyway would be willing to go morals off for a moment if it was impossible for Harry to get the memory. "Imperio. Hand over the real memory between you and Tom, Horace. Obliviate"
