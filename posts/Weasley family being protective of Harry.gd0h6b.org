I want a fic or a one-shot where the Weasleys are really protective of Harry and Harry is really small and maybe more abused than in canon. Maybe also without Ginny or something so Harry is the youngest.

What is also something I would like to read is a story or one-shot where Ron is possessive of Harry (and Hermione) because he is the second youngest and always had to share everything. Harry and Ron could be in a relationship or Ron is just possessive over his friend (maybe fem!harry)


** This is literally all I want.

  Ron was always clear with Harry's boyfriend on the consequences of hurting his best friend. Suspicion now falls on Cedric when a private photo of the two together begins to circulate. Ron is officially out for blood, though it never quite comes to that.
