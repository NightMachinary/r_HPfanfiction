** Wow. This is stunning. I really appreciate a story that jumps right in and gradually fills in the backstory. I can't wait to read more!

The only critique I have is that some of the wording is a little awkward in places.

• 'Hermione braces for the painful clasp of his paw'. Clasp of his paw is a little strange. Crush/crunch of his fist? Not sure about that one.

•'the Council already had their paws sunken deep in the Ministère'. Claws instead of paws would make more sense here.

•'Florian's stomach groaned'. I'd suggest turned instead of groaned.

This is probably the most unique thing I've read in a long while. Please please please continue this story! <3

*** I agree. This has massive potential, and I am intrigued at what you're planning with the fic.

The way it's written is slightly verbose, but the imagery and scenes themselves are fantastic, and there is a lot of detail added that shows off the background of the fic, which is very nice.

As for spelling and grammar, except for one instance (should be petals of a flower, not pedals) I didn't find any errors.

Followed, and looking forward to what you've thought up for this fic.

**** As to being 'slightly verbose', I didn't mention that because it pulls it off so well.

** You had a few misplaced commas (the comma following No, said Tom is redundant) and the slightly awkward wording that another commenter already touched on, but it's otherwise really good and interesting!!

** Hmm I don't hate it! I don't say this to imply that it is bad. There simply is a lot going on and not too much to go off of. Especially introducing soany new things in one chapter. I think it's fine as is but keep in mind that you can always add details in later as well.

** Remember to have different voices and lots of repeat character interaction. It can be easy to start so many new plot lines that you forget about or stop writing the plotlines people started reading your fiction for in the first place.
