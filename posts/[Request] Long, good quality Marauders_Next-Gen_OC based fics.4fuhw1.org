I'm almost done with The Life and Times and I need good quality fics to tide me over through exams! I love Marauders (preferably focused on Jily, though I'm not too fussed), next-generation or OC-based fics (like Alexandra Quick). Basically, anything that isn't about the Golden Trio/set during Harry's Hogwarts years.

Recommendations would be much appreciated xx


** linkffn(Tears on the Balcony)

First in a three story arc. The entire thing is like 2.5 million words.

*** I've read all of these stories and honestly they're really enjoyable as long as you skim through half of it. The author rambles and repeats the same problems and "drama" over and over again. I would recommend them, but be prepared to skip parts or to just end up losing interest

**** Sounds about right from what I can remember. 99% of the drama problems could be solved with proper communication as well.

**** I agree, but I also felt that that same issue reflected the fact that they're teenagers/barely adults. I'm waiting to reread the series until Goodbyes is finished.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

  In the year 1590, new threats have arisen against wizarding Britain. After a series of murders of magic-users at the hands of muggles, one witch, Judith Fairweather, must discover the cause of the attacks and the reason behind their success for the government of wizarding Britain - all while keeping her own hide intact. Collecting a generous fee would be an entirely welcome bonus.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Are you looking for fics that don't star the golden trio AND aren't set during the 90's at Hogwarts? Or is either enough? So if we have a fic about the trio in 2010, say, or during the marauder era, does that meet the request?
