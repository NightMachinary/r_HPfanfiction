  After his first year at Hogwarts Harry discovers a startling truth that throws him into an entirely new world. He finds a new family and a new home that drastically changes his life for the better, if not crazier. After all when you're the son of Tony Stark, the one and only Iron Man, life is bound to be interesting.

** Trust is a delicate thing

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25083436/chapters/60761023]]

This fic is slash with a Harry Potter/Peter Parker pairing but they're not together yet. The premise is that the Dursley's abandon Harry and move away after 5th yr and so Harry is put into British social services and gets out after being confirmed to be Stark's son. The timeline is mashed up so the avengers are dealing w/ the Sokovia accords and so Harry doesn't tell Tony that he's magical because he doesn't want wizards involved with that. It's angsty with both Tony and Harry not really knowing how to have a good relationship so if that's not something you're into I wouldn't rec reading it. There is also mentions of sexual assault against minors but it doesn't get explicit about it
