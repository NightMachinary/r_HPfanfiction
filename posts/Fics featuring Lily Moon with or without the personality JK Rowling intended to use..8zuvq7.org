It came to me as a surprise when I reread the HP books and found the name Lily Moon in the sorting, after doing a bit of research I found out she was the 'draft' for Luna Lovegood. Any fics out there where Lily Moon plays a part, big or small it doesn't matter just as long as she is featured as more than a name. Maybe with a few key differences that sets her apart from Luna.

Thanks.


** I may be misremembering things, but I'm pretty sure that Lily M. shows up (cuz of her family) in linkffn(Finding a place to call home).

She's also one of the MC and best friends of both Daph and Harry in linkffn(Path to power by sirius009)

** This has Lily Moon. linkffn(7796463) She's pretty normal, but the fic is centered around the Potters. Shame it was abandoned. It was one of the most original and funniest fics out there. Really, top notch work.

P.S. Well the bot doesn't seem to be cooperating so I'll just post the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7796463/1/AntiHyphen]]

** Lily Moon is a supporting character in my series, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn; The Chessmaster: White Knight; The Chessmaster: Black Bishop). It's a political, Slytherin!trio AU. Lily Moon isn't similar to Luna, but she does have her own personality and is one of Hermione's close friends.
