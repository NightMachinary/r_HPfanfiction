** The way I headcanon it:

- Sales tax
- Wage tax
- Currency exchange tax
- Property tax
- Fines
- Services: Floo connection (tax), licenses, permits, patents, testing fees, etc

** Tarifs, fees for licenses (for stores and monopolies), fees for the Floo network - you can get a lot of money without taxes, provided your economy is suited for it.

** I don't believe we know from canon how the Ministry gets its funding - however, it seems likely to be through taxes and/or fees.

We know they do fines on breaches of the Statute of Secrecy, which presumably makes up a chunk of the budget (eg - Arthur Weasley having to pay a 50 galleon fine in book 2). Other fines (eg, the dark magic ones) might also be ways of adding some money.

But yes - the Ministry does need to have an income to pay the salaries of its workers + finance all the other stuff that it does (Big events, Hogwarts, etc).

** In addition to various fees like Starfox said, we can be reasonably sure that they accept various donations and loans from rich people.
