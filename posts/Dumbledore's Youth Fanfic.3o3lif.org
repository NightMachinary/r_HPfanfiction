Best fanfics which focus on how Dumbledore became the Dumbledore we know in the book?

Is there even any out there? Any help would be much appreciated.

Thanks.

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.
