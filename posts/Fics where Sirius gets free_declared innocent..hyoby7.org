Hi all.

I'm wondering if anyone has any fics about the above? They can start at the end of 3rd year where Pettigrew is captured, memories are looked at, Pettigrew gets captured later in cannon... Basically anything like that.


** The linkffn(Innocent) series is one of my favourites. Sirius accidentally escapes 5 years earlier (literally, he dreams of walking out of his cell, and wakes up in the water outside), and since he has no leads on Peter, he instead goes to check on Harry. And when he finds how unhappy Harry is with the Dursleys, he offers him another home. Which results in an even bigger uproar than his initial escape, with everyone thinking he kidnapped the Boy Who Lived in an effort to finish the job he started. Eight-year-old Harry, meanwhile, thinks Padfoot is much better than the Dursleys, and is awed to learn more about his parents and about magic.

Sirius does eventually clear his name, but it doesn't happen quickly; the fic is half a million words. And it's only the first book in a series, although the others are shorter.

It doesn't have any superpowered characters, nor secret Black family magic, nor lordships, just Sirius doing his flawed but sincere best to be a good parent to Harry.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

** I'm currently reading ffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan]]) which starts just like that. Only it is becoming a bit OP!harry and â€˜Lord Potter-Black' ish but the beginning is solid. Also the characterisation of Dumbledore is much better than usual. The weasleys as well for that matter.

*** I'll vouch for this story. Despite the lordship stuff, it's very well-written and fairly believable within the context of the story. Harry isn't really overpowered (compared to canon, maybe, but not within the story itself). Dumbledore's arc is also very well done.

***** That's right! Been a while since I've read it (not really a fic you can just reread whenever you feel like it) but yeah, the politics is mainly Sirius's thing. Harry has a small part with the other heirs, and there's the whole family magic thing (which I actually liked and thought was well done), but Harry isn't a teenager politician like he's normally portrayed in these types of stories.

***** It's a series with minor Dumbledore-Molly-Hermione bashing but a lot of characters get second chances, I there isn't much romance usually, there's not really slash but Sirius and Remus act like a married couple 99% of the time and it's hilarious bc Sirius doesn't even realize, and it does have the 'pup' nickname, but it's usually from Sirius and it makes sense in context.(There's also minor Lord shit but it's not in your face)

Basically, the series starts during the summer of fifth year, and basically Harry gets fed up with how Molly treats Sirius and gets Sirius to stand up for himself. It's got a lot of fluffy family moments but it's also got plot and drama. Also, Sirius is protective and powerful and knows how to intimidate people and it's amazing.

The author also does a lot of Marauders Era fics in the same universe, and has given me a lot of my headcanons. I almost prefer their universe to canon. I'm on the edge.

That sounds amazingly cathartic.

EDIT: Okay, a couple of chapters in and it looks like it starts post-freedom? I'm guessing this ties into the spoilers you mentioned but either way I feel like I'm missing a large amount of context for a lot of the things characters are offhandedly referring to.

EDIT 2: Yeah the stories are kind of all over the place but the chronological order is in the author's profile, thank god.
