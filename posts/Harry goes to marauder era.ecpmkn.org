Read a few of these and I love them, can't get enough. Preferably complete but I'll take anything I can if it is still updating.


** These are fairly popular so you might have heard of them; but also, you might not have, so. linkao3(15465966; 5986366)

Face Death in the Hope is focused on Harry and Regulus, after the Marauders have graduated. The Second String is focused on Harry and Aberforth Dumbledore, among others, and starts while the Marauders are still at school.

FDitH has more interactions between Harry and the Marauders. TSS has interactions, but it's less of the focus, especially at the beginning. Both are still updating. Neither is, in my opinion, a "typical" Marauders-era time travel fic.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Harry Potter never had much luck, being sent to his parents' past should have been expected. 'Complete' Time travel fic.

** For a shorter one, one of my favorites is linkffn(Timely Errors)

It's one that's explicitly temporary, as the contrived reason for Harry to be there lasts just for a few days/weeks, but I found it the best of the lot that I've read.

  Dumbledore concocts a cunning plan to travel back in time and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. His untimely death prevents him from going so Harry must go in his place, and take the one person whose help he really needs with him.
