Thanks alot!


** linkffn(Not From Others) is a DH fic from Ginny's POV, and it's absolutely amazing. Totally canon-compliant, well written, and thoroughly plausible. It's become my headcanon for Hogwarts during DH.

** NoahPhantom's 7 novel Albus Potter series expands on the canon amazingly, is canon complimentary for everything canon prior to 2014-ish, and has a preconceived plot with mystery and grand reveals.

Here's Book 1 of the 7

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
