I'm working on the first chapter of my new fanfic, and it's about two thirds done but it's already 10k words.

Whats your view on chapter length? I don't want to split this into two chapters, so it's going to be a very long chapter, but I'm wondering if seeing about 12k words for the first chapter alone would keep people away


** I think people prefer longer chapters over short ones. Don't worry about it. 4 out of 11 of my chapters are about 20k words long and I haven't got any complaints. The opposite, in fact. Apparently longer chapters help immersion.

Which makes sense for fanfiction. In a normal book, you have the entire book in your hands so of course you can get immersed in it. But a fanfiction that's just updated with 3k words? Eh. I'll read that while I'm taking a shit.

I'm Still Here has chapters that are 40k words long. Those I found a bit too long, as I sometimes lost my place and scrolling through 40k words was a pain in the ass, especially if I wanted to get to the very bottom for whatever reason.

*** Alright thank you.

I find it different now, you see I used to start a fic with just an idea or inspiration and write my chapters at the spur of the moment with no planning to it whatsoever.

But I haven't written a fanfic in over a decade, so I really pplanned this one out (It covers books 3-7). And I find now that it's planned and I have certain parts I want in said chapter in bulletin points they are much longer. Like before when I was writing i'd write 3-5k words, now they are all over 10k with it planned.

I was just worried so thanks!

**** Yeah, I have the same issue. I think a lot of authors do. I have a large outline of everything for my story, and in the beginning, what is my first 8 chapters was originally like 4 chapters.

*** I think Mr. Norrell's story "Sympathetic Properties" has some chapters that are over the 40k word realm. But his updates are far and few in between. (Also, with my current story, I have an estimated average word count of just under 3k words. With my previous, one, however, it was averaging out above 9k).

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Five unique tasks. Eventual Animagus, morally ambiguous, and reasonably powerful fem!Harry. No bashing.

** Hm... I mean, a chapter should be as long as it needs to be to cover what the author wants to tell. I usually don't like overly long chapters because, in my experience, they often lack structure and the author ends up including many unimportant scenes or overexplaining things. It is often a sign that the author can't distinguish between important and unimportant details/scenes. That said, there are also authors who do a good job of it and keep their readers interested. Basically, it comes down to how well written your story is. If you think the opening chapter needs to be 12k long, then that's the way it is. If it is a good story, I doubt readers would jump ship because of it.

** I've got a few chapters that have gone over 10k words. I think as long as you're keeping the action focused and not trying to cover too much for the sake of word count, it should be fine. I find that with the serial nature of fan fiction (posting chapters as they're completed), that longer chapters tend to be more satisfying to readers--they feel adequately rewarded for the wait. I know some fics I've followed have updated with like a 4k word chapter and I'm like, "Is that all??"

** Anything over 10k is pushing it, especially if you're using scene breaks. Reading fatigue is a thing, and there's is a psychological difference between reading 2 5k chapters or 1 10k chapter, even though the only difference is presentation. Also keep in mind that canon chapter lengths are for the most part under 5k, except for book 5 which average like 6.5k for some reason

** My rule for chapters is advance main plot incrementally, complete tertiary c subplot(an incident that is introduced and resolved in that chapter), and intro/advance/complete b plot(a multi-chapter subplot)[e.g., harry has top cow's darkness ability. Incremental advance, he practices a spell. B plot, he studies leather types for an auror satchel, c plot, he introduces Bingo to the school]. If i can do all that in 3000 words, fine. If it takes me 150,000 words, that's okay too.

But, take in account the other chapters you've written. Try to be consistent in size. Take in account how much you're writing about. Is this chapter too much plot-wise or word count? Can it be changed to multiple chapters without issue?

** How long is a piece of string?

Chapters should be as long or short as necessary to be effective. There's no hard and fast rule, though I find that breezily toned pieces seem to work best with shorter chapters and dense, literary works, longer chapters.

** I like chapters around 20K words. Chapters that are longer make the fic feel like it is dragging. Shorter chapters break the story up too much and cause a distraction. One of the criteria I look at before I read a story is the size of the chapters. I've found that fics with shorter chapters are more prone to be bad fics. So if i see a fic that has 60K words and 30 chapters i'm not going to read it. That's just me though, others might like the shorter chapters.

** Personally I'll say this: Too long chapters can be a pain to scroll through, in case you stopped reading and then wanted to find the place where you were, so with multi-chapter stories it's better not to go overboard (do try to aim for 10k words per chapter or less, as that is the equivalent of 20--30 pages depending on the print). With one-shots, however, people generally go into them all at once, so going above 10k words is perfectly fine ... for as long as you don't go to really high values where it's obviously that the story should have been split into chapters, like that one above 100k story I saw one time that was all in one chapter and did not play nice with the browser because seriously.

** I tend to look for the overall lengh of the fic but I prefer shorter chapters (3k to 5k is my ideal). In my experience, long chapters are usual in fics that drag a lot (explains in detail every minute of the main character live or tells the exact same event from two different perspectives without being neccesary).

Actually, if the fic is on-going and it only has one or two chapters and I see that are 10k long, I tend to pass on the fic. Why? No really sure...

** It depends. The first chapter should be longer to help catch readers interest, 4.5-8k words. After that, I would aim for 3500-6500 words. This is because you want chapters to be easily digestable for a reader, but at the same time long enough that they feel satisfying. A 10k long chapter might be great for someone already invested in the story, but keep in mind it's really hard to stop in the middle of a chapter due to the medium. If it's too hard to pick your story back up after a break, people are likely just to drop it.
