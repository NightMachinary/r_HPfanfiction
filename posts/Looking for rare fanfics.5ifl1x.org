I have read a lot of Harry X Daphne G fanfics but I am wondering if there are any Harry X Astoria G fanfics.

Also are there any 5th year fanfic where Umbridge is not the professor?


** I saw 'Harry X' and 'Umbridge' in relative proximity to each other, and I thought, that /would/ be a rare fanfic.

I remember seeing a wrong-boy-who-lived story where an evil-ish James Potter was the DADA teacher, and favored Harry's brother. I don't remember anything else about it at the moment, though.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** This one is pretty good: linkffn(Finding a Place to Call Home)

This is an interesting AU one-shot that has a sequel by another author: linkffn(The Kiss of a Maiden by Ell Roche)

Jeconais has [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Motivations/Motivations/][Motivations]] which is pretty good and [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Pureblood_Princess/Pureblood_Princess/][Pureblood Princess]] which is the sequel to Kiss of a Maiden, and finishes it pretty well.

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria
