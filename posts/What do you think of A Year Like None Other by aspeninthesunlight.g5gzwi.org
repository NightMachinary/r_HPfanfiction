I've been a fan of A Year Like None Other (and its sequels) for quite a few years now, and while it's not without its flaws, I've reread it multiple times, and whenever I do, it's like wrapping myself up in a warm blanket with its familiarity and intricate plot that sucks me in completely. For those of you that have read it, I'm curious to know what you think of it. If you haven't read it, it's an extremely long fic with a complicated plot where Snape adopts Harry, and that's only the beginning (but not really the beginning, because that doesn't happen until chapter 30-something).

*What I love:*

The writing style: smooth and eloquent without overdoing it. It reminds me of Rowling's style, which is part of why the fic feels so familiar. And I learned a few new vocab words, too.

Characterization: most of them are pretty spot on, and any character changes are generally well accounted for. Snape is really, really well done, as is Draco for the most part. Dumbledore is great, and while he does annoy me in places, his whimsy is emphasized just enough to make him endearing rather than straight up nuts. Ron and Hermione are great, and while they don't come off well in certain parts of the story, it makes sense in the situation, they do redeem themselves, and they're not villianized or bashed just to make way for Snape and Draco. And Remus. Remus Remus Remus. Pretty spot on, and his story arc enhances his character in such an incredible way. Overall, the author is definitely not afraid to examine character flaws or have the main characters make mistakes and face the consequences for them.

Plot: how does this author come up with this stuff? Obviously it's not for everyone, but I feel that the plot is executed extremely well, and I had the rug pulled out from under me a number of times. The plot is slow in parts, but it never gets boring, and there's a good balance between day-to-day life and major events.

Humor: I found myself laughing out loud more than once, and certain scenes have really stuck in my mind. Plenty of quotable moments to be had.

Realism: in terms of character development, not magical explosions. I prefer character-driven stories over plot-driven, and this fic has a good balance of both. Every character's story is well-developed, and nothing is glossed over or sacrificed to keep the plot moving forward. All of the focal characters have experienced significant trauma, and it's addressed very realistically and satisfactorily without anything shoved in for shock value alone.

*What I dislike:*

The characterization of Harry. That's not to say he's out of character, but he comes across as younger than his age in some situations, and he's a little too naive and people-pleasing for my taste. Some of his behavior, particularly the people-pleasing aspect in regards to his new family, is understandable due to his upbringing (the Dursley's abuse doesn't go beyond canon levels, and it's given the respect in deserves, as what canon Harry experienced is horrific enough on its own), and that aspect of Harry's behavior is addressed in the sequels, but it felt to me like a bit of a copout on the part of the writer, as though, looking back, they realized Harry was acting too immature and clingy, and came up with a way to explain/resolve it. I don't actually think that's the case, but it just wasn't fun to read Harry acting that way. Part of this is just personal preference- I prefer seeing Harry as a bit more intelligent and independent than that, and it may not bother everyone. Harry still has plenty of backbone, he does become very powerful, and he retains a lot of his snarkiness, but something is missing for me. This is my main issue with the story.

The glorification of Draco- and I don't mean in the usual way. The writer is really good about holding him accountable for his actions, his flaws are well-developed and examined, and his turn to the light side is very realistic, in my opinion. What bothers me is that he's made to be extremely intelligent, as though he's second to Hermione in terms of grades, and he's good at basically everything, magic-wise. In comparison to him, Harry often comes across as unintelligent and uninformed. Some of this is justified by the fact that Draco grew up immersed in magic while Harry didn't, and Lucius being a very exacting father who taught him magic beyond the Hogwarts curriculum. Even so, it feels like too much. One thing that really rankles is that he's shown to be nearly as good as if not on par with Harry at flying. Canonically, he's nowhere near as good; why can't Harry have this?

So that's about it. What are your thoughts?


** Oh I love A Year Like None Other too, I regret to say that I haven't read it in a while but it's still in my subscriptions on ao3 hahaha, but it is a very well written fic and it was an amazing read

** I stopped reading after a plot point in the third installment which just kinda ruined everything for me. I initially thought Harry having memory loss could be an interesting perspective of him viewing the development of Draco and Snape in a more objective way, but It just went on way too long, and I got tired of it. Up till that point though I enjoyed it very much, and I still reread the first two!

*** Yeah, I agree that it went on (and is still going on) for way too long. It was useful in addressing certain unresolved issues, but once those were dealt with, I started getting really impatient. It doesn't stop me from continuing, though. I'm too invested. I think part of the problem is that the third installment has been in progress for literal years, so it makes things drag even longer.

**** That's very valid, the pace of chapter coming out is slow enough that what may end up being a small section of the story in the long run feels like it's the entire story. I'm disappointed to see it's still going on though. I was thinking about rereading but I guess I'll keep holding off.

** Sorry to mini necro this but I feel like I can air my qualms about this fic without being inundated by rabid Aspen-stans.

I've been reading this fic for years. When I first read it, I thought it was amazing, and I'm realizing it was because I was just... really young? Then I started getting older, reading more, developing my own skills as a writer, and started to notice stuff about her fic that was bothering more and more when I would return for rereads.

I could probably go on forever but I'll bring this down to 5 points.

1. Much like you're bothered with the glorification of Draco, I'm bothered by the deification of Snape. He's not a real character at this point. He's had three books to develop and actually change, but he hasn't. He started mildly bitchy but from day one he was ready to be a father, somehow, and has stayed at the same level of perfect fatherhood ever since. He's too good. And this newest installment that's trying to absolve his Wizard-Nazism past with "you needed to do it, otherwise you wouldn't have been able to save me!" is probably the weakest pitch I've seen? Like the problem is that Aspen doesn't allow him any actual room to be bad. His intentions are always perfect; his actions, while questionable, can always be justified somehow. Even when he's a Death Eater, he's "spotless", because he never does anything bad. There's nothing complex or problematic about him; no actual problem that they have to overcome. There's that contrived, made up one Aspen made up for the sake of pretending Snape needed a redemption arc even though she's never built him as any other than picture perfect and blameless, and of course, the "pay off" for that was as anti-climatic as one could expect. Her Snape is just boring. There's nothing about him that causes the family dynamic any actual strife; nothing about him that makes me think he's anything other than the avatar for the Perfect Father. It's annoying to read.
2. The background characters aren't people. Period. I think she already struggles characterizing her main cast, and the people who get this worst are the side characters. I never understand them as anything more than set pieces to push plot points forward, or mouthpieces for the author. I've never had a sense of them being actual people interacting with the world, but rather actors that sit backstage until it's their turn to step on stage. I don't know anything about them; what are their desires? Their ambitions? Their goals? Their anxieties? What are *they* dealing with right now? I don't know, because their lives are so focused around this one, insular family that they aren't people. And it's getting worse.
3. The depiction of trauma. Like just as someone with PTSD it bothers me because she clearly doesn't know what she's doing and I don't know if that's due to a lack of earnest research or just no experience with trauma herself, but when I read this I don't see Harry as a person dealing with trauma. He gets symptoms but he never struggles with anything. He goes to therapy but Marsha isn't a therapist, she's an author stand in, so there's no actual trauma work done. The closest that it's come is with this new "tapestry" stuff, but it wasn't trauma work, lol. It was Aspen talking to her own character to advise, to say "you need to radically accept this", when no therapist worth their salt would ever, *ever*, try to force you to be okay with something you aren't. That's not the point of trauma work. He never confronts anything. He never has any, genuine struggles with his own past, other than really brief encounters with bad dreams or "memories."
4. The Amnesia Plot. I thought this plot was going to be about deception and being forced to confront difficult aspects of ourselves that we prefer to keep hidden, but it isn't, lol. The catalyst of the event is a footnote that Harry just, upfront, accepts with no bad feelings. Oh, you got my parents killed? Oh but wait, this could be a possible conflict that means you made a bad choice, Snape, so it wasn't /actually you/, it was this entity outside of you that did the thing YOU did in the books, so you're innocent! No problem! I, Harry Potter with no positive memories of you, accept this radically. Lmao. I realized rather quickly this was her second shot at trying to redo Year. Her second shot at reliving her glory days of building a relationship between Harry and Snape, and it was so much less interesting this time.
5. The outright rejection of Harry being allowed any curiosity of his parents, his family, or just who he is outside of Snape. This one breaks me because I know people who have been adopted -- sometimes, no matter how happy you are, you still want to know things about your biological parents. And Harry never asks. He has a billion people around him who have known his mom and dad and he never asks a single question. Never asks for a memory. Never asks for anything. And part of me thinks it's because Aspen seems to view them as a threat. Even when Harry is going to meet them for the first time, he's not allowed to. The author places this restriction to where he's not allowed to actually get to know his parents, and then they ultimately serve as author mouthpieces to tote the pro-Snape line instead of having complicated feelings about the idea of their only son -- the son they had stolen from them due to death -- has another family without them. Sirius is about the only one who gets a realistic reaction, but he's categorized shortly as a "hater" and has to be chastised and be forced to see the light. Aspen just cannot allow Harry any other close parental relationship to anyone other than Snape, because I guess if Harry does, it means less or something? It makes no sense to me and I really don't like it.

I could probably go on forever (Maura/Narcissa debacle, the issue of 17 year old Harry acting like a child 95% of the time, Harry's life being non-existent outside Draco and Snape, etc) but yeah, I won't. I don't hate Aspen and I don't think she's a bad writer. She was one of the people who inspired to me write. But it kind of feels like she's stuck in this phase of being a writer and hasn't developed in the 15 years she's been doing this. It's really sad because this used to be my favorite fic and I can't read it anymore. I get really upset sometimes; newer chapters feel like they're mocking my intelligence and it sucks. I really want to like this fic. I'd really like closure on it, see where the story goes. But I can't.

So I wish her the best of luck and I hope things develop better as Family reaches its end.

*** I actually very much agree with a lot of your points, but I think I tend to overlook them because I've developed some sort of nostalgia for this fic, not unlike how I feel about canon (to a much lesser degree). I first read this fic when I was pretty young, too, and before I had written anything of my own. My overall evaluation in this post was mainly based on Year, rather than later installments, where things start to get really weird, with the amnesia and the Maura/Narcissa debacle (although I am curious to see how things will go with Narcissa).

#+end_quote

Yeah, I get that feeling sometimes. Doesn't stop me from reading, but still. Compared to Year, the plotting and twists in Family are lackluster.

I've definitely noticed the issue with Snape. I didn't mention it in my post, but your comment clarified things a bit for me. It bothers me how, even when he does mess up in the fic (i.e. in a moment of pique, he tells Harry he doesn't deserve to be his son, which is just about the worst thing you could say to a kid who's never had a family, has just been adopted, and is still feeling insecure about the whole situation. I haven't forgiven Snape for this), he's not really held accountable for it. They talk it over, but I don't get the sense that Snape really understands how wrong he was, and it's never brought up again. There are a lot of moments like this, which is why I don't fully agree that he's written as the perfect father. Or maybe, the author has attempted to write him as a perfect father, but there have been so many moments where he was pretty awful and not held accountable that he doesn't come across that way to me. I very much agree that his backstory is clearly engineered to justify what he's done in his life, and in that moment when he and Harry finally address the catalyst for the amnesia, things fall flat.

About side characters, I think it's more that they don't get enough screen time to have their own stories rather than them not being people. They get just enough screen time to push forward the plot centered around Harry, Draco, and Snape, and there's no room for anything else.

And the PTSD. I think she has some hits and some misses. In some ways, Harry's behavior does reflect his trauma (like his insecurity, people-pleasing behavior, etc) but in other ways, he's just too...fine. This bothered me from the beginning. He recovers way too quickly from the torture at the beginning of Year, and I don't mean physically. And I absolutely cannot stand how childish he is. To me, it's the absolutely worst thing about this fic, and it would be infinitely better if Harry acted his age and grew a little backbone. He's improved somewhat in Family, but not nearly enough; the dynamic is already established.

Regarding the amnesia plot, I also get the impression that Aspen used it to redo Year or fix aspects of it that she regrets, but it's been dragging on for way too long. It feels like a quick fix for issues that could have been dealt with in so many other ways. The storyline in Family with Harry trying to accept Snape's Death Eater past is just really odd to me. Like, I see what she's going for, but there's a difference between learning to accept the good and bad aspects of a person, and trying to convince yourself that the bad things are actually good.

With Harry's parents- I think Aspen did try to address this issue. In Year, there was a time when Harry was conflicted about referring to James as his father, and Snape addressed it, but you're right that Harry doesn't give them much thought, overall. That seems to me more of an oversight on the author's part rather than intentional erasure.

To sum things up, the fic has a lot of flaws that are hard to overlook, but imo it's still an immense accomplishment on Aspen's part, and it's one of the best written fics I've come across.

Thanks for your thoughts, it was interesting to hear your take on it- that's exactly what I was looking for when I made this post.
