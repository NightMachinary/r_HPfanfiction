** From a reader's standpoint, I think one of the more important aspects is balancing the power of the two universes. Don't make Harry a God above the Asgardians, but also don't make Harry useless against people like Iron Man or Cap.

You could also look at the timeline closely. HP is set in the 90's, Avengers in the 2010's. If you change it so that Harry's timeline is moved forward 20 years, make sure it's all clear and concise.

This ties in with the first point, but I don't think Harry's magic should solve everything. Iron Man's suit Shouldn't suddenly be god-like because of magic.

But above all, if it's compelling, none of what I said matters.

*** Almost everything you said, exactly. I've written previously about power balancing in crossovers, but all you need to do is fold both world's power levels together. The Harry Potter and the Avengers universe both have distinct power leveling built in. For example in the Harry Potter universe somebody like Sally-Anne Perks would get roflstomped by Voldemort in a fight; trained, powerful wizards (see Sirius, Snape, etc) have difficulty controlling werewolves; and even within the Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix there are almost clear delineation of 'power.'

From there all you need to do is go "how does this equal out to the [crossover universe]?" Look at the X-Men universe for example. Let's take Sally-Anne Perks and put her up against Magneto. Hell, put her up against Nightcrawler and she'd have issues. Similarly, a character like Bellatrix Lestrange would probably be caught upside down and inside out by someone like Legion, but would absolutely have no issue with somebody like Jubilee.

So the proper, and the best, way that authors approach meshing Harry Potter with other worlds is to simply fold the two power leveling structures together. Each world will already have their own, and they're actually quite easy to line up next to each other. Harry could probably banish Samwise Gamgee to the other side of the Shire by the end of the last Harry Potter book, but Saruman would probably fold Harry in on himself for fun. Hermione Granger would probably be teaching at Xavier's Institute, but Wanda Maximoff could leave her drooling on the carpet with a second thought. Voldemort could probably give most of the Endless a run for their money, but Death...? Well, I think the books already answered that.

** Like the other person says, don't make Harry too powerful or too weak. I personally prefer Harry to be written as accurately as possible and I think it works rather wel. Harry has a huge advantage with things like apparition, all kinds of fighting spells and ways of disguising himself or solve simple problems. But on the other hand, he doesn't have the physical strength that superheroes like Thor and Captain America have, so that makes him vulnerable and evens it out. You could also think about to what extent magic works against people. Can he use it against anyone, or are people like the Hulk resistant to magic to a certain extent like giants and dragons are?

Secondly, the Avengers movies are well known for their humour. Combining that with Harry's sass and wit and the whimsy of the Harry Potter books is great.

And lastly I would say, don't copy paste big parts of movies. I see this happen a lot. Harry gets added to the team, but thefic still has the dialogue from the movies and Harry's presence barely changes anything. Think about what Harry being there changes. How he would interact with the other characters.

I suppose it would also be worth thinking about how Harry's magic compares to Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch. I don't like them much, because their powers are practically unlimited and Scarlet Witch especially doesn't have to put in any big effort to make tge most ridiculously powerful things happen. I like that magic in the Harry Potter books has limits and that can create really interesting situations.

Generally, the Avengers movies are fun, action packed, funny movies with interesting characters. A big baddie that needs to be defeated and some drama between team members. Then we have Harry, who is a fighter, needs humour in his life and is a great leader with a saving people thing. It's a good mix for a fanfic. Just think about what his goal is in the fanfic, and what is stopping him from achieving it? How does he end up joining the Avengers and how does he get along with the others?

One of my favourite fics so far is 'A New Man', but it's sadly been abandoned. I loved how Harry entered the Avengers' dimension in which the books exist and he needs to use magic to prevent SHIELD from hunting him down.

**** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11196345/1/A-New-Man]]

Unfortunately it's only a few chapters long, but I liked the premise. It's only the beginning of a story.

** No one wants to read Iron Man 1 and 2 with Harry Tacked on, hell other than the Avengers movies try and keep Harry rather separate from the others. About as separate from the others as they usually are. Send Harry off to do other things, like fighting Giant Monsters (There are Hundreds in the Marvel universe), Vampires, Werewolves, Demons, he can even just go fighting regular old Villains like the Atlas Foundation who are Desendants of Genghis Khan looking to take over the world and continue the Mongol Empire, or The Deathwalkers a Quintet of Black Mages who focused their powers around the 4 elements of the ancient world and seek to sacrifice the entirety of humanity and have even joined together into a giant monster call Deathwalker Prime. Now compare, Harry standing around casting ineffective spells while Thor punches Malek it. Or Harry casting spells fighting off a group of Mages flinging around fire and stone.

Remember every Avenger is supposed to be so capable, yes even Hawkeye, that they could probably take out the STRIKE Task force from Cap2, with little to no sweat. So if Harry is going to be the usual 5'6" and 135 lbs that he is in fanfiction, remember Magic is a great equalizer. Normal humans and other non Big Bad guy mooks should be child's play for Harry just like they should be for Tony in his suit or Cap or Hawkeye. Even if you have Harry be closer to the average try and prevent no Name jobbers from posing to big of a threat to Harry just like you won't have them pose a threat to anyone else.

Pairings are easy way to suck fun out of a story buy just making it Hermione. People treat Marvel as if there is only 2 women in the whole world as well, Black Widow and Scarlet Witch... But again with a little help from the Wikia, you can open up some more interesting pairing options, like Lilith Drake aka Dracula's Daughter who travels the world trying to kill her father off for good. Or Namorita who is the cousin of Namor the ruler of Atlantis. Hell if you want to don't break from the MCU, you have Sif, Darcy, Christine Everhart from Iron Man 1 and 2, Agent Maria Hill and that's just the movies and not counting Agents of Shield.

** Don't re-use the film dialogues. Each and every crossover I've read use the same lines like blah blah ''I'm always angry'' And pretty much all of them, no matter how OP the MC, canon stays the same, avoid that.

** Don't abandon it.

Change things up. No one wants to read a story where everything happens exactly as in the movies just with a 'Harry was also there paired up with X'. Abuse the living hell out of the butterfly.

Do some comparisons with the existing Marvel magic systems.

As many others have said, don't make Harry weak nor overpower him. The HP magic system is quite insidious. They have all forms of mind control and manipulation. Apparition and portkeys make escaping very very easy. Especially if he isn't against a magic user. Also the big effect spells with explosions and fire.

Lastly and this is just my preference, don't add Hermione. That's probably the main reason I read crossovers.

** Look at some fanfics on how the authors chose to use a particularly powerful wizard in battle. If Harry is powerful, stop making him yell out spells like a monkey and use non-verbal spells in conjunction with charms, transfiguration, curses and manipulation of the environment around you.

If you want an example, look at the movies in the final battle against Voldermort vs Dumbledore, and look at the cave scene where Dumbledore manipulates a raging firestorm and kills hundreds of zombies.
