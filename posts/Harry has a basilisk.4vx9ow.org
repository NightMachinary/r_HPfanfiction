  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

*** Sounds like fun...damned that topic made me want to snark:

"So do I - it's usually hiding in my pants!" :D (sorry, I just love flippant humor like that - others might call it childish, but I love sass!)
