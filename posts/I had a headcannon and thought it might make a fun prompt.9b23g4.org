Okay, so my thought was, Dumbledore is insane (it's been done I know) but in this everyone knows it. He has severe dementia, and alzheimers. The whole cannon books are his delusions. In reality Voldemort is dead, killed by Dumbledore himself. The fight leads to his current mental health. They keep him in in Hogwarts because he just keeps getting out of the old folks home and coming back anyway. He believes harry is the chosen one, but really Harry is just his actual grandson. Everyone knows he's crazy but plays along anyway because of his sacrafice.


** "Back from another training?" Ron asked, fixing Harry with a knowing look.

"Yes. Today was the story about the orphanage again." Harry sighed, sinking into the common room's couch. "You'd think with exams in the next few weeks Healer Bridgeworth would try and contain him, but it seems he's reliving something he doesn't want to talk about. This is the fourth orphanage story in as many weeks."

Hermione looked up from her essay, chewing on the end of her quill thoughtfully. "Has he told you the name of the orphanage?"

"No, not yet," Harry admitted, pulling out his Defense textbook. "Why?"

"Well what if the orphanage was a building he couldn't save during the Final Battle?" she countered. "Or maybe he had friends who worked there and they were killed somehow? You know there was a lot of devastation in Muggle London during the Battle."

"Do you reckon he should try and drag it out of his granddad?" Ron asked, pausing in his own schoolwork to look at his friends. "If it's that traumatic..."

"Maybe," Harry said, shrugging. "In any case, I have got to study for this DADA exam. Maybe if we had a decent History teacher we'd know the significance of the orphanage. You'd think Professor McGonagall or Snape would know."

Hermione nodded and returned to her parchment, scribbling in the margins.

"What, is that draft number three?" Ron teased, flinging a Bertie Bott's bean at her pile of books.

"Sod off, Ron," Hermione groused, flinging it back to him without looking up.

Well, slightly out of character, I think, but here's a quick stab at it. I hope someone enjoys! (This has not been Brit-picked.)

** "I see you've found the Mirror of Erised," Grandpa Albus suddenly materializes out of nowhere behind me. The razor clatters to the bathroom floor tiled floor with a resounding echo not quite loud enough to diguise the... manly shriek I emit.

"Um. Hi Grandpa. Didn't see you there."

"The Mirror of Erised has a way of consuming our attention," he nods sagely at the bathroom mirror. A beard of white shaving cream and a long white beard reflecting side by side.

"That and you were invisible," I mutter under my breath as I examine my chin for cuts.... and hairs....

"I've been watching you for quite a few days now-"

"What?!"

"-And while wiser men than you have succumbed to the temptations of the Mirror of Erised, I urge you to not allow yourself to obsess over what you see. It does not do to dwell on dreams, and forget to live."

"It's not a dream. There's really facial hair there, I swear. It's just taking me a bit of time to locate it, that's all."

"The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow-"

"What?! You're taking away my bathroom mirror?! I can barely keep the mop on my head under control with a mirror, never mind brushing it blindly! Is this because I didn't thank you for your Christmas gift yet? I'm grateful. I really am, Grandpa. It's a lovely jacket-"

"Invisibility cloak," he corrects wisely.

"Right. Invisibility cloak," I agree hurriedly. "Can't even tell it's me with the hood drawn up. The point is, I didn't thank you, because you didn't sign it. I thought you were going for the whole Santa Claus thing. And even though Hermione told me Santa isn't real, I didn't want to ruin your fun. But I really am grateful for the... Invisibilty cloak. Please don't take away my mirror!" I beg from the bottom of my prepubescent heart.

"I understand, Harry. It's difficult to part ways from the Mirror of Erised. After all, how could we not want to keep our deepest desires close? Here, have a lemon drop. Let's discuss this calmly."

"Er, I just brushed my teeth... I was getting ready to go to sleep actually..."

"What do you see when look in the mirror, my dear boy?" Grandpa Albus asks as he plops down onto the toilet seat and pops a lemon drop into his mouth.

"Errr..."

"Perhaps, you see yourself with the loving family you have never known?," he watches me sympathetically.

I glance awkwardly at the mirror again. Where I can see both myself and Grandpa sitting behind me. "Um... I see my family...." I answer tentatively. I'm sensing another uncomfortable orphan speech, where my Grandpa tells me I have no living relatives left...What we do for family, ey? Entertaining their notions that they don't exist.

"I see my loving family," I affirm more confidently. "What do you see Grandpa?" I ask in return. And it feels like our own little secret handshake for 'I love you's. I smile affectionately at his reflection, and imagine him smiling at mine.

Grandpa Albus nods solemnly: "I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks."

​....

"Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get a single pair. People insist on giving me books."

...Right... So he didn't like the gift I got him for Christmas either...

** Would probably be cool to have the POV alternate between McGonagal trying to curb his more destructive behaviors and Snape who is still trying to remove the old man by enabling him in the most harmlessly embarrassing ways possible, primarily by telling Dumbles the various plans "The Dark Lord" has that can be stopped by Harry.
