So I'm on Reddit and I get this notification that Grow Young With Me is updated. I'm on cloud fucking nine as I open the app only to find... nothing there is no update and I'm really fucking sad now


** No idea why that happened, but I'm sorry! If it helps, I am working on the next chapter and hoping to get it done by the end of October.

**** It happens because every time that an author makes a change in a chapter and save that change, the app send a notification that it has been updated. The only reliable way that I know that a fic has been updated is if I have an email at the same time

No pressure though, clearly you have a full life just like everyone else and should live it the way you need and want to.

But I am /so/ excited. You've been writing such a lovely story.

*** Grow Young With Me is the only Harry/OC story that I've ever enjoyed.

I haven't once felt like the drama and angst was manufactured and the pain Harry is going through feels genuine. I honestly bring myself to question whether you know what it feels like and, if you do, I sincerely apologize. If you don't, bravo. If you do, you've done an excellent job translating it to the page.

Abigail is a wonderful character. A true /Original Character/ in the best way. Not a Mary Sue, but somehow perfect for Harry Potter.

This latest chapter. The wedding. My. Fucking. God. Perhaps the best singular chapter I've ever read in one of my favorite stories of all time.

Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll wait, and everyone else will as well, as long as we need to.

**** I'm very fortunate to receive so many positive comments from people, and I never take that for granted. But yours, in particular, is one of those that really struck a chord with me. Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. I can't express how much it means to me, but it means a lot trust me. Thankfully I've never had to go through what Harry does in the story, but I've made it my mission from the start to stick as close to reality as I could. And I'll continue to do so.

Also, so glad you liked the last chapter. It was a difficult one to get just right, but I was satisfied with the result. It's good to know others feel the same!

** When a fic is edited in any way, its "last updated" date changes. That might be what happened?

My habit to do small quick edits of posts forever after publication is probably going to make some people really annoyed if that's the case and I start writing fics...
