:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for this series of fics I remember. It's about Harry being sorted into Slytherin, he has a snake that's a mentor for him and transferred some of its venom to him, which helps with the basilisk. I remember Daphne was engaged to Marcus Flint, but then he dies in an attack. Harry is a wolf animagus, and Ginny eventually becomes one herself. Draco is a snake I think? Can anyone help?


** That would be linkffn(Harry Potter and the Muggle's Daughter) and it's sequels. I believe it just finished Harry's fifth year, making it 6 complete “books” with the first being a pre Hogwarts fic. I enjoy it, though it does have its own issues.

**** My main issues with it are that one: a lot of the first few books are very canon rehash. Two: some Dumbledore bashing, some minor bashing of other characters. Three: Harry and friends don't talk/act their age a lot of the time, both in terms of age appropriate vocabulary and British slang (pretty sure the author is American, judging from how they talk).

However, in its defense, a lot of the trauma that the characters go through shapes how they act. Beyond that, the author takes a much less whimsical look at how events of canon (and how their changes to canon butterfly) would realistically effect the characters. For example, Ginnys possession by the diary VASTLY changes her mental health and has far reaching consequences.

All that said, I still recommend it. It has some cool ideas, and most of the tropes it includes are done very well. It makes some pretty bold choices that tell an interesting story at the very least.

#+begin_quote
  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.
