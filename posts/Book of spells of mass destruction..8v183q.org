Harry finds a book of spells of mutual destruction in the restricted section. The sorting hat is evil and possesses Dumbledore, the mirror of erised has a demon in it.

I am looking for the fic where the sorting hat tears through Harry's mind and asks him where Circe and Morgana are. The fic has been bothering me cause I can't find it. If you know what it is called please let me know.

Edit: realized it was mutual destruction not mass destruction.


** Never heard of it, but if it's well written looking forward to reading it when someone finds it.

** It does sound familiar. I know I've read that story before. The only one I can think of is one where Harry is the Horseman of Death
