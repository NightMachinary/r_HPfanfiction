The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][Pureblood Pretense]] series aka Rigel Black Chronicles has well over a million words, but no TVTropes page at all, so I'm looking to start one. Is anyone interested in participating?

The first question is the exact page title to use, and whether to have one page for the series or one per book.

Also mentioned on Discord.


** Ok, I have a bunch of upvotes but no replies, so I guess this is something people would like to see but aren't sure how or aren't available to do. I'll just get started, then!

I decided on [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheRigelBlackChronicles][The Rigel Black Chronicles]], but for now I'll just have the one page rather than individual pages for each book. Hopefully searches for "Pureblood Pretense" will still find it.
