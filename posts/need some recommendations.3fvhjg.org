the sword of gryffindor and crack'd mirror(really wish the author finished it) are my favorite harry potter fics. so if you guys could give me a few recommendations of stories similar to those two, doesn't have to be exactly like them. Hp/Hr pairing with a good amount of lemons(fluff, smut whatever you wanna call it) and proper romance will do. oh and bonus points if you could also recommend me a story with a powerful harry XP


** Also, I really liked. linkffn(What We're Fighting For)

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

  COMPLETED Harry Potter enters his 7th year at Hogwarts ignored and friendless because his brother Daniel is the Boy Who Lived. *** Badass Horcruxes. *** Read the author note on profile before you start. Thanks!

**** I mean towards the end the story gets a bit weak but its got everything you asked for, HP/HG pairing, "romance", harry is smart which then leads to him being "powerful" but not in the god like fasion.

there is character"Bashing" but honestly its required for the plotline, in cannon harry is abused by the Durslys in Unsung Hero he's just ignored by his parents who favour his twin brother that gets all the fame and attention and lords it over harry. Its worth reading if you haven't already. Give it a go and post back when you're done!

***** sorry to say unsung hero wasn't as good as i thought it would be, it felt slow and the whole ideal of harry being viewed at as some sort of dream crushing reality that constantly shows everyone a truth no one is willing to accept(with the exception of hermoine), to a point where it annoyed me. so i tried out what we're fighting for mainly because the summary intrigued me and HO-LEE SHIT, that was outstanding. ending felt a bit content weak but damn, that story was freaking good. i'm going to give vox corporis a shot since i've been hearing good things about it, even though the summary can't be any more vague.

** Pretty much anything by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/881050/cloneserpents][cloneserpents]] (who wrote both those stories) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1223678/canoncansodoff][canoncansodoff]] will fit the bill.

** You'll need a Ficwad account to read it, but I think [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun]] by Vanir would float your boat. Gloriously NSFW.

Summary: Harry escapes Britain, and learns the truth about the weirdest heritage ever. He learns stuff and gets some girls, too. There is much to experience in the land of the Midnight Sun.
