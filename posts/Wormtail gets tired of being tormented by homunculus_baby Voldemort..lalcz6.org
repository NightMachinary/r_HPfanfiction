After a long verbal abuse session Wormtail randomly apparates in front of a house and drops baby Voldemort on the doorstep. As he walks away angrily, he doesn't even notice the address, Number 4, Privet Drive.

** Love this, I'm all for weakened Voldemort combusting on the spot because of Lily's sacrifice, reinforced by Petunia's blood protection, being harmful to him :)

*** Well Moody is in a trunk and Dumbledore would be part of the people that don't trust Wormtail.

**** That depends on when it takes place. Moody gets attacked on the last day of the summer holidays. Means if it hapens before that point Moody wouldn‘t be in the trunk.
