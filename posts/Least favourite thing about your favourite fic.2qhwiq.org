** The man-whoring in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] gets a little skeevy at times. Mostly it's all in good fun and very funny, but there are a couple times when Harry and Sirius are edging close to the line between Lovable Rouges and Misogynist Pricks.

******* I'm by no means making a big stink over it. I'm just stating my opinion: removing a person's memory of a sexual encounter, even if it was consensual, is a bit too close to rape for me to be 100% okay with it. The fact that it was a casual throwaway comment actually makes it worse because it trivializes what they're about to do. And really, the fact that they're going to be obliviating them isn't really the worst part, because Sirius clarifies "We're just gonna memory charm them of the things they're not supposed to know." however at the end of the scene he also says a bit later "You mind if I get the camera, since, I mean, you're already going to be obliviating them..." Which I thought was not okay.

That doesn't mean I'm hating on the author or the story nor am I just some SJW with a stick up my ass. I've repeatedly said nonjon is in my top 5 favorite authors and A Black Comedy is my favorite story overall.

******* If you look in his authors notes repeatedly throughout the chapters Lesswrong says he can't spend time writing HPMOR unless his charity receives money which is then used to pay his salary during the time he takes off to write the story. You pay the charity, the charity pays him, you get chapters. This is well known throughout the hpfanfic fandom and one of the main reasons the story and author gets so much hate. He is asking fans to pay him for work. This is illegal and violating copyright law as well as the tacit agreement JKR has made supporting fanfic authors on the condition they do it for free.

Pretty sure he started writing it to get more people into rationality. He doesn't derive any direct financial benefit from it. His organization might, but it would be hard to tell whether it does.

Why do you have such an issue with this though? Just in general? I see an issue with selling fanfiction, as that is selling a good which shouldn't be allowed with fanfiction. I don't have an issue with people paying for an authors time in which they write fanfiction.

******** This is not asking fans to pay for his work. Pretty much everyone writing fanfiction has a real job they need to concentrate on first.

It's also not what I've seen him do. It seems like he gets time off from work to write HPMOR because its popularity brings more people into rationality and by extension LessWrong which leads to more popularity for the ideals it and he espouse. Which leads to more notoriety for the charity and more donations.

I've never seen him say he won't write or be able to write or publish a chapter unless X amount is donated. That is bad. What I've seen is him saying that "the charity gives him time off to do this work". Which is a financial decision that I guess makes sense from their perspective. And though I've never seen him say it, it makes sense that he wouldn't be able to write unless he gets paid for time off. Simple financial decision.

I'm not sure whose behavior you want to change here. His behavior for publicizing the facts of his financial and time commitment situation? He for taking money from the charity for time off which he chooses to write fanfiction among other things? The charity for giving him money to write fanfiction?

All three. Firstly, the way be publicises the charity is done in an incredibly scummy way. He could easily say "oh if you like these ideas consider supporting the charity I work for that promotes them" but instead he says "i'll update quicker if we get X amounts of donations". Secondly, he doens't get time off then choose to write fanfiction in that time, he is given paid time off to write the thing as a promotion for the charity. Thirdly, no one should be paid for writing fanfiction.

********** Oh, I just disagree about the morality of these actions. The first one is just stating the situation as it is which I don't have a problem with, I don't have a problem with the second, that's good employers business not mine, and third, when you aren't paying for the content but the publicity it generates (almost the same thing but not quite in my mind, as he would be getting a salary anyway if he didn't get the time off to write and tere isn't a separate donation fund for writing or set goals that will allow for time off.) I don't have a problem with his fanfictoom being good or popular enough that someone is willing to pay for his time. People aren't paying for the content, as in it's not behind a pay wall or anything, which is what o would have a problem with. I don't have a problem with any of this morally and the legality is borderline. Since he hasn't been sued or asked to stop by Rowling and Co they clearly don't see it as enough of a problem.

** I've never really taken the time to rank my fanfics in my head, let alone on paper, so here's a dump of the ones that come to mind:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] - the unplanned way in which it introduces plot points and resolves them - which I feel it does well, but still they're clearly not part of the original. Oh, and some of the cliches it includes (Snape godfather, some unnessecary slash/slash implications in the early chapters, parselmagic and so on).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle][Alexandra Quick series]] - Alexandra's character in the first novel, and perhaps the overly-convoluted back-story as revealed later on (if you've read them, you'll get this).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4508571/1/F%C3%BCr-Das-Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fere-Wohl][Fur Das Grosse Whol]] - That it got abandoned before anything could really take off. Otherwise, the slow start.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1811995/1/A-Sue-s-Story][A Sue's Story]] - The fight scenes dragged on a tad too long near the end. (Warning for little relationship to canon, BTW, almost entirely original fiction.)

I kinda chose slightly unusual ones on purpose, but those are all ones I'd five-star.
