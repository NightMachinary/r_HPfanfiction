Umbridge: Mr. Potter, do you expect to be attacked in my class?

Harry: Yes.

Umbridge: What?

Harry: Well, I mean, i'm running four for four.

Umbridge: Mr. Potter-

Harry: Quirrel tried to choke me out.

Umbridge: Mr. Potter-

Harry: And Lockheart tried to wipe my memory.

Umbridge: Mr. Potter-

Harry: Of course, Professor Lupin didn't mean it. He just forgot his potion, but still, totally went werewolf on me.

Umbridge: MR. POTTER-

Harry: And then Moody turned out to be an escaped Death Eater in disguise.

Umbridge: POTTER!

Harry: So, yeah, I figure it's 100% you'll attack me in June, 50/50 you'll try to kill me, with a 25% chance of an Unforgivable curse.

Harry: (turns to Hermione)

Harry: Did I get the math right?

Hermione: Yes.

*** I'd write Harry then like so:

“That is exactly why your presence here is so appreciated. Truly Professor, it is a blessing that you would grace us with your wisdom after long years of atrocious lessons and danger towards my classmates and me. Excuse my restlessness, but please understand it is a natural reaction at this point. I'm sure I'll ease up a bit over the next weeks.“

After class hes gonna ask whos up for pranking her into a mental ward.

*** That makes no sense. Moody was a very decorated ex-Auror, Quirrel was a teacher for years before his post to DADA. Harry was explaining why statistically Umbridge is most likely to harm Harry, not explaining how positions in society affected that.

**** And Umbridge wouldn't let Harry explain that much. She'd tell him he was disrupting the class, and send him out.

She wasn't interested in facts. She was interested in squashing down Harry's narrative about Voldemort. All she'd say was that that showed how Harry was a very damaged little boy who Hogwarts had failed, and who had a history of being a troublemaker. Both Lockhart and Quirrel were respectable people, before Harry either killed them, or brain damaged them. Conveniently, there were little to no reliable witnesses, either.

  With the DADA professor for 1996-97 being unknown, Dumbledore assigns all returning students a summer essay, “What I have learned in DADA while at Hogwarts”. You wouldn't believe the approach Harry took, as some people are finding out, much to their shock

****** Doesn't werewolf Lupin 's instinct being to hunt, and kill mean that it would probably actually be 75%. I just copied & pasted what's up there, but considering that a werewolf's psyche is basically hunt & kill, i'd say that qualifies as intent.
