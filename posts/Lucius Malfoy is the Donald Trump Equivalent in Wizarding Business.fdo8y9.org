Inherited a wealth from family, puts his names on a lot of things, invests badly in businesses that often fail, and somehow proclaims himself to be incredibly wealthy though he refuses to open his vaults for anybody to check.

A lot of naive people believe his claims, but those with any sort of business acumen are suspicious of him.


** Does canon suggest that Malfoy is a bad businessman? A lobbyist, sure, but driving his companies into bankruptcy?

*** Malfoy isn't really a businessman in canon - rather, he is Old Money, unlike Trump: though Trump did inherit his wealth, it only goes back a few generation - he doesn't qualify as Old Money.

Malfoy seems more the type to be unconcerned about mney except in the influence it buys and the prestige it gives, but he certainly isn't going to /work/ for his money, That's what peasants do.

**** As you say,money buys influence and prestige. But all that stops if the money is ever lost. So I think old-money types like the Malfoys are very much focused on their money, or at least preserving it. Even if they go to a lot of effort to pretend otherwise, and put up the facade that it's beneath them to be concerned about it.

Somebody who's old-money and who doesn't treat that as a pose, and who really is indifferent to money, finishes up broke - exactly what happened to the Gaunts.

*** He went to Borgin & Burkes to sell stuff, not to buy it. That implies he needed quick cash (probably for buying the Nimbus 2001's for the Slytherin team) and was selling off heirlooms for it.

Not exactly the sign of a wealthy businessman there.

***** Selling it leaves open the risk of Borgin and Burkes ratting him out if they got raided.

So it does sound like he was mainly motivated by the risk of a Ministry raid,like he said. But at the same time he needed the money so wasn't taking the safest option of simply dumping the stuff.

**** Plenty of wealthy people in the real world live on credit, as their assets are illiquid. If the magical world doesn't have an advanced finance system then he may not be able to get credit as quickly as we can and so occasinally have to sell/pawn stuff. In the real world of Ye Olde Dayes even the most wealthy royalty did that.

** Stop involving President Trump in every shit. We non-Americans are tired of this.

And he is President of a powerful country and a billionaire, so he must have done something right. Only 45 people managed that feat, which I know almost none on this sub can achieve. So stop saying Trump as a failure.

As for your question I don't think it mattters Lucius was a bad investor or not, as he most likely bully his partners and steal their money as compensation.

*** I never claimed he was failure, just that he was bad at business. Otherwise, his core businesses of hotels and casinos wouldn't have had to declare bankruptcy six times in ten years.

Also, it's not a question, it's a prompt. I want to read something where Lucius is just bad with his money, since in canon, it's always something he relied on to buy power and influence.

Between 1985 and 1989, when the economy was booming, Trump's apartments, hotels and casinos lost 359.1 million; when the economy flagged in 1990-91, those businesses lost 517.5 million, and then lost an additional 286.9 million during 1992-94, when the economy was bouncing back.

In fact, his hotels and casinos, parts of his core business, declared bankruptcy six time between 1991 and 2009.
