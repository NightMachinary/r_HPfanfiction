Alright, so I kind of want to see any fic that exists that flips the WBWL genre on its head. To be more specific, I'm wondering if there are any fics out there, from Harry's point of view mind you, where Harry is the main character and is proclaimed to be the BWL, while the real B/GWL is sent to the Dursleys or neglected or whatever the fuck. Do any of these exist? Keep in mind, Harry has to be the main character in this, it has to follow his perspective.


** Ooh, ooh, I know one for once!

It's called The Substitute where the Potters attacked at Godrick Hollow were decoys. Been a while since I read it but I remember enjoying it, though it's a bit dark.

*** That wasn't what I was expecting from the same guy who wrote linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff). But that was really good!

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
