I downloaded the fanfiction.net app, but I can't find the story I'm waiting to update on the website. Is the app not legit? I found this and other story links through this Reddit that redirect to the website so I hope someone here can help me.


** Every fic should be there - I've used it for years and haven't had an issue - could be some minor delay thing (minutes wise) but I've never not been able to find a fic

Are you saying a fic you found on the app is not on the desktop site? Or is it the other way around?

What fic are you looking for?

*** It was Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts, I couldn't find it on the app, but searched by author and found it thanks to another reply.

** I sometimes find it easier to find the author via the app then get the story from there.

The app has everything from the site. The only part i have noticed is different is the PM's they dont show up on each other.
