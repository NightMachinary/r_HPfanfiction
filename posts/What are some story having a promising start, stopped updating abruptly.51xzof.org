Basically what the title says. I'm meaning stories which stop updating without indicating a clear sketch, not stories which stopped updating at midpoint. Here's few examples comes to mind:

Diadem - Linkffn(9105154)

Death Before Dishonour - Linkffn(10724650)

Whiskey Time Travel - Linkffn(11233445)

It'd also be fine if you think what some one shot/short story needs a sequel. For example:

Expectations Linkffn(5797888)

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The Girl-Who-Lived won; Magical Britain never recovered. As their world grows closer to another war, the surviving DA members concoct an elaborate plan that will see Iris Potter back in time to guide her younger self and prevent the war from ever happening. Fate however has other plans. GWL BWL, dark!Harry, timetravel, canon magic.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

  Self preservation was a powerful motivator that sometimes made good people do bad things. At least, that's the excuse that bad people who think of themselves as good, give to justify their actions. Harry Potter wasn't sure he'd ever been 'good', but he knew he was good at being bad. He just always thought, that the ends justified the means.

  It's funny how important timing can be. Take the case of Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem, for instance. Decades after being destroyed to rid the world of Voldemort, the Diadem is found to be much more significant than previously thought. With war looming on the horizon, an infamous but youthful Harry Potter is sent on a desperate dimension-hopping gambit to replace it with a new one.

  When Unspeakable Harry Potter wakes up in 1976, he determines he's either A: In the past. Or B: In a mental hospital. At least the firewhiskey still tastes the same. Waiting tables at the Three Broomsticks, drunken death eater bar fights, annoying an attractive but pushy auror, and avoiding his mother's crush on him is just another day in the life of Harry Potter, 1976

  I've written a good chunk of the story already, but unless you want me to just post the conclusion, you guys are gonna have to wait a bit longer.

It's basically a way to say he's leaving. He may return in two years or so. But until it happens, I doubt he'll. I have seen lots of writers say stuff like that & doesn't return.

**** I always give the author the benefit of the doubt. And even if he stops writing he doesn't really owe us anything. Anyways I hope he continues writing.

** I really enjoyed Breaking Habits linkffn(8988776) . Unusual pairing, pretty well written. Little bit of Ron bashing which is annoying but otherwise I was interested to see where it went, then it didn't. Also I agree with people about Belial666.

  Dumbledore gives Harry an offer he can't refuse. A year at Hogwarts without constant whispering, life-threatening situations, or Voldemort. How? By taking a trip to when Marauders were still faithful and 16. !Um, make that one out of three!
