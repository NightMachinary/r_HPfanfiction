*** My belief is that every one in the Harry Potter world has a magical core. The power inside the core determines Wizard/Squib/Muggle. And it also determines the core of your offspring. The reason why Muggles can't brew potions is that the potions require magic to activate.

I think different potions require different amounts of magic, so a Squib might brew a Boil-Cure Potion, put a Polyjuice Potion would be to advanced.

  It is often asked whether a Muggle could create a magic potion, given a Potions book and the right ingredients. The answer, unfortunately, is no. There is always some element of wandwork necessary to make a potion (merely adding dead flies and asphodel to a pot hanging over a fire will give you nothing but nasty-tasting, not to mention poisonous, soup).

***** Okay but that's a muggle. A Squib has magic just not enough to handle the intensive wand work required for the subjects like Charms, DADA, Transfiguration etc.

Now while I understand this came from Pottermore there is not one single instance in the books where a wand was needed in potions. In fact, in Snape's opening speech he specifically states "there will be no silly wand waving".

So with those two points I would lean towards that a Squib can make a potion but a muggle could not.

****** African wizards and wizardkind around the world before the invention of wands by the Romans made potions without wands. You want to know how? Wandless magic. Just because Squibs can pass /Muggle/-repelling spells (magic acts on symbolics and Squibs are, in the popular way of thinking of wizardkind, different from Muggles) does not mean they can perform magic, which potions are, which Squibs cannot do. Snape also meant no /unauthorised/unneeded/ wand-waving when he said 'foolish wand-waving'. Do you really think someone who created his own spells would think wand magic overall to be foolish?

******* I can see your point however As far as I can recall there is not one single use of a wand for a potion in the entire 7 books. In fact, the only time a wand is used in potions is primarily when Snape uses it to vanish a potion or repair things after they have gone wrong.

And there is nothing written in any of the books that says anything about how much magic is needed to activate a potion/ingredients. So we have no idea of whether a Squib (who does have magic) has enough magic to activate a potion/ingredients. Seeing that they can enter Diagon Alley, are not turned away from muggle-repelling charms, can see Dementors, use a floo, and can take a potion without harm, etc., it is likely they have enough magic in them to make potions.

In terms of "foolish wand-waving" that's your interpretation that Snape meant no unauthorized/needed wand-waving. Once again there was no use of a wand to activate a potion or potion ingredients in the books. There may have been stasis charms or some auto stir etc used (canon/fanon blending together) but nothing that I can remember where a wand was needed to make a potion work. And yes when it comes to Snape's area of expertise (as the youngest ever Potions Master) I do believe he thinks wand-waving is foolish when it concerns potions.

There's a big difference saying that wand-waving in it's entirety is "foolish" versus saying that wand-waving is foolish when it concerns "...the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes...". I believe that Snape was referring to the latter in his speech.

******** u/Impossible-Poetry:
#+begin_quote
  I have been asked all sorts of questions about Squibs since I first introduced the concept in ‘Chamber of Secrets'. A Squib is almost the opposite of a Muggle-born wizard: he or she is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent. Squibs are rare; magic is a dominant and resilient gene.

  Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students. They are often doomed to a rather sad kind of half-life (yes, you should be feeling sorry for Filch), as their parentage often means that they will be exposed to, if not immersed in, the wizarding community, but can never truly join it. Sometimes they find a way to fit in; Filch has carved himself a niche at Hogwarts and Arabella Figg operates as Dumbledore's liaison between the magical and Muggle worlds. Neither of these characters can perform magic (Filch's Kwikspell course never worked), but they still function within the wizarding world because they have access to certain magical objects and creatures that can help them (Arabella Figg does a roaring trade in cross-bred cats and Kneazles, and if you don‘t know what a Kneazle is yet, shame on you). Incidentally, Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.
#+end_quote

Basically, magic is conceptual and recognizes that squibs are not muggles, even if both do not possess magic.

Edit: Additional evidence for squibs being unable to make potions is the spell course Filch did. One of their claims was teaching squibs to make a specific potion.

#+end_quote

That's the thing, though, they aren't repelled by /Muggle/-repelling charms. Those are meant for Muggles born to Muggles. Wizards, for the most part, accept Squibs as part of the wizarding world because they were born in it and have knowledge about magic. This translates into spells targeting Muggles not targeting Squibs because they are seen as 'different' from Muggles by almost every magic-user and so magic, which works largely on symbolic, doesn't affect Squibs when asked to affect Muggles.

#+begin_quote
  can see Dementors
#+end_quote

No, they can't. Rowling said on her website that Mrs Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry, but because of her knowledge about the wizarding world, she was able to identify the feeling caused by Dementors (which Muggles can feel, too).

So can a Muggle. It's the powder which is magical and reacts with the fire, it's not a spell, just like a Muggle can also consume a potion safely. People without magic can be affected by magic and can use magical things which do not need inherent magic to activate like a Portkey set at a certain moment or Floo Powder or a potion.

Also, Kwickspell wouldn't be considered as a complete sham if Squibs could be taught potions at the very least, but they can't. Squibs are Muggles born to wizards and are simply able to not be affected by Muggle-repelling spells because their social situation makes them to be widely believed to be inherently different from Muggles.

** What if the squib is John Constantine who is wandering America during his “American Gothic” phase of Alan Moore's Swamp Thing? Maybe according to JKR rules he is a squib which is why he has to use a different magical system. Maybe the aging potion is some eldritch magic and Constantine while he likes Harry and feels bad for the kid, has his own reasons for helping him.
