The war was over but now Harry was at a loss for what to do.

He sits watching a sunset over a peaceful world and suddenly a red bird tackles him out of nowhere.

He wakes up in a cupboard. 18 years old, full of ackes and pains, as if he'd rarely moved.

He was back in the dursley but he was a grown man.

He finds out 1 Fawkes can speak and 2 he is in a reality where voldemort killed the whole Wizarding [British] world.

Harry has all the broken horcruexs with legendary items to fix.

The goblet makes Infinity liquids lime wine and stuff. [You pick] and Harry is now in "Harry Potter the game 2 or NG+"
