Thus far in a fic I'm writing, I've been using the premise that the Dark Mark tattooed into the DEs arms was not very well known about based on Fudge not seeming to recognise its significance on Snape's arm. Then I remembered the Mark was recognised and feared at the quidditch World Cup at the beginning of the book.

I've decided to go with Fudge was a dunce to not realise and perhaps, while the Mark itself was well known, no one considered a known Muggle hater to take a leaf out of the American Old West and brand his followers like Muggle cattle. Any thoughts?


** Can't go wrong assuming Fudge is a dunce.

** If I recall correctly, Sirius also doesn't recognise the significance of Karkaroff showing Snape his arm. It seems that the use of placing the dark mark above houses was a well known and feared calling card, while the branding part isn't known until the second war.

*** That's right, I forgot Black didn't know either, but I'm fairly certain if Snape or someone brandished it under his nose in an attempt to prove the Dark Lord's return, he would have understood the significance. Thank you for reminding me and validating how I was handling the Mark in my fic. My headcanon is the Mark looks quite a bit cooler than it's depicted in the movies. I've seen lots of tattoos featuring skulls and/or snakes that were a lot less... disappointing than how the movies showed.

** Fudge was actively denying Voldemort's return from the get-go. He also saw Cedric Diggory's corpse and ignored the significance of that. He knew what the Dark Mark was, but if a literal murder victim was not enough to convince him that Voldemort was back, a tattoo of the Dark Mark on one of Dumbledore's professors certainly wasn't going to.
