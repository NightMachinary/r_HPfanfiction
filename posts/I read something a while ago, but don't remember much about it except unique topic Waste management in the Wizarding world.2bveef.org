There was a chapter or two about the waste management of the wizarding world. There was a crisis because when things are vanished, they have to go somewhere. And they had been using the same dumpsite for centuries. The potions ingredients had had been interacting badly for a while, and were about to be a bad enough problem to get the ministry to move quickly. So they call in our heroes.

I can't recall anything else.

Any ideas about what I'm thinking of?


** My only problem with this, is I could swear I remember McGonagall in the books explaining that when things are vanished they go from a state of "being" to one of "unbeing" not put somewhere...

I don't know which story you are looking for though, sorry.

*** It's in book 7. It's the riddle McGonagall answered in order to get into the Ravenclaw common room. Her answer was that the object went to a state of unbeing which is to say into everything.

**** Then I can forgive a story with its own explanation. Most of the best HP FF's were written before 6 and 7 came out. Most of the best were written before OotP even.

***** I think so too. Once we got the whole story and all the mysteries and realationships became more or less answered and/or apparent that wild inspiration of the early fics seemed to waver quite a bit. Although I imagine my nostalgia and being a kid/teen also has something to do with how I perceived the quality of fics back then compared to now .

** I'm rereading "Visited by the Doctor" a HP/Doctor Who crossover and this sounds like something that was dealt with in some of the earlier chapters:

Here's a link to the start of that part of the story: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4922483/14/Visited-by-a-Doctor][Click ME]]

*** That looks like it. Thanks!

I thought it was straightforward HP, not Xover. But this is it. Thanks!

** I read that too, I think... it involved Harry eventually learning to enter the place where they Vanish things to, as a kind of parallel dimension?
