What's your opinion on Snape and how he's portrayed in stories. I'll say I think he's an arrogant man child.

How many do you think Voldemort killed? I've always assumed it was a good percentage of the already small wizard population.

Do you like stories that improve the education at Hogwarts? I like those rare few that don't bash the school but instead use the castle to its full potential.

Wand holsters hip or wrist? Many have the wand shoot out of the holster, How many times would the person miss the wand and drop it. Hip holster on the other hand is secure and easy to get to.


** 1. Snape is a petty and vindictive man and I'd honestly describe him as pathetic. I'm fine with that but not the trope where he finds out about Harry's home life and does a complete 180 which is very unlikely.

2. I'd estimate that the number of wizards in Britain to be around 1000 considering that there is around 300 kids at Hogwarts on average per year. To be honest Voldemort probably killed more muggles and death eaters then wizards since he only personally killed when they were an important figure opposing him (Rufus Scrimgeour for example). The number of kills including muggles and wizards range in the hundreds considering he had enough corpses to make an army of inferi to guard the horcrux locket.

3. I don't really understand that question

4. We already know arm holsters exist because Grindelwald had one in FBCOG (we couldn't actually see it because he wore a coat, but he summoned his wand from within his sleeve so I'm assuming he had a holster of some sort). I'd say arm holsters are more effective because you'd be able to draw your wand much quicker then having to physically reach to your hip and retrieve your wand, plus I doubt you'd drop it after enough practice.

** Oh, I so love to give my opinion of things.

I truly, sincerely, despise Snape in canon. I don't feel/read him as a redemptive hero. He's as bad as Bellatrix or any other Death Eaters. And instead of getting out of the repercussion of his illegal, murderous activities through money and lies like Malfoy, he got out thanks to Dumbledore's convoluted plans. Just like Karkaroff, he doesn't have the backbone of Bellatrix or Crouch Jr. either, and thus hides from repercussions by acting as if he didn't do anything and a lot seem to just go with it. Beyond everything (and I believe before even becoming a DE), he's a truly bad person. He's just awful. And I don't care what convoluted explanations of spy work people can work out: he is a man who take joys in bullying children to the point of becoming their greatest fear. He isn't a hero. No one forced him into becoming a DE or into taking pleasure in bullying every child who stepped in his classroom. (And, no, there is no way he is a good teacher, let alone the greatest). So I just don't get how he's constantly whitewashed in FF, just because he loved Lily. Big deal, really. Lot of people probably loved her at some points (Harry probably would have adored her if Snape didn't relay the prophecy and play into her death). I hate how he's shown as this great man who checks out every kid for abuse when in canon he's literally their abuser. I mean, most of the time he's even shown as being a better man than Dumbledore (and I don't like Dumbledore. He literally raised Harry for slaughter, but he's still leagues above Snape in the morality playground). It is never shown that he ever regretted being a DE. This is the man who only asked for Lily to be spared and was OK for her husband and newborn child to die. He isn't the one and only DE who somehow didn't partake in all the criminal, murderous activities of their gang. He isn't innocent at all. And, no, his age doesn't spare him of the consequences. Especially when he uses his second chance to be as awful as he can to innocent children. There is no Snape redemption, there is no evolution. He's still a petty, nasty, awful man stuck into the mentality of a teenage bully.

I don't feel like his canon persona even works out. It's always him acting in shadows as the magical Child Services, constantly going against Dumbledore, of all people. When he never ever cared about anyone but himself.

I feel like Voldemort must have killed a lot of people. As TMR, he spent a summer just killing his whole family in cold blood while framing it on his victim. He totally moved on from Myrtle's death even with her ghost literally haunting the school (and I do believe that it was somehow accidental, but, really, I've accidentally killed bugs and felt guilty for weeks afterward, I wouldn't cope if ghosts were involved). So, yeah, he's got a happy trigger (I think that the phrase?). And the whole splitting his soul thing must have accentuated this trait. That and his dramatics, his madness and the fact that the DEs and their own murderous tendencies probably egged him on even more. (And that would explain why people were so terrified decades later and why whole families disappeared). (See, that's also why I believe Snape got as much blood on his hands as any other DEs. He's truly nothing special that would explain how he got to be in, but somehow not partake in the murders?)

I truly love the different looks on magical education. It's probably what I love the most about the stories staged in different schools. Or why I love time travel stories, too. The look through the ages, through different headmasters working through thoroughly different societies in such a short time period : so interesting. And while I feel like Dumbledore wasn't the best headmaster (and that McGonagall was very far from perfection), I also feel that, beyond Harry and his adventures, it all comes down to the repercussion of war on their society. So, yeah, bashing isn't truly interesting on this point. I'd rather people show us the details of clubs, chorals, any after school activities than lose time trying to dismiss any headmaster.

I always felt like holsters were natural on the arm (after being introduced to the very idea of holsters to begin with). But this week I've read through a fic from which I only remember Harry's holster being on his thigh. Holsters were sold to fit different body parts, depending on preferences. But Harry being clumsy and always running through life defying adventures, felt like thigh was better and more innocuous than wrist. A very curious thing.

*** Yeah, but Snape risks his life to serve as a spy without any apparent benefit for himself. The child abuse more or less becomes irrelevant in the face of that.

**** No? That's no excuse, in my eyes, at least.

If he didn't become a spy, Dumbledore wouldn't have cared for him and he will have become a fellow prisoner of Azkaban. That's a pretty big benefit to/for himself. If there wasn't the threat of Azkaban, I'm not sure he would have stuck with Dumbledore (but, to be fair, he will have sought out to avenge Lily's death in some way---so, perhaps it would have been more “productive” in the end).

I also have a very different view of his relevance as a spy as is most common on this sub. I don't see how he's supposedly in extreme danger from then on. On the contrary, he's living a rather pampered life in Hogwarts, knowing that he has Dumbledore's protection. He's a guilty man who gets handed more chances than even innocent ones (Sirius rotting in Azkaban for a decade, Harry living through hell from the moment he's dropped in Petunia's street...).

And I know that people like to imagine him as a very successful spy during the second war, but we're really not shown that at all. He's not very useful to the Order, he even worsen the morale at a crucial point. And I feel that if he truly wanted to help, he wouldn't have spent the Occlumency Lessons taking pleasure in torturing Harry even more, and would have taken the time needed to actually teach (but then again, that man wasn't made to be a teacher). Who knows how that year would have ended if Harry had tools to actually fight back against Voldemort.

And I don't think that if at the last minute Bellatrix decided to be a spy to get spared Azkaban/to bargain someone else life, without knowing that Voldemort would ever come back, she'd be awarded the same leniency. Especially if she then spent decades bullying children for the hell of it.

Hell, even Regulus who saw his error and died trying to stop Voldemort isn't shown the same mercy.

So, sure, very tragic. He died, too, in the end. He will have died in Azkaban or by his master's hand anyway. His contribution is meagre at most, and his legacy is his fucking over a whole generation of children.

I mean, I have less difficulty having more regards for Narcissa lying to Voldemort's face (selfishly), or Draco in the end, than I have for Snape, who freely and consciously made all his terrible choices. Even Slughorn comes of as more heroic, less despicable as he is and he's the perfect incarnation of Slytherin.

(Also, it's war, they all risk their life. It doesn't somehow excuse his awfulness in times of peace. The literal children he bullied took stand against adult wizards and fought for what they thought was right and it wasn't done for anything else than believing in a cause. They could all have fled, dropped out of school, go to any other school. But they stayed. They fought. They fought wizards with so much more power and knowledge and experience they could never dream of gaining. They lost lives. They saved lives. They're heroes. They're the reason the “light” side ever won. Compared to that, well, Snape doesn't stand the comparison. At best, he decided to risk his life to avenge himself and Lily, if we want to be generous. But he's never the bad guy who saw that the dark side was bad and decided that the light one was good. He saw the dark lord take something he wanted and decided to try his luck with the other powerful guy to get his personal revenge. He is never shown having changed ways.)

But it's also only my opinion. Which isn't worth much or more than anyone's else. And if anyone wants to read him as a hero he isn't, fair enough. I've complained about the fics where he serves as the magical Child Services (and you probably agree that it's as far as his canon self as can be, I assume) and I still read fics where he plays out this role. Sure, it doesn't please me the most, but if it's how some people want to show him, I'll just pretend it's an OC and carry on and I'll leave kudos and comments and all such.

I feel like these points can be debated as nauseam, but if you've read canon one way, you won't be swayed to reading it to the contrary (and I'm saying that for me, too, because I know that after all the fics I've read where Snape is a pseudo saint---like, whatever the contrary to bashing is---I've still not changed opinions on canon Snape, so, shrugs). These debates are a lost cause (and, to be fair, some of the poster here have a much better handle on the English language and a better knowledge of canon and fandom than I do and would be much more interesting to discuss this with than with me haha).

***** He sticks to the plan after Dumbledore dies though. Like a lot of your points are ignoring that he legit comes around to the side of good. I don't see how you can be sympathetic to Draco and Narcissa but not to Snape, though I def agree Regulus and Slughorn don't get enough credit.

And yeah, Snape isn't AS good as the others who stuck around, but that's kind of irrelevant, and the vast majority of people didn't actually fight anyway.

***** I love Snape to bits, yet I agree that he's likely just as guilty as any other Death Eater from the time before he turned spy. I see his canon redemption as plausible but unsatisfying, and that's why I turn to fanfic to fill the gap.

However, I'm a little concerned about your insistence that Snape takes pleasure in bullying/torturing Harry. We see the entire series from Harry's point of view and do not know what he was feeling most of the time. Especially this moment here:

#+begin_quote
  spent the Occlumency Lessons taking pleasure in torturing Harry even more
#+end_quote

At that point Harry is still grieving for Sirius, upset at the tyranny of Umbridge, frustrated by the Ministry's denials, and generally acting even more angsty than fanon!Snape. Since Voldemort is likely to cross-check whatever he sees directly from Harry with whatever Snape reports, I find it shocking that Snape was tapped by Dumbledore to give these lessons at all, and I'm amazed Snape was able to keep his cool for as long as he did with Harry being a nosy hothead who looks just like one of the people who made Snape's past miserable.

So if you want to take a more objective view of Snape, a good first step is to stop assuming he /enjoyed/ his role as the petty git. He was under intense pressure to keep Harry safe while keeping his cover, and I rather suspect he was having a boatload of traumatic flashbacks with the uncanny resemblance to James Potter. For an Occlumens who can go up against Voldemort, that better explains why he would remove the memories he chose to remove during those lessons.

Which just makes me admire him more, to have that kind of self-awareness. A git, maybe, but a brilliant git ;)

****** Eh, that's fair ! My first post was posted pretty fast to begin with, just for the pleasure of giving my opinion haha. And while my second was more reread since someone took the time to respond, it's late here and my English isn't the best. So, I know that when I say he bullied a whole generation, for example, it wasn't the literal whole. He probably also gave the silent treatment to most students, if they weren't standing out like Hermione or poor Neville, say, and some went unscathed.

(And it's funny that we have such different experience of fanon character because I read him more often being such a weird snob having tea time with Narcissa than being angsty).

I do agree that the whole Occlumency thing was a whole mess, from start to finish. But I still feel like he was being needlessly cruel and unhelpful the whole time. And maybe he didn't take pleasure in it as much as I think---after all, he made clear that having to be in Harry's presence was the bane of his existence haha. But he's also an adult. An adult that knows exactly what Harry is going through. So, his ressemblance to his own father shouldn't be into question, you know?

(And it's true that it was another level of stupid to put the spy on this task if Voldemort could see that much? I always knew it was stupid to put them together to learn something where obviously trust would be needed while they equally disliked each other. But that part is just as mind blowing. Dumbledore's plans are... something else).

And even if we find a way to excuse his whole treatment of Harry from the moment he felt like a newborn and his father could be killed to his very last breath, it's not like he's only awful to him. We see it more in detail with him, but he's still a thoroughly toxic person that shouldn't have been left into his position at Hogwarts.

But again! It's fiction! My reading is just mine and isn't gospel. I change opinions on a lot of things (though I still haven't about Snape haha). And I don't condemned or judge anyone who likes his character. (I mean I personally love to read about Riddle in all his monstrous glory.)

I feel like it also plays out on what we all imagine is going on behind the scenes. And since we obviously all imagine different things and lives for the characters, we will obviously disagree in our understanding of them. (And nothing bad in it, diversity is good and all that).

And I don't disagree about some of these fics, either. Writers in this fandom are some of the best. They truly are champions when it comes to save characters from the canon narrative shortcomings. From Draco going on a truly redemptive path to Remus and Tonk being just better characters altogether, fandom is GREAT. And I'm sincerely happy you all have these great fics where Snape gets the glory he doesn't have (and gets botched) in canon. I'll find fics where Snape is a saintly saint taking care of every abused child under the nose of the mean heartless headmaster more infuriating than any sincere attempt at showing him as a Byronic hero (or whatever type of hero you want to show him as). In the end, as much as I've written off Canon Snape, i still try to stay open minded about his fanon versions (with obvious exceptions).

And, yeah, I'm sorry because it feels like I'm rambling stupidly and I'm not even sure anything I'm trying to say can even come across (let alone intelligibly). But I really, really, hope that I didn't come across as judging your liking for such or such character or anything. Or that it wasn't possible to read him this or that way. Because I consider your version of Snape as legitimate as mine, for example. And I'm also biased, obviously, since I don't like him. But, truly, I'm only ever mad when it's trying to show him as such a nice goody two shoes. Just like I get mad when Remus is shown as an angel when, for me, he's nothing at all like that. Or, even Sirius, who I love!, but becomes truly infuriating when he's this womaniser who only jokes and is never cruel in words or actions. So, yeah. I hope my comments, as messy as they were, didn't come off in any way that could spoil your fun or anything. It's just a personal opinion, badly stated at that, and I'm truly not looking out to spoil anyone's fun.

******* No worries. Not badly stated at all. This is the most interesting conversation I've had in a long time with someone who doesn't like Snape. So thanks for that. The complex ambiguity is what /makes it fun!/

And we seem to be on the same page with how the Occlumency lessons were a disaster in every way. Whether or not Snape took any pleasure in being awful to Harry, they should not have been forced together for those lessons in the first place.

I'm with you on the Marauders too. Every character had their flaws. That's what makes them so interesting! The utter toxicity of Sirius with Severus is why I've dabbled in shipping that pair. Even the often-wholesome Lupin/Tonks... I see shipping Lupin and Tonks being /very/ similar to shipping Snape and Hermione, and I've got them double-dating in one my fics lol.

I have to wonder if you'd like the versions of Snape I write, which are generally canon-compliant but often EWE because I like the idea that he survives and mellows out. I cannot link my most compelling fics due to breaking the rules of reddit and this sub... Since you like monstrous Riddle you might like the tragic dark angsty Snape in my one-shot /My Whole Existence is Flawed./ There's also a fluffier post-war Healer Snape in my 5-chappy /Fridays I'm In Love/ ... My [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][AO3 profile]] has everything I've published including these. I will absolutely /not/ be offended if that's a /hard no/ but I figured it doesn't hurt to throw it out there :)

** Snape is the most compelling character in the series, and that's why all my fics are Snapefics :)

"Kill the spare" suggests there could be a LOT of killings just because they were too close or in the way.

YES. I try to write Hogwarts this way. A place of magic and mystery (abandoned classrooms and hidden passages and forest critters and secret artifacts and on and on) and educators who are passionate about their subjects.

Wrist holster with a little magical assist so it only takes a tiny flick of the wrist to quickly draw and securely sheath that wand.

Edit: For real with the downvotes just because I like Snape... At least I didn't make you read an essay titled "Why Snape?" and got on with answering the other questions in this /opinion/ post. Don't y'all ever get sick of reading why Snape is such a piece of shit ad nauseam? Jeez.

** Hm, I dislike Snape in canon. I don't see anything inspiring about his character, anything worth admiring, and I'm always surprised why so many people seem to love him. In fics (at least those that I've read), Snape doesn't exist most of the time. He is replaced by fanon Snape - less intense, less cruel, smarter and more understanding than he was ever portrayed in the series (or just bashed if the author doesn't like him).

I don't think I ever read a fic where Snape's portrayal made me believe I'm reading about Snape and not an OC who resembles him and use his name.

How many people Voldemort killed? Do you mean personally? If so, I don't think he had killed as many as people like to believe. The wizarding world isn't big, and even in the series, we don't get lots of names of people who were killed by Voldemort himself. I'm not saying he was a saint, far from it, but I believe he let his minions do the job for him, while he took care of those he had found truly threatening, or who had "hurt" him personally.

Stories with the goal of improving Hogwarts usually fall flat. Some authors seem to think improving Hogwarst mean to bash Dumbledore and the rest of the staff. Hogwarts has many problems, but I prefer the imperfect version of the school, over the "improved" I have seen in fics.

No wand holsters :) and if I have to choose, I would go for a hip or thigh. A wand pinned by something on the wrist sounds rather uncomfortable. It's a piece of wood - it would cause more trouble and pain than it's worth. I mean, stick a ruler against your wrist and see how comfortable it is :D
