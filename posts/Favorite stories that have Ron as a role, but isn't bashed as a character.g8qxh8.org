Just looking for pretty much ANY stories that feature Ron Weasley, that isn't bashing. Sometimes they'll say it in the summary, so I'll ignore them, but sometimes they won't be in the summary at all and it comes off from nowhere.

Ron doesn't have to be the main character, he can even be a very minor character, I don't care, I just don't want him bashed in anyway.

Now a character pointing something out in Ron, is perfectly fine, if there's a reason and he tries to change himself, but needlessly bashing him just isn't fun for me.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash. Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual (Doesn't have to be a pairing)

Can be on ANY site, can have any warnings, anyone can be the main character.

The plot can be anything, I don't care, I just don't want Ron Weasley bashing.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

No Harem Harry stories.

It's Harry-centric, but Ron's a really good friend and there's no bashing (if you don't count Harry sometimes lashing out a bit because he's having a rough time, but he doesn't mean it). He's an absolute angel in this fic

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
