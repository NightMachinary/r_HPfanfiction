Fics where Harry is proud of what he's done. Like killing Voldemort, the Basilisk, etc. etc. A little touch of arrogance is fine too.


** I feel like HP Book 5 was literally this, I must've read him saying "I did this and I did that" a dozen times in that book..

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** JaimeJabs' linkffn(13123652). It is the first story that came into my mind when you mentioned arrogance. Harry is downright narcissistic, but in a funny way.

  I am not what you think and life isn't always sweet to me. But I know, I will always carry that single magical moment with me, even when I'm broken. [A love story of a broken prodigy and a beaten down flower.]
