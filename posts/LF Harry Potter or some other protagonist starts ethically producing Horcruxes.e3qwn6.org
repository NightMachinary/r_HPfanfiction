Like, finding people on their deathbeds who can't be helped and offering their descendants money in exchange for being killed to make a Horcrux. Or even reworking the spell so it doesn't require human sacrifice.


** I think the lack of remorse and the tearing of the soul being required to make it work is kind of an issue for the deathbed route working ethically. Like I think the implication is you have to do it evilly to rip your own soul apart.

Finding a better way though, you know how they say a piece of you remains with your loved ones? Maybe a love based anchor could work better, where you exchange part of your soul willingly with people you love and who love you in return.

This route also has some potential for reviving Lily using Harry

*** I interpreted the ‘tearing the soul' thing to be metaphorical, if souls exist at all in wizardland. Like, you've gotta kill people. The kind of person who'd do that's already going to be deranged, and magic itself seems to like tropes and symbolism, so it also damages the mind and perpetuates that mindset, turning someone who just murders for the Horcrux into a psychopath. I do like stories that explore what exactly having a soul means, though. It's a fuzzy concept, and we can't know what it would be like in real life to have a soul, so putting down some rules for what they are and do would be interesting to explore. Or maybe only magic people have them.

**** I think a good element of HP style magic is the intentional conflation of the metaphorical and the literal. So one of the few things we actually know about souls in HP /is/ that they can be ripped apart by remorseless murder.

I really wish we could've spent some time on what people are like after receiving the Dementor's kiss. I guess we know it's something like execution, and Barty couldn't(?) give any testimony once it was administered. But I think they say they can still walk?

Here's basically all I can find:

#+begin_quote
  "Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you'll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no . . . anything. There's no chance at all of recovery. You'll just --- exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost.”
#+end_quote

Maybe you can still follow orders? But even that requires some kind of intrinsic motivation. Maybe you can seek out food and eat it and lie down when you're tired? Because those are very body-based motives instead of self-based?

***** That's certainly /said/, sure, but we don't /know/ that. It could be that people just conflate what happens with the creation of a Horcrux with the Dementor's kiss. After all, these are very different effects. Ripping apart a soul turns someone into a psychopath, apparently, and Voldemort had very little left and was still himself, if twisted and insane. I'm pretty sure Rowling meant Dementors to be a metaphor for depression, which fits with the description of someone who's been kissed. Permanent, super, magical depression.

**** The primary difference between "killing" and "murder" is intent. Intent is a major component in most moral systems, so you might need to be more specific about which moral system you would use to judge the ethics of the hypothetical intent in this case, and thus on which occasions (if any) the intent behind murder could ever be considered ethical.

In my own headcanon, I like the idea that making a horcrux doesn't just require "murder"; it requires an act that is intensely morally abhorrent to the person committing it (an idea which is expanded upon in the fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest][Blood Crest]]). Thus creating a horcrux requires the intent to commit a morally abhorrent act however the perpetrator defines morality, in which case there are no circumstances under which the intent could be considered ethical by the perpetrator.

That could leave open some interesting possibilities with mind magic, though. For example, Confundus or Obliviate could make someone temporarily believe that a 'killing' they are about to commit is a 'murder' abhorrent enough to split their soul, but after successfully creating the horcrux they could restore their memories/personality to 'normal' moral reasoning, thus making them realize that the 'killing' was actually 'ethical' and not something they should feel remorse over.

** There is suggestions (I think by JKR in interviews) that it is not only the intent to murder someone, but also acts of cannibalism what is required in order to truly fracture the soul and split it.

Even if somehow you ethically "murder" someone - the act of ripping your own soul apart - there is nothing "ethical" about that. It is an abhorrent act that no sane person would ever do.

*** Depends on what souls actually do, really. They don't seem to mean all that much in the Harry Potter universe. We know they're disconnected from mental functions, since you can be tortured into insanity or otherwise suffer brain damage, so at the very most they're containers for someone's life experience and personality, in which case it's perfectly ethical to rip apart your own soul so long as you do your very best to never die---and with magic, your very best can be extremely effective. That's leaving out the whole murder aspect to it, so ideally you'd find someone you truly hate, and then you'd ensure they had a soul too; muggles might not have them in Harry Potter so it'd have to be a witch or wizard to be safe. That should ensure the magical cannibalism requirement or whatever is meant, and then you'd have a Horcrux. The only really unethical part about the whole thing is that Horcrux making might make the user into a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbm6QnJv9dgWsPHQP/schelling-fences-on-slippery-slopes][Murder-Gandhi]].
