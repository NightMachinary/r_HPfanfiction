Story where he is given a choice to trade places with a alternate reality version of himself who was a sadist and was awful to his family who are alive and he has siblings. Have had this story stuck in my mind but can't think of the title.


** Ah, is this the one where Harry was an anti-werewolf bigot who was a jerk to Lupin?
