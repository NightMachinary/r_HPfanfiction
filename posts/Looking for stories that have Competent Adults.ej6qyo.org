I love the Harry Potter world, even if it has flaws, it's a lot of fun. But now as an adult, re reading the books makes me roll my eyes at the adults.

What about this? Dumbledore goes on the same spew about the third corridor being dangerous, but then it turns out to be a trap to whoever knows about the stone and is trying to get it. (It doesn't hurt any students who are nosy)

Dumbledore takes Harry away from the Dursley's, and has him at Hogwarts, or the Weasley's, or with Andromeda or something like that. (I'm a sucker for Snape raising Harry type of stories, but it feels like I read all the good ones).

McGonagall stops the Slytherins from bullying Hermione and the others, stops the Marauders from bullying the Slytherins, et cetra.

And other little things like that. It doesn't have to be all of that, but just something.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine

Can be on fanfiction.net or another site.

NO Character Bashing please


** Okay, here's my list of favorite fics - I think part of the reason that I like them so much is that there are responsible adults in these stories... apologies if you've seen them already.

I really love Oliversnape's work - lots of Harry and Snape interactions (some are Snarry and slash, some are just mentor Snape).

linkao3(329404)

My favorite Hermione fic is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7944847][Six Pomegranate Seeds]] by Seselt - she's totally badass and so smart - kind of like an adult in this fic. It is complete and has a sequel.

linkao3(7944847)

Dudley's Memories by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Paganaidd/pseuds/Paganaidd][Paganaidd]]

I really like this story about Harry and Dudley meeting when they are older. They are good at adulting. It is part of a series, so if you like this one, there is more.

linkao3(601542)

Harry doesn't figure too prominently in this fic - it is more about Hermione and Cedric. Cedric's parents are intriguing people in this fic. Finding Himself is about Cedric surviving the graveyard battle, but seriously injured. It is very well-written.

linkffn(4594634)

Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor is about Harry adapting after he's been blinded in a Death Eater attack. Sirius survives and is a mentor. It has a sequel.

And my own fic, Basilisk Eyes by Hegemone | T | [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16269131][AO3]] | [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13160266/1/Basilisk-Eyes][FFN]] | [[https://www.wattpad.com/myworks/208609546-basilisk-eyes][WATT]] in which Harry is blinded by the Basilisk in the chamber of secrets and then spends the summer learning new skills at the Perenelle Flamel Adaptation Center with a bunch of OCs.

** I can point you to two of them off the cuff, though one is my own work so this is kinda self-promoting.

First recommendation is the famous "Harry Crow" by robst on ffnet, though one might consider its treatment of Slughorn to be borderline bashing, and Dumbledore is made an antagonist so it's hard to say whether you'd consider his depiction bashing. It's novel-length, long-completed, and has long been one of my absolute favorite fics - Harry actually gets the support of competent adults, all of the primary and secondary characters are very well-developed (in many cases getting more depth and development than in canon), and at basically no point does anyone seem to do something solely because the plot requires them to.

linkffn(Harry Crow)

Second is my piece, "Umino Iruka and the Will of Fire" on ffnet or Ao3: It's not all posted yet, but that's because I kept a buffer of completed chapters to ensure a steady posting schedule. Now that I've finished, it updates every Sunday. Overall length is again substantial, probably ~300k words. I won't even try to claim it's anywhere near as good as robst's writing, but I try. The concept is a crossover, pulling Umino Iruka from the Naruto franchise into Wizarding Britain and having him be the adult mentor and advocate that Harry and others needed but never got in canon. I specifically picked him because he was well suited to a supporting role in events without being ridiculously OP.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

  What if, when Petunia Dursley found a little boy on her front doorstep, she took him in? Not into the cupboard under the stairs, not into a twisted childhood of tarnished worth and neglect---what if she took him in?Petunia was jealous, selfish and vicious. We will not pretend she wasn't. She looked at that boy on her doorstep and thought about her Dudders, barely a month older than this boy. She looked at his eyes and her stomach turned over and over. (Severus Snape saved Harry's life for his eyes. Let's have Petunia save it despite them).Let's tell a story where Petunia Dursley found a baby boy on her doorstep and hated his eyes---she hated them. She took him in and fed him and changed him and got him his shots, and she hated his eyes up until the day she looked at the boy and saw her nephew, not her sister's shadow. When Harry was two and Vernon Dursley bought Dudley a toy car and Harry a fast food meal with a toy with parts he could choke on Petunia packed her things and got a divorce.
