Voldemort realizes prophecies can be self fulfilling and decides not to seek out the one the prophecy refers to. He still has many groups fighting against him and multiple horcruxes that ( for the moment) no one knows about. Pettigrew is still secretly a death eater but neither the Potters nor Longbottoms nor anyone else is targeted as a way to combat the prophecy.

What happens next?


** The ministry would have fallen sooner rather than later with Barty Jr and Rookwood undiscovered it wouldn't even be difficult. Without openly targeting the potters snape wouldn't defect. With intel from pettigrew he'd keep picking off order members. It'll end up with Voldemort in control of everything but hogwarts which becomes a dumbledore stronghold. Dumbledore probably then appeals to the ICW and asks for international intervention since he has no chance on his own

** I remember one fic in which Snape justified telling Voldemort the prophecy by the fact that it didn't occur to him that it could refer to children yet to be born. He just assumed that it was referring to someone from Voldemort's period of wandering the world catching up to him. "born to *those*" could equally refer to an extended family, organisation or entire culture. The 'marking as equal' is then either Voldemort admitting that this person is dangerous enough that he needs to deal with them personally, marking them in his mind as it were, or an accident during a confrontation.

**** I believe it might be linkao3(Swung by Serafim). At the very least, similar justification as to the telling the prophecy, as it is a Snape apologia fic. Be warned, it is very long and I think the prophecy bit is closer to the end.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

**** Something similar is also a minor plot point in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). From chapter 32:

#+begin_quote
  True, the word 'born' spelled B-O-R-N would have referred to an infant, but I mistakenly thought Trelawney meant 'born' spelled B-O-R-N-E, as in 'one who has been transported or carried.' I interpreted the Prophecy to refer to a powerful adult wizard who, at the end of July, would be delivered somehow to individuals who had defied the Dark Lord on three or more occasions, most likely the Headmaster and his Order of the Phoenix.<!

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

***** Is that story ever even going anywhere? I can't remember exactly how much of it I read at one point a good while back, but I'd estimate it was in the ballpark of a ~500,000 words and it just felt like it was sorta spinning it's wheels without ever advancing the plot in any meaningful way. Now it's more than double that and I really can't decide if it's worth the effort to start it over so I can actually remember what's going on.

*** really depends.

While the war would have continued, one can debate that Dumbledore might still learn of the horcruxes or figure it out, and then take them out still.

And since there is no prophecy to account for, anyone can potentially kill Voldemort, not just Harry.

**** I'm a believer that Dumbledore doesn't realize that the method Tom used to survive was horcrux's untill he gets the diary and hears harry's story.

In my mind that first the timeline better and we see him start researching Tom's past from then on. This way he doesn't realize harry is a horcrux until he is already grown and explains his lack of progress in finding the gaunt ring.

** Voldemort's reign was completely different during the first war. He was at the height of his power and people were dying and and the general population were rapidly losing hope. The order members were being picked and killed one by one. With this rate, what do you think would've happened? Dumbledore would've put up a big fight but at the same time he had no idea about the existence of horcruxes and only learned about it after the chamber which was 12, almost 13 years later. I doubt that Voldemort would've waited patiently for that point in time even if Harry would still go through with his adventures in second year despite not being marked.

So what I think would've happened is: All in all, the ministry would've probably been Voldemort's next target to take over. After a few more years of death and destruction, in which Voldemort could or could not have taken over the ministry, Dumbledore would face Voldemort in a fight in which despite everything I think Dumbledore would've won. But Voldemort has horcruxes and too many death eaters at this point. The following year would be spent with Dumbledore and very few members of the order trying to fight a losing battle against them with the hope of setting everything right with the world. I think within that year the order might gain new members and gain some strength, perhaps setting themselves on a somewhat equal footing with the death eaters. Voldemort would resurrect within a year and then Dumbledore would learn about the horcruxes. After that I believe it will be the same war all over again as it was in the beginning of the first war until young Harry is old enough to attend school. The only difference would be that Dumbledore would've also been hunting horcruxes and Lily and James would've still been alive to raise Harry. After that... nothing is quite easily predictable. With harry being a normal boy, would he still be a Mary Sue and fight Voldemort the same way he did in the books? Would he support his parent's cause and join the order or maybe find a different approach to fightinng in this war? What would his relationship with his parents be? With Dumbledore? With his friends and Neville?

** In 'And the Wolves All Cry', Snape doesn't hear the prophecy and so it doesn't get relayed to Voldemort.

It's a wee bit different than canon.
