Hi guys. I'm looking for some good stories where Harry is adopted by anime characters. Fanfics that focus on his interaction should with them are welcome (e.g Gamer95's Harry Adoption fanfics) , also I know about Lupine Horror, Arawn D Draven and Quatermass's fics, so try and avoid those when mentioning things. No slash! The longer the better.


** Not 100% fitting maybe, as Harry doesn't actually interact with the anime cast too much after a few chapters, but there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12355543/1/One-Punch-Wizard][One Punch Wizard]] linkffn(12355543) which is a story where Harry is adopted by Saitama. It's a bit on the cracky side, so one probably shouldn't take it too serious, and it's still ongoing, but I kind of like it, so it might be worse a look. :)

â€‹

Could you perhaps share the fics you mentioned though? Just to make them a bit easier to find. :p

*** Fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087150/1]] The Devil's Beloved Pawn. Something like that.

**** Thanks! Though I was actually mostly curious about the fics you named, like the "Harry's Adoption" stuff and had hoped for an easy way to check them out without googling name and author ^^"

I'm a bit curious about such crossovers as well after all, but would prefer to see if I know the anime in question first as I haven't kept up that well with whatever is popular now. :)

In any case, good luck with your search!

** Harry is adopted by Sir Integra of Hellsing in linkffn(Death's Visage by Black-Raven3). Unfinished, but good as far as it went.

Linkffn(Bug Boy by Mrs. Insane One) is a Naruto cross that has Harry adopted by Shibi Aburame. My main complaint with this one is that Harry isn't "Harry."

Linkffn(The Potter Attraction by Pax Humana) is another Naruto cross that has Naruto and his harem adopt Harry. It's a sequel to Chunin Examination Day, which is where Naruto acquires his harem and abilities.

Harry gets sort-of (IIRC) adopted by Ryouga Hibiki of Ranma 1/2 in linkffn(Harry Hibiki and the Philosopher's Stone).

And, not really an adoption, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Ultimate Force by DarkKing666), the Norns become Lily's cousins and take Harry from the Dursleys to put the prophecy back on track.

  HIATUS. After Harry's 5th birthday, his true powers are unleashed, powers so dark that Dumbledore felt the need to bind them. Fleeing the Dursleys just before his 11th birthday, he seeks refuge with his family's ancestral allies, the Hellsings. DARK. AU Crossover

  On the night Voldemort attacks the Potter's home, a completely different person finds Harry before Sirius Black or Hagrid. Harry is found and adopted by Nermia's very own eternal lost boy Ryoga Hibiki! Soon Harry will be joining his classmates at Hogwarts but how will Hogwarts handle this kind of Harry? And how does it affect the prophecy, what is the 'power he knows not?
