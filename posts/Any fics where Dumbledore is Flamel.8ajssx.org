** I remember a fic where Xander is approached by the demon lord I forgot the name of (D something hoffy?) and he turns back in time to screw around with the genetics of Xander's ancestors, which ends up as Xander being some kind of lord of Order through Chaos? Anyway, Xander in his journey travels through the multiverse, picks up Sirius Black right after he went through the veil of death in some desert? Which turned Sirius Black into Marry sue god mode Nerf pls in the magic department? So they decide to pimp out Xander's car with every kind of enchantment they could stick at it. Back seat of his car turned into some kind of Demi-Plane? They travel through Multiverse some more and steal parts of LA, Death eater mansions, and porn shops. They arrive at HP world where Harry is fem!Harry and the secret keeper in that night were Sirius black(who was the betrayer and The rat while Pettigrew was the loyal dog). Dumbledore and McGonagall were the Flamel and his wife. Philosopher stone was just a fancy rock and the turning themselves younger and gold was just master level transfiguring.

***** I mostly didn't know who this Xander is (in my language it is a very good tasting fish) and who is this demon lord?

****** Xander is short for Alexander, who was one of the main characters in the buffy the vampire slayer sitcom. The demon lord's name is d'hoffryn. I'm texting from my phone and the auto correction is stuck in my main language.
