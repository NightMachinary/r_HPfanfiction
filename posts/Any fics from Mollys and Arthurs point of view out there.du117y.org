Especially during the time where the Trio is at Hogwarts. Something that gets the love and worry across without being to bleak.

Thanks!

**** Oops yes you are right! Honestly you won't regret it - I read every story momotwins has, she's absolutely hilarious while also being touching and gets to your emotions in a way most writers just can't do.

*** I basically accept momotwins' Molly and Arthur as canon. She is SO good.
