Read this one forever ago and want to read again. Can't remember the tittle

Hermione goes back in time and becomes the marauders defence professor.

If anyone can help me out I'd be so happy


** This happens in A Living History by MistressMalfoy. It's a James/Hermione pairing. Unfortunately, that fic was hosted on Granger Enchanted, which is no more.

** Linkffn(Pride of Time)

Hermione travels back to the time /of/ the Marauders and becomes a defense professor. She doesn't teach James and company, though. If it isn't what you were looking for, it is a good read at least!

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
