:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Years and years ago I read a fic where Harry ended up in Azkaban for some reason and the fic starts as Sirius and I think Remus go get him when he's released. I think there was a scene on a boat in the beginning but I am not quite sure. What I do remember is that Harry has become very quiet.

Anyone who can help?


** is it linkffn(1480438) Redemption?

  COMPLETE! Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.
