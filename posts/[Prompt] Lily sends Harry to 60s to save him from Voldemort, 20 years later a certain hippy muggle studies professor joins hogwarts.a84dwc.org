** Why would sending him back to a time where voldemort is in his forties and unaware of his relevance actually save him? Harry would likely oppose him still. Would he have the protection of the blood and the horcrux or would he be without either?

*** Debatable. Canonically, most of Harry's reason for fighting Voldemort was out of revenge. If he were sent back in time, he wouldn't even know about his parents.
