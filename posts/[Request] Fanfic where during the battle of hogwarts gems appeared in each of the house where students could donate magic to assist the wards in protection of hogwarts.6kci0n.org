** That's...that concept opens up so many fanfic ideas. The idea of being able to donate magic, I mean.

I mean, it'd be like donating blood, except that instead of the blood being used for research or for fixing someone else's body, it's used for strengthening construction and improving the output of machinery and otherwise a large variety of commercial and infrastructure uses.

There could be entire markets for people who are willing to sell chunks of their magic for galleons, and crime syndicates who drain magical creatures in order to get mana for cheap...

*** well people power up runes by pushing magic into it, so this idea isn't too far from Canon to believe.

Edit: also there are pepper up potions that "give" you more energy. Some fanfictions also use the idea that potions manipulate your magic to do certain things and that's how potions work. A shot of magic could be like a drug while small doses are healthy.

**** Pepper up potion doesn't give you more energy, it's a cure for common cold, it also precents hypothermia.

**** Except "powering runes" is in no way canon. There is zero explanation for runes, their purpose, or their use in other "branches" of magic, within canon. The ONLY canon uses of runes we ever see are an ancient runic version of Tales of Beedle the Bard that Hermione has to translate, and Hermone freaking out about two runes she may have switched on her OWLs.

** Never seen that before. Did see one fic where there were runes on the History of Magic classroom to suck the kids magic out to power the wards, which explained why they all fell asleep in there and no-one bothered getting them a proper teacher.

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.
