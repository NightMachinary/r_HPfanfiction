Played Straight, do you think a possible justification for the Philosopher's Stone being in the school was that they knew something was up with Quirrel before the school year started but it was too late to find a new Defense Professor so Dumbledore had the teachers set up random traps to dissuade the rest of the school but trap Quirrel specifically so they could figure what was up with him? /But they weren't counting in him having fucking Voldemort on the back of his head?!/

I'm asking because I think if Harry hadn't made it to the Mirror when Quirrel had, that Quirrel could easily waste away in front of the mirror looking at what he saw as his heart's desire. And since he's being possessed, Quirrel's desire and Voldemort's might either conflict heavily. This could lead to

A. The Mirror showing nothing.

B. The Mirror flickering back and forth between whatever Quirrel wants and whatever the Stone looks like. But likely not how to find it. The Mirror shoes what you want but not how to get it so unless Quirrel breaks the mirror (and even then there might be some enchantment there because Dumbledore said the Stone would appear to those who wanted to /find/ it but not /use/ it.) there doesn't seem like he has much of a chance to find it.

I think by the time Voldemort has figured out that he'd not getting what he wants, the other teachers would be down there and could subdue Quirrel even if they can't get rid of Voldemort.

Does this make sense? If not, why?


** My headcanon, which is even less supported by anything, is that Dumbledore lied about going to the Ministry, intending for Quirrell to tip his hand.

All the teachers would have known he was up to something after that little stunt during Harry's first Quidditch match. They just couldn't legally do anything without proof, such as catching him red handed at something.

This is why Dumbledore flew out, he really just Disillusioned himself when out of sight and doubled back in hopes of catching Quirrell in front of the mirror (which would have counted as attempted theft of the stone).

The Headmaster is the most magically-powerful person in Hogwarts at that time so it'd be the least messy fight, plus he has an excuse for being there the other teachers didn't (he's the only person who knows the last line of defense, so he's the one who should be checking on that).

He was counting on Voldemort's involvement somehow - either by converting Quirrell to his cause or via magical means. He wasn't counting on /Harry's/ presence in the plot.

** Yes it could have worked. My belief is that all the safeguards other than the mirror were a smokescreen with the mirror being the true trap. Dumbldore couldn't put truly lethal or dangerous traps in the middle of a school filled with children but the mirror wasn't directly lethal it was meant to trap the thief until dumbledore could capture them.

** Anyone who actually makes a concerted effort to obtain the stone from Hogwarts is either too unthinking to be a danger or too powerful to stop. Thus, I always thought it was all just designed to delay whomever was going to steal the stone. There's not much you can do to stop a relatively powerful magical (Voldemort getting away with robbing Gringotts) if they really put their minds to it (also, incompetent Harry and co managed to rob Gringotts too) so delaying them and keeping them in place until you can get your Dumbledorean Trump Card there is about all you can do.
