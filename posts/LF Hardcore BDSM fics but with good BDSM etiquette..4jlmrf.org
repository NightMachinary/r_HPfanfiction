Preferably femdom but I'm interested in maledom too.

I'm asking because most "BDSM" HP fics I find are more like abuse.


** Hmmm. Linkffn(safe word is devil's snare) seems to fulfill your request, but I've only read the first few chapters, so I can't tell for sure.

Not sure if you're into slash but there's "Ligabus Filium" by Tessa Crowley. Pairing is H/D.

I don't think I've ever come across well-potrayed BDSM het in the HP fandom. :/ Maybe I've been looking in the wrong places.

  It should be careful, deliberate, but it isn't. Like every other part of their relationship, it happens gradually and then all at once, before they even realize it. And when the little blue threads bind them together, there's no going back.

** linkao3(Nights Like These by LadyAmina) is Remus/Sirius, with Sirius as the sub. No sex, it's all aftercare, and it's one of the best I've read. I'll hunt tags--I'm fairly certain I've read more, but I can't think of them off the top of my head.

I can think of a few fics off the top of my head where they push limits pretty hard, but it's revealed afterwards that it was negotiated ahead of time--is that of interest or no? Fair warning: everything will be slash, as I do not read explicit het, so if you want het-only let me know.
