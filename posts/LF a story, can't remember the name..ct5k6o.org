:END:
Right in the beginning, Vernon kills Hedwig after distracting Harry with lots of chores, Harry goes crazy, and then some Blood Wards or something are destroyed. Then Remus and Snape (who are a couple, and Snape is a vampire) sneak Harry away from Dumbledore, who is SUPER manipulative and brainwashed Harry.

Remus and Snape then enroll Harry in a school of a different dimension, with Werewolves, Vampires, Demons, Fae, and lots of other creatures, and starts learning necromancy and other darker magics.

Anyone know which one I'm talking about?

  Being a gay Hero hunted by a crazy Dark Lord with delusions of immortality, a barmy old Headmaster who thinks it's his job to save the world, and the odd vampire trolling through the halls at night looking for a midnight snack isn't easy. Just ask Harry.
