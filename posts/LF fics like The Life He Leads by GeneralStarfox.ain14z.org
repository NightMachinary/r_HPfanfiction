I'm looking for more fics like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13082443/1/The-Life-He-Leads]] where Harry studies some kind of esoteric, lost, forgotten magic or magic that's thought to be nothing but myth, and the characters actually changes over the course of the story, and where the relationships between the characters feels real

​

i love that there are no jealous ron or overbearing bossy-know it-all hermione in the story

​

i feel the magic in that fic feels more impactful and powerful than the cannon magic where all they do is flinging around stupefies, reducto's, crusio's and avada kedavra

​

Please no Slash, fem!harry, Femslash or Harry/Hermione/Ginny or Daphne


** Try Cadmean Victory (rituals and blood magic)

**** It took you 30 chapters to figure out it wasn't your cup of tea!?

That sucks man.

Try magicks of the arcane. Less angsty than Cadmean Victory.

** Blindness, prince of a dark kingdom, and emerald trance are pretty good. Read them already though?

*** I've read some of Blindness, and i don't really like it , it might be because i don't like harry in it or because i really hate hermione, it's just no where near as good as Like the life he leads,

​

I don't think i would like prince of a dark kingdom, because i just really can't see harry being mentored by voldemort when he is supposed to be his enemy, and i really dislike fics where Voldemort is harry's father/mentor

​

Emerald Trance, feels like every other story where everyone walks all over harry like he's a fucking doormat, after having read Like the life he leads, i really want more fanfics where harry stands up to dumbledore and tells him what he thinks while looking him in the eye's and not backing down. one more point, i can't fucking stand snape! in chapter 4 where harry says he likes snape is a major deal breaker for me, how can anyone like snivellus!

** I guess for me I try and take each fic as a new world rather than have a preconceived idea about the original characters. But I hear what your saying.

Have you read innocent or the mind arts? Barefoot and the art of self fashioning are also pretty good. Core threads he's OP as hell but I can't remember all character interactions in that one.
