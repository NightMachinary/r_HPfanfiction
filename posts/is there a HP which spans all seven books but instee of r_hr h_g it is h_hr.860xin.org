** Literally everything by Robst. Or you could just search for that pairing, looking for completed stories.

You're asking for the absolute most common noncanon pairing. There are thousands of fics. You're being downvoted because of how ridiculously common the request is - if you know how to use FFN searches you can satisfy your request immediately.

*** But OP is looking for one of those atrocious series spanning all seventh years. Calling out OP for not searching FFN while not even reading OP's post doesn't really paint you in a good light, you know?

**** Yeah, seven-year series that are actually complete are incredibly rare.
