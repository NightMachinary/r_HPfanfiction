Another minor Dumbledore detail that I wish was used more: apparently, according to his chocolate frog card, he likes ten-pin bowling. I'd love to see that.


** Partially kissed hero has him use his scar as a map, but I've never really seen it used like that exactly. Honestly, a Dumbledore that tries to make up for Harry's childhood by taking him to random places would be the best Dumbledore.

** I wonder what year his scar is based on? The London Underground has changed over the years as new stations are added and the odd old one removed. For instance, does his Jubilee Line scar end at Charing Cross or does it have the extension to Stratford (changed in 1999)? Strand Station (closed 1994) etc etc. Or does his scar update in real-time?

*** Imagine if his scar was like the Marauder's Map and could tell him arrival times as well.

*** Well I mean he was dead by 1999 so it probably didn't change then, but a magic scar of London Underground that updates in real time is pretty f-ing cool

** I actually do remember seeing that scar mentioned in a fanfic. I can't remember its name, but I read it in the last year.

The story had a scene where Dumbledore reminisced about the scar -- I don't think he actually used it as a map. But the story added the detail that the scar was originally not a perfect match for the London Underground -- it was missing one or two lines. So Dumbledore had later gotten a tattoo that filled in the missing lines with ink.

*** I want to see a Dumbledore who goes through abandoned classrooms and other chambers in Hogwarts randomly playing music. Of course, he'd be ecstatic when Harry finds the Chamber of Secrets so he can play music there too!

Yes, I know that's not what "chamber music" means, but it's a wonderful image.

**** That could be what it means in the wizarding world, where things are sometimes taken literally as what they sound like and then turned sideways. It's a fun idea.

** I read one a waaay back, but it was a bit of a crack fic. Dumbledore made a horcrux (because evil dumbledore, of course) and made it into part of a subway car or something so the scar was actually how he kept track of where the horcrux was.

** I don't know about /using/ the Underground scar, bit I do believe an old story at WitchFics is the /origin/ of the scar. Since the site went down, here's [[https://web.archive.org/web/20150116025658/http://www.witchfics.org/fortuna/botu/index.html][Chapter 1 at the Wayback]].

Full disclosure: I have not actually read this story. I was always at WitchFics for Snape, Snape-Hermione, Snape-OC, and oh yeah more Snape ;)
