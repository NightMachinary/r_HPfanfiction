What are your thoughts on either idea. I have read many fics who mention them in passing. I think the idea actually helps being a level of believability. What are your thoughts on casual sexual references in stories and do you think it can be done well? If not why? I mean teenagers often push their bounds both sexually and in general. Why can't they in stories as well. I've only read a few stories that handled Harry exploring his sexuality well and I'm just curious how other people feel.


** As a gay male -- oh God how I hate throwing my sexuality around -- I can safely say that very little fics handle the process of exploration correctly. Of course, I don't mean that it only happens for homosexuals, but it's a process that many trudge through in real life. I don't think I have ever read a fic where Harry (or any other character) has actually explored their sexuality. It's always, and I mean it, an instant case of finding their sexuality.

Exploration is a teenage thing, even for those that never attempted such things as aiding a friend in the night or sizing up against friends, curious about whether he was bigger or whatnot. There's no detail of Harry getting aroused randomly in the showers and denying that he is, in fact, homosexual. There's just instant acceptance and knowing.

I understand that not many people wish to read a fic where Harry is showering and he pops an erection admiring another boy's form, but it's the principle of the fact.

I want to read a fic where Hermione (or Ron!) finds an adult magazine tucked under Harry's bed or hidden. I know that not everyone wishes to read smut and sex, but even without that, exploring sexuality is such an important thing and it's often glossed over and never touched upon.

As for playwitch and playwizard, I love the concept. I've seen it done once and remember laughing so hard at something so simple that I never thought of.

I went to an all-boys' school and boarded there for a small period of time and I can safely say that many, many boys were heard pleasuring themselves and even caught doing it and just grinned sheepishly. I can safely say that I would be shocked if it didn't happen -- and it did, every night it was heard. Look what you've done, OP, you've got me talking about masturbation. -.-

OT (once again) I think that more writers need to explore these 'adult' things. It's such a small thing, yet it can make the reader feel like they're experiencing a huge revelation.

*** Thanks for taking the time to articulate this. I'm writing a Harry/Neville fic and I really want to incorporate this into my story. It's astonishing how difficult it is to include elements of this (which I do) with it looking or feeling or sounding like smut (which I don't want). In smut stories, it's not uncommon to indulge in some exploratory masturbation, but in nonsmut stories, it'd be really odd to follow harry as he woke up, wanked in the shower and then went to meet with Remus to do patronus practice or whatever. For a thirteen year old boy, that wouldn't be weird AT ALL. For a story about a thirteen year old boy, it'd be bizarre. Just something I'm struggling with in my writing. Thanks for chiming in here and encouraging me to keep going.

**** I'd love to read it. :)

I also read your comment wrongly multiple times. I was so confused until I actually say sat down read it properly instead of just breezing over it.

It does make sense. It's not unusual for a thirteen year old boy to wank. When I was thirteen, that's about all I did. But reading a story about a thirteen year old wanking seems to be bizarre.

As for a suggestion, you could gloss over it. Go in detail of it, but don't go into deep detail. I mean, no matter what you write it's going to come out as some sort of smut, whether it being described as a pleasurable feeling or a sense of bliss.

As for the magazines, you could explain it as in most do and call it an adult magazine, even gloss over the title and claim that Harry had swiped it from Dudley (if you're going by the fact that wizards wouldn't have porn mags, which I doubt. They would have had something, even if they swiped them from Muggles.

You know for a fact that half-blood and Muggle-born boys are gonna take them along.

*** I'd have to disagree that exploration is only a teenage thing. I'm 28 and have started to explore my sexuality and come to the conclusion that I'm bi. Exploration can occur at any age, especially if someone has repressed themselves.

**** I didn't mean it like that. I know that exploration can happen at any age and at any time simply because it's a basic human thing. I know a few people in their thirties that have come out as gay or bisexual simply because it took them a while to figure out.

I simply meant that it's more common for it to happen in teenagers and that's when it starts. Most thirty year old men wouldn't ask their friend to wank them, etc. Some may, but again, everyone is different.

*** First let me say I wasn't sure how to respond to your post. Not for any particular reason. I guess it stopped me short.

It is sort of strange to throw ones sexuality out there. Personally I'm bisexual and I'm alright with that.

I believe sexuality is a constant journey that starts in our teenage years. It seems likely that Harry would experiment at least just a little bit.

I agree that it wouldn't be interesting to see Hermione or Ron finding sexual material that belongs to Harry. It's a very interesting plot line. I could see where at least a one shot could go with this idea. Vice versa I think it would be interesting if Harry found anything of Ron or Hermione's. For Hermione it could be a simple as he needs to borrow a textbook and find it stashed there.

I'd say I'm sorry about causing you to talk about masturbation, but that wouldn't really be true. I'm a minx like that. I enjoy causing my own friends to blush, so I'd be lying a little. I went to college with paper thin dorm room walls, so I can understand just knowing that exploring is happening.

I agree that more authors should at least explore things. It doesn't have to be much. Even in the books we see Harry appreciate the female form a little bit. Even in passing.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4752758/1/The-Bet]]) this tell what I think is a good coming out scene. It's not long and it's just a one shot, but I love it. Someone told me once it had some errors, but I just like it for how sweet and simple it is.

**** I just don't like doing it simply because I feel like it's no one business. This time around, it felt like something that I should add for some minor clarification.

Oh indeed. It wouldn't be hard to include it onto anyone. Harry could also find sex-ed pamphlets in Hermione's trunk, stashed between two books. It's such a small thing, but it is such a great plotline. WHy did Hermione have them? What were they for? Had she read them yet? blah, blah, blah.

Heh. I could talk about my own masturbation stories quite easily without embarrassment. I just feel like people wouldn't want to open a thread discussing a topic about magazines and seeing a post about masturbation. Oh, when I had a flat, my neighbour was rather loud. It was rather entertaining, seeing who could be louder. I'm sure the other people thought we were on something.

Coming out scenes are poor in most fics as well. So far I normally see two outcomes.

1. Everyone laughs it off and explains that homosexuality is alright in the wizarding world. I'm sorry, but no. I highly doubt that a community that's based on family and heirs would accept it with open arms. I get why everyone makes it accepted, and that's to break away from homophobia, but still. Seeing as on this very thread people argued that wizards were stuck in Victorian times, I could see people getting into some serious issues with being gay).

2. Everyone but Ron (and sometimes Ginny!) accepts it.

AS for the fic. That's great. I love it when people do that as it's such a heartwarming thing. I ha d abet on my sexuality in high-school... I wonder what happened to that and who won it.

***** I agree it would be a good plotline. Like really even just the minor embarrassment of getting caught could make a good plot point of for no other reason to break tension happening in the main plot. Like uhhh...... I can explain. If nothing else let's say Harry is gay and Neville is crushing on him, but it's not sure if Harry is gay... Neville finding certain magazines could be what tips him off. The same could be said about building a relationship. Like one of the members wants to take things further, but doesn't know if their SO it's even interested in stuff like that. It could open a conversation.

I agree it could cause problems in a conservative community. It could be written away as something that happens like on the side. What I mean is that like as long as a heir is born any side relationships are fine. Mistresses weren't uncommon in Victorian times. What's to say that they don't have men of the night too?

** I've seen this a few times - the problem is, all the times I've seen it it's been backwards. Going by the muggle counterparts, playwitch would contain men, and playwizard would contain women. Author's get it wrong though and have it the other way around.

This problem I have is the actual wizarding population. How many witches of a youngish age would actually be posing in a mag like this, and where do they come from? It just doesn't seem like the wizarding population has enough people.

That's not to mention the societal norms themselves. The wizarding world is not necessarily the same as the muggle world in regards to all things. What is believable for a muggle might not be the same for a wizard.

Personally, I find sexual related stuff in the story to be mostly needless, if it's not a blatant self-indulgence.

*** Who's to say that the people posing for pictures are witches and wizards? It could be a muggle who thinks they're just dressing up and role-playing or posing for someone who likes vintage cameras. Just because the subject of the picture moves doesn't mean they have to know about moving pictures.

Yeah, I usually include sexual stuff in stories because, well, post puberty people have sexual stuff in their lives. However, I don't make it the focus of the story and I try my best to make it reasonable. A lot of people just don't want to read about that, and a lot of good writings don't include it.

** The problem is that its often at odds with the rest of the world. The nature and size of the wizard world is such that a porn/prostitution industry probably can't exist. Especially when they could just pull from the copious amounts of muggle porn.

** Everytime they're mentioned in stories, I get annoyed. Porn in victorian times existed but they didn't have publications like we did in the 20th century. A wizard or witch would be more likely to have a painting of a nude woman or man or couple--or more--or etchings that are animate, not a magazine. Now a muggleborn MIGHT try to get something like that up off the ground but the wizengamot's purebloods would happily buy it AND also use it as proof that muggleborns are destroying pureblood culture.
