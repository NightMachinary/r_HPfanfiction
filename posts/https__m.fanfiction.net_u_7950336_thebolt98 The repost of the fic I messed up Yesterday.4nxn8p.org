** I don't know how many times we can say this to you. You need a beta. Just the title and summary alone:

#+begin_quote
  Harry's true love Harry has it all star Quidditch player skinny though handsome the girls love him,but even with all this, Harry is still lonely longing for a companion someone more than a friend someone he loves. More confident/funnier Harry,Harry/Fleur pairing romance and fluffy chapters will happen! Please read and enjoy If any of you saw yesterday's attempt I promise this is much better.
#+end_quote

Has so many grammar mistakes I can't be bothered to begin. It also sounds cheesy and cliched. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but this is now your third? fourth? post on this story in about two days. Keep it to one thread, and wait until you have it to a readable standard with decent editing. Like I said, this community is willing to help, but it's not something that should be expected of us, and we need to feel you're putting the effort in. Find. A. Beta.

*** The issues with this fic can't really be fixed with a beta; they'd end up having to do more work than the author to make the fic readable.

What OP really needs to do, is to head out and buy a style manual, and start practising grammar exercises until he/she has it down completely. Furthermore, OP needs to read some of the recommended list, and then evaluate whether their fic is worth writing or not. Having read the chapter, even excusing the poor grammar, it's well... excuse me for being blunt, but it's just not very good.

So far, this fic seems like a clich√© retelling of GOF where the only difference is that Harry is now a ladies' man. It's one thing to have bad grammar but a fresh plot; it's another thing entirely to have both bad grammar and a story that has been trod and retrod ten thousand times over.

*** Putting the effort in? I spent all last night and good portion of the day trying to fix it any criticism I'll try take but don't say I don't need put in effort. Where is the best place to find a beta?

**** The amount of time means nothing when we can't actually see any improvement in your grammar and writing technique. This is not something you can fix by running a spell check and reading it through over and over again - you have a fundamental lack of understanding about grammar and syntax. This is stuff that should have been learnt at primary school. I understand that you have difficulties, and that must be very frustrating, but the fact that only now have you asked where the best place to find a beta is speaks volumes. The very first post you made on this forum should have been looking for a beta. You know that is your weakness. Telling everyone "it will get better" means nothing because it's such a crucial part of people being able to understand your writing.

Furthermore, you've mentioned that you wrote this in a day. It really shows. Really. You need to be more humble about this. There's always room for people to improve and generally speaking this community is supportive. But you are currently at a very low standard of writing.

As for where to find a beta; it's not easy, especially not at the level of help you would need. But the forums at ff.net are a good place to start.

If you don't want to do all of this and just want to write for fun, that's absolutely fine. You will still find readers on ff.net. But communities like this one and DLP prefer stories of a publishing quality, and the writers here go through many drafts, revisions and corrections before we ask for feedback.

***** Yes I know but I only got mad their because you accused me of lack of effort. Yes I know while the spell check obviously hell somewhat I know my language is poor! And as for my difficulty it like this when its comes to commas and Claus they so many rules or a method of doing it'll eventually gets muddled in my head which happens to every one but I can't get out of the muddle is where my problem..how far off is the standard to have a beta consider it? Thanks and yes I want to write on a high level

****** If that's all it took you to get mad, you are not prepared for constructive feedback.

Look, I understand grammar is hard. Especially if you have a learning difficulty (I'm assuming something like dyslexia?) or you're just starting out. It's also very boring. I actually teach English as a foreign language, and even I make grammar mistakes often in my fics. That's why I always get someone else to read it first. But I cannot emphasise to you how important it is. If you genuinely want to improve your writing, you need to spend a lot of time understanding the fundamentals of the English language. You need to do LOTS of reading (and it can't just be any old crap from ff.net, it needs to be proper books or at least highly recommended fics from this sub or DLP) and you need to practice certain grammar rules over and over again until they become natural. Perhaps try looking up some TEFL lessons on YouTube. Start with understanding sentence structure and syntax - what is a verb? A noun? How do we use adverbs and adjectives? Move on to practising the differences between there/their/they're, or too/to, or your/you're. Move on to working out how to use commas. For example, your summary starts with a list of traits that are missing commas. Between all of this, read read read read.

If you manage to find a beta, take the time to notice where the corrections are, and try to work out why they are there. Try to understand where you are going on, and how you can remember to correct it in the future.

And, I'm really sorry... But one evening is a lack of effort. It takes me at least a week to get a 5000 word chapter ready to publish, and that is extraordinarily lazy by many people's standards.

******* I am prepared for criticism and yeah dyslexia and adhd(but that's not near as bad as it was a few years back) and yes I will launch a full scale assault tomorrow to find a beta hopefully he/she will like the story and take it on. Yes but with a difficulty trying to do what I did is a the equivalent of a weeks writing work :)

******** Ok, but I advise against creating a new thread about this story. We've given you feedback, it's up to you to find a beta now, and generally speaking self-promotion is frowned upon unless you're very established.

Go check out some of the most recommended stories. Take it easy.
