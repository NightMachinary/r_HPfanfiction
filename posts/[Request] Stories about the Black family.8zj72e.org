Any era, any character. F.e., something focused on Arcturus Black and Melania Macmillan's relationship (was their marriage arranged? was she a Hufflepuff?) or Andromeda and Ted Tonks or Sirius finding friends in the Marauders... Just no Wolfstar or Bellamort.

Honestly, this is a pretty broad request :)

Thanks in advance!


** This is my list of Regulus Black stories. They also consist of Black Brothers fics.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12672741/1/renascentia][renascentia]] co-written by tonberrys-and-kuchikopi is a type of fic that really needs more attention. The fic's writing style is written in a way that I reminds me of a high level fictional read. Like the language is written by a extremely well verse writer, or in this case writers. A rare but delightful find in the fanfiction world. It's essentially a Regulus alive fic and what would he do if he was alive. The authors understood each character extremely well, especially on the background of the Black brothers.

The authors have written several stories in that universe that centered around the brothers' past which are also insightful reads as well. Those are not really needed to be read to understand the main story, but I do recommend reading those background stories as well which are all under there account on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/9795334/tonberrys-and-kuchikopi][FFN]].

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12467737/1/Sang-Noir][Sang Noir]] by Aithne Morrigan actually made me cry. The ending was bittersweet.

- [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1037432/chapters/2069217][Dead Man Walking]] by cywscross. The summary for this one: "Kreacher goes back to save his master, and Regulus survives but his near-death-by-Inferi puts him into a coma for the next sixteen years. When he wakes, well, the world is not so different. Voldemort is still at large, and the Ministry is still inept. His brother's got a godson now though, so it's only natural for Regulus to keep an eye on young Harry as well."

linkffn(1037432) Status: Incomplete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11266645/1/Blood-of-Thy-Enemy][Blood of Thy Enemy]] by Jenkt5 is where Regulus went into hiding for about sixteen years.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11822457/1/A-Tale-Of-Two-Brothers][A Tale Of Two Brothers]] by riakida. The story has excellent writing and I like the concept where Sirius has to take care of Regulus when their parents passed away earlier.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8895954/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Deus-Ex-Machina][Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina]] by Karmic Acumen. The first couple of chapters I admit is quit boring but it picks up to be something of an epic later on.

linkffn(8895954) Status: Complete

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5986366/chapters/13756558][face death in the hope]] by LullabyKnell is slightly slash, but the story itself is well written enough that it isn't overbearing. This is a time travel fic where Harry saved Regulus before he was drowned.

linkao3(5986366) Status: Ongoing

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12221773/1/Unlocking-Doors][Unlocking Doors]] by LaRadium. I absolutely love this story. The concept is just so original. Basically if Regulus is reborn as a Weasley. In fact he is Ron's twin brother in this story. Definitely worth the read.

linkffn(12221773) Status: Incomplete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4045677/1/Foreshadowing-Demise][Foreshadowing Demise]] by Shadowmistress13 is by far one of the most stressful read I had ever came across. Every scene adds another piece to the puzzle and every scene builds up the story. I especially love every character is not exactly black or white, just a whole rainbow full of colors. The story could make you feel amuse to downright tears and every other emotions in between. I just highly recommend this fic. The only downside to this fic is the fact updates are not frequent, however, in the way the story is written, I say it is worth the wait. Plus the author is very persistent when saying to they are not abandoning the story. It updated recently, and I'm content to say that this is one of my top favorite Regulus and Sirius Black fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2721217/1/Brothers-just-the-same][Brothers just the same]] by Snufflesforever really hit me in the heart. This fic mainly focus on the Black brothers' story and their relationship.

linkffn(2721217) Status: Complete

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834182/1/The-Little-King-s-Road][The Little King's Road]] by Lily-lamaire. I want to say that this is one of the most original, but closely cannon story that I have ever came across. The fic takes a fresh perspective of Draco and /kept/ him in character in the form of his prat-ish view of the world. He does not even realize what he was getting into. Another bonus that got me hype was the fact Draco is learning about Regulus' story and that was when he begins to opens his eyes.

linkffn(12834182) Status: Incomplete

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/48618][Rewritten in Time]] series by ScotlandEvander. Draco travels back in time to his first year while Atlanta (an OC) travels to Marauders era and fell in love with Regulus (while another her is around Draco age). Fix it series.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12224847/chapters/27770244][Toujours Pur (of Heart)]] by Nillegible I started to tear up when Regulus cried. This story was really a emotional rollercoaster that I had definitely enjoyed. It's short and bittersweet, but had a hopeful ending to it for the brothers.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8033802/1/Me-and-Snuffles][Me and Snuffles]] dreamerbydawn. This is one of the sweetest one-shot that I have ever read. It is basically filled with fluff.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12963801/1/The-Good-Brother][The Good Brother]] by ALeighS is an interesting what-if story where instead of Snape being the potion master of Hogwarts, it is Regulus because he defected from the Death Eaters earlier.

linkffn(12963801) Status: Ongoing

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12947527/1/a-new-life][a new life]] by belle parole is very short and definitely should've been a longer story.

****** Yeah, I usually lean more towards stories where they threat the brothers as equals. The stories I suggested might be what you're looking for.

Warning for Deus Ex Machina though, the first chapter is especially dry, but the author did that on purpose. It will pick up towards an extraordinary story later on.

******* To be honest, Sirius and Regulus have one of the most interesting relationships in the entire series. I love both of their characters and I truly wish they didn't die so young and so tragically. I like to think if they'd both lived they'd have reconciled later on. It's very hard finding good fanfictions with both of them so I applaud you for providing so many great ones. However, there's still some false facts that grate on me, such as Lily and Snape being the top of their class (Sirius and James were so) but I can ignore that in favor of well-written dynamics between both. I know it's petty but I love accuracy.

******** I can definitely relate. We never really get to know more about Regulus' character in cannon so he is really an open canvas that we attempt to fill with fanfics.

It is even more tragic that Sirius never found out how Regulus had died. They both did not even die peacefully. Regulus was drowned trying to do something right while Sirius died in battle trying to save Harry.

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

  Regulus waits for hours. For hours, he stands on that cursed cliff, the black waters churning and gushing and crashing far below. Even as far up as he is, the air is heavy with spray. He breathes in the salt, and tries to cast his mind back to childhood visits the seaside. He can't. It smells too much like blood.There is an odd noise behind him, inhuman footsteps, nails on rock-Regulus spins around and finds a large, wet, dog. It's huge, and black. The dark eyes are wide and intelligent; far too intelligent to be a convenient stray.  Regulus laughs hysterically. He has been sent a Grim. An omen of death that should be sent to the unwary, not to someone who is attempting what is tantamount to suicide.   The Grim walks closer, eyes wary, and Regulus tells it helplessly, "It is alright, I already know." His voice doesn't waver, and he takes a moment to be viciously proud of himself for that. "I am going to die." Or: Regulus hopes for a chance to say goodbye to Sirius, and somehow that changes everything.

  Regulus was drowning, or at Least he thought he was until a woman of light came to him to offer a second chance. He was thrown unprepared into a new world to save his brother and Harry. Fate has a few things to change, for better or for worst. Blood will be spilled and an Ancient and Nobel House will rise again. Lets just hope that working in the shadows does more good than harm.

[[https://deathlydragon.livejournal.com/105196.html][Snow Warriors]] by deathlydragon - oneshot. Cute, a little bittersweet story of Sirius and Regulus before Hogwarts.

[[https://deathlydragon.livejournal.com/67185.html][Killing Curiosity]] by deathlydragon - oneshot. "Sirius and Regulus spend a summer at Malfoy Manor, but their first meeting with Lucius Malfoy is everything but auspicious."

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=320073][House of Cards]] by Aphoride- Complete. A bit of a Black family murder mystery. It contains slash (Barty/Regulus), but it's in the background and very easy to ignore if you don't like slash.

I also rather enjoyed [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/545371][this]] series of oneshots by GwendolynGrace.

  Sirius' room had always been a place of refuge for Regulus Black. Even amidst the war and all that's changed between them it will always remain as such.

  Whenever they sat in a small cafe, young Dora had a habit of wandering to different tables, talking to different strangers. This time, the strangers were Andromeda's estranged cousin and sister, forcing Andromeda to face the life and people she left behind.

  Sirius never stopped to think that his brother may not have joined the Death Eaters of his own free will. Or just how thorough a tragedy his death was. Oh the secrets a diary reveals and the unique opportunities a deadly veil offers.

** This oneshot explores the fandom debate about whether Sirius played Quidditch or not...it deals with Sirius's family, his relationship with his brother, and his friendship with the marauders.
