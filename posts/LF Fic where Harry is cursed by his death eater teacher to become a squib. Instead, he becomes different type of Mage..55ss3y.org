This a story that I read a while back and forgot the name of. I remember that the three schools were very important in the fic because they had some relics in them. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: I just remembered a few more details from the story. Harry discovers that it is illegal to be a Mage like him because they are bloodthirsty and have killed tons of wizards. He is taken to a jail that is not Azkaban (I think it's a goblin prison or something) and blinded. There he meets the last living Mage of his kind who teaches him the ways of the Mage.


** I believe you are looking for linkffn(5269970) harry Potter and the Third Key. Totally awesome story, though I could have done without some of the romance. Has been years since I have done a read through, so thank you for the reminder!

** Three schools with relics in them reminds me of linkffn(8770795) a bit, although I don't remember it having the squib curse thing.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
