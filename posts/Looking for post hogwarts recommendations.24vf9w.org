I'm looking for recommendations for post hogwarts where Harry becomes a professor or headmaster. My only other requirement is no slash.

** This story might meet your criteria. It's set about 50 years post-war. It's novel-length and complete. I wrote it.

Spoiler: Harry becomes Headmaster at the end.
