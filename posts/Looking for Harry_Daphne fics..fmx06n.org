** Ah, my time has come!

The Harry Black series by AuthorK is ongoing and a nice AU where Harry was raised by Sirius before going to Hogwarts as a 3rd year. Harry and Daphne have a similar start to their relationship as James and Lily do before becoming closer. Good and unique characters, good plot lines, highly recommend.linkffn(Harry Black Book 1: The Hero's Return)linkffn(Harry Black Book 2: The Rising Darkness)

linkffn(Novocaine) is a slow-ish burn as Harry tries to make the Wizarding World a better place using his heritage and wealth to bring back businesses to a post-war Britain. Great writing, great story, also highly recommend. Currently ongoing, slow-ish updates.

linkffn(Wait, what?) is just a funny fluff piece where Harry and Daphne reveal their relationship to others. Nothing deep, just fun and fluffy.

linkffn(Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent) is basically in the Harry/Daphne pantheon at this point and is a must-read.

linkffn(From Southhampton to New York and Beyond) I really enjoyed. It's still ongoing, but with slower chapter updates. Harry takes a world cruise after the war and runs into Daphne. Major Ron/Ginny/Molly bashing as a warning.

Finally, if you want a long read full of interwoven plot points and intrigue, definitely check out linkffn(A Marriage of Convenience). Now complete at 106 chapters, it's a take on the Marriage Contract trope where Harry is blackmailed into marrying Daphne while he's still with Ginny.

EDIT: Bot didn't link to the correct "Wait, what?" story. Link is here: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12610457/1/Wait-what]]

*** To avoid further bot miss-happenings like that, you can use the story's URL numeric code, instead of the title. It often happens that when there are more than one story with the same title, the bot links the wrong one. Using the unique numeric code each one has assigned prevents that. For example, if I wanted to link The Mind Arts, to name something, I can link it like this: linkffn(12740667). That way, even if there are a million stories with the same name in [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], the bot will link only this one.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Sirius had made a slew of different decisions that night he had arrived at Godric's Hollow. With Sirius' focus on Harry rather than revenge, a very different Boy-Who-Lived is going to make his return to the wizarding world at the age of 13. But the question is, why did Harry return so late? And will he still be the Hero the Wizarding World needs? Haphne! AU-ish, slightly mature!

** Someone say free promotion?

I'm working on a trilogy of Haphne fics, first one is completed and the second one is about half way through. They do the whole Ice Queen trope, but I try and flesh out more of the prejudice/dark arts aspect and how that filters into their relationship. Hope you'll give a look and who knows, maybe even enjoy them!

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.
