Hi! I've been lurking here for a while, and finally decided to upload a fic project I'd written elsewhere to ff.net for some feedback. Everyone here seems very articulate, so I'd love to hear any thoughts you might have!

Briefly, the story structure's modeled after the books, in that it starts in year one and follows the protagonist up through year seven. Not that it's anywhere close to done yet. The cast is mostly OCs, but the canons are around and do show up where appropriate. I love the canons as much as the next person, I just wanted to give a new batch of Hogwarts students the chance to shine.

Regarding the somewhat odd format and the second person perspective, the fic's actually been written as a reader-voted Choose Your Own Adventure story on an alternate forum. There are game-like elements to it, such as the protagonist having rudimentary 'stats' and rolling dice to determine success, but I've tried to focus on it as a narrative first and a game second. I really enjoy having some randomness and uncertainty when I'm writing -- keeps me on my toes! (I do have an overarching plot, of course, I couldn't pants that hard if I tried.)

Anyway, outside of the nonstandard fic format, I'd like to hear how the writing comes across. I'm a bit concerned that I tell too much rather than show, and that the main character lacks a really defining personality or does not have enough flaws. I have ~32k words written so far, and about half of it is uploaded. Gonna space the next few chapters out over the next few days while I'm working on the next chapter. Thanks in advance for any feedback and constructive criticism!

** I'm really sorry, I understand that what I'm about to say is monumentally subjective and you asked for critique outside the fic format, but I just don't get why you need to include the game elements at all. Can't you use them to help you plan and write the fic? They don't add anything for the reader, in my opinion. I really don't get the impression it's narrative first at all, to be honest.

*** It's a bit hard to explain -- the game elements really are just a part of the format. Where I originally wrote and posted the story, they were the standard practice. The voters probably approached things from a game perspective, but I honestly did try to put the narrative first at all times. I started writing because I had a story in mind, and I thought an interactive medium was the best way to tell it.

If you don't mind, what specifically feels game-y about it? If I removed the votes from the main text, would that improve the flow of things?

**** Sorry, I don't think I can help you. I guess I just don't get it. I don't know why you wouldn't just write a story without all the other stuff. Best of luck though, if people are already voting on it then clearly it's going well.
