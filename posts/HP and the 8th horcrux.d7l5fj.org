So in this story Harry Potter realizes that Voldymort actually kept a piece of his soul in one more object.... A crack rock! And the only way for him to destroy it was for him to smoke it.

Just as he was about to light up Ron shouted "No! Don't do it Harry! I've heard it's quite addictive!

"He's right you know" Hermione added. "Crack is one of this countries biggest addiction among muggles"

"Well maybe so guys but I'm a wizard. And a damn good one, Hagrid told me himself. Besides it's the only way to bring down Voldymort" and so Harry Potter smoked crack rock till nothing was left.

Harry Potter didn't realize he was about to spend the next ten years as an addict. A useless crackhead living on the streets. Always fiending for more crack.

Ron and Hermione spent the next 10 years trying to help their poor old friend and begged him to seek help

"Harry please you've got to stop this madness. You're supposed to be out their finding a way to stop Voldemort... Not living here among these homeless people." Hermione pleaded to Harry.

"Oi mate's long time no see. Have you um.. by any chance have some money or or maybe just a tad bit more crack? Please I'll just smoke this last bit and I swear I'll go back to Hogwarts. " Harry looked like he had aged 30 years. His hear disheveled and his teeth rotting.

"Oh not this time Harry. We're not giving you any more chances. We're here to take you to rehab. Enough is enough.!" Ron yelled at Harry.

"No please Ron. I swear just one more crack rock. Please I'll.. I'll polish yer knob real good m8. "

"Harry! WTF?" Shrieked Hermione.

And so Ron and Hermione were eventually able to force Harry to seek help. And he was able to bring down voldy only after a 10 yr delay. The end.
