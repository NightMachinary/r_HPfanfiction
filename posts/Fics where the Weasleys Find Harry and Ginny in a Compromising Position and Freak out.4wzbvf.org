I read a story set after the war where Harry and Ginny are "together" and the Weasleys walk in on it and kick Harry out of the house. Does anyone know which fic this is from?


** This happens in Backwards with a Purpose and although they are young it is (technically) after the war

*** Thank you! It was really bothering me why I couldn't place that scene and why the Weasleys would have been that upset. This makes sense.

*** Weasleys were hostile and suspicious of Harry right from the start, but it was mainly caused by the meddling of another time traveller, whose identity is not revealed until the last sentence of this fic.

I actually enjoyed this angsty episode, although I hate angst in general. Weasleys at odds with Harry actually had quite a few interesting effects later in the story, many of them positive.

*** Ugh that's the point where I put the fic down. Yes it's popular but the abject stupidity of Harry and Ginny getting in to that position and risking getting caught.... bleh.

***** Yes, but in that particular case if felt ... contrived. Horny people can and often are stupid, but those two were together for long enough and furthermore lived long enough to be capable of controlling themselves for a few minutes when it's clear that they are somewhere where the adults have something against one of them and likely will take note of them disappearing. So it really feels like a cheap attempt at creating more drama by handing Ginevra a ball full of stupid.

****** It did seem a bit force, yes. Although not enough to put down the fic in my case.

Not the best re do fic out there, in any case, but nothing to be ashamed of.

**** If you stop reading stories when the character's do stupid or inadvisable things, you must not have made it far through the Harry Potter series :p

** This one isn't after the war, but it's called Unexpected Events, by Epeefencer. It's an unsuccessful attempt though, and only the Weasley brothers take part in it.
