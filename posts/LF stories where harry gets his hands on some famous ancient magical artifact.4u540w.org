I read this crack fic the other day where in the end, Harry and Voldemort battle it out in some kind of reality bubble thing, surrounded by all these famous magical artifacts/foci and some from other series as well. So basically I want to find another well written story where he gets his hands on some kind of famous amulet or staff, or even sword (ex. more use of the Sword of Gryffindor or maybe something with Excalibur). I just would like to read something that forces him to use a different style of magic or something. I don't care if he's OP. Thanks.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/5/Common-Sense][The Girdle of Arthos]] is pretty alright I guess.

** linkffn(6995114) has a bunch of different weapons that Harry and other people use, but it's a /weird/ story and crosses over with Naruto (only to the extent that Harry has Sharingan eyes) as well as Type-Moon (to a much greater extent, but only later on in the story).

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.

** The different style that you're referring to usually happens in crossovers like linkffn(School Spirit by StoryEnvy;The Witcher by Unlimited Blade Works;FateProphecy Break by Wrathkal). Fare warining: The first one starts out great, but is most likely dead. The second one is a mash up between Witcher lore and HPverse. Finally, the last one is A Nasuverse character and his lore in the HPverse. All providing the MC with a change of style on how the MC uses his magic, or in the case of the second one [[/spoiler][lack of magic]]

*** I believe the one OP read is that Harry Potter the Geek story that's been referenced to a few times lately, where a time shifted to modern day HP gets a computer and goes all l33+ and refers to memes and all that kind of stuff.

  Harry Potter wasn't surprised to learn he was a wizard. He'd been dreaming of wizards and magic for years. He was just surprised at what sort of wizard he was. Prologue is identical to "Death and Dreams". Dresden Files crossover.
