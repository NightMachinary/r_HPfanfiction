Greetings!

Some of you (may) know me from ff.net where I have an established h/hr series and am starting a h/f fic that's been percolating for a while. Aside from my writing though I've been addicted to reading hpfanfic for like... ever, so I'm well entrenched in the subject matter.

Just wanted to stop in and say hi before I peruse the rest of the sub.

LGreymark

P.S. I see a lot of fancy shite going on with links and such, if anyone could flick me a link to a primer that'd be great.

******* The bot is actually pretty easy to use - literally all you have to do is wrap that link in the parentheses of linkffn(). So we have

=linkffn(https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11392655/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Falsehood-Ploy)= instead.

Now, if you want to be a bit fancier, you can use the fic by name instead of having an ugly-looking link in your comment:

=linkffn(Harry Potter and the Falsehood Ploy)=

There. That's it!

Now it should be pretty easy to understand how to commands work.

How does it all work? The bot combs this sub's comments for "linkffn", searches the internet for what's inside the parentheses, goes to the fanfiction site, grabs the story information, and comes back to Reddit and formats and posts the relevant information.

If you want to know some other cool tricks for the bot, just take a look at the sidebar, maybe even read through the short linked guide. For example:

ffnbot!ignore - the bot should ignore any links I made in this comment.

********* I was going to say that portkey would be nearly impossible but I think I've come up with a workaround.

If you look at the page for a story, such as [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/9162][this one]], you can see that the description, number of chapters, and status do not appear anywhere on that page. However, they do appear on the search page, [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&sortby=updatetime][as seen here]] where that story is the first result.

That means that if you do something like linkPortkey(9162), it could go that story page, parse the title and author, then go back to the search page do a search which will return a single result of exactly the story you want, and could build the reddit post from there.

#+begin_example
  http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/9162
  http://fanfiction.portkey.org/index.php?act=searchresultsv2&sortby=1&storyTitle=Always+and+Forever&storyAuthor=Lorelover
#+end_example

Not that we rec to portkey much, and there's only like 6500 stories, but if [[/u/tusing]] wants to add it, well there you go.

Ficwad would be a little easier since everything is on the same page, but the way the chapters are linked is goofy as hell and it could screw up the bot if the right number isn't used.

I write when my muse strikes and that's basically it. Never mind that I'm having huge issues with that story at the moment, my logical head is taking the plot one way and my creative head is clamoring to shove all these other bits and pieces in. I really suffer from being a complete push over when it comes to letting my creative side run my writing. It's easy to see in the narrative where I can't help but basically lecture the reader on some arcane premise or other. Hell, almost entire chapters of Deceit are written that way.

A few days ago someone on this sub requested recommendations for romance involving the Giant Squid. No one really takes the whole shipping thing here seriously for the most part (with a few obvious exceptions) and just kinda roles with it. Adding Weasley hate is generally considered by most to devalue the ship the author is trying to set sail though. It's a complete cop out; rather than have to deal with the emotions of some of Harrys most loyal canon supporters the author just makes them wildly OOC and so awful that Harry ditches them in a heartbeat, usually whilst rewriting their history together entirely from canon. Which actually no one would care about if it were ever done in an original manner.

I can say something positive, then. I really like the uniqueness of linkffn(A Different Halloween by robst). There are very few stories that try to tackle a /very/ young Harry the way he did and I admire his creativity. Another user recently reminded me of robst's excellent use of hooks to draw the reader into his story. A lot of other works take the reader's interest for granted and the plots are often slow to develop as a result. But robst seems to make his initial hook a priority and I respect that. As you said, it's a matter of preference.

******** Robst writes a lot, updates regularly, finishes his stories and generally has few if any typos or grammar mistakes. He's also very popular.

Saying that his stories lack "meaningful challenges or conflict" seems to be the main criticism, and that is at least partially a matter of personal taste.

********* Actually, his earier stories have a problem with run-on and awkward sentences. A big problem, actually. I /like/ some of his stories, but reading them gives me a mental "itch" because I want to fix so many sentences. Curiously, listening makes those problems almost disappear, which tells me he was writing what "sounded" right to him.

His most recent works don't have that problem. You can almost watch the steady improvement, which I think is great. It really shows how much actively writing can really help.

Although I prefer stories with more conflict - where it at least appears that the hero might not succeed - I think that some of his stories will always be favorites of mine, even if they aren't perfect.

******* So far all my HP stories involve Harry/Hermione. Three of them are complete.

Edit: They all got a mature rating, but there's no graphic sex. They are violent however, and I wanted to err on the side of caution.

linkffn(10959290) - Nominally a crossover; only the concept of Spyboy was taken and applied to Hermione.

linkiffn(10595005) and its prologue linkffn(10993575) - Set post-Hogwarts, in an AU where the magical world never really adapted those weird muggle ideas like "human rights" "democracy" and "equality before the law", and muggleborns are oppressed by pureblood aristocrats all throughout Europe. When the British muggleborns revolt, both the oppressed and the oppressors take note. It starts with a revolution in Britain, but then spreads to involve Magical Europe as the ruling pureblood cliques react to "those uppity mudbloods taking over".

linkffn(11102515) - A crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, set before the TV series, featuring her predecessor. Politics play a major role.

linkffn(11080542) - still going on. Hermione and Harry, set in an Alternate Universe, where the Magical World split off in 1691, and evolved a culture of their own, sometimes more archaic, sometimes far more progressive than the muggle world, but far more magical and often more alien than in canon. A core concept is the fact that while the laws are often archaic and literally medieval, custom and tradition over the centuries have changed how they are enforced, making adjusting to and navigating society difficult for muggleborns and muggle-raised. It also features a Dumbledore who is more ruthless, and yet far more protective of his students, and a more cunning and less insane Voldemort, whose plans do not rely on coincidences and mistakes made by his opponents, and alternate Triwizard Tournament, both safer and more friendly to an audience, as well as several different wizarding cultures.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

******** Wow, it's you. It's actually you!! I just read (completed today) your 'Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution', and bloody hell you did an amazing job. Like seriously, your's was on-point. I loved it. I still can't believe it's you. Like, I never thought of actually coming across the writer of that epic story. My mind is actually blown at the fact that I've come across you, on reddit.

Your dialogue is amazing, like there's a smile on my face knowing you're the author. Like I was sceptical at the beginning, at how would this go, simply because early on there would changes of POV instantly. It took me time getting to understand your style, but once I did it was nothing short of amazing. I was kind of 'hurt' at how /ruthless/ Hermione & HP were at Professor McGonagall, early on, since she's been supportive of Harry/Hermione for quite some time, but then again perhaps it was to do with her being old-fashioned in her ways/friends with Kingsley, the snake!

Hopefully a spoiler tag works, because your portrayal of Draco was brilliant.
