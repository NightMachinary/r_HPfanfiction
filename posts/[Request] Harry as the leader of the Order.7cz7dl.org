Hi! I'm looking for fanfiction where Harry raises to a challenge of becoming a leader for the Order, e.g. after Dumbledore's death. I quite liked the take on that in linkao3(Secrets by Vorabiza) and I was hoping for something similar. I don't just want him to be in the position of leader, but to actively manage the war. Can you guys think of something like that? Thank you for your help!
