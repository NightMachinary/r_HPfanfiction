You don't have to name the fanfiction is you don't want to.

For me it was a cross over with a MOD Harry and he was a depressing whiny sad sack who commuted suicide far to many times.


** I read one where he was in boxers, tripped and accidently fell on Ginny. He bursts into tears and locks himself into the bathroom wailing about almost raping Ginny. That was fun.

***** Searching for the Power is the name. I highly recommend reading on FFN because that version includes the hilarious authors notes. As far as smut goes it's pretty bad/good depending on your standards. It certainly isnt an accurate representation of sex and relationships though. There are a number of chapters where the author responds to comments calling out his lack of understanding about how sex works and he goes off on paragraph long IHaveSex rants. Absolutely hilarious.

From a fic standpoint there are some interesting if not unique representations of mind palace type occlumency, a not completely unreadable super!Harry, and a massive loss of steam once the pre fifth year summer is over.

From a pathetic Harry perspective, in addition to bemoaning his almost rape of Ginny, he bemoans the fact that Hermione wants to have sex with him while dating Ron, that Gabrielle wants to be his sex slave, and that he doesn't know what love is because he's never experienced it from the Dursleys. Leading to a grand culmination realization that he's been in love with Hermione, Ginny, and Gabrielle since like chapter two but needed a few dozen chapters and a schedule to bang every named girl in Hogwarts to know for sure.

** Harry from Invincible Technomage. Harry raised by Tony Stark, should be an ultra fucking badass who doesn't take shit from "Authority" figures? Snape smashes his several million dollar datapad he was using to take notes and instead of dealing with it in the Tony Stark way, he APOLOGISES to Snape. Snape who was being a massive cunt, gets an apology like he was in the right. Not even an ironic "I'm sorry... Sorry you're such a prick" sort of apology, it was a genuine "I'm at fault I'm sorry" bullshit.

Like even when he's in the right he starts tearing up and apologizing (this happens alot in Harmony fics) and begging for forgivness its not only stupid but its also out of character. Harry barely apologizes in canon unless he absolutely knows he's wrong OR he's being forced to by someone with more power than him (IE Dursleys or Dumbledore)

** Lazy pick but Cursed Child Harry. He's nothing like Harry in books 1-7 and comes of as edgy!Harry in fanfics without the magical talent/powerwank that comes with it. Hermione calls out Harry for not reading his threat assessments on werewolves/giants and Harry's just like whatever. Harry in DH demanded that Lupin reveal his identity and he's not a trained Auror yet, I don't believe for a second that CC Harry would be so casual about dismissing threats when he's the head of Magical Law Enforcement.

He's also some bizarre mix of Umbridge and Vernon. Aside from the "I wish you weren't my son" comment, he forbids Albus from seeing Scorpius and threatens McGonagall to keep surveillance on Albus or there will be consequences. Aside from his personality change he's inept in combat, needing everyone to take on Delphi and somehow not managing to subdue Draco even though he's an Auror.

*** Let's be honest, much of Cursed Child is just Rowling (and yes, while many like to protect her "legacy" by blaming Jack Thorne the story was hers so he likely just wrote it into play format) wanting to discredit major criticisms of the first few books.

Hermione turns into Umbridge if she doesn't marry Ron because apparently not having kids makes her awful, because it was too much to face criticism that her relationship with Ron was rather tumultuous and somewhat gaslighty at times.

If they saved Cedric he turns evil and becomes a Nazi, because it was too much to point out his death is incredibly contrived by the plot for no real reason.

**** That gets under my nerves so much. The Cedric thing that is.

His death was supposed to be tragic because he was a good person and a needless causality of the war.

Harry helped him, he helped Harry, they formed a friendship too. And in the end Cedric - who's completely innocent - dies, simply because he was with Harry at the time.

His death was terrible, and was supposed to represent the entirety of the coming war. Innocent, good people will die in the cross fire, because that's what happens when you're fighting a war. And it's the reality Harry has to carry with him now. With Cedrics death, Harry loses the very last of his childhood and innocence, and is faced with the harsh reality.

And to make Cedrics death not only unavoidable, but /necessary/ for the greater good? To remove his good nature and the happy life we all assumed he would've lived? To make him a bad guy?

Well, it's disturbing.

*** unpopular opinion, but his characterization made sense to me. I saw the play and I thought it did a good job of explaining Harry's shortcomings; mainly that he suffered from extensive child abuse, and thus has trouble raising kids.

granted, the overall plot and Delphi are quite bad, but I wouldn't call him pathetic. I find it strange that some people criticize JK for glossing over Harry's child abuse, but when CC addresses it and shows how it negatively affects him, now he's being OOC. IMHO, it's not that unusual for Harry to be 1. overprotective 2. obsessively paranoid over the name Malfoy 3. apprehensive of his son, the middle child, who he struggles to connect with.

just to reiterate - not at all defending CC as a whole, but watching the play makes everything click much better. Reading it makes it seem so much worse because the plot is terrible. When it's presented altogether the characterizations make a bit more sense, e.g. I didn't mind comedic relief Ron. Better than useless / lines-stolen-by-Hermione Ron. He's always been quippy even in the books, it fits as a counterplay to broody moody Harry

Him saying that he wishes Albus wasn't his son is close to how canon Harry just lashes out like when he called Remus a coward in DH, but other aspects like how he casually ignores threat assessments when its his job is not a good look. If they showed Harry as a workaholic that ignores his family because he's obsessed with his job it would feel more understandable.

Him telling McGonagall she doesn't understand because she doesn't have kids is just bad writing. Along with threatening her with his position with the Ministry. Just feels like its there for added drama given how Harry respects McGonagall.

Basically if it is somewhat believable within the confines of that fic them is ok with me. But I enjoy canon divergence fic so perhaps that makes me an oddity and I get that people like to keep within canon and look to fan fiction as an extra bit of canon and are trying to expand their canon with fashion but I never really did this just went for the stories on an easy to read setting to escape to.

And of course the author says he's showing how the trope can gi bad but the trope is never about women ruling the world, and the fact it was done to make sure superior men don't subjugate women and when things are overturned it's assumed that will come back.

***** Exactly. And the whole thing is just one big male wet dream. For example the whole harem thing. In this fic universal harems are part of this twisted new order therefore the fic is a deconstruction, so the Harems are special and somehow acceptable compared to orher stories with the same exact paragraphs describing Harry's unique sexual appeal, with headstrong, indepedent young witches like Hermione, Luna, Ginny are overcome out of no where with longing for Harry to shag them on the spot, and the 14-15 year old sex God is just so amazing the girls give up their identity, dignity, shame and self respect just so they can have their turn with him. They're unhappy but willing to share him with others and never get frustrated or upset with him. If they don't blame themselves they turn on one another. This smart deconstruction fic has harems used and described identically to the hoards of poorly written lemons. That says a lot me about the story and the raving reviews and none of it is positive.

No matter how the author and or fans try to frame it as an evil dystopia caused by one group disempowering and Harry is the one who has the gifts to destroy the corrupt system, it comes down to the dystopian universe being evil because women rule over men and naturally being physically and magically weaker the women are forced to have ajy men, taking their wands and the phallic meanings that has on a deeper psychological level. They have to tie their bonds and hide their own secrets from then. Women even when in power are too weak to succeed with their own strengths.

Then theres the standard oversexualizing that is claimed to be instrumental to the plot. it really isn't. The bisexuality may be a reasonable result of demographics but no need to have copious displays of it everywhere just to be titillating. That Harry is a sexual god who can handle not only his Harem but really any woman in existence. Just becausevm witchkins require physical touch that doesnt excuse some may adolescent hook ups and exhibitionism.

The whole series made me feel dirty. Not the way it was intended to because of a corrupt society that obviously needs a complete overhaul. This is because what's wrong with society isn't what yo would expect. Not the legitimizing of sexual enslavement and rape including among minors, not the rising magical rituals to disempower an entire group, not a corrupt oligarchy that has control of society and government.

No the problem is that wen are the ones in control and inflicting these degradations on men. That's the issue and what needs to end. The protagonists heroic journey is to destroy the bonds placed on men to take their naturally superior power they were born with and to return the knowledge of wand creation that they first developed to further enhance their power that has been limited solely to witches, so they can enhance their naturally inferior power and subvert natural law to rule over men. Its mentioned that witches first started this power coup because as weaker beings they has been subjugated by men. The story's protagonists use this as more proof women in charge are angry, bitter, revengeful and have subverted natural order leading to the current dystopia. They dont ever look at a single element of or time in this coup as a just revolution to obtain some form is equality. It's completely without merit. And as such, the heroic battle in this story is the fight to return to what they see is the natural order.

Tom Riddle's group is introduced to show what's unacceptable. It's one thing to want the return to unadulterated or emasculated wizards in power as they should be. The problem is their hatred for women is so deeply embedded they want to rape them all in revenge for the neverending sexual assault Riddle experienced, keep them like animals just to breed and then kill them immediately following.

That's what's evil. Harry follows Morgan, wanting to return to a society where the superior powers wizards are born with are unrestricted, their knowledge of wand creation is returned ensuring they forever more are the rightful rulers of society. Witches they believe, are better off bound only if men desire and without being able to feed off their powers. Wizards will be the benevolent dictators that the weaker, substantially lower powered witches require. That's the future the protagonist and his allys are fighting for. The most jarring thing is it's not just men who want this, it seems that all the "acceptable and good" women support this return to the original ways.

In no universe could I see an in-character Hermiome, Ginny or Luna willing to give their lives to disenfranchise themselves. Fighting the corruption that's been created, the acceptable raping of young boys, the crippling of an entire gender by refusing them wand lore? Yeah I can see that. But not bringing up how the current system came to be, as a result of witches overthrowing the men who were their masters and kept them subjugated and second class their purpose only to serve, entertain and indulge them, essentially slaves. Saying how fat it had come leading to the current ruling class was too far and just flipping everything leaving wizards on top and witches disenfranchised underneath wasnt a solution, they needed a completely new system with the goal of equality. But they don't. They're just there to soothe Harry's ego, feed his physical desires,byelo him on his path.

The whole series reaks of Men's Rights Activism, showing that poor men are the ones society truly discriminates against and disenfranchises, while women are the ones on top, taking men's rightful positions that they can only keep by soending all their time disenfranchising men, discrimination against men in any capacity. Men are the true victims and once women (and often PoC) can no longer create laws giving themselves extra benefits and favors and run out of ways to take men down just for being males, then men will return to their rightful positions on top, as managers, CEOs, politicians. This is because men are the most powerful and worthy and all political correctness is is a way for weaker, less intelligent people to rise above (usually white but not always) men.

Any woman that fights against them is a bitter, ugly, man hating lesbian who hates men because none will sleep with them. Real women know their place, focus on their looks, make up hair and clothes. If they're married they defer their husband for leadership as they should, and stay at home and take care of the home and children which is their naturally given position. The only other appropriate women are young and single, beautiful of course with perfect hair and make up, whoi know their place with me and claim to hate feminists because they believe in the ridiculous notion of gender equality when everyone knows men and women are different and complimentary, men are powerful leaders and women are there to support them. They appear to be educated and well spoken and informed, and get riled up when fighting their own on the behalf of men, but they're not indepdent enough to question the clearly defined gender rules and boundaries or else they lose their attraction to these men and become angry ugly lesbians. Pretty much just look at Fox News's women anchors, Meghan Kelly is a perfect example, she was a MRA darling and now that she stepped away from the party line once... pau.

Or maybe this is just all in my head and its ana amazing story that deserved how often and passionately it is recommended.:shrugs:

** I forgot the name of the author, but he wrote Angry Harry and the Seven and similar tripe.

Basically Harry does one small thing and that somehow snowballs into everything going his way without him doing a damn thing.

The world is handed to him on a silver platter made from a reforged Goblet of Fire, and he acts as though everything that goes right is because he is so awesome.

Oh and this guy has a major hate boner for Gryffindor, and thus Harry is ways soooo~ Slytherin he farts emerald snakes, and tricks the hat into putting him into Not-Slytherin so he doesn't have to associate with the comically evil Slytherins like Malfoy and Snape and their ilk (but not Daphne and Tracy - they're pure angels. Sometimes Millicent is too.)

The tl;dr of this rambling is that the alleged author turns Harry into a Mary Sue and is pathetic even by Mary Sue standards because Harry doesn't even /do/ anything with the Mary Sue powers he was granted.

** The Harrys written by authors who like Hermione wank, especially those who aren't a fan of Hermione's biggest ships and know they won't get enough traction without one of those tags. Harry's turned into a bitch who caves at the merest huff and, for the most part, a dependent who can't function without her.

** Probably the Harry in the Saving Connor series. The prototypical "magically strong, emotionally weak" Harry.

It's made worse by the fact that the series repeatedly turns Harry's character arc into a character loop - Harry has a moment of character progression, we think we're moving on to the next stage of his character arc, but then the author just defaults back to writing Harry in the same pathetic way and the impression of progress turns out to be false.

You could probably cut about 1.5 million words of angst filler from that series without having any negative impact on the plot or character development (and you would substantially improve the latter).
