Harry uncovers a set of diaries his mother had written over her time at Hogwarts.

Eager to get to know her, he begins reading one night...

He learns of her friendships, especially with Snape, and then of the initially antagonistic look towards his father... but that's not all, folks!

Yeah, turns out his mother was a bit batshit insane loopy from the get-go. Worse still, as he reads on utterly baffled and horrified, as puberty hit at around twelve or thirteen for her, she became a tsundere (e.g. Helga from Hey, Arnold!) that grew into an outright yandere on James.

Lily goes on to write things like her "discouraging" other girls' interests in James, behind the scenes, to subtly sabotaging his dates.

Eventually, in her last diary, it goes on about her plans on marrying James and the like... except it's hinting he's trying to GTFO, and she just doesn't see it. She even writes down baby names: "Harry if we have a boy; Rose if we ever have a girl."

Contrary to the rose-tinted glasses people have of her... cuckoo-cuckoo

*** Recently read this: it was... disturbing in some areas, heh. I did like Petunia's bits and Lily's perception of her, though.

** The diary should definitely end with Lily writing in it as Voldermot is coming up the stairs to kill her and Harry. Something along the lines how 'James is bravely fighting Voldermot having gone to face him with a relieved grin on his face obviously to be a hero to his wife and son' ( when in actuality he was so tired of lily that he wanted to get killed by Voldermot just so he wouldn't have to deal with her )

** See, I think this would be hilarious. So much James hate, but outside WBWL fics, Lily is pure and innocent.

I'd read it. :)

*** Even WBWL fics have a habit of trying to avoid Lily bash, usually by just not making her into her own character but rather more of a trophy wife for James -- something pretty to look at but without her own agency. Which is arguably even worse than bashing because at least in those fics, she is her own person...

The only time I see Lily-bash really is in 70s Slytherin whitewashing fics, typically with Regulus, Severus and sometimes the Malfoys.

***** Not a problem, bud! When written well and organically, they're quite interesting to see in a character.
