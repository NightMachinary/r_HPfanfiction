Like the title says. Most Want of a Nail fics I've seen tend to stick very close to the original story with major plot points happening more or less on schedule regardless of any changes.

I want fics that start from year 1, make a small change then actually deviate from cannon as a result of accumulating changes.


** What is "want of a nail" ? I've seen this be used to categorize fics in the last few weeks, but didn't see any explanation of what it is.

*** Basically, the butterfly effect -- a tiny change somewhere in the universe spirals the world into a /very different/ direction.

A lot of fics start with canon with a single point of divergence, and explores the results of said divergence. What OP is looking for is fics where the change is such a change that it makes the universe take a /very/ different outcome.

An example: Several fics explore Slytherin!Harry. This is a point of divergence at the Sorting -- a very large one, in theory. But yet, usually, a lot of the canon story remains the same, just with a slightly different coat of paint -- say, the Golden Trio remains, just now it's Draco instead of Ron, for example. That is what the OP is trying to avoid. This is very easy to write, and isn't really unrealistic for a lot of the things that happen in canon. But you can also write Slytherin!Harry as producing a completely different story with different events without it being unrealistic. Maybe the entire CoS debacle ends up different, doesn't happen at all (maybe Draco is friends with Harry now, and Lucius doesn't want to jeopardize this by dragging a Horcrux into Hogwarts), for example.

***** Not quite the same thing. (You can have a divergence fic without significant butterfly effect).

Plus 'want of a nail' isn't quite the same as butterfly effect:

Butterfly Effect: Chaos Theory that 'A butterfly flapping it's wings in Kansas could cause a tornado in China'. Used to describe why large changes happen in time travel/divergence situations, generally without explanation on how.

Domino Effect: Chain Reaction, usually used to describe situations where one change goes through a series of (logical) steps to cause a very different one. Basically Butterfly effect but explained.

"want of a nail": From the poem, explicitly talking about a Domino effect where a minor, insignificant change causes a massive, significant effect through a series of events, each one getting progressively bigger...

*** One small change leads to vastly different situations.

So, in this case; lets say "What if Harry had his own room at the Dursleys?" or "What if Harry develops an interest in, I don't know, some muggle sport?"

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

** I love this idea, but:

Not everything would be derailed (GoF would probably still happen, even if you change a ton of stuff at Hogwarts (even removing Dumbledore might not stop this - they after all planned this for YEARS!)) as not everything is directly influenced by certain changes, but yeah:

Many things would change if you for example make Harry more intelligent, curious and attentive :)

*** See I think that while the Triwizard Tournament still happens no matter what, Voldemorts plot can only happen if Peter is allowed to escape at the end of year 3.

No Peter, no one to help Voldemort out so the entire plot falls apart.

**** Depends on how close to canon you stick. You could have Barty Crouch Jr. seek out Voldemort after escaping (you could have them find Bertha Jorkins after the World Cup and plan then), then have them seek out another Death Eater to help them (maybe make Karkaroff a loyal Death Eater and he's the one who puts Harry's name in). Hell, the R-Series by Regulus has Mad-Eye Moody actually being a Death Eater the whole time. When diverging from canon there are plenty of routes you can take to have certain events happen in different ways.

** So an example of the kind of thing I'm looking for is linkffn(For Love of Magic) Harry Potter has a different upbringing and changes accumulate rapidly going entirely off the rails by year 3

An example of what I am NOT looking for is linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff) which is an amazing story (still in progress) but sticks very close to cannon which isn't what I'm looking for right now.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
