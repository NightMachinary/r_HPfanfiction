Fics where Harry is something like Otto von Bismarck or Augustus Caesar. I have already read Emperor btw. I would prefer no bashing and not a lot of romance. Thanks in advance.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp
