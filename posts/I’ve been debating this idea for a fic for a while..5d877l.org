I am actually unsure if I should add onto the two chapters I already have or just tuck it away for ages and leave it in my ‘do not continue' folder.

What I have so far is Salazar Slytherin had a son, and the story follows him. The first chapter is pretty much defending the castle and then the boy is swept away into the Chamber of Secrets where Salazar promises to come back for him after the castle is safe. Salazar forces his son into a magical sleep and leaves.

The events of Chamber of Secrets rouse the boy and he quickly finds that everything is wrong. He searches for his father and leaves the Chamber, following the black-haired boy, and commands the basilisk to hide (sparing it). He runs out into the Great Hall in his tunic and realises that everything is much different.

He's quickly bought up to speed and the rest I'm not sure of yet. I'm still jotting things down, but meh. Advice is appreciated... whether it's ideas or informing me to stop x)


** The obvious opportunity is to give modern mages first-hand stories of Salazar Slytherin, either confirming or confounding pure-blood ideology (or a mix of both). Develop your own story of Salazar (other fanfics have already done so, so be original). Maybe his ideology evolved over his life (the Salazar who left Hogwarts may have been very different from the Salazar who first helped found Hogwarts). Your character might even have a muggle mother (there were no wizarding settlements before Hogsmeade was founded at the same time as Hogwarts, so muggle spouses could have been common).

Will your character be courted or condemned by modern pure-bloods? Will he be happy with how his father's House has evolved? Is there a Slytherin inheritance waiting for him somewhere? (probably not Gringotts since, canon, the bank was created almost five centuries after Hogwarts -- but maybe it got moved there when the bank opened?) He's also likely a parselmouth, so will have the same public perception problems as Harry (will he be shunned by light-siders and thus pulled into pure-blood circles, or will he be friends with the only other parselmouth: Harry?).

How will this change Harry's story? (because I'm tired of reading stories with original characters who don't actually change the canon plot)

#+end_quote

Are you talking about Harry? Tom was also described as a "black-haired boy" but I'll assume Harry because Tom didn't go anywhere. Did your character leave the chamber and then follow Harry back into the chamber (where the basilisk is)? Or did he hide the basilisk before he left the chamber (when Ginny and Tom are still in there)? I'm not clear on exactly which "events" caused him to waken. And why didn't he wake up when Tom first opened the chamber in 1942-3?

*** I have already planned out Salazar's arc! I just didn't want to go into it as it's a spoiler! :)

I'm not sure yet. He'll have different believes from what people say, but they could be bias because Salazar is his father. As for money, nope. He'll be dirt poor. The Slytherin line won't have a vault as Salazar kept everything in the Chamber/Hogwarts. He and Salazar primarily speak Parseltongue. It'll be joyful when he speaks it in the Great Hall!

I want to tie him and Harry together closely. He doesn't believe in the house rivalries, so he doesn't really care for Gryffindors a she and Godric were quite close. Him being there will change everything! I want it to change everything. I'm just not sure what yet. Voldemort will be threatened by him as he is by proxy the Slytherin heir :p

Sorry! He followed Harry. The Chamber scene will be different -- the basilisk needs to survive.

Another plot-hole I need to fix up. I was debating that Tom was alone and Slytherin blood, but when Harry came in, he was waken because of an intruder. Another part was that Harry stabs the basilisk, but not killing it, and that wakes him up.

Thank you for commenting. It's good to talk about it. :p

The phrasing here is unclear. He "doesn't really care for Gryffindors" implies that he doesn't like them. Did you mean he's generally indifferent, along the lines of "if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you."

This does sound very, very good. No, seriously, this is how you do a game-changer. Bravo.

That's what's going to shock everyone because he'll talk to everyone. He'll sneak into the Hufflepuff common room and mess around, attempt to get into the Ravenclaw common room and fail because he sucks at riddles.

I cannot write Luna, sadly... I had a few things in mind, especially her asking about old creatures and him just being baffled.

********* He's ten. :p

Back in his age, they were open places for them to study and be taught by the founders. I can go into this a bit more without spoiling much.

Salazar prided cunning and in order to be taught by him, you had to be sneaky. You had to sneak into his teaching area undetected.

Godric prided courage and in order to be apart of his lessons, you had to stand up to something and show that you can be brave.

Helga prided compassion and friendship and allowed anyone, but you had to be friendly and open to be taught by her. Her house was by far the hardest to get into as you had to be genuinely helpful and friendly. (knowing how to cook was bonus points!)

Rowena prided knowledge and talent and you had to answer a question to be accepted.

Still working on those for a more in-depth explanation. But students had no idea when they were being tested and they had to do it on their own intuition. The Sorting Hat was implemented after Salazar and his heir went MIA.

Two primary questions about how this will affect the climax:

Excellent question and something I seriously overlooked. I want her to live, but I'm not sure how I can fit it in. He may be 1,000 years old, but he doesn't have 1,000 years of knowledge. I also don't want the basilisk to die, so I'm not sure how to handle this.

Another thing that I overlooked. The sword won't be imbued with basilisk venom. I was debating about having him ask the basilisk for some venom or something.

**** Maybe have Slytherin's son wake just as the basilisk is about to attack? However he has to fight Voldemort's influence over it and only gets control over it just as Harry has retrieves the sword. Initially he can only order it not to kill with it's gaze eliminating the need to blind the basilisk and he does not get the full control over it until Harry is standing on the head of Salazar, about to stab the basilisk, and the main character manages to override Voldemort's orders by virtue of being a more direct heir than Voldemort?\\
By having the final, overriding, order come just as the basilisk is about to strike and have it "spill" some venom on the sword, the sword still gets the venom and thus the ability to destroy horcruxes. Then he could have the basilisk bite the diary in two before retreating, not so much for the effect of killing the horcrux or saving Ginny (which are the side effects) but rather to deny Tom any influence over the basilisk.

***** I was debating something like that, actually. I was toying with the idea that the basilisk knew the boy and would do what he says over Voldemort, but it'd take some convincing.

I also toyed with the idea of Godric's sword not being in the fight at all and that it simply always had the ability to destroy horcruxes. :p I can see Godric killing basilisks.

That's the issue I'm dealing with now, though. There's so many different paths I can take regarding this small change.

At the risk of repeating myself, I encourage you /not/ to find ways to steer the story back onto the canon path. If you have a basilisk, you don't /need/ the sword.

In fact, maybe you don't even need horcruxes, maybe Voldemort found some other way to survive death and the diary is in fact just a memory. Then you can avoid the inevitable horcrux hunt ("oh, I wonder where Hufflepuff's Cup could be?!").

******* That was an issue I also had as the boy (sorry, I haven't a name for him yet) would be curious on where their prized possessions went. Helga's cup, Rowena's Diadem, his locket? I'm sure he'd look for them. It's things like this that made me make a thread this time around.

I don't want to be pulled into canon as then it'll turn into another canon rehash with an OC as a leader. No, you make a great point there and I need to make the scene different.

Also a very good idea. That also allows me to make Voldemort less insane and rash and more the leader that allowed him to get into a position of power -- amping up his power and threat in the process. The only issue i have now is for the reason for the possession... maybe a distraction so the non-dead Voldemort can try to get back to his immortality method.

You have given me much to think about. Thank you!

**** If SoSS wakes up during the fight between Harry and the basilisk, then SoSS could order the basilisk to stop fighting so he can find out what's going on and let Harry and Tom explain their sides (which he can check by talking to the basilisk).

On the one hand, Tom is presumably a greatX-grand-nephew of SoSS and possibly the only family he has left. I assume SoSS hasn't had any children so it must have been a sibling whose descendent married into the Gaunts.

On the other hand, Harry can argue that Tom is trying to kill Hogwarts students (including 11yo Ginny lying /right there/), turned out to be a dark lord (and if restored would probably see another heir of Slytherin only as a rival), and also ... dead (and thus maybe not really relevant as family).

Tom has already pointed out to Harry that he's a "memory ... Preserved in a diary..." so once SoSS chooses Harry, they can try to destroy the diary (presumably SoSS has a wand, so maybe he engages Tom while Harry works on the diary -- or maybe he orders the basilisk to fight Tom while both Harry and SoSS work on the diary). When conventional methods fail (it's a book -- first Harry would try to just rip pages out or something), SoSS could tell the basilisk to bite it (or maybe the basilisk even volunteers to bite it).

Basilisk bites book, Tom disappears wailing, Ginny wakes up. No phoenix (and thus no debt to Dumbledore if you want to go that way), no Sorting Hat, no Sword of Gryffindor.

***** Yeah. The only issue with that is that he's about ten and I doubt his first choice of words would be to talk it out. All three of them can speak Parseltongue, so it'd be easy to arrange a conversation in the language.

The boy is the last Slytherin in name. He had a sister who had kids of her own and eventually married into the Gaunt line. I'll have to redo both family trees for it to make sense. :p An onslaught of OC are going to be used so it can somewhat be completed.

I did debate the boy stabbing the diary with a dagger that he was given by Godric, which was quite obviously soaked in basilisk venom, but I like the idea of the two working together in order to bring down Tom. It's something I'll toy with.

**** Does there need to be a large confrontation though? Surely if he follows Ginny from the chamber to the great hall that would make her obviously the heir which would tip off Harry (only person he could talk to, parselmouth) who would then tell Dumbledore. On the sword thing, I would simply not have it appear, it's in the hat and without Harry drawing it out in his time of need, there it should stay. There are plenty of intersting ways the horcrux could be dealt with without he sword.
