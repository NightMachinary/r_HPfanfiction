I love Huna/Larry (any better names?), But the vast majority of luna-centred fics have her walking around like a total lunatic (pun not intended). All she does is walk around like a wood nymph, and the only things she talks about is spewed nonsense of her imaginary animals and for some reason or another harry finds it hot.

If someone made/suggested me a fic where Luna is still a human, but either some sort of Seer or just a broken girl which hides her pain behind happy animals only she can see, I'd be happy. If her speech was anything more than "hey Harry, me and my crumple-horned snorcack was talking to a Blibbering Humdinger when we heard a nargle talking about naught stuff. Let's have sex now.", I'd be happy.

Luna isn't a seer or on crack. She is quite similar to canon, with a lot more maturity than what you see in most fanfiction.

  Harry Potter returns to school after a first year filled with peril, brotherly battles and a changing world. Conflict follows from school to Privet Drive and back to school, where an altogether too mysterious man of fame and fortune is their new Defence teacher - and it only becomes worse when the Petrifications start.
