Finally got back to drafting a story I was doing after a very shitty July (being hospitalized is very inconvenient, as it turns out). Anyway, one of the things I wanted to do was - based on a recommendation I received and agreed with - channel Hermione's activist mindset into her goals post-Hogwarts in my HP/Avengers MCU crossover.

The idea that came to my mind involved the question what exactly the wizarding world would think of the mutants (no reality warpers will exist because that's just boring; also no X-men school). What would they call them? Since they're stronger than Squibs and possess unnatural powers (though not supernatural in origin) would they be amenable to helping them? That sort of thing. What do you think the lay of the land would be in terms of general outlook among different wizards (especially Purebloods vs muggleborns, if you think they'd be different).

I don't want to explain why Hermione isn't at the Ministry at this point (just assume she got her House elf rights stuff through (and axed pureblood preferences in law and such) and Kingsley reformed the government). But I figure she would come down on the "Let's help them side", in spite of the possible bad consequences (like Muggles catching on). Thoughts much appreciated!


** Ultimately, I think it doesn't matter what the wizards think of mutants - what matters more is what the Muggles think of wizards. Any anti-mutant bigotry among Muggles is going to carry over onto wizards as well, because in the eyes of the ignorant public, there's not much visible difference. Young Muggleborns will get fingered as mutants for accidental magic, adult wizards carelessly deploying magic where the people can see it will get labeled the same...they all hang together, pretty much.

Additionally, since in the Harry Potter world the Muggle governments have contact with and knowledge of the wizarding world, when the first mutants start showing up the Muggle leadership will probably take one look at the teenagers spewing fireballs or lifting textbooks with their minds and whatnot and wash their hands of the matter. It's all just magic, right? Sure, they're not waving wands around, but /holy crap/, that kid just teleported out of jail, and he's /blue/, and we already have a whole /parallel society/ for dealing with weird rubbish like this! So, congratulations, Ministry of Magic! New taxpayers. Better start hiring more Obliviators for overtime, and draft up some more Aurors, cause as of right now, Magneto is /your/ responsibility. Oh, and Deadpool too, probably. Good luck with that Statute of Secrecy business. You'll need it.

To actually deal with wizarding perceptions, though...I could see the wizards being split on the issue. The usual blood purists might find common cause with Muggleborns raised to hate mutants who are extremely relieved that actually they are /wizards/ and not dirty muties. The majority would probably be very sympathetic to mutants, though, even including a lot of purebloods; the Muggles are lashing out against a subgroup of strange people with fantastic, reality-defying powers (against a superior race, maybe some purebloods would argue), which should sound familiar. It's a modern witch hunt. Watching that sort of thing go down would probably reinforce any existing currents of xenophobia and insularism in the wizarding world, and sympathetic wizards might start inducting at-risk mutants into magical society. A political climate like that could even help Voldemort, if it happens while he's still around, especially if he himself reaches out to mutants for power's sake. He could transition from pureblood supremacy, to /non-Muggle/ supremacy, pick up a mutant following, emphasize the barbarity of Muggles to the wizarding public to build that base up, play up the fears of wizards being abducted for experimentation like mutants...it could make him a lot more widely popular if he plays his cards right, and thus vastly more dangerous.

As a side bit, I imagine with the existence of telepaths, occlumency might suddenly become an extremely popular skill to develop. Just a thought...

Note: I am assuming I remember X-men lore right - ie, that mutants are a persecuted minority hated/experimented on by homo sapiens.

EDIT: Additionally, while it might be arguable whether mutants should be treated as wizards or not, if they aren't considered wizards then it's not like they'd be the first non-wizard magic users protected by the Statute and hidden away. Goblins, centaurs, dragons, and various other magical creatures are all hidden to keep Muggles ignorant of the supernatural; mutants in the HP world would probably get the same treatment, at the very least.

*** From what I know of mutants this seems right to me. The only thing is, that I see the elitist purebloods being particularly opposed (and most certainly Voldemort as well), they'd consider mutants as abominations/threats, rather than brethren .

I believe they'd be treated as another magical race akin to Centaurs and Goblins, as you say.

**** Purebloods might very well be opposed, but I think Voldemort would see a use for them, at the absolute very least in the same way he sees a use for werewolves and giants, and would want to court them. He wants power, mutants would be a road to that, especially since Muggle persecution would probably predispose a lot towards his anti-Muggle views. Placing them as equals to pureblood wizards in his new order might be farfetched unless they make significant contributions that raise their esteem in his eyes, but there'd be a place imo.

Could go either way - a full fanfic could flesh either direction out.

*** I should note that the SoS is still in affect. So Muggles don't know about magic even though mutants are known about. At least in HP canon, only Heads of State in government know about wizards. And it's post Second War so Voldemort is less relevant (though not completely; woo-woo mystery~)

Other than that, this is great. Thank you!. The Occlumency bit came to my mind as well. The only thing I'm not sure of is the application of the SoS to mutants. Since they're abilities aren't magical. I figure their inclusion (especially since the Muggles already know about mutants) would be a highly contentious issue among wizards.

**** I'm not sure that canon occlumency is all that magical, actually. It's just forcing your mind to be clear and /stay/ clear while someone else prods at it, as well as forcibly suppressing memories and emotions. That all sounds like stuff anyone could do, and it sounds like it would be effective against mutant mind reading as well as legilimency.

As for the governments...heads of state knowing is more than enough, I think. I just cannot see any scenario in which the Muggle government, already having a branch dedicated to lunacy like metal men, furry blue teleporters, humanoid supercancer, and people being artificially too lucky for their own good, would /not/ pass the buck on mutants over to them. Honestly, it all sounds right up the Ministry of Magic's alley, whether it's /really/ magic or not. I doubt in the HP world, mutants would get too broadly known before the government branded them as magicals and shooed the Obliviators in to make the scary magnet man go away. A few Muggle-worthy excuses and an enchanted book to list newly-revealed mutants later, and boom - mutants become just as laughably mythological as wizards and dragons.

Good luck writing, by the way - more HP stories with mutants in them are always a good thing :D

***** Well, Snape calls it the "magical defense of the mind" so I assume magic has to be involved in how they suppress memories and emotions when being scrutinized.

It's not so much that they wouldn't want to let the magicals handle them, but I don't think they could really do anything to make them since the mutants aren't technically the problems of wizards. Since only the heads of state know (courtesy of obliviators) I suspect they wouldn't be able to setup an agency to try and pressure people no one else knows exists. ;)

And thanks! Your feedback has been really helpful!

** I figure they'd either see them as disabled wizards or jumped-up Muggles.

On the one hand, their abilities /look/ like magic, albeit rather limited in scope (no mutant would be able to pass an O.W.L. exam). So wizards' first impression might be that they are like disabled wizards.

But on the other hand, their powers aren't magical and so from the perspective of magic, they're still Muggles. They'd still be repelled by Muggle-repelling Charms, wouldn't be able to make potions, etc. Once wizards realised this, I think their approach would shift.

*** What do you think their approach would shift to? I agree with the other stuff. I see the issue playing out politically as the "against" side arguing that since mutants aren't magical, risking the SoS to hide them isn't worth the risk. But the pro side making the argument that it's essentially a modern day witch hunt and i think that's a strong emotional argument for wizards for obvious reasons.

I can't think of what wizards would call them either. "Midlings" sounds just insulting enough but not sure it sounds very HP, heh.

** I think that the muggleborns/half bloods would either think there really cool or really weird since they would know muggles better and know it's not regular in the least, while the purebloods would most likely see them as greater biengs than muggles.

** Depends on the era of the X-Men your basing the story on, but if its early Claremont I could see Wizards rounding up Mutants seeing them as some sort of new magical creature threatening the SoS.

Also there are a number of mutant's that are capable of using magic in the comics so its not like the two are mutually exclusive.

*** Since mutants aren't new, I'm making the assumption wizards already know they exist like the Muggles do. But since most mutants don't have magic, and there powers don't come from magic, I suspect they'd fear the risk exposing themselves (Muggles will notice if a bunch of super powered people vanish). Since I'm sure you're way more familiar with the comics than me, how do you think the mutants would view the wizards offering them safety?

Yea Wanda comes to mind. Obviously can't go with her MCU background, but something like House of M would violate my "no reality warping mutants" stipulation. Mutants like her are a good point though, I might have them used as a sort of bridge or catalyst those in favor of helping them might mention.

**** Part of why I mentioned the Claremont is because that was the origins. Muggles as a whole didn't know about mutants who made up a minute percentage of the population. The other part is most mutants didn't really have super powers so much as strange physiologys, Beast is a good representative of the majority of mutants from the era. Those that made up the X-Men were the eXception, not the rule.

What is magic is inherently hard to define but it should be mentioned that Tonks could easily be a mutant. As for how wizards approach mutants, I'm guessing Dumbledore would use his influence to reach out in much the same manner as with muggleborns offering an explanation for why one doesn't fit in with muggles and yes unicorns are real. What if anything wizards can actually offer mutants that the muggle world can't is hard to say but there are a ton of sentient magical beings besides wizards in the wizarding world. Compliance might be forced if wizards feel entitled to mutants in some way.

I actually totally forgot about Wanda, I was thinking of Selene the original Black Queen, Storm, Dani Moonstar, Madelyne Pryor, and Magik.

***** Ah, good points. That "eXception" joke tho...

Good point about the Metamorphmagus. I figure Parsletounge could count as well, though it's less impressive. I should note as I say in the OP, this is after the second wizarding war so Dumbledore is long dead. I suppose my idea is that since wizards are well used to strange, fantastical abilities (and strange creatures, such as goblins) mutants might feel more welcome there. Or at least, more willing to accept help setting up safe communities under the auspices of the ICW.

****** Are you planning to use the entire MCU, or primarily the X-Men? The majority of x-men comics basically exist in their own universe even thought they are technically tied in.

Marvel uses a sliding timeline so its hard to really lock a lot of dates down anyways. Traditionally mutants starting showing up after the atomic bomb which is why they were originally teenagers in the 60's, but there were plenty of mutants before for various reasons. First Class touched on that plot thread.

My suggestion to rectify things would be to have the amount of mutants slowly increase during the 20th century with the proliferation of nuclear testing reaching a tipping point about 15 years before the story begins, maybe the Chernobyl disaster.

As Sinister, Wolverine, and others were active during WW2 it wouldn't be too surprising if Dumbledore knew something of mutants. Harry could meet Magnito at Dumbledore's funeral or something.

Mutants could have interesting affects on the Wizarding World as their population continues to swell and a vocal minority are not content to hide now that I think of it. Might be interesting to see how wizards deal with telepaths as well.

******* It's primarily focused on the MCU. The role of mutants in the story is more related to Hermione. I got a suggestion earlier, when I wasn't sure how to draft certain parts of my story, where the person suggested that Hermione's activist mindset is important to her character. So since I had already made the decision that she and Harry had gotten all they wanted out of the Ministry, I needed to come up with some kind of underclass of people Hermione would be focused on trying to improve the rights of as her main "thing". Although not in canon MCU, mutants seemed to fit the bill.

Dumbledore knowing Wolverine could be very possible here. Although it was for a short time, he was out in continental Europe to go and fight Grindlewald at the same time WW2 was raging. Might have it mentioned off hand. Closest thing I have to this is the Ancient One appearing at Dumbledore's funeral in my current draft of the first chapter, where she eventually teaches the trio some more esoteric magic later in the chapter.

Hah, the telepath thing came to my mind as well. Occlumency might become more popular, heh. Mostly I'm trying to work out how the mutants and wizards would view each other. I got some good suggestions from others on how wizards might see mutants. How do you think mutants might view the wizards? As potential allies with a similar history (the Xavier types) or as weaklings not crushing those inferior than themselves (Magneto mindset)?

******** Depends to a large degree how accepting wizards are, but I don't really think mutants would like wizards. Hagrid claimed that the reason wizards hid was in large part because don't want to be bothered to fix muggles problems. No idea how true that is, but I imagine its a common sentiment.

I doubt that sort of complacent "I've got mine" attitude endears wizards to outsiders, and mutants would probably see them as apathetic if not complicit and potential oppressors considering how flagrantly the ministries of magic manipulate their muggle counterparts in canon.

** Well I personally think that the Wizarding world would see Mutants like monsters, these are people usually Muggles or those with Muggle blood who in rare cases have abilities on par or far exceeding those of wizards.

Many on the light side would probably jump to the idea of 'help them' in particular Hermione and Harry, both personally know that when faced with incredible abilities at young ages (Most Mutants come to light at Puberty so like 11-14). I don't know about pureblood characters who could see Mutants as a threat to them and their society.
