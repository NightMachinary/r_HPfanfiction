Any good fics where the triwizard is different (I love crackfics, so those a great)

I already posted looking for fics where Harry's name didn't come out of the goblet, but reddit isn't letting me link it.


** My own linkffn(Like A Red Headed Stepchild) features a very different Triwizard Tournament. None of the tasks are the same, and the champions are altered as well. It is, however, certainly a crack fic.

The Triwizard Arch starts on Chapter 23.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Plenty of fics:

linkffn(The Lie I've Lived by jbern): if you can stand the bashing and Fleur characterization, its a great read.

linkffn(The Mind Arts): more recent, still ongoing TWT tournament, but the AU world here promises interesting ideas.

linkffn(The Accidental Animagus): this one takes a long time to get to, but the tasks are mildly interesting if a bit overly complicated.

linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School): a very AU world, but with the exception of the first task most of the events are totally unpredictable.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
