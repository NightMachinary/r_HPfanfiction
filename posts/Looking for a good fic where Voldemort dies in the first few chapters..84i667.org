I've read several good fics recently that deal with killing Voldemort in a variety of ways and then the fic ends, now I'm looking for something a little different.

I'm looking for something where Voldy dies in the first few chapters and then the story moves on from there. No next generation stuff, doesn't *have* to be romance, any choice of pairings is fine. Doesn't have to be canon compliant.

I would prefer for it to be reasonably well written and complete but a bunch of chapters is ok too.


** Several very nice time travels kill him off within a few chapters and then focus on how the main character adjusts to the new environment:

** linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) - It's not really a couple of chapters in, but it disposes of Voldemort pretty quickly IMO. Majority of the story happens after Voldemort dies and the plot mostly isn't about defeating him. It's well written and it's about to be completed.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
