So, I've been reading Magicks Of The Arcane ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8303194/1/]]) and i know the author has written some lemons related to the story. The problem is that i have no idea where to find them. Does anybody know where to look for them?

**** DLP's Work by Author section.

And NOW is as far as I'm willing to go in that conversation. Evil things lie down that road.

** The author has a reddit account, but afaik he's usually on [[/r/narutofanfiction]] rather than here. If anyone knows where to find them, or has a copy backed up somewhere, it'll be him, although he's not been that active lately so I'm not sure if/when he'll see this. [[/u/eilyfe]], I hope you don't mind me attempting to summon you.

Joking aside, I pulled the one lemon I wrote for artistic reasons. Sorry to say, but it's not coming back.

(It's also not in the DLP WbA because I wrote it long before joining the community.)

Not sure if you got a notification, but I got a reply from Eilyfe, although it's unfortunately not the one you wanted.
