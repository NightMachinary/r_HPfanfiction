***** Believe me, you can wait until you're old and grey and your teeth fall out before someone else recs your fics on here. Truthfully, the vast majority of recs are the same ones that keep going round and round. Every now and then a new one is added to the list, but generally it seems that people just keep reading the same things, never try anything new, don't look for themselves and most importantly don't trust their own judgement.

If I sound salty, yes I am a bit, but I don't write fanfiction any more so I feel fairly objective about it these days.

***** True, but that may it a bit difficult with the amount of new stories and updated stories pushing their stories out of the way in that less people are able to view them. Although fanfiction for Harry Potter isn't what it used to be, there are still so many new stories and stories updated daily that it's overwhelming and has certainly overpopulated the feed where these stories that are self-promoted here, are able to gain traction.

By which you are saying that a fic that doesn't get recommended isn't worth reading. I really really hope that isn't true. And I don't believe for a fraction of a second that it is. But it's very sad that it probably is the general opinion on here.

** I see no way this thread can possibly end badly. /s

I think people here sometimes get a little too wrapped up in their preferred interpretation of a character (whether that interpretation be rooted in canon or fanon or whatever) and, in the process, lose sight of the fact that this is a /fanfiction/ community. There's nothing in the job description of a fanfic author that says they must adhere to canon, let alone an internet rando's headcanon.

So yeah, weird ships like Draco/Hermione or Harry/Bellatrix would make negative sense in canon, but in the world of fanfiction it's more than possible for the author to make up some reason for it to happen. It might be contrived, it might be cliche, it might be utterly ridiculous and doomed to failure, but that's their perogative, not yours.

(...or maybe I'm thinking of some of the discussions I've seen on [[/r/harrypotter]] and mistakenly putting them here in my mind.)

This would also apply to non-ship topics, that was just the first thing that came to mind.

*** In my experience, [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] is /way/ more keen on the canon ships than [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]]. The general consensus over there is that Ginny was the perfect partner for Harry, and Ron for Hermione, and there was no other possible way the ending could have turned out.

Over here, it's openly admitted that Ginny's growth as a character and as a potential partner for Harry was poorly developed in OotP/HBP (that chest monster thing), and Ron, while not being the dumb glutton that fanon makes him out to be, doesn't have that much romantic chemistry with Hermione outside of moments of mutual jealousy.

It's pretty interesting to compare the differences. I've also found that [[/r/harrypotter][r/harrypotter]] isn't a good place to ask about AU scenarios. If you asked "What if Harry didn't tell the Sorting Hat to avoid Slytherin?" there, you'd get a few lukewarm responses or be ignored completely outside of Discussion Week. But you'd get many good responses and fic recs exploring that idea here.

I think Harry/Hermione is a fandom phase. It's popular, and like Harry/Ginny, it will always be popular, but it's past the point of saturation. Now people are interested in newer, more exciting pairings like Harry/Katie or Harry/Susan.

Tbh though, and this is perhaps generalizing but is based on multiple main fandom subs I'm part of and have been on, the majority view on any main fandom subs (HP, GOT, AOS, some of the anime subs) leans toward a kind of 'might is right' view of storytelling. That is, if X is the way it happened in canon or was written, it must make sense and be The Right Way to see things just by virtue of being the creator's choice and if you see it differently, you are wrong and Also Rude and why are you attacking our poor creator?! Can't you be supportive, fake fan?!

I feel on the more text based subs there's (slightly) more open-mindedness towards discussing the multiplicity of options that a story starts, and I feel that part of that is bc as I've seen mentioned before, fanfiction is a creative form of literary criticism, just like how essays and that are a purely critical form. More of us are writers or have studied literature/media, and so approach discussions more as a what if/sandbox based on lines of logic and characterization and where that /could/ go to, compared to the main subs where it comes down to more of a black and white moral ruling based in knowledge of the core text, or whatever of it is currently released.

**** I think that Ginny could have been fleshed out more as a character, but out of all the Canon characters, Ginny, Hermione, and Luna (always thought she would marry Harry before book 7 because of her last name and the fact Rowling has a character named Remus Lupin as a werewolf) I think had enough closeness to Harry to eventually progress that far. That being said, Ron is depicted worse, Hermione is depicted as some sort of goddess or is bashed to the extreme, nothing in between (I feel her character lacked character growth in the later books myself). Luna is for some reason a seer, when in Canon she's just a smart, open-minded, trusting girl. And the martyr complex is something to fix. The subreddit is way opinionated on these things though.

- Some fanon becomes so entrenched that people discuss it every day as if it were canon, until they're reminded it's not (I was just reminded that an "Occlumency book" was not canon). I think we should do re-reads as a sub event.

- There are so many excellent fics, especially on FFN, that I wouldn't have encountered were it not for this sub. I avoided FFN for years because I viewed it as the province of talentless hacks. Recs from here have led me to real gems.

** I'll be straight up honest, 9 times out of ten I'll read a published book when I want a clear and concise well thought out story that's fun to read but has more facets than just, “independent Harry” or “Harry the fuck boi” or “Harry angst riddled Potter”.

That's not to say that there aren't some amazing fanfics, but for every fanfic that has emotionally moved me, there are thousands that are just poor excuses for having two different characters hook up. For example, if I'm being perfectly honest, I think jeconais kinda writes like shit, it's pretty bad in terms of realistic writing (by that I mean, I can't imagine a real life human, even one with magic, talking or acting like they do in jeconais fics), but I've enjoyed a couple of jeconais stories purely because it was a fun escape from reality, to imagine Harry decked out in armor and a sword fighting a dragon, while written a bit funky, it is a fun thing to imagine.

That's my hot take on fan fiction, but I think that some of the more vocal members of this sub have a very much opposite approach. It seems like the very vocal people read fan fiction and only fan fiction, I'm probably wrong in that regard but that's the feeling that comes across, and so because their only reading materiel is fan fiction they feel like they have to justify why they like a specific type over another, that's why you'll hear people talking against “bad” pairings or why daphne /totally/ would have hooked up with Harry, or any other justification really.

You also have people on the other side who like canon too much, and seem to believe that means they can shut down nearly anyone who wants or likes something that is very much non cannon. I've seen people start fights because cannon Harry was sarcastic not a wimp, Indy, angsts, horny, or other character trope favored by fanfics. And those people who start fights saying Harry was sarcastic and not one of those other things don't seem to do so because they find those other Harry's written poorly, they start fights because that Harry is too far away from canon. They may not come out of the gates with that reasoning, but they have it and will show it to you if press them about it enough.

Anyway, I'll be the first to admit that when I read a romance fic I often times choose them based on the pairing, and often those pairings are a bit wacky and don't necessarily fit well in canon(I personally have a soft spot for Harry/fleur). I don't like slash, between females or guys, doesn't matter, it's just something that I find off putting and I'll openly admit that. I think everyone should really just mind their business and enjoy what they enjoy and leave everyone else alone.

If you're someone who likes more canon-esque fics, then when you see a request asking for fics where Harry bangs a lot of dudes and then does the same to their wives, maybe just stay away, no need to tell that person that Harry would never do that. And if you're the guy who's really into Harry banging dudes and then their wives, maybe don't pick a fight about whether or not fanfiction is meant to rehash canon or not when someone posts a request asking for canon compliant DH fics where the romance between Ron and hermione , and Harry and Ginny is fleshed out.

I know this stuff isn't happening all the time, most people already tend to stay in their camps, but even though fights aren't being picked super often I think people should really learn to recognize that there can be two separate and a valid viewpoints on an issue.

Tl;Dr people should respect other people's opinions and not get pissy over conflicting ideas about what fanfics should be

--------------

--------------

- Most readers who are into Harry/Fleur, Harry/Tonks, or Harry/Bellatrix don't really care about the characters. They just like the archetypes of the sexy unapproachable ice princess, the goofy girl next door who can make her boob dimensions fit anyone's personal taste, or the BDSM kinkster who will do anything m'lord wishes.

- Most readers who are into Hermione/Draco, Hermione/Snape, or Hermione/Voldemort don't really care about the characters. They just like the fantasy of a rich, powerful, and/or influential guy falling in love with a plain, geeky, relatable bookworm.

- If you don't like slash, you shouldn't try to come up with justifications for it, (it's badly written porn, it's full of problematic pairings with Death Eaters, the age differences are too high, Harry can't be gay because he only dated girls in canon, etc). Let's be real, these people would always pick Daphne/Harry over pairings with "good" characters like Cedric/Harry or Colin/Harry. It's fine, brah, just say you don't like gay stuff.

- However, gay girls are fine for some reason.

- Bringing up the Age of Consent in debates is real suss. It's one thing to say that teenagers living in unsupervised communal dormitories would probably be getting up to no good, and another to say that 17/18 year old Fleur seducing 14 year old Harry with her Veela magic during the Triwizard Tournament is perfectly dandy because of them are past the Age of Consent in Country X.

- It's very obvious that sooo many people here have read way more fanfiction than canon, or haven't read canon in years. There are so many misconceptions argued about in threads that could be cleared up with a few paragraphs from the books. Some common ones are:

  - Bellatrix wasn't some poor woobie brainwashed by her upbringing into joining the Death Eaters. She /chose/ it, she was proud of serving the Dark Lord, she didn't repent at her trial, she gleefully told Neville about turning his parents into vegetables in the Department of Mysteries.
  - Snape isn't always cool, composed, and snarky. He shouts, bodyslams people, and throws tantrums. The "Didjaputyanameindagobletafiyah" line fits his character more than it fits Dumbledore's.

Threads for all of these people usually decry shitty stories that feature these fetishy tropes, and stories that feature said tropes that are listed in the comments are usually shit on. I and many others like them for what little character we get.

Daphne is perfect for fanfiction in that we know fucking nothing about her and she is a Slytherin Harry's age. This let's her be used as a good Slytherin OC without the OC label. I dont mean that in a demeaning way, we got anything but a nuanced look at Syltherin, so she is a welcome addition to the fanon outside of "boy do I wanna fuck that patrician girl with an anime ice queen personality."

Tonks let's us see a whole new world as an auror, a member of a family of prestige and a connection to Harry that no one else has in Sirius. I'd kill for some fics after Sirius's death that show them working through their shared grief during the following summer. It's free quality angst that's not "CRAWLING IN MY SKIN" bs.

Fleur does have that perfect sexy woman thing going on, but she has the problems that go with it. No one thinks about who Fleur is as a person, either lusting after or hating her. She has to deal her role as a triwazrd champion with the reaction of being attacked in the third task, the death of Cedric and the eventual revelation about Voldemort. She has to deal with raw hatred from her would be family as well in the Weasleys. There's a good character in there. Minus the lust part Harry has the same problem, so there's a connection there and in their shared roles of champions. I've always gravitated towards fics with both of them and Krum being friends and/or coming together to memorialize Cedric.

Draco is usually done shittily, but he has the making of a redeemable guy if he's "fixed" early, or at least prior to getting the Dark Mark. The switchverse is a perfect example of this.

I will say the adult death eaters fall more into your archetypes, primarily because Alan Rickman and HBC were/are fucking hot.

But discussions around it also /do/ devolve into homophobia. I had a whole conversation with someone where they were trying to convince me that having any gay characters at all made a story sexual, and a hetero relationship in a story didn't.

Yeah, Snape /tries/ to be cool, composed, and snarky, but it's all surface layer stuff that gets knocked off when someone rattles him.

Fanfic Snape usually goes to one extreme or the other, with little in between. It's a shame since he's one of the more psychologically interesting characters in the series: an intelligent, talented, petty, bitter, unattractive bully who does occasional good deeds for unhealthy reasons, and springs from an unfortunate background.

#+end_quote

​

Eh, some of those example justifications qualify as legit criticism (bad writing is bad writing) or be chalked up to personal taste (problematic pairings, age differences). They're the same things I'd say (and have said) about certain f/m pairings, too. Or any pairings in any fandoms. 90% of everything is crap, as the saying goes, and that doesn't matter if you're talking about m/m, f/m, or f/f.

(Multi pairings and harems are the exception. They're usually 99.9% crap.)

But it's difficult finding slash in this fandom that's to my tastes, so if I want to read it I usually just totter my way over to something where yaoi-inspired drivel is at a minimum.

Or write it myself, professionally, which I've done. (The market for m/m romance is insanely hungry.)

I'd probably qualify as one of "those people" based on past comments -- and I'd read a decently written Cedric/Harry or Neville/Harry or Viktor/Harry over Daphne/Harry, tbh. People lean on the whole Ice Queen thing way too hard without bothering to make her feel like a real character.

Can't speak for other people, but the reason that I like f/f is simple: it's more likely to be written by those who can get the details right, so it reads as more authentic and heartfelt.

Fanfiction is the very definition of "what do you want to happen," which is what fuels our fantasies. People want to believe that their self-insert is getting laid with the person of their dreams, which is more often than not a female.

What I dislike, and what I think we should make a distinction for, are the new additions (a lot of Pottermore, Fantastic Beasts, Cursed Child, JKR's Twitter) that have been added to canon after the original series. /That/ is the canon that I don't want to subject innocent readers to. And I hate the fact that is canon at all.

***** Eh, it all comes down to personal preference at the end of the day.

I'm fairly sure I haven't seen all the films, and I've definitely only ever read the books through once. I just didn't like either of them enough to justify going over them again.

And yet I've been in the fanfiction community for just under a decade now because to me fanfiction was much better than the canon it was based off of.

It's entirely possible for people to come in and enjoy and engage with fanfiction without needing to touch the canon it's based off of.

Would I recommend they give the canon a try? Probably. But there's no guarantee that they're missing out on anything important.

People just gotta do what makes them happy if you ask me.

***** I've gotten into more than one fandom without knowledge of the source material, so it isn't as shocking for me. You might miss out on a few things, but it isn't that hard to pick up on most of the stuff, if the author is talented enough.

I've read several Fate Stay Night fics and crossovers without any knowledge of the source material because it is too scattered and I dont know what the order is. Read a ton of Stargate crossovers with Buffy, because that was a huge thing back in the day, and only watched half the seasons years after the fics. I read Fallout Equestria after playing Fallout 1 and 2. Of course this is easier in settings which are less detailed or light on lore, but still quite doable.

I even read Pureblood Pretense with only the faintest memories of the crossover. It is the epitome of a good crossover to me, in that you don't need knowledge of either source material, but you will find something else to appreciate about it if you do.

This one annoys me so much because people treat it as some kind of epithet instead of a compliment. Lupin is saying "you're the smartest 13 year old I've ever met" or "you're the smartest in your class." He is /not/ saying "you're the smartest person in your entire generation," and he's certainly not saying "you're the smartest 13 year old who ever lived."

Writers seem to use "brightest witch of her age" to justify writing her as some kind of genius capable of all sorts of intellectual feats as a teenager that stump witches and wizards with decades more experience and knowledge than her, losing sight of the fact that no matter how smart she is at age 13, she is still a 13 year old- and even a genius 13 year old would be easily outclassed by an average adult when it comes to knowledge and problem solving skills.

*** My experience with fandom culture says that creators want to fill in what they feel the original IP is missing, and make what originally appealed to them more appealing. For dark stories like Game of Thrones/ASOAIF, people want Fix-It endings and catharsis. For queerbaiting stories like Sherlock, people want explicitly gay characters. For happy stories like My Little Pony, people want grey morals and edginess.

Harry Potter was a coming of age story, and because of this, the romance aspect was pretty heavy handed, poorly developed, or happened off-screen, for pretty much every single character.

There are some aspects that authors try to compensate for in fanfic, not just romance. Like a gritty and serious tone instead of JKR's original whimsical and illogical tone. And cold, rational Harry versus the moody, childish Harry of canon.

It's hardwired in us as a race to want those two things, so unsurprisingly in fanfiction, a place where you can do what you want, romance is one of the most popular subjects.

I find often that people who aren't overly social or sexual are the ones who get most tired of romance and sex being so prevalant in all forms of media.

There's barely anything in Canon outside of major events in Tom's life with vague ideas of time frames so authors are writing the past themselves. This has created a sort of feedback loop as fanon rules take hold (such as which characters were in which year, Abraxas Malfoy is commonly found in 7th for example) and are established.

So it is a lot of "this Fanfic did this so my Fanfic did that" like you were saying but it's kind of interesting imo and I can't get enough of the good old time travel trope.

In some fanfics, Harry is gay, or a woman, or an animagus, or heavily scarred and deeply physically different from canon because of battle, and in some cases, straight up on polyjuice for chapters on end. Hell I once read a fanfic where he was half alien from Alien, with the long tail and girls still falling over his tentacle fingers. It was terrible but I'm sure someone loved it.

We're all here because we enjoy reading fanfiction/never outgrew Harry Potter/have an unhealthy obsession with Harry Potter (in my case, all of the above).

There's no logic to it. At some point, most non-canon, unusual pairings might as well be original fiction, just using the worldbuilding of Harry Potter. There are really good fanon-storylines that follows canon. It's fanfiction.

In short: it's fanfiction. We all like fanfiction. We all like certain specific varieties of fanfiction. There's plenty of fanfiction for us all to read. Read fanfiction and don't worry about what others like.

Edit, to clarify: We come here to find new stories and discuss the ones we like and don't. But it's fanfiction. There's no right or wrong answer and no reason to be rude or nasty. Regardless of what someone likes, we should all be respectful of what they like and contribute to a discussion in a meaningful way, instead of insulting their likes or giving an automatic downvote because they think it's a stupid post.

** I like a lot of 'unpopular' fic recs and I think in many ways it's become more of a meme to hate on the fics than actually critique them actively for defined reasons. I also feel (which I come across a lot in genre film too, which is my speciality) that some of the criticism is jumping on the bandwagon from people who haven't actually read the source material and are just going with the wave.

On a positive note, I tend to like this sub and people are welcoming. My one criticism (and it's a light one as it's mainly borne of ignorance imo, not malice) is when people make blanket factual statements about the history of fanfic, fanfic fans, the community etc. that are quite clearly based on their assumptions and tend to privilege what they /want/ the community to be rather than what historically communities like this /have/ been. (e.g. started by men, following canon, supporting main pairings, not accepting slash etc. etc.) In many cases the roots of fanfic are actually the polar opposite of those things. And that extends to views of what pairings are popular, what tropes are long and historic etc. As I say though this is just me speaking as someone who's been involved in the community across various sites for circa...maybe 15 years now, and with a lit crit/writing background and personal interest in the history, so this is not necessarily common info that people are actively out to twist.

a) am not a fan of Tom Felton (he's fine, but not my Draco)

b) Don't love the ship only because, as someone above stated: "Most readers who are into Hermione/Draco... don't really care about the characters. They just like the fantasy of a rich, powerful, and/or influential guy falling in love with a plain, geeky, relatable bookworm." That's a trite and super simplified (and incorrect) reason and frankly insulting. I love Hermione and Draco as characters. They're both incredibly fascinating.

Also, I thought I was the only one who dislikes the Dramione FB groups. They're....not my type of writers, to say the least.

I mean, I think a lot of people are going to feel that. They really want to see it. I met a really clever reader the other day, and this is what's wonderful about books; she said to me, I really know what Neville looks like And I said, Describe Neville for me. And she said, `Well, he's short and he's black, and he's got dreadlocks.' Now, to me, Neville's short and plump and blond, but that's what's great about books. You know, she's just seeing something different. People bring their own imagination to it. They have to collaborate with the author on creating the world.

  The Order of the Phoenix: “And this is Kingsley Shacklebolt” --- he indicated the tall *black* wizard, who bowed ...

  what do you mean? she always described neville as blonde, etc, in the books, too. she's not saying she wrote him as black, she's saying that you could /read/ him as such, because skin colour doesn't meaningfully define who neville is.
#+end_quote

You'd have to go out of your way to read a character differently from how they are written.

I agree that skin colour shouldn't meaningfully define who neville is. However, why point out anyone's race in Harry Potter? They're all wizards, why should we care whether there is a Jewish wizard? Why should we care what race Hermione is? They're all wizards and witches separated only by blood amongst the bigots of their world.

Still, I get a desire for representation. None of the main heroes or villains are anything but white as the freshly driven snow, all POC are minor characters at best. Perhaps if their race wasn't mentioned they could be seen how ever the reader sees them.

#+begin_quote
  she's also never said hermione was black in the text, just that she could've easily been /read/ as such, especially given her descriptions of frizzy hair, brown eyes, etc.
#+end_quote

Exactly! Outside of pendantic and petty details, Hermione is a great example here. Being an black BRITISH girl, as far as I know, would not change her character at all, and as such provides representation for any and every race and creed.

This is at odds with how Rowling let her be portrayed on all artwork/films/etc. prior to Dec. 21, 2015... But that's okay! She never specified because** it didn't, and doesn't matter**.
