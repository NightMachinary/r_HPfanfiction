*** Nymphomaniac Tonks is enjoyable if you make her dominant to a certain degree. Not whips and chastity cages, but clearly the one in command yet observant to Harry's reactions. That also mashes well with Harry having someone who takes the weight of the world from his shoulders for a few hours.

However, nymphomaniac and the usual "submissiveness" often found with all love interests (but especially Fleur and Hermione) just makes her a pretty fucktoy. I mean, she's at least six years his senior, it is bound to be an unbalanced relationship, but one where Harry will be an inexperienced beginner and she the one who knows what she wants and how it is done.

I find the practice of bashing and villifying characters the author doesn't like to be vindictive, petty, and completely unnecessary. Especially since 99% out of 100 this is done by completely savaging their character and portraying them in a way that is completely inconsistent with the character's actual personality...I believe TV Tropes refers to this practice as "Ron the Death Eater" largely because Ron is such a frequent victim.

****** *.50 BMG*

The .50 Browning Machine Gun (.50 BMG, 12.7×99mm NATO and designated as the 50 Browning by the C.I.P.) is a cartridge developed for the Browning .50 caliber machine gun in the late 1910s, entering official service in 1921. Under STANAG 4383, it is a standard cartridge for NATO forces as well as many non-NATO countries. The cartridge itself has been made in many variants: multiple generations of regular ball, tracer, armor-piercing (AP), incendiary, and saboted sub-caliber rounds. The rounds intended for machine guns are made into a continuous belt using metallic links.

***** The one I described is linkao3(The Contract by StellaStark).

I quite like Tyger, Tyger! By BloodcultofFreud but it's only archived on sshgreview.wordpress.com.

Ishouldbewritingsomethingelse does a lot of ML and soulmate stuff and it's SUUUPER FLUFFY if that's your jam.

Denial by little_beloved is great although sshg don't get together because of the ML. Or they sort of do but it's complicated.

The Lioness Prophecies by AMR (also on sshgreview but I can send you a nice epub or mobi version) is not technically a ML, although it is sort of an arranged marriage sort of thing, but it's REALLY GOOD. Best Voldemort-defeating mechanism in history. Also babies.

There's another one that I can't remember the name of, also on sshgreview, where its sort of HP with a regency flavour and a Marriage Law and Snape has three beautiful sisters and everyone is still alive. Snape spends most of the book engaged to Fleur and trying to avoid Hermione's plotting.

Linkao3(Hermione Granger and the Intended Vessels) is very well-written but super depressing. Like, it's the Leonard Cohen of SSHG Marriage Law. It's not worse than the one where Hermione actually kills herself, but it's all very tragic and sad.

I assume you've read mia_madwyn's Care of Magical Creatures?

A lot of these are super popular so they're the easier ones to remember. I'll have to look at my bookmarks to find some of the others.

  [newly edited as of Feb '18] Sometimes all it takes to change the world is one small, simple choice. On the night the Death Eaters attack Hogwarts, Hermione Granger makes such a choice. Her life---and her world---will never be the same.By killing Draco, she saves Dumbledore and keeps Voldemort at bay for a little while. But evil never sleeps for long. When a Ministry decree forces her to marry Professor Snape---a cruel, cold man who's apparently hated her since she was a child---in order to be used as a breeder of superior wizards, Hermione doesn't think her life can get any worse. She's wrong.Soon, Voldemort's after her and her friends (again), her life is in grave peril, and all her hopes for a future at all, much less a happy one, rest on her own shoulders---and on Snape, her unwanted husband, whose heart still belongs to a woman long dead.

***** Well, yes, that's true, but there are a lot of variations. For example, the Snape in Intended Vessels is much crueller to Hermione, and much more damaged, than the Snape in any of IShouldBe's ML fics. The Snape in CoMC is also cruel, but not deliberately.

I like the ML for the same reason I like to read Harlequin romance novels - I know the basic plot beats, so I'm reading to see how this author executes them. Writing a good ML fic is at least as difficult as writing a good romance novel - you have to write to the beats and give the audience what they expect, but you also have to be original in your execution and characterization.

******* "Harry, the Ministry is planning a marriage law."

"Ugh, it's only ten in the morning, Hermione."

"Harry!"

"Fine, let me get a shower and then we can get a cab to Heathrow. New Zealand or Canada?"

"Don't you think that we should do something about it?"

"Alright, guess we have to pick up Gryffindor's sword and take out the trash beforehand. Try to get us first class seats for next Saturday then. You know how much I hate flying Economy."

There is no way Hermione would subject herself to a marriage law. Either she escapes or she raises the Red Banner of the Revolution and the Ministry learns that they should not have crossed her and Harry. They have Umbridge and Voldemort as an example of the consequences after all.

That there is no way to tell him without him flying off the (broom)handle and destroying their friendship.

**** One my favorite fics is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12858961/1/The-Sparrow-Suite][The Sparrow Suite by Red Garden Gnome]]. It deviates from the standard Charlie/Hermione story where they both absolutely loathe each other at the beginning but when they talk up teaching positions at Hogwarts, they grow closer together. Their characterizations, in my mind, are spot on and parts of the story are extremely funny.

​

I'll give you another (since this is by the same author) which is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12243730/1/Nocturnal][Nocturnal]]. It deals with Charlie and Hermione starting an affair after the second War, which Hermione traveling to Romania to work on the dragon reserve there, before they both move back to Britain with a new dragon reserve opening in Wales. Besides romance, this story has a ton of mystery with everything coming together in the last couple of chapters.

** I mostly read Dramione fanfiction, but this applies to all pairings, really.

- Character bashing. It's just bad and lazy writing, imo. People can simply grow apart, you know. And there are actual legitimate reasons for why people break up. Demonising a character beyond any redemption is just taking an easy route.

- Marriage Law. Similarly to bashing, it's just such a lazy way to bring people together, not to mention is just plain creepy and /totalitarian/. Forcing people to marry each other? Forcing people to procreate within a set time frame? How can that possibly turn out to be a healthy relationship? I just don't get it.

- Alpha/Beta/Omega. One word: knotting. Nope. Nope. Noooope.

- Pureblood!Hermione. It takes away at least half of what makes Hermione such an interesting character. She is brilliant and such a selfless and good person, all /despite/ of the pushback she receives for not being brought up in the wizarding world. Making her a pureblood seriously diminishes her character imo.
