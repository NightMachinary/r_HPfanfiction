Tags No romance because gets in the way of the novel not pure evil Harry but not good either because he kills for power maybe crossover later

Harry Potter grows up reading a book about someone becoming a dungeon core and Then finds the blood Ward stone in the backyard to the house and when he touches it he see a 360Â° view of the house Because it's his Waterstone and it's using his blood and since he is young he believes he is the stone from the novels and what not and he uses magic to become the actual stone and it transforms into a dungeon core And slowly makes a dungeon underneath the house by sending monsters out to kidnap people and absorbing the life forced to give him more mana and the soul to make his stronger this comes in useful later when he makes a Horcrux a Second dungeon it's not really a horcrux because he is still connected to it so he's mostly multitasking all the time and slowly builds up dungeons all around the world but that's later The first dungeon once his at like 2 floors he Opens up and people start entering the dungeon and the creatures Drop mana stones and items that he absorbs and makes copies of there can be POV of different characters like Dumbledore going into a dungeon and gaining (magic) items People can't build a wall around it because if they do he will send monsters out to attack it and the surrounding area if people don't enter He's not good in this novel his mostly bad no romance because most dungeon core novels that gets in the way He can find Vail of death later and it's a portal to an crossover like sg1 or I don't know what but it there for later I think that's everything if not I will edit it just thought of something he can use the souls of the people he kills in the dungeon so they become dungeon monsters they still have their memories but their loyal to him
