Are there any HP fanfics where the conflict isn't Harry vs the villains but Harry vs his own inner demons. I'm kind of growing tired of reading about an op Harry batting away all of his life's problems at the age of 15


** What OP Harry are you reading? He clearly solves everything at 11

** Yeah, I'd like to read about a depressed character sometime, or one that has to deal with mental dilemmas.

** True, most demons in “Inner Demons by serendipity_50” linkao3(601124) are Ginny's, but Harry has plenty of his own as well, and it is very nice story (actually, the one which persuaded me that whole idea of amateur writing could make sense).

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)
