So at first I was all for Harry becoming an auror until i thought more about it. The Ministry is basically corrupt and even with Kingsley as the new minister there is still corruption. I mean they kept Umbridge even after she used an illegal object on children when parents were probably outraged as fucked (i know i would be royally pissed if I heard a women that tortured my child was still walking around freely instead of facing justice) .

I think Harry should've created an orphanage. There were probably many children after the war and given that Harry is an Orphan I would think he would use the Potter and Black Fortune to make sure these kids didn't go through what he went through.

I can also see some Hogwarts students who lost their parents (because I call BS on the fact that none of the students lost their parents during the war) helping him out.

But that's just meðŸ˜„

What job do you think Harry should've had?

Orphanages are not good things and I'm surprised how often I see this in the fandom considering the books make that pretty clear. It is very unusual that a child does not have family members to care for them, and if not another family can step in as Foster parents, as the Weasleys did for Harry, as the Potters did for Sirius. Avoiding the harm that institutions like the Orphanage Voldemort grew up in is very important when it comes to protecting children, and it's why orphanages do not exist in countries with established social care systems. I know that Rowling is a curse word in the fandom these days, but it is worth looking up her charity Lumos for more information on this.

*** I imagine part of the reason harry went into the ministry is to reform it and make sure the reforms stick

I imagine for a good decade the DA had a strangle hold on the ministry

** I think it's bullshit that Ginny gets to play quidditch when Harry was the prodigy (youngest player in a century) & the only way he could lose was if he got knocked out of play somehow.

After all the crap Harry went through in the books, he should have had a chance to enjoy a career instead of spending the rest of his life trying to slowly fix the incredibly corrupt ministry.

*** you forget that most of the people in the DA seemed to have Join the ministry as well

so its not that slow, when shacklebolt would have used the fact his side won to clean house

everyone in the DA and the order of the phoenix would have been offered lofty postions

This was total victory for the order of the phoenix its much easier to pass laws when you have an overwhelming victory

** Orphanages are bad for children because even though they offer living conditions, they still deprive the kids from the affection so necessary for their development. That's why most of the children from orphanage never properly adjust to adult life and end up with shitty careers best case or criminals/alcoholics/junkies in the worst case.

I think Harry realistically would have moved on from fighting Dark Arts (as he puts in the last chapter he had enough troubles for a lifetime) and would have done something less stressful. I doubt he could settle for a boring life but I'd have imagined him, more than Ron, to join George in the WWW shop especially that he had a few shares in the business.

** I'm in the dada mastery corner but he goes for hit wizard over auror and for a government other than brittain. After they way they treated him in canon I can't see him wanting to work for them

** I like to believe that Harry gets his Dada Mastery, and opens up a few orphanages (12 Grimmauld Place is used as one).

He'd work at the orphanages as equally as possible, have monthly outings with the kids and a junior quidditch league or something. If not a league, then just have pick up quidditch games.

Occasionally, he'd do some contract work for the aurors/ministry.

Or he works with wizarding child services + muggle social workers and he picks up magical kids in bad homes (both magical /muggle).
