I'm looking for a fanfic that follows Tom Riddle leaving Hogwarts to him returning as Voldemort. AU is absolutely fine. Him making the horcruxes, where he learned how to become so powerful, etc. Especially love fics that involve blood sacrifices & rune drawing.

To add on to that, I'll take an dark fics with blood sacrifices & rune drawing involved.


** The only fic I've read on this list is all Linkffn(All Roads Lead to Rome by Alemantele) which is a one shot. Both of these should cover Tom Riddle's whole life. Linkffn(Little Differences by Theta Serpentis) linkffn(The Dark Lord Exposed)

  In the end, it didn't really matter what road he took. Tom Riddle's destiny was, is and will always be in the form of Lord Voldemort.

  !COMPLETE! The story of Lord Voldemort's life, from the moment he becomes a wizard to the moment he dies. Everything---Slug Club, Horcruxes, Chamber of Secrets, Death Eaters, working at Borgin's, both wars, banishment, resurrection. With details of what happened in Albania. Names and dates are all canon. Gets significantly darker as the story progresses.

** Sadly I haven't seen any fic that follows his entire journey. There are however linkffn(The Crown of Mètis by Megii of Mysteri OusStranger; The Fire Omens by chase glasslace) which show parts of it.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
