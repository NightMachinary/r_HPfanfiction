I'm looking for story with a heavy focus on friendships, preferably non romance fics, but if a romance happens naturally I'd prefer they be friends before that.

A story that spring to mind are Harry/Hermione friendships where every year post war they go to Godric's Hollow and visit James and Lily's graves around Christmas eve, and eventually Harry asks Hermione if this is something he should be doing with Ginny instead (damn me, I can't remember the title to that fic) and she just lets him talk out his problems before telling him its his choice.

I don't mind if it's AU entirely, or Post War, or Non epilogue compliant, I just want to feel all warm and fuzzy inside and think that people rock.


** On mobile so I can't link, but HalfaSlug does a lot of nice trio friendship fics.

** Ehh... so I wouldn't say this one is warm and fuzzy, exactly, but it is very much about the importance of friendship and just what Ron and Hermione are willing to do for Harry. Warning for drug abuse.

  Harry has issues. Fortunately, he also has friends.

** I just lined these two on a different thread, but they seem like what you are looking for:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/The-Strange-Disappearance-of-SallyAnne-Perks][The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks]]: Harry and Hermione investigate the disappearance of [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Sally-Anne_Perks][Sally-Anne Perks]], who, in the books, was sorted just before Potter but then wasn't called to be tested for the OWLS (even though her name would be between Patil and Potter, both of whom were called). What was probably an error by Rowling, the writer spins out into a mystery.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]]: Simply put, Ron was born a girl. Changes ensue, but the spirit is preserved.
