So I thought about doing a manipulative!Dumbledore story, from Dumbledore's point of view. Because so many of these stories has Harry basically having a childish tantrum, using the most ridiculous language, and calling him a lemon drop addict, I thought I'd try to reuse a lot of the same sort of language. And Dumbledore's just too soft-hearted to tell him off.

I'm aware it's no great work of literature. Criticism is welcome, even if it's just 'there's too many of these, get rid of it'.

** I appreciate that it's a response to, frankly, bad fanfics and requires the catharsis required, but making Harry less blatantly the villain would probably be a great idea if you ever feel like redoing it. Dumbledore /did/ have his faults, as he himself admitted at the end of OOTP, and there are plenty of valid criticisms for Harry. Also, correct me if I'm wrong but Harry wasn't too hostile towards McGonagall...pretty much ever, until he was /defending/ Dumbledore to her in canon, so him ranting at her too comes a bit out of nowhere.

'Course, I'm overanalysing a response to crackfics, but I just feel that if you want catharsis you want one where both parties understand the bullshit the other went through, not just one. And remember, at this point the massive telling-off of the Dursleys by Dumbledore hasn't occurred either, so that little bit of emotional impact for Harry is worse.

*** Thanks for that! He's not supposed to be a villain. He's a teenager who's been through a lot of trauma, having a teenage tantrum. My teenage tantrums were pretty bad. I'm sure Dumbledore and McGonagall, and the other teachers are pretty well used to teenage drama, which is why I included the anecdotes about other meltdowns. I always felt terribly afterwards, when I realised I was in the wrong, but looking back now, adults didn't consider me a villain, just a typical teenager to roll eyes at.

And it's in response to Indy fics I see where Harry's rants are out of place, and he does have a go at McGonagall when she tries to tell him off for yelling at Dumbledore. I was going to include Harry mentioning something the Goblins were doing in support of him to give him independence from Dumbledore, and them facepalming and explaining that the Goblins aren't being nice, they're trapping Harry in contracts.

Massive telling-off? Apart from the howler, I can't recall any interaction Dumbledore had with the Dursleys.

edit: also, in my point of view, Dumbledore's extremely busy, and has a great many things to do. He is preparing for a war that he knows will be bloody, and hard, and that they are at the disadvantage for. He doesn't really have much time for worrying about Harry, and since Harry's safe at his home, with a guard watching him, he's not terribly fussed. Harry felt like people weren't telling him anything, but I doubt that's because Dumbledore was restricting post - they just had to be careful what they wrote in post that is easily stolen. He really was an idiot for not reading the mail he got daily. Yes, Dumbledore should have taken the time to have someone sit him down and explain his concerns about the connection, and Legilimency, and he admits that and explains it in the part at the end.

**** That's fair enough, it's just different perspectives I suppose. The massive telling-off I'm referring to is at the beginning of HBP.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

*** haha maybe I should add some more, perhaps about Harry's emancipation due to the Goblins taking advantage of him. And perhaps about the outing Harry and Sirius did, despite advice and orders to stay inside, as part of the rebellious revolt they both did.

*** Yes, it is. It's basically an Indy!Harry, only Dumbledore isn't actually any more manipulative than he is in canon, just extremely rushed and with a great many things to do. McGonagall told Harry to apologise, and Harry replied, saying she couldn't tell him what to do. McGonagall was just pointing out that in the position of authority she holds over him, she can, indeed, tell him what to do.

***** Wrong. in loco parentis (In place of the parent) First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students' civil liberties.

****** No, people in colleges and schools are not in Loco Parentis, at least where I live [America]. In Loco Parentis in America is only applied to foster parents, godparents, siblings that are written out in your parent's will as being in Loco Parentis after your death. The schools here are not in Loco Parentis, as it's simply stupid to allow teachers that much authority, especially when the parents/guardians are alive.

******* Thanks for your input! I understood that in boarding school, your head was in loco parentis, due to the fact that they see more of the child through the year than the parent does.

Plus, I'm pretty sure schools don't put up with students behaving like Harry. If he refused to behave, he'd eventually be suspended, and then expelled. He's a reflection on Minerva herself, as his head of house. Just like Draco (edit:sorry, pressed send) represents Snape and his Headship, and Luna represented Flitwick - he obviously didn't notice the bullying or was ineffective at dealing with it, and we know what Snape was like. She does have the power to insist on manners.
