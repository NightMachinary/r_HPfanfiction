The next fic will be [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/][The Perks of Survival]]. This was in the recommendations list and sounded like it could be interesting, a Sally-Anne Perks SI. We'll see how it goes.

What did y'all think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6663972/1/Secret-Steps][Secret Steps]]?

#+begin_quote
  Extreme AU. In a world where contact between muggles and wizards is strictly forbidden, where love blinds, and power is corrupt... an orphaned Hermione Granger struggles to make things right with the help of some unlikely allies. HG,SS.

** I'm trying to read The Perks of Survival, but the format of the site is just so terrible for writing a story.

**** I loved the perks of survival, do you have anything like it ?

I really like the fast pace and the many likeable characters in it.

** I think this story was pretty good, but not one of my favorites. It was paced well, the plot was interesting enough, and there were no obvious flaws.

I especially liked the AU and I think the author did a really good job at worldbuilding. However, I felt that the story was too short to do the world justice. Like, this AU started off with so much potential, and then the story just never tapped into most of that potential. If this story was twice as long, or I could read a side story set in the same world, I would probably do so, because there are just so many questions to explore in this new setting.

But as it is, I feel like this story is only deserving of a good review, not a great one.

** I thought it was an interesting premise, and the AU was really intriguing... But I should insert the disclaimer that I didn't manage to make it past the 3rd chapter.

This seemed like such a quiet, dull fic. I was /bored/ with a Hermione this young. I found it really difficult to immerse in the initial chapters where Hermione is such a child. To me, it felt like the fic drug its feet excessively in setting up the plot. I don't like or have kids, so presumably that caused my inability to relate to this fic. I also wasn't super impressed with the characterization of Severus. His voice and character (in the beginning chapters I read, at least) felt unremarkable and weren't memorable; to me, this was a weak way to start out the story.

I ended up skipping to the last chapter just briefly to see how old Hermione ends up being; I was worried that if I attempted to invest in this fic and the pace stayed the same, it'd be the same slow, boring drag until the story ended with Hermione finishing her first year... Since she actually ends up a near-adult, presumably the fic picks up it's pace at some point?

I'd be willing to give this a second shot if someone can convince me that chapter 4 is where it really gets good. d:

*** It doesn't stay quiet and dull for too much longer. To give you an idea, they do manage to have a war somewhere between chapter 4 and the last chapter =P

**** I think it's the author's tone... Even when conveying exciting things (magic! Hogwarts! new world to explore! re-introduction to parents!), the author doesn't show that excitement, just tells me things in a weird, observational rather than immersive manner.

I agree. I always felt a step removed as I read it. I wasn't reading it quickly to find out what happens next, but skimming to get through it faster.

**** It almost had a documentary, observational tone rather than an active, immersive tone... If that makes sense.

****** Oh, I'm glad you agree!

I usually love the book club fics. This one was nice, but I think it just wasn't my style - but at the same time, I've had a lot of trouble putting to words /why/ it wasn't my style. I've probably spent way too much time trying to qualify that "why." haha
