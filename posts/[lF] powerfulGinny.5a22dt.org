Looking for fics mostly focused on Ginny, particularly where she kicks some ass. Could be slytherin Ginny (I'm so eagerly awaiting the return of The Changeling). Maybe gets to access Tom's knowledge via COS diary.\\
I rather liked a Ginny Returns ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4740107/1/Ginny-Returns]]) a Ginny-centric time travel fic.

** A few years ago I wrote my own Slytherin!Ginny which is now only available on Phoenix Song.

Title: And On the Eighth Day? (Teens) - Edit Status: Completed Summary: It's the final week of Harry's time at Hogwarts and he's looking forward to spending some lazy days by the lake with his girlfriend, Susan Bones. But there's an end of year and end of war celebration to attend and Susan insists on their being involved in the preparation for it. The only fly in the ointment is the Bitch Queen of Slytherin, Ginny Weasley, and the fact that all is not quite what it seems. [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/story.php?cid=4128]]

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

** *Elemental Harry*, linkffn(5648259): Ginny became a fire elemental, and she threw Fiendfyres at will. But the story is in Harry's first person POV.

*My Slytherin Harry*, linkffn(6160345): Ginny's first person POV, and she was more powerful than a 17 year old Voldemort thanks to the Diary.

  Ginny is setting everything on fire, and Harry is calling down storms and throwing lightning out of his hands. How things would change if Harry's power was something different and he had to learn how to use it along with understanding a mysterious bond.

  If things were different, and Harry was a Slytherin, and Ginny's parents had tried their best to keep her away from him, what would happen when she's finally had enough? Anti lots of people, Grey Harry.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
