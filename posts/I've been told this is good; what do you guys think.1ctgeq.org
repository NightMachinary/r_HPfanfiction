** Just from looking at the summary, I can tell I won't like it. I absolutely hate harem stories.

** You seem to be aware of this, but this story lacks any sort of conflict, and is mostly composed of filler/cliches.

Nine chapters in, the plot has consisted of Harry acquiring a long list of powerful new items and abilities, including one which will make the the few females who weren't already in love with him unable to resist his charms.

I'm not trying to flame or anything, but this story really needs some meaningful conflict. Making Harry more powerful will only make that harder IMHO.

*** That is actually why I named the very last chapter 'Soon Things Will Happen'. I admit to slowly adding more and more to his list of abilities and whatnot, but I plan on almost everyone in the story having similar powers. In this version of the HP-verse, Harry is admittedly quite a bite better than average, but I'm raising the average substantially as well. If they went all-out, Harry would get his ass kicked by Fleur, Krum, or Cedric. Let alone Death Eaters, teachers, Aurors, or Voldemort.

** " This is a work-in-progress plot blurb without a definite direction for the plot as of now, so I'm perfectly open to suggestions. "

AKA "I have no idea what I'm doing so please help me write this."
