So many fics make Luna's quirky oddness into a love for torture and dark and crap. I want a fic where she ISN'T a "bad" girl.

Slash, bashing and crossovers okay. No romance/smut-driven plot, mpreg, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you!


** linkffn (The Rise of Darth Veneficus) Really good Harry Potter/Star Wars crossover where Harry becomes the Sith Emperor. Currently in progress but the prequel is already up.

  A dark power is rising. An ancient enemy with a new face. Can the Republic and the Jedi Order withstand the storm of the new Sith Emperor, Darth Veneficus? Sequel to Harry Potter and the Power of the Dark Side.

  Only the strong may rule, this was the way of the Dark Side, and Darth Millennial was about to prove to his master that he was worthy of the title Dark Lord of the Sith, but first a tremor in the Force draws him to the Unknown Regions of space... I do not own the picture
