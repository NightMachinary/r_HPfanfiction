Just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate][A Different Fate]] suggested by [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2xksqu/petunia_married_a_wizard/cp10yu7][twofreecents]] on this subreddit. It reminded me of [[http://ink-splotch.tumblr.com/post/106737310659/what-if-when-petunia-dursley-found-a-little-boy][this]] similar drabble story I had really enjoyed found on tumblr.

Can anyone suggest other drabbles that sort of tell what happen rather than show it to get a long idea across in a short amount of words? Though both stories focus on Petunia I don't mind who the main character of the story is. Just looking for any quick read interesting concept drabble. Thanks [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]

*** Great recommendations. I generally don't read anything outside of my established OTPs but these were a nice change of pace, thanks.

** I [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/7/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][wrote a few]] you might consider. Not true drabbles (300-word stories, not the traditional 100-word limit for drabbles, they were penned in response to prompts on a drabble challenge site).
