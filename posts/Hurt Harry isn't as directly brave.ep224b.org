Harry in the books is in a very Not Okay situation. i was wondering if there were any fics where instead of Harry immediately backtalking Snape, he acts used to it because he IS used to it? I'm not talking about those fics where Harry is like so brainwashed by the Dursleys that he think he needs to sleep in a cupboard. I just think that with his canon childhood, Harry would be more cautious when met with an adult who spews mean words at him. If you know any fics like this, please recommend them! Thank you for your time
