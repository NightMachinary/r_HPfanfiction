:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember reading a Sirius/OC fanfiction this year on Fanfiction.net that started with the couple in Hogwarts and then out of Hogwarts. The main protagonist died after being captured by Death Eaters. They tortured her at the end, and when the Order finally found her in a raid, they realized she had been pregnant with Sirius's baby. Does anyone know what fic this might be?

If I can remember correctly, there was also a separate fic that I remember reading where the main protagonist died in a field of flowers protecting Sirius from her Death Eater father(?). Does anyone know what these fics are?

I believe that they are on Fanfiction.net, but now that I think about it, could have also been on Wattpad or Archive of Our Own. Thanks.

Edit: I just very quickly somehow managed to find them both on Wattpad. Nevermind then.

In case you're wondering, fic no. 1 is: Barking Mad by gracedkelly
