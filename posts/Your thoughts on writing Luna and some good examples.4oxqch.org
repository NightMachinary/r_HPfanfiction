I could never decide whether Luna was actually "loony" or was simply pretending to be (as a defense mechanism or maybe just for fun, idk) Writing her also seems insanely difficult because of her unpredictable character. Do you have any tips as what you believe she is really like? Or any good fanfiction stories with her as the main character? Thanks in advance.


** I think the description of "loony" implies some kind of mental instability, and by no means do I think Luna was actually insane.

I think Luna was a very lonely girl who was raised by a devoted, obsessive widower. Luna wasn't raised like the Weasley kids were, with the radio on in the background, two parents, a dozen chickens and the family cat rushing back and forth - Pandora died when she was quite young, and because of her and her dad's odd beliefs, I think she grew up in a very strange isolation.

Luna isn't mentally deficient or somehow insane: she has a very different way of looking at things and keeps calm in virtually every situation, which I think a lot of other students find unsettling.

Writing Luna is hard, because while she comes across as dreamy or detached to other people, I think she just has a different thinking process, and that thinking process is not affected at all by society's ideas of normal. Luna is quietly hedonistic, and she doesn't mind that people might give her strange looks for it - she's happy to walk barefoot through the woods and settle with the animals who do not judge based on things as unimportant as footwear.

Harry grew up an outcast, bullied by his nephew and heavily disliked at home, and growing up he learned to despise and take relish in defying the Dursleys' idea of "normal". What Luna does isn't all that different - she barely notices or places any weight on such non-concerns, and I think Harry gets that. Hermione and Ron, who are much more logical thinkers with better understanding of people and societal rules, just can't understand why Luna chooses to be so "weird", because they can't understand why conventional thinking and other people's opinions don't deter her.

Luna's a great character, and I hope you do give her a go - she's hard, but I feel that the more you write her, the more you get a feel for the way she works and the way she talks.

** I think what I liked about how JKR portrayed Luna in the books was that we saw how all various sides of society would view someone different: Ron laughed and said she was 'loony', Hermione found her foolish and exasperating, and Harry didn't mind her being weird and let her do her thing. He saw past the weird factor and saw a friend. I think she was always a little sad and lonely, but embraced her weirdness and cared deeply for her friends (remember the portraits in DH?). So I guess it would depend in your story who the main character is and who Luna is in relation to them and the plot to how you want to portray them. Personally in my most recent fiction I have portrayed her as an empathetic quirky kind of loveable figure.

General advice would be to keep the Snorkacks references minimal, along with descriptions like 'dreamy' or 'loony' (which I find not very nice, the PC crusader that I am hehe). Try and find some kernel of truth or a conundrum Luna might just throw out into a scene like a ticking time bomb for the other characters to defuse.

Hope this helps.

** Just want to add that I'm sick and tired of Luna being described as /quirky/. Having severe hallucinations or a level of perception far beyond your magical peers (depending on which side of the Snorkack divide you fall) is not a "quirk", for heaven's sake.

** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11923164/1/I-Know-Not-and-I-Cannot-Know-Yet-I-Live-and-I-Love]]) is my favorite Luna focused fic.

I tend to think that Luna is extremely insightful but also somewhat mad. And figuring out which applies to the situation is not straightforward.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** I do think she is "loony", in a sense that she has a greatly different perspective on things. That is basically what makes her so hard to write. She defies logic at her pleasure.

If her animals are real, imaginary or just different words for bullies and such, I really don't know. I've read either way in fics and have seen either way done well.

What I do know, however, is that Luna is fiercely loyal and devoted to her friends. I do think she was extremely lonely during her first years at Hogwarts. True, Ginny was there sometimes, but in the Ravenclaw tower, Luna was alone. If anyone would fear abandonment and loneliness it would be Luna and not a small part in this is of course her late mother. Loosing a parent at such a young age leaves a deep scar.

She is probably the kindest character in the story and shows a deep understanding of people, as seen in the forest in OotP. While Hermione, Ron and all the others struggle with a mopping Harry, Luna finds the words necessary to turn Harry around and away from even darker thoughts. It was this, among my sympathy and appreciation of her character, that made me hope for a Harry / Luna pairing at the end of the series.

** I think luna is slightly gone in the head like her father. My fanon explanation for this is that the magical backlash that killed her mum also affected her and her father. However, I find that lots of writers try to rationalize luna as using a defense mechanism (this literally makes no sense, if you're bullied for being g weird, your defense isn't to be more weird) or see real animals that are invisible or seeing magic itself more clearly. I prefer a luna who is treated with kindness and stuff like that instead of her being 100% right all of the time.

I can't write her. I like the advice to not overdo her, don't make up new creatures. I love the character though.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

** To me Luna is a girl, damaged by seeing her mother die and her father's inability to cope with said death without retreating into a fantasy world of strange creatures that explained away why he was unable to cope.

** I have a friend who is as close to Luna as I've known; just when someone patronized her for being clueless, she would say or do something three steps ahead of us all. Gentle and calm, her zen-like nature would be, by equal measure, out-of-step with half the banter. I don't much care in what subtle ways she is parsed, but as a reader, I want her, like any good character, to have depth.

** Luna would burst out with side-splitting laughter if she came across a carpenter and his apprentice, and the old man says, 'Hand me that Hammerfore' and his apprentice replies, "Whats a hammerfore?" so the old man says, "So I can hammer in these nails, silly!" she might even fall over and roll around on the floor.
