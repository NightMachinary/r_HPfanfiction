Severus Snape is gifted a computer from Harry Potter one holiday, and Harry explains how the computer can be used to search up people's images, their whereabouts, a place to find dinner, read weird fanfictions about Hermione being shipped with a whole bunch of people, and much more.

Curious, Severus opens google, and stares down at the keys on the keyboard.

HARRY: You know, Sevvy, once, James went missing just before dinner, so we used the phone to find him. A neat little tracker if I do say so myself.

/Severus stares in silence./

HARRY: Well! /claps hands/ I should be going. Hope you put good use to your present!

/The man strolls out whistling the Bob the Builder theme song./

SEVERUS: Pictures of anyone? eh, Potter?

/He opens the laptop and opens a google search engine./

SEVERUS: L-I-L-Y E- where's the v? no that's g. V? V- ah there you are. V-A-N-S.

/he finger types his old love's name into the search engine bar./

SEVERUS: Hmm... About... 52 BILIION RESULTS!

/The potion master stops for one second, and gasps clutching his heart./

SEVERUS: Minerva! I need to find Minerva! It's sorcery is what this is! Blasphemy!

/He runs away leaving the computer open./

/GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS: All, Images, Videos, News, MAPS/

*My humor is dead, really, but this could be an invested fic if someone did it properly.*
