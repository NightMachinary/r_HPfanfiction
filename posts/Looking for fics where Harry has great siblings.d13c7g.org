Hi! I'm looking for fics where Harry has siblings (or one sibling), and where he really gets along with them. This new interest was inspired by "Nose to the Wind" by Batsutousai so if you have something similar I would be really thankful! [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15562401/chapters/36128262]]


** Many “Harry is risen up by somebody else” stories have his sibling. Just randomly, linkao3(The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel) has him living with Grangers, so Hermione is his sister (and no, for obvious reasons, it is not H/Hr pairing).

  While Harry had been content with his second chance, that didn't keep him from thinking what he could have done different, how many people could have survived if he hadn't been set on the very specific path he'd walked. Third time is the charm, though, right?

*** Yes, this was the inspiration for this request, as I mentioned at the beginning. Do you perhaps know of other fics like it?

** In the Saving Connor series, Harry has a really good relationship, at least in the first one, with his twin. And I think even if down the line they fight and break apart, they would reconcile. It's more the adults in his life he has troubles with.
