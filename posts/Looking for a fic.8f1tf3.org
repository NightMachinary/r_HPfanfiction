Old one, I believe was on ffnet. IIRC, Harry transfers to a school in the US (California I believe) under a new identity after a couple of years at HW to hide, and complete his training. Also, I think one of the teachers is obsessed with Harry Potter, and constantly berates Harry's new ID as not being as good as Harry, Harry eventually reveals himself to the teacher.. also Harry ends up with Ginny, and a harem, including Snape...?


** ... including snape... in the harem? Did I read that right? I must witness this travesty first-hand!
