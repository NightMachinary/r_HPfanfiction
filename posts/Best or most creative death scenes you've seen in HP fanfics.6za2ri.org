Three vague categories here - the deaths that were just really well dealt with, super heartbreaking, emotive and tragic; the deaths that were the most physically creative or showed the most ingenuity; and the deaths that were funniest or most well-deserved.

/Note that there'll likely be spoilers re: character death in this thread./


** Snape in chapter 34 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/34/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]]

#+begin_quote
  tl;dr Snape is captured with the rest of the Death Eaters ad is waiting for his trial. Gets a chance to talk to Harry, tells him to get the memories from his house because Dumbledore had asked him to AK him. Harry destroys them and lets Snape get Kissed.

Sirius in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/38/For-Love-of-Magic][For the Love of Magic]]

#+begin_quote
  tl;dr Harry, Fleur, Tonks and Sirius are exploring an Egyptian tomb. They are attacked by an lich, they all fight it and it sandblasts Sirius. No buildup, no foreshadowing (that I remember). He's just dead.

  I might not have liked much of the fic but this was definitely one of the high points for me. The out-of-nowhere nature of it was absolutely fantastic.

Literally every death in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/3/The-Unforgiving-Minute][The Unforgiving Minute]]

#+begin_quote
  I'd forgotten how much I love that fic. To anyone who hasn't read it you should definitely give it a shot. Adult Harry goes back in time. He has 7 hours to find and destroy Voldemort and his horcruxes.

Not the flashback ones, they are ridiculous to the point that they stop being sad and become kinda funny instead.

**** That just made them even better to me. That vampire nest thing where Oliver dies was hilarious.

** Dumbledore's death in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8581093/1/One-Hundred-and-Sixty-Nine][One Hundred Sixty Nine]], linkffn(8581093), earned my top spot for most funny death.

Umbridge's death in [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] was the most karmic one however. She hadn't done nearly as many evils as in Canon due to her opponents' competence, but her greed still did her in. [[/spoiler][The Locket was highly radioactive in this story, and she eventually died painfully of cancers caused by radiation poisoning]]

#+begin_quote
  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

**** I think the last one was in maybe 2008 so your tense there is off by about a decade.

As for why they used to happen: back then, indy!Harry was a tiny niche. The obnoxious mainstream (which indy!Harry has now become) back then was intensely fluffy, soul bondy, Harry/Ginny SIYE-type fics.

The kill-off was a cathartic expression of frustration at the choke-hold Harry/Ginny had on the fandom.
