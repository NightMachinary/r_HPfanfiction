** The only one I know of is this Snape/Hermione one: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20050203192623/http://www.witchfics.org/fr/index.html]] They accidently switch bodies in a potions accident.

Edit: Just remembered this one too: Witching Hour by LadyFlorentine [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12506007/1/]] where Dumbledore and Harry wake up to find they switched bodies. It only has one chapter so far but it's really funny.

  Imagine that one person that irritates, infuriates, & insults their way under your skin to the point where each moment with him or her becomes a pop quiz in self-control. Now, imagine that you've woken up in that person's body. For Lily Evans & James Potter, learning to navigate this unfortunate and stressful new reality is truly a walk through hell.

  After a potions accident, James and Lily switch bodies. However, they need to keep it a secret:- Brewing the potion wasn't exactly in the school rules. Watch how they cope living inside each others skin.

** IIRC there's an in-progress time travel fic wherein Harry and Hermione go back in time (landing in their pre-first year bodies), but they screw something up and end up in each-other's bodies.

It's pretty good, actually.
