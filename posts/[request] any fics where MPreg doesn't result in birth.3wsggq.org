I only read like 1 or 2 stories where an abortion was even mentioned. Or giving the baby up for adoption. Even when the conception was under horrible circumstances like rape or even just a one night stand mistake. Therefor, for my sanity, I need me some responsible MPreg.

As in they're adults already, or they realize getting preggers at 15 is idiotic and get an abortion or they decide giving it up for adoption is best, because seriously ... I cant be the only thats bothered by that!?

Harry-centric if possible (HP/DM , HP/SS, HP/LM, HP/?) though he doesnt need to be the one who concieves necessarily.


** This is a really interesting request! I racked my brain and looked over some of my bookmarks but I just couldn't find /any/ mpreg's that didn't result in baby that wasn't because of a miscarriage.

I would suggest also trying requesting over on LiveJournal - many of their HP fanfiction pages are still active. I really only read a few pairings but I do know that the drarry fic request pages [[http://accio-hd-fics.livejournal.com/][Accio H/D Fics]] and [[http://drarryficfind.livejournal.com/][Drarry Fic Find]] are still very much active and the [[http://snarryficfind.livejournal.com/][Snarry Fic Find]] is still very active as well. As for any other Harry centric pairings I don't know. You could try using the LJ community search function to see if there are any pages still active for those.

I really hope you find some because it's a really great premise and I'd like to read some fics involving this as well!

** Not a fan of mpreg, but it is surprising (when I do read something with it) how nearly always 15yro Harry vehemently goes "Who would ever want to kill an innocent baby!" when he finds out he's pregnant and someone asks if he wants an abortion. I wonder if it's the author's viewpoint bleeding through, or if they really feel it's something Harry might think.

*** I know right? I know Harry would love a big family, but is he really that stupid to belive teen pregnancy is the way to go? In the middle of a war? With him being targe #1? Even if he is, Hermione should friggin know better ... I always thought its the writers opinion shining through, many fanfics are written by younger women and how many women really /want/ to write about the act of abortion even if they are pro choice? Its not a happy topic. And apparently love conquers all and all that shyte. ;)

** First off, no idea. Never read any of that.

But I wanted to ask a question.

Whats the appeal of MPreg? I really don't get it and I'm curious.

*** I think a man having to unexpectedly deal with a pregnancy could make for a really interesting body horror storyline.

*** I'm not religiously into it or anything myself, I can't stand fluffy MPreg and would rather /shoot myself in the head/, but I guess I just like the idea of 2 men being able to give birth without the need of finding a woman to help them out. Not that I mind surrogacy or adoption in any way, but it'd be nice if everyone could make that choice themselves.

Mostly, I like to see the social and cultural implications, in case of HP Fanfics something like a lack of homophobia, the use of blood adoptions etc. Blood is important in this fandom, so I guess it just fits they'd think of making a potion/spell to keep themselves pure. Oh and it's not the pregnancy itself I like, au contraire the idea of anyone giving birth is super icky (saw a birth on TV once, I'm never having kids!).

If you do like M/M and would like to read a, in my opinion, good MPreg I could try to scourge something up for you if you give me you fave pairing and some time. :) It's been a while, I've been obssessed with other tropes lately. May I ask why you /don't/ read MPreg? My guess: Assbabies. Just. omg ... so much lol. Its why it took me forever to even attempt reading a MPreg fic, hehe. (I am a firm believer in a cesarian section and a magical womb for MPreg. Yes i have /opinions/.)

**** I also always imagined the baby would be cut out at the end of pregnancy. My brain refused to process assbaby images and still refuses.

I guess I get it, somewhat.

Don't trouble yourself. The reason I don't read it is probably that I can't even begin to relate with it. I also read close to no male-slash fics. Thanks for the offer and the answer, though.

*** I can only imagine young, pregnant women staying at home during their pregnancy and need an outlet for their pre-natal frustrations, so they use their favorite fictional hero as a self-insert where /he/ has to deal with this shit. I guess that's one awful, horrible way of expressing the frustrations of pregnancy.

Seriously, I can't imagine anyone else who would want to write or read such a fic other than frustrated pregnant women.

** The character in this story is still in college and whilst someone else is going through Mpreg, he isn't having any of it. Great read... [[http://www.amazon.com/Omega-Moon-Shifter-Mpreg-Adult-ebook/dp/B01ASLCAEO]]
