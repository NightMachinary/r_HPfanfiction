I mean, at that point, the self-fulling aspect is already in effect. The prophesy saying Voldemort has to kill Harry is redundant. Voldemort is already after Harry. Did the Order spend a year guarding the prophesy, not from Voldemort, but from Harry?


** I would have preferred they just trust Harry, help him sneak into the DOM to take the prophecy and leave a decoy (so Voldemort still wastes time trying to get it).

The Order could then devote their time to tracking Death Eater activity and collecting as much info as possible so they can move quickly when then Ministry finally acknowledges Voldemort is back.

And maybe do some proactive planning on how to help muggleborns and their families in the worst case scenario.

** Since only Voldemort or Harry could actually take the prophesy The order members were playing Russian roulette, After all If Voldemort actually turned up the Person Guarding it was Dead.

I wonder if there was a Dead man's switch on the Person Guarding the prophesy so Dumbledore and the rest of the order Knew to go to the Ministry to head off Voldemorts escape after he had already taken the prophecy?

Nope. The only reason they knew Mr. Weasley was attacked soon enough to save him was due to Harry's vision.

**** So the only way they would know that Vodemort had heard the prophesy is when someone finds and report about the corpse of the Order Gaurd assuming that Voldemort dosn't just Transfiger their body into a marble and take it with him to dispose of it at a later time.

I guess they would know when the order member dosn't report in and Snape lets them know they Voldemort has been to and left the department of mysteries.

Edit:or it could be that the dead man switch wasn't triggered because Arthur didn't die.

** My belief there is that Albus really didn't give a shit about Voldemort knowing the prophecy (Harry will have to kill Voldemort regardless of it, and Voldemort knows it already), however it kept Voldemort focused on the prophecy for a whole year. They made it look like there's something super important in it, thus keeping Voldemort from outright attacking the world.

I'm not a huge fan of how it was done though. It can only be removed by Harry, Neville and Voldemort. Harry doesn't know about it nor would he be inclined to steal it even if he did, Neville is still the most useless character in the series at the start of OotP, so even if he did decide to steal the prophecy, he would probably, metaphorically speaking, trip over his long bottom, and if Voldemort was to come himself, the guard would be extremely pointless as I highly doubt anyone in the Order bar Dumbledore could fight Voldemort.

*** The thing is though, Voldemort didn't sit on his ass and brood about the prophesy. He made inroads to the giants, he busted his inner circle out of Azkaban. Voldemort had an entire year of the Ministry sitting on it's ass, and attacking it's own people, while he built his forces up.

Dumbledore was probably wishing Voldemort would be stupid enough to stage an open attack and out himself. "It was foolish to come here tonight, Tom," said Dumbeldore calmly. "The Aurors are on their way-"

**** In a way, yes. But a lot of his attention was still diverted towards the prophecy, attention that would otherwise be diverted towards civilians.

** To keep it from Harry so he didn't blame himself for everything Voldemort did with the knowledge that he is the only one who could stop him.

To keep it from the public so they don't expect Harry to do it all. That could me they turn on him for not doing enough or they might stop fighting and lose all hope since nothing they do seems to matter.

To keep it from Voldemort so he can't use it to isolate Harry. He could issue a public challenge to Harry, put Harry in the position to be a coward if he doesn't answer. Voldemort loves a show of his power, a public opportunity to defeat the only one who could possibly stop him sounds perfect. Voldemort might also be far faster moving and public in his efforts, after all, the prophecy suggests that he is unstoppable unless he faces Harry. Voldemort leading from the front would get far more done.

I doubt Harry would have tried to bust into the ministry just to get the prophecy. He did in book 5 because he thought Sirius was in danger.

I think Prophecies can only removed by the people who the prophecies refer to...

** My theory is that the prophecy was kept hidden as it offered Harry an additional layer of protection. Since Harry, along with Dumbledore is one of the main symbols of light and someone who has repeatedly made a mockery of Voldemort, if Voldemort had his way, Harry's death would be the first thing he would attempt to do if he revealed himself to the wizarding world on his own volition. But Voldemort would be quite paranoid after Harry managed to escape him thrice (four times if you count the chamber of secrets fiasco). Every time harry escapes, it is always using a crazy amount of luck and some obscure Deus ex machinas. He, being a believer of the prophecy, would assume that Harry managed to escape him every time due to the prophecy. This means that he would desperately try to get the second half of the prophecy to see if it offers any hints on killing Harry. Thus he would not try to capture or kill harry during this time as it would be quite embarrassing if he ended up offing himself again because of some obscure magic.
