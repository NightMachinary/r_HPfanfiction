For me, it's linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin4) and its two sequels. I haven't reread them in a long time, but I remember a dark, captivating world and a brilliant story.

** First fanfic ever or first HP fanfic? The former would be the fan-wanky [[https://StarDestroyer.net][StarDestroyer.net]] crossover, and the latter would probably be HPMoR. Thankfully I've found much better since then...

#+begin_quote
  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

I only read it because my husband had recently started reading HP fanfics; this one was funny enough that he started reading particularly humorous bits to me. I finally told him to stop interrupting me and send me the link so I could read it myself. Went from there.

** HPMoR. And honestly it was the perfect introduction for me, a heavy divergence AU that wasn't afraid to play with the setting and characters.

(I know I read a few others in the distant past, but I don't remember what they were and didn't really get into fanfic reading/writing prior to HPMoR so I consider that my gateway even if it isn't the actual first.)

** I for the life of me can't remember what it was called but the premise was sherry finds out he's actually Voldemort's son (maybe named morfin?) and joins him. It really sticks in my head even though I haven't read fit in at least half a decade (can't find it). I remember details like Harry starting at hog warts but leaving for the death eaters, fumble fore turning the order into the ‚Äúlife feeders‚Äù because he's lowkey evil, and some weird connection where it was just moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs, but also two Vs, Voldemort and vulpus (snaps of all people) who were another group separate from marauders), shipping was also weird, near the end of the story funny's is captured from hog warts and the death eaters say she needs to die, Harry kills her but I think she validates it, and at the becoming Harry leaves hogwarts with Ron and hermione, Ron stays loyal but I think Hermione is killer early on. If anyone knows what it is, I'd love to check it out again :)

** The first one I remember reading was a fic where Hermione was turned into a little girl with Draco and Harry helping take care of her

It stuck out to me because at some point Hermione is crying for ice cream. Harry says just give it to her but Draco said that would just be spoiling her

At that point I closed the fic. Even ~8 year old me realized that was out of character lmao

It wasn't hosted on fanfiction.net it was on a fan made site for hp fanfic and I can't remember much else about it. It definitely wasn't slash as I didn't know it even existed back then but there might have been other pairings

** During the time I was waiting for OotP, I was searching online for leaked versions of it. There was a fanfic called Harry Potter and the Phoenix Order that had a completely different premise. It also had a sequel called Harry Potter and the Ring of Ancients. I remember it being so cool for my 11 year old mind because it was the first time it introduced the concept of an evil Dumbledore who worked for the greater good. Unfortunately the author never finished the seventh year book and I remember being quite sad about it.

** I was reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (my least favorite Harry Potter book, by the way) and when Dumbledore and Harry were going through the memories people had of Tom Riddle (and that of his family), I wondered what Tom Riddle would be like at Hogwarts with Hermione there with him - not in a romantic sense but what he'd think of her and her intellectual abilities. So, I Google searched this exact thing and up came Fourier's Flaw by SiriusBlacksGodDaughter via FanFiction. Interested, I read it and loved it at the time. Now, though, I don't hold the story in a high regard after rereading it but it still holds a special place in my heart being that it was the first Fan Fiction I read (much like Ginger Pye holds a special place in my heart because when I read it, it was the longest I had at the time).
