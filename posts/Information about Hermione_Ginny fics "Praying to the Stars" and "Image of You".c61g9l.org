So, the first question. I've seen a number of mixed recommendations for the fic Image of You by angelic1hp. Because of the angsty nature of the story, I'd really like to know if it has a happy ending for Hermione and Ginny's relationship before I commit to reading it. Can anyone who's read it let me know?

Question two. Praying to the Stars by Someryn has also come up a number of times for recommendations for H/Hr/G but the stories disappeared from FFN. Does anyone know if it's been posted elsewhere or have an ebook they can share?
