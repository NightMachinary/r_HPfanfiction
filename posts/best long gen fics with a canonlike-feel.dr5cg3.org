what are (in your opinion) the best Hogwarts fics which are similar to canon in terms of being gen & Harry POV and dealing largely with everyday school life & relationships? I love fics which really go into classes and magic and the school atmosphere, with lots of interactions between the other kids/staff. AUs and Canon Divergence are both fine, and I don't mind fics which go a bit off the rails w plot as long as it's not too ooc or unbelievable or full of bashing. for example, some like this I've enjoyed are:

-the Crow Rides a Pale Horse series with its focus on Harry's relationships with everyone and its believable child-feel linkao3(632600) -The Pureblood Pretence linkffn(7613196) with the length & level of detail that goes into the ins-and-outs of magical life -The Problem of Potions linkao3(10588629) -On the Way to Greatness linkao3(559219) etc -Forging the Sword linkffn(3557725)

I'm mainly looking for gen fics, but if there's romance for Harry I'd prefer m/m. thanks !


** My favourite long gen fic series is Weasley Girl, which is two books and a couple side stories so far. It features fem!Ron, but is (mostly) told from Harry's POV just like canon. It diverts wildly from the canon stations halfway through book 1 in the most realistic way I've ever seen. All the character development is great too, especially Neville and Ronnie herself.

it's later revealed that Ronnie is into girls, but there's been literally no romance so far other than Ginny's normal canon crush & Ronnie noticing Luna has nice hair.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  The Wizarding world hadn't seen the rise of the Three Lords in over a thousand years. Although time and again people tried to claim they were the Light Lord or the Dark Lord, the Grey Lord was absent altogether. How would Harry's life have changed if he were the Grey Lord? With a little bit of of Arthurian legend and a whole lot of book-slinging, the Three Lords' rise to power won't be easy, but together, they will interject the Wizarding world with the one thing it was sorely lacking: common sense. 11/26/18 - ON HIATUS while I work on original work for a while. :)

** Well, I just caught up to the fifth book of the Alexandra Quick series and feel like it's excellent, publishable quality. It's not about any of the cannon cast or even about hogwarts (it's set in America) but it manages to capture that slight mystery/coming into the world of magic feel that attracted me to Harry Potter as a kid.

It has flaws, but I honestly stopped noticing them in favor of the things I liked. The best part is, if you read through the first book there are four others with more to come!

There's excellent character development (which the main character needs) and it excels beyond any other HP work I've read in addressing and considering multiple magical cultures and how they would interact. Characters are flawed but not just for the sake of it, characters are set up as minor antagonists without sacrificing believably as individuals, and the protagonist manages to achieve a hard won competency that doesn't feel like the author wanted to make them good at something for the sake of it. Oh, and even though you feel like Alexandra is progressing and becoming a very talanted witch, it is never to the point where she is throwing around experienced adults effortlessly.
