  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I don't know if it's the kind of thing you want, but there is a chance that it is so I direct you towards “Island of Fire” (linkao3(3236603)).

Outside of that, I remember something maybe like that happening in Darth Marrs's “Revenge of the Wizard”, but I have to admit that it felt too “and then they did stuff and were awesome all around” when they begun making their base and so I just stopped reading; as such, I have no idea if the element you are looking for actually is there to the degree you want it.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  The Better Burrow arc from my Lone Traveler compendium: The Lone Traveler encounters the Burrow before it was expanded. Maybe it can be made into a safer and more comfortable home for this version of the Weasleys. It's amazing how much a building can change history.
