like if you've ever read judith mcnaught's kingdom of dreams, then you'd know what i am talking about. i want to read a fic where main couples dynamic is where one of them is big,strong and heavily scarred from the battles of his past and the other is soft and caring and caresses the scars and kisses them with love. (i am a hopeless romantic)

does anyone have any recommendations?


** I want to read a Harry/Luna like this where Harry's this like six foot tall battle scared Auror who basically gets dragged across the world by five foot tall and petite Luna to look for creatures and just have fun. Itd be cute

****** The original story was going to be Harry and Luna going across America and documenting what they find (in the story itd be explained that the Americas aren't that explored magically compared to the old world.) It would be a sort of biography with a chapter about the creatures and places they find and then actual story between them.

It was supposed to be framed as a book Harry and Luna wrote.

***** I'd say book!Harry is around 5'8". He describes a ton of people as "tall" (probably due to J.K. Rowling being 5'5" tbf) and I believe he's the same height as Narcissa in HBP.

Harry being 5'5" and having Ginny be taller than him is the one thing I like about the movies so I tend to use it anyway.

** If you like that particular dynamic, then linkffn(Learning to Breathe by onoM) is pretty close to that. Its Harry/Ginny, but the characterizations in the story are more in line with those of Full Metal Panic (a mildly entertaining school/military/mecha/romance anime, look it up if your interested).
