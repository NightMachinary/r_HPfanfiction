I'm looking for fics that have Harry older than he was in canon.

I've read some interesting stories where he befriends entirely different people and goes into different houses or even defeats Voldemort earlier (his canon 2nd year, 6th year in the story, in this particular instance).

I'll take almost anything except slash (unless it's a small part of the story).

Thanks in advance!

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

  A prophecy left unfulfilled, a family torn apart by repercussions of war and one child left to a life of neglect. But there were those not content to allow this to pass. Harry Potter may have been abandoned at the end of the war but he will rise to be more than any could have imagined.

****** They're not older harry fics specifically, but linkffn(12317784) and linkffn(12155794) are his other completed fics. Honour thy Blood is a little unrefined in the first half in its technical writing, but the focus on Harry living up to the Potter family's legacy (his grandfather's specifically) is really satisfying and all three of the authors fics are Black Family centric which i enjoy. Stepping Back is a great Time Travel fic and the author's writing skills are much better in this one. Honour Thy blood may not have been the first fic i read but it is the one that hooked me into reading fanfic as a regular pastime/hobby.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
