Can we just have one fic where there's no family drama in it please? I'm so tired of it. No WBWL crap where James somehow mentally regresses back into a teenager and where Lily thinks it's fine to leave her son with her sister and then never check on him.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily and Harry met Hermione's mum on that fateful day. One of the better robst fics.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily were more paranoid here and set a very nasty trap for Voldemort. They fled Magical Britain afterwards and Harry never went to Hogwarts.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], linkffn(10099028): No Voldemort AU, Bellatrix and Hermione are main characters. Decent story, but Harry, James, and Lily are minor characters.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): Non magic AU, but an excellent Harry/Ginny romance. [[/spoiler][Potters, Hermione, Sirius, Tonks are all Americans, and Lily is the POTUS]]

The Boy-Who-Lived... Is Over There by tyrannicpuppy

Voldemort chooses The Longbottoms and the Most logical outcome plays out, everyone is brought in and questioned, Sirius walks away Scott free, Wormtail is outed and kissed, and the Potters wanting a more quite existance while staying close move into the Muggle world where obviously Harry And Hermione become friends

*** That Everyone Lives AU series is technically well written but terrible. In order to get Harry to go through all the stations of canon again even with loving parents and uncles, they get turned into idiots who angst, soap opera like, about telling him the truth about adventure of the week. They eventually decide to keep this truth from Harry, and a few paragraphs later, with almost unfailing accuracy Harry will almost die because of this truth not yet told him.

In the 2nd year, Lily Potter accompanies her son to face the basilisk and basically cries while Harry defeats it. It's really just such a bummer for people wanting to read it to see how awesome Harry's life could be with his parents alive.

  Mr. and Mrs. Potter were not perfectly ordinary people. They did not live on an ordinary street like you or I. They did not have a small house with a number to differentiate it from the identical houses on either side of it. They had, in fact, quite the opposite of it all.----How different would the world of Harry Potter be if James and Lily had lived? Ships not listed because I'm unsure if there will be deviations from canon in that respect. Characters will be added as they appear.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
