*[1]* is pretty straightforward. I have a character who needs to die for plot reasons. They've just found the bad guy doing something they shouldn't, but the bad guy isn't the sort to go straight for murder and is more likely to attempt a memory charm. Can you think of any way that could go so badly wrong as to kill someone?

(I can alter the scene so they have a fight leading to accidental death instead, but I'm curious if anyone has idea for botching memory charms.)

As for *[2]*, I wrote a scene last night that involves Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries for reasons unrelated to the prophecy, and it was only this morning that I realised he's not going to pass up such an obvious opportunity to go steal the prophecy. Aside from the obvious, what, if any, changes would him knowing the prophecy make to his actions during Harry's fifth year?

A lot more of his Death Eaters are in prison in this scenario; only about half a dozen are left free, including Snape (who is a loyal spy for Dumbledore). Obviously, getting more followers is going to be his highest priority and he can't skip straight to terrorising people, but I can't imagine how knowing the prophecy would actually affect his plans with regards to Harry.

Extra info that may or may not be relevant: his resurrection is publicly acknowledged before Harry goes home at the end of fourth year, and the events of the resurrection were different enough (no graveyard!) that there was no joining of the wands.

If you're not referencing the cave in, I don't understand because he lost his memories but otherwise wasn't physically injured by the spell.

** 1) Yes. When you can conjure a buffalo out of thin air when trying to levitate something, then botching up any spell could be lethal.

If you disregard that, which I've always done, because it's more than absolutely ridiculous, then maybe.

2) It depends on what type of Voldemort you're writing. If it's an insane one, he tries to kill Harry. If he's sane and intelligent, he tries to either gather every single possible detail about him, so as not to leave any "power he knows not", gets someone else to do something about him, if not kill him then Obliviate/maim him enough he's as good as useless, but that's unlikely, as he'd likely read more into "neither can live while the other survives" than that.

Also, consider that it might not be possible to get the prophecy at that moment if he wants to be stealthy. It's at least my headcanon that the death eaters had to go to some lengths to ensure that the DoM was accessible and the ministry empty that particular night for that trap to work.

I wouldn't call that botching the spell, though. The wizard in that anecdote cast the /wrong spell/ on accident, not a "bad" levitation spell.

**** It wasn't a levitation spell that botched to conjure a buffalo, though. The wizard in Flitwick's cautionary tale said 's' in stead of 'f' and there's no 'f' in the incantation they were learning that day. It was a general cautionary tale about paying attention when casting spells (especially if you had a speech impediment).

(My personal headcanon is that Flitwick was bowdlerising that tale for the kiddies' sake, and Baruffio might or might not have had a buffalo on his chest, but he certainly ended up with one on his /conscience/)

**** See, I've never actually had a discussion with anyone on that, but that line actually shatters everything you'd expect magic to be, and it's bothered me so badly.

It said that he "flished and swicked instead of a swish and flick", while he was trying to levitate something, right? Casting the wrong spell, as you say, should that ever be possible?

It's the same with how Harry used Snape's spells while not knowing what they do. He had no clue what a spell did, like with Levicorpus, and yet, it worked. I can take the explanation that Sectemsempra worked because he was fighting and knew it was "for enemies", so he'd expect something dangerous, but that's stretching it too.

All of that, it means magic doesn't work on intent, it's mechanical. That isn't something I will accept.

***** In the buffalo anecdote's case, I have reached a satisfying solution: the wizard was competent enough that as he performed the wand movement, he /realized/ he was messing up, and what's more, he recognized what he was doing as normally a buffalo-summoning spell --- so his thoughts jumpted to /that/ spell at the last moment, enough intent for it and the perfectly-cast mechanical aspects to complete the spell.

I'm agreed on the your headcanon, but stealth isn't high priority. Voldemort's breaking out rather than in, with the aid of an Unspeakable, and so late at night I figure there are probably few enough people about for Voldemort to kill his way to the Hall of Prophecies before leaving the Ministry.

** *(1)* A memory charm could be overpowered and completely destroy /all/ of their memories of /anything/, leaving them hardly better off than someone with a Dementor's Kiss. For a direct lethal consequence, you could get creative and have a misaimed memory charm make them /forget how to breathe/. Or perhaps there's a fire going on, the Memory Charm makes them forget what fire is, and they cheerfully dive in it out of curiosity before anyone can stop them. There's lots of options to choose from.

About *(2)*, I wrote a short one-shot about something a Prophecy-savvy Voldemort /might/ do, linkffn(Prophecy Averted), but realistically, it /wouldn't/ change much to his actions; he was already trying to kill Harry anyway. The actual contents of the Prophecy were more or less anticlimactic for him; he wanted it so he could check whether there /was/ any game-changer inside the ending, which there wasn't really. The Order of the Phoenix protecting it quite so heavily was a bluff, essentially --- making him think it was /really/ important so he'd lose time and effort trying to get to it rather than launch fully into his conquest just yet.

The bottom line is that if your Voldemort wasn't already spending his time seeking out the Prophecy, knowing it won't alter his motivations very much: he'll just keep "must kill Potter at earliest convenience" in the back of his mind, and go right on conquering the world.

*** Hmmm. I disagree with the assumption that you could make them forget how to breathe, as that seems to go beyond the scope of the spell. Obliviation removes memories, but is there a memory where one learns how to breathe? I would say there is not, that is is something subconscious that cannot be forgotten.

We see this explored in "A Little Child Shall Lead Them", where Hermione questions that even if she is obliviated, if she would be able to subconsciously know how to do things, in her movements or otherwise.

**** That's why I said "get creative" before I launched into that tangent: it would require additional worldbuilding that, while not going against canon, does /expand/ it, in assuming that memory-charms can deleted /skills/ as well as actual factual memories. Though whether breathing counts as a skill /is/ debatable even then, but you could at least make someone forget that they need to eat to survive, or make them forget how to walk.

***** Yes exactly! Babies have to LEARN how to walk and talk and what to eat and not eat by spending time with their parents teaching them those things, which means the memories of learning those things can be erased, which means you would forget HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS because you don't have the MEMORIES OF LEARNING IN THE FIRST PLACE FROM YOUR PARENTS.

So yes that makes total logical, realistic sense, even in plain canon harry potter books. You'd just have to go back really far into someone's head to find those memories.

Heck, that happens with real world brain damage! People can forget concepts like what teeth are or object permanence or how to make words, Why wouldn't magic be able to get rid of those memories and make someone unable to know how to talk or walk again?

****** Really depends on the definition and scope of a "memory". Breathing wouldn't count, because that's an autonomous muscle contraction. Babies don't learn how to breath, they are born breathing. It's instinctual. You might forget how to /manually/ breath, but then you'd pass out and start breathing again, wake up, and forget about forgetting about breathing until you consciously notice that you are, in fact, breathing. Rinse and repeat.

I would say that if the memory spell were capable of that, it would have to be a Dark Magic variety made specifically to cause harm. The normal memory spell would be limited in scope to conscious memories, because otherwise that could get very messy in completely unintentional ways. The human brain is very interconnected and confusing, and the subconscious brain is still largely a mystery.

  Single point of divergence, one-shot. The Death Eaters succeed in getting the Prophecy to Voldemort, and this rather changes matters. Lord Voldemort wants to kill Harry Potter, yes, but he won't be the toy of Fate.
