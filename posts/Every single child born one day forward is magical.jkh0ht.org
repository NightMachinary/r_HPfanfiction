:END:
Been thinking about this recently, if only I had the writing talent to do this justice... but oh well.

Prompt is basically what it says in the title - on some random day, every single child in the world born from that point forward is magical.

First scene is something like McGonagall seeing that the cliched 'book of magical births' is completely full, or the quill went past the bottom of the page and she walks into a room covered with peoples names written on the wall, something like that.

Another scene that has McGonagall and Dumbledore telling the Ministry/the Wizengamot/the ICW. Another one telling the Prime Minister/UN.

I mean, just thinking about this now, think about the resources that would be required to support this. Physical resources, like plant/animal parts, for potion ingredients/wand parts, but also people in careers, like magical teachers, healers, aurors, etc.

Thinking about this from the political perspective, too - how would the purebloods deal with this news? Not well, I'm assuming because with a little forethought they'd realize with every single child in the world being magical, their faction in the government would shrink immensely, they'd be outnumbered by muggleborns by a ridiculous degree.

A big portion of this would be about how to integrate the wizard and muggle worlds/governments when you know that there's a finite time (10 years) before the statute of secrecy is completely meaningless, and every single child in the world will be at the age of their first year in magic school.

Though of course, even before that, all it would take is some person in like a mommy group talking about the weird stuff that's happening around their baby, before everyone else says hey mine too, and it goes public.


** Consider that there is in no way the resources to properly teach every magical child, based on the current infrastructure. So, who would be taught? Are you going to choose at random? No. Those with the connections to secure a spot, Purebloods and Halfbloods would be taught magic. The new muggleborns would probably be left in the dust. Would there even be enough wands for them all? Probably not. Durmstung doesn't even accept muggleborns. Most of them would never be told they're magical, I imagine. The statute of secrecy would be a bust, soon enough, even if the muggleborns are never informed of their magic. The sheer volume of accidental magic would be impossible to hide. Soon enough, you have those who do know magic, and those who don't. And let's be honest, magic is a gamebreaker for the wizards vs muggles debate. Now, there's two ways this can go. One, they expand the wizarding world to eventually teach everyone magic. it's super dope. Or, what I consider vastly more probable, those with power(magic) do their best to retain their monopoly on it, and society enters a strict caste system. Those who are taught magic, and those who are not. But, those who have magic, but know not how to harness it are the majority. Eventually, knowledge would get out. Even if the upper caste do their best to ensure it does not, over the course of years or decades, it would. And the lower caste would revolt, and probably win, ensuring free knowledge for everyone. Or they begin their own tyrannical reign. Or they lose, and deal with dragonhide boots stomping on their faces forever.

*** Well, that's a super depressing, though valid, take on this, lol.

There definitely would need to be a lot of changes that would need to be made for that first option, which was how I had been thinking this would go. That's kinda why my idea was to have McGonagall discover this by checking the book of magical births. Presumably she'd check it at least once a year, so that would give the magical world 10 years to prepare before having to deal with magical schooling on a wide spread, global population basis.

How long does it take to make a wand? Would wand makers be able to craft enough in those 10 years? Or would they choose to spend a few years teaching others how to craft wands, so they can start crafting more as well? Or maybe, just due to the numbers involved, it becomes no longer viable to craft wands beforehand and match them to a person (think of how long it took Ollivander to match Harry to his wand, then multiple that across three quarters of a million people - there might not even be enough time in a year to match all of them), so they would have to craft wands on an individual basis, for a person. All this would need to be figured out.

And then you need to do this same thing, thinking through all the consequences of needing to expand the magical government/system to work on a country wide scale, for every career/resource that is needed for the magical world. Combining modern medicine and healers, dealing with magical crime on a country wide basis, ensuring there's enough plant and animal resources for potions to be anywhere near as wide spread as it had been.

**** Oh man, that could make an amazing story. McGonagall (And the other hogwarts staff) forming a group, desperately trying to get the government/world ready for the sudden influx. They have to deal with naysayers who claim the book (or whatever tracks magical children) is broken and refuse to take action. They have to deal with purebloods who attempt to use to this barr muggleborns from wizarding society, citing scarcity (iirc it was the Whig party in Britain which cited Malthusian theory to perpetuate the inevitability of scarcity in order to justify large wealth gaps and hating poor people). The obliviators are worked to the bone, desperately trying to keep up the masquerade and governmental and societal pressure forces them to keep quiet. I recently watched The Normal Heart (which broke mine) Which is about a gay men's health group desperately trying to raise awareness/funding/help against AIDs despite the government refusing to take it seriously or even take notice of the death toll. I think that kind of tone could work well. Though, I don't think I could write it lol.

** In case anyone else was wondering about the math, there were [[https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/vitalstatisticspopulationandhealthreferencetables][about 730,000 births in the UK in 2018]], which is about 2000 births/day. [[https://www.statista.com/statistics/281977/live-births-in-the-united-kingdom-uk-1961-1990/][The numbers were pretty similar around Harry's time]].

It's not really clear how many students are at Hogwarts. Rowling once said it was about 1000, but she is notoriously bad at math. Most estimates I've seen put the number at about 250-700 based on various numbers in the books. But they definitely wouldn't be able to handle 2000 first years if they didn't prepare for it. Fortunately, the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad would almost certainly have taken note of the massive upswing in accidental magic years before that.

*** Oh, I meant every single child from that point forward forever, not just the one day. So 3/4th of a million first years, not 2000, hah.

With numbers like these, I don't know if it would even be possible for there to be enough wizards and witches to field a single teacher at all the schools necessary, much less one for each subject.

Maybe normal schools would just do the basics to teach kids how to control their magic, to avoid accidental magic, and other less directly magic using subjects, until they graduate. And then learning more advanced OWL/NEWT level magic would be treated as more of a trade school thing, taught to people who are interested and want to make a career out of it, not everybody in whatever the British version of high school is called (secondary?).

I imagine the drastic increase in demand and non-commensurate increase in supply, magical resources would drain immensely fast.

And then in the year 2020 the goblins of Gringotts loot the ancient runins were the curse that suppressed the majority of the world magic was cast. The curse breakers do their job breaking the curse and suddenly every muggle, Non-magical animal and planet,ect suddenly has their magic unsuppressed.

The muggle world then has to learn how to deal with not only their population suddenly developing magic but also all the plants,animal the world and environment in general with thing like magic storms and natural disasters.

** This is legitamately terrifying when you think about it.

This wouldn't be a scenario where every muggle on the planet adapted to wizarding life. Rather, magic would be the one adapting to muggle life. Wizarding problems like blood discrimination would virtually vanish because all the people who gave a shit and have the power to enforce their viewpoint are now vastly outnumbered. Wizarding life would change completely to become "muggleized". No more old clothes, old castles, and everyone will be scrambling to make technology work with magic.

Not to mention prevalent muggle issues. Racism, sexism, terrorism, wars, riots, school shootings, organized crime. Those don't go away, they just replace blood purity. And definitely for the worst. Its not just one radical wizard running around killing babies in magical Britain anymore. Every nation across the globe has an entire population of people who could kill with the swish of a stick. If wizarding society sucked so bad with only one major issue (blood purity) and on such a small scale, it'll be pretty bad news if applied to billions of people who hate eachother based on things like race and religion.

Basically like the cold war all over again. All it takes is one nation utilizing magic as a means of mass destruction and bam you got another world war on your hands.

Also, at first a lot of those kids could be turned into child soldiers.

And a lot of people would go untrained in their magic too, making them dangerous if it acts up.

Totally easier to murder people in general, actually.

Theres a lot of terrible things that would happen if everyone got magic all of sudden Iol.

**** I could see that happening, but only after a couple generations a least. Sexism isn't tied only to physical strength after all. It's part of culture. A woman being able to curse someone as well as a man doesn't mean a woman can recieve equal employment oppurtunities, pay, or be recognized by society as a complete equal. Expectations and gender roles are deeply rooted. Magical power would be a gateway to equal rights, but it's not an instant or easy thing. It would just be a tool. It would take decades of trail blazers and a fight for equality to eventually change the culture enough through each successive generation. More so for the nations with an already restrictive and rigid culture.

But I could see it speeding things up. It's easier to organize meetings, marches, distribute informative material, and show examples of feminism if the organizers could fend off those who want to stop them.

** What actually causes children of wizards and witches to be magical? Is it something in the DNA? Some other property of the cells? Or does it happen during the development in the womb?

A morally dubious wizard with access to test subjects, genetics expert and an IVF clinic could probably do things such as DNA from nonmagical parents in cells from magical parents and the other way around to narrow it down. Once it's figured out which conditions exactly result in magical offspring, it might be possible to artificially produce those conditions at scale.

For example if it's not DNA and the child being magical depends on how magical the sperm and ova cells are plus random fluctuation, then it might be possible to get a witch to donate ova cells, duplicate them somehow and increase potency, then remove the nucleus and replace them with nuclei from nonmagical test tube embryos, and the result would be a magical clone of the muggle embryo, resulting in a magical child with DNA from muggle parents. Therefore growing the magical population without the small gene pool issue. If the approach can be done safely and at scale, there'll probably be more than enough parents who'd pay a few grand to give their child magical abilities to double the population.
