Because, it occurs to me, if we take all the Indy!Harry cliches as-is (P.S. I blame [[/u/flingerdinger][u/flingerdinger]] for putting this idea in my head), goblins:\\
* Run the /only/ bank in Magical Britain, reserve/central banks included, with pretty much the entire economy going through them.\\
* Have the authority to manage lordships, land ownership, marriage contracts, emancipations, and pretty much every other kind of legal document.\\
* Can get away with imposing entire vaults worth of fees and fines, and sometimes decades of forced labour, usually on whichever witch/wizard happens to be being bashed by the story.\\
* Have secret goblin magic which is capable of making positively unbreakable wards, can easily undo Harry's scar horcrux, and on occasion insta-kill Voldemort from halfway across the continent with no saving throw.

So, if we run with all of that, are there any stories where goblinkind are actually responsible for running the magical world? Passing legislation regarding all the magical creatures, tightly regulating the use of their secret goblin magic, allocating funds to various public projects, and utilising human witches/wizards to act as representatives dealing with muggles (and as camouflaged Obliviators), whilst letting the human Ministry of Magic think that /they're/ in charge with their regulations on games and children's toys (e.g. wands)?


** This sounds brilliant.
