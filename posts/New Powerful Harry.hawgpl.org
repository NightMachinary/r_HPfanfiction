Newer fics that include an extra powerful Harry. It could be started recently, but fics that were also updated or completed recently are okay as well(meaning in the past 2 months or so).

Thanks


** Harry Potter and The Ashes of Chaos, by ACI100.

You can read it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13507192/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Ashes-of-Chaos][here]] on FFN, and [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1664050][here]] on AO3.

~~~~~~~~~~

I don't really know what you mean by "extra powerful". We won't see Harry beating Voldemort anytime soon, but he is very advanced for his age. His character introduction reminds me alot of Tom Riddle's character introduction though. He learns from a young age that he has magic (though he doesn't know exactly what his "powers" where defined as at the time) and he experiments to see what he can do.

The author updates weekly, so you won't have to wait ages between chapters. They've already finished Book 1.

Hope you enjoy. =)

*** By extra powerful I meant like Harry>=Dumbledore and Voldemort, or at least on the way there. Thanks for the rec.
