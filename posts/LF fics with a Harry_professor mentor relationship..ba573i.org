To clarify- I absolutely do not want any sort of Harry/Teacher romance. I dislike those sorts of fics, and really do not want to read one.

I'm looking more for closer relationships between Harry and one or more professors. Maybe McGonagall teaches him how to be an animagus and tells him about his parents and they bond and such, or Flitwick teaches him to duel and takes on a 'weird uncle' role, or Dumbledore teaches him how to be an absolute monster of a wizard while being his kindly grandfather self.

Bonus points if there's also romance happening with Harry/student. Pref no slash, HP/GW, or HP/HG.

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** I know that it's a divisive story on this sub, but the mentor relationship that Harry has with the professors is one of the major parts of /HPMOR./

Also, technically, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart][this fic]] I wrote fits your criteria. However, the professor in question is an OC.

  Petunia married a biochemist, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter, and a world of intriguing new possibilities to exploit. And new friends, like Hermione Granger, and Professor McGonagall, and Professor Quirrell... COMPLETE.

  During the battle at the Department of Mysteries something unexpected happens and a knight from a place far, far away suddenly finds himself in the strange world of Harry Potter. How will Harry, as well as the rest of the wizarding world react to having a paladin thrust into their midst? Evil closes in on all sides, yet the Light still shines in the Darkness. Slight AU.

  Among the assets left behind by the Death Eaters, Harry Potter learns that he now owns the Chudley Cannons. And they need help getting back up and running after the war. Fortunately, Harry knows just the wizard for the job. What do you get when you mix Arithmancy and Quidditch? Hopefully, wins. (Post-War One-shot)

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
