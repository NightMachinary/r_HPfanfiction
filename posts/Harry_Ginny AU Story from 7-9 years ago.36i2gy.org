I'm looking for a story I read about 7-9 years ago. Ginny was a Healer working at St. Mungos and dating a famous quidditch star. Her father was Minister of Magic. She accidentally got pregnant but her boyfriend was a jerk and left her. The story ended with Harry coming in to the emergency room, she worked on him, and realized that she really did love Harry.

Thanks in advance!
