Are there any docs in which Harry @ 11 gets the Lord Potter title but since he knows nothing about the wizard world and is considered an adult, he gets screwed? Maybe after that he has to fix all the shit he f'ed up with his ignorance?


** Maybe consider having a better title than "Request" if you want any replies
