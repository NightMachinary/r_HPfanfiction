You can see the new chapter [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/14/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][here]] (chapter 14), or start from the beginning [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][here]].

*Summary:* Applied Cultural Anthropology, or ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

** For some reason, I just didn't buy Hermione defending Draco's actions. I think regardless of what House she would be still be Lawful-Good and disagree with Draco's blatant cheating.

But perhaps this is her character and she would actually condone Draco's actions. Either way, it painted her as very annoying. Not that she isn't in character, but I make the comparison to AQ. Well written, but it makes me dislike the character.

Hermione wasn't Lawful Good in canon; why would she be that in Slytherin, of all places? In canon, she only looks Lawful because Harry is Chaotic Good, or, really, Impulsive Good, while Hermione actually tries to think about the consequences of her actions. To the extent that D&D alignments are meaningful, canon Hermione is Neutral Good: most rules and regulations are good idea most of the time, but nothing wrong with defying or breaking them if the cost-benefit calculation works out. (If there's an LG character in canon, it's probably Dumbledore or McGonagall.)

She's the one who all but told him to do it. Perhaps she hadn't intended for him to be so violent about it, but it's not like Hermione is good at figuring out when she's gone too far.

The problem with AQ, IMO, is not that AQ makes bad decisions and gets in trouble, but that she /never/ learns from her mistakes, no matter how huge and consequential, making the exact same mistakes the year after. Hermione in ACA, on the other hand, is learning the lessons life in Slytherin is teaching her /too/ well. Sneaky, vicious behaviour has paid off for her time and again, starting with her earning her first friend in Slytherin by repaying her bully fivefold in one day, and, most recently, getting Pansy back in line and solidifying Draco's view of her as his leader.

**** I still think Hermione would tend to fall in the category of Lawful-Good than Neutral-Good. When Hermione disobeys orders, it is because it comes from an authority that doesn't promote goodness. My memory is fuzzy, but I can't recall a scenario in which Dumbledore/McGonagall/whatever authority deemed as good explicitly tells her, "Don't do this" and she disobeys them. But these are shades of gray, a character doesn't just fall in one categorization.

I think the larger point I was trying to make is that Hermione should recognize the difference between playing "hard and physical" and "cheating to injure."

This particular exchange baffled me as I don't think ACA!Hermione or Canon!Hermione would ever be pulled into this kind of homerism.

  ...checking his momentum while at the same time crooking out an arm. A second later Harry Potter was almost wrapped around his elbow, taking the shot straight to the stomach.

  ...Hermione was beside herself. "Draco's allowed to hold his position! If anything that's a foul on Potter for running in to him."
#+end_quote

Anyone with two eyes knows that Draco was trying to injure Potter and it was nothing about holding position. That Hermione would display this kind of homerism just broke character for me as it seemed like the author was trying too hard to force Dark!Hermione.

That's easy. In PS, McGonagall says: don't go after the Stone. Hermione joins Harry and Ron in going after the Stone (and is the only one to assault another person in cold blood to do so). For that matter, after the Troll Incident, she casually lies to McGonagall about what had led her there. That's with six books to spare.

Anyway, how many times do we (and by "we", I mean Harry, since he's the PoV character), see someone deemed good order her to do something even remotely controversial in the first place?

Pretty much the only instance I can think of is during OotP, when Hermione, on Dumbledore's orders, refrained from putting any potentially sensitive information in her letters to Harry over the summer. (By the way, contrary to fanon, both Ron and Hermione wrote to Harry; they just didn't include any information about what was going on on the Voldemort front.) Now, to me, that seems like basic operational security: you do not mail intelligence via an easily intercepted medium (an owl) to someone with a mental link of unknown nature to the best Legilimens alive. Ron, by the way, also obeyed that directive, and there's no way he's Lawful anything.

You're the one who brought D&D alignments into this. If you want to concede that Hermione can't be assigned a proper alignment on the Law-Chaos scale --- which means Neutral probably fits her best --- please go ahead.

On reread, I think that this is, indeed, a possible issue --- though there's no reason to perpetuate bad fanon to make the point. At the same time, Hermione has every incentive to rationalise. Like I wrote, she's the one who told Draco to help the team by obstructing Harry --- to engage in unsportsmanlike behaviour to win. For her to condemn Draco now would be to condemn herself in part. She also has a lot invested in her pride and identity as a Slytherin, caught up in the moment, and resenting Harry for the special treatment that she perceives him as getting. So, I suspect that she might feel bad about it later, but, in the moment, her behaviour makes sense. (That might be worth poking jacobk about.)

****** Hmm. Maybe the fanon whitewashing has blurred my perceptions of Hermione a bit. For someone that writes a lot of HPFF, I certainly haven't read the books in quite a long time.

I won't bother jacobk about it. The story is one of my favorites and high standards do bring out picky criticisms. I just really don't think Hermione would be all that interested in Quidditch, but perhaps trying to maintain her position in the House would require more knowledge of the sport - moreso than canon. Either way, there's still a fallout to deal with, so I can't make any harsh judgements on her character until then.

*** Most sports fans consider tactical fouls to be fair game. Depending on the level of physicality of the game, and the particulars of the foul of course. As an example, if it would get a red card in soccer, it's gone too far, but if it would get a yellow card, nobody thinks it's cheating.

**** A tactical foul would be one of the Slytherin chasers grabbing onto a Gryffindor broom to stop them from scoring. Clean, preventing an obvious scoring opportunity, and no one is hurt in the process. That's akin to someone grabbing onto an attacker's shirt so they don't get caught out on the break.

What Draco is doing is akin to John Terry kicking a player off the ball, trying to either injure them or throw them off their game. Or elbowing them in the head. Or slowing down and elbowing the player oncoming to them.

It really broke character when Hermione says that Harry ran into Draco while, in reality, Draco intentionally slowed down to elbow Harry.

There's a line between a clean, tactical foul (or even a hard tackle) and an intent to injure and Draco quite obviously crossed that line from the start. That Hermione would defend his actions just doesn't strike me as fitting for her character.

I understand supporting the team/House, but Hermione should be smart enough to recognize the difference between a tactical ploy and an intent to injure. She does not or is written as not recognizing that, and it just seems very OOC for her - even in this story.

#+end_quote

My reading was that the intent to injure was baked into the tactical Polly from the very start, maybe even suggested by Hermione. And because of the high level of physicality in the game as well as magical healing, it (in my mind) could very well be in tactical foul territory.

In the sport I competed in, there are some situations where the person in the lead has the right-of-way, no matter what. The same sort of thing would be legal, although it wouldn't make any friends.
