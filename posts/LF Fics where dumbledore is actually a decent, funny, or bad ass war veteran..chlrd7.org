There are so many fics where dumbles is a manipulating old coot who only wants world domination. I'm looking for fics where there is actually a good banter/mentor relationship between Harry and Dumbledore. He has fought in two wars, he should be shown as some who has. Finished reading linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot]]) a while back and that is the sort of relationship I want to read. Any help is greatly appreciated.


** Good examples I can think of are:

- linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane) features a mentor!Dumbledore to Harry, who spent forty years abroad fighting dark wizards and witches (with some interesting background too, see chapter 17/18 later on). Work through the first 5-7 chapters, the fic really improves.
- linkffn(Realignment) displays Dumbledore as both a kind mentor and total badass defending Tom Riddle from both Grindelwald and time-traveling Harry Potter.
- linkffn(The Firebird's Son) and its sequels show Dumbledore as constantly working to protect both Harry and his students from retribution, going so far as to challenge the Ministry directly to protect them.
- linkffn(By the Divining Light) is a short adventure story with Harry and Dumbledore diving into old magic together to undo the acts of Voldemort.

**** You made me curious about this, so I did a little research. So far I haven't found anything that says what percentage of soldiers suffered from psychological trauma in WWI, most likely because there was no standard diagnosis like we have in modern times, and doctors were often discouraged from making a psychological diagnosis because that would place the patient under stigma from assumed personal failings.

[[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3181586/][This article]] has numbers for WWII:

#+begin_quote
  "For the total overseas forces in 1944, admissions for wounded numbered approximately 86 per 1000 men per year, and the neuropsychiatrie rate was 43 per 1000 per year."

  (...)

  "In contrast to WWI, the course of symptoms over decades and their chronic nature were extensively studied in WWII survivors. For instance, in 1988, we studied a group of French civilians living in the AlsaceLorraine region who were conscripted into the German army and later held in captivity in Russia. This population of Alsace-Lorraine was interesting because it was bilingual, French and German, and had cultural roots in both heritages. The analysis of 525 questionnaires showed that, after over four decades, 82% still experienced intrusive recollections and nightmares of their wartime captivity; 73% actively attempted to avoid thoughts or feelings associated with the trauma; 71% reported a foreshortened sense of the future; and nearly 40% reported survivor guilt. Beyond PTSD, these survivors from Alsace-Lorraine also suffered lasting personality changes. We believe that an aggravating factor was the fact that these individuals returned home uncelebrated, embittered, psychologically isolated, and that they were caught in a web of psychological ambiguity."

****** *Fenian raids*

Between 1866 and 1871, the Fenian raids of the Fenian Brotherhood, an Irish Republican organization based in the United States, on British army forts, customs posts and other targets in Canada, were fought to bring pressure on the United Kingdom to withdraw from Ireland. They divided Catholic Irish-Canadians, many of whom were torn between loyalty to their new home and sympathy for the aims of the Fenians. The Protestant Irish were generally loyal to the UK and fought with the Orange Order against the Fenians. There were five Fenian raids of note and all of them ended in failure.

here you go.

its rather interesting how nonviolent we are now, historically people went to war and for the vast of amount of history to kill someone meant stabbing them with something sharp. people would go and watch public executions and torture for fun. gladiator games and chariot races where people died. the romans even got slaves to reenact famous battles with the killing involved

we live in one of the most peaceful times in history where if you live in a first world country you live better then kings of old did I think we can over protect people, and then the world breaks them because they are not used to how tough it can be

***** War is a terrible but also a great thing. That is a very controversial statement, but what i mean bu that is that while war causes death, it also breeds creation. War can be looked as as an incentive to innovation in a way. Just look at all of the developments and progress that came out of WW2. It's just one of looking at it, genocide is not something that i agree with at all and WW2 was truly a terrible thing.

EDIT: I always knew this opinion would be downvoted. This is not my opinion, it is just ONE aspect that is a product of war. “great” was definitely not the right word to use reading back now.

** That fic, Barefoot, had such an amazing premise. Harry with psychometric powers. Then the author wanks Harry to the heavens by making him hoover up skills and knowledge by touching other people's wands, constantly teases a harem with Tonks, Hermione and FUCKING HEDWIG of all creatures, despite the constant authors notes promising that a harem won't be happening, and just has too much stereotypical anime/harem banter that just doesn't make sense in a Harry Potter setting IMHO. Harry/Tonks in the first year is just fucking weird. I really tried my best to ignore it for the sake of the story but it was hard.

The world building and magic additions are truly top notch. The story after a certain point, leagues below that IMHO. I'd really love a fic with this premise written by a different writer whose interests and style are more like my own.

**** I mean, the canon books all centre around a mystery. A Harry with psychometry would tear through most of these mysteries like tissue paper. You wouldn't need him to be some super powerful Dumbledore level child genius who can knock out 30 Death Eaters in a single fight. Just someone who can touch a door or step on a certain tile and be like "Yes, Hagrid comes in here to feed a cerebrus calleded Fluffy" or "Peter Pettigrew had a rat animagus form, and it looks awfully like Ron's rat".

It would be cool to see a Ravenclaw Harry who could unravel these mysteries easily, but he's a bit more delicate than canon Gryffindor Harry (maybe the psychometry is painful or disorienting in some way), and so is hesitant to actually tackle these adventures, or not well equipped to deal with them. He could have friends in each of the other 3 houses who teach him "lessons" on his journey of growth. Cunning from the Slytherins as he engineers a trap for Wormtail. Courage from the Gryffindors as he steels himself to go through the trap door. Loyalty from the Hufflepuffs as he protects the school from the Heir of Slytherin and his pet basilisk.

***** Barefoot is done in a way that it isn't meant to be taken seriously. It is really just a little humor fuc with some great banter between some old men and harry. You are right about it really taking the difficulty out of it.
