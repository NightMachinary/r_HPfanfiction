** Flamethrower's "Of A Linear Circle" series on ao3 is fantastic: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/11284494/chapters/25241499]]. It starts out with Snape (as a student) befriending a painting, and takes fun twists and turns including time travel. It features the founder's era, and is chock full of interesting discussions involving languages and history.

It is a long story (now on Part V) that is updated several times a month.

** I really enjoyed linkao3(left hook by elicitillicit), though it has not been updated in quite some time. It features Ginny accidentally time travelling to Tom Riddle's era and interacting with the students there including McGonagall, Abraxus Malfoy, and TR himself. The prose was really good.

Another good one was linkao3(text talk by merlywhirls) which is a nonmagical AU where Remus and Sirius become friends and develop romantic attraction to each other through accidental texting. It's really cute and highly addicting.

And everyone loves the linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) series!

  Ginny never took Ancient Runes, but she grew up with magic seething in her sinew and coiling in her gut, and so laughter, hard and hysterical, bubbles up in her chest when she sees a precisely cut crescent moon sitting inside a pictogram of a sun.The sun marks the hours of the day, but the moon marks the passage of weeks. Months. Years. There's still shouting behind her.Ginny doesn't hesitate.

  What if Voldemort had chosen the pureblood boy, not the halfblood, as his opponent? This Neville would have had graves to visit, instead of a hospital. He'd still have grown up in his grandmother's clutches, tut-tutted at, dropped out windows absentmindedly, left to bounce on paving stones.Let's tell this story: Alice Longbottom, who was the better at hexing, told Frank to take Neville and run.
