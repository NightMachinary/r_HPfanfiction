Help all the ficmongers! I look for some special fics very common in Russian Potter fandom but never seen (for me) in English one - fanfic writer/fanfic reader in the Potter-verse.

The plot is: Someone who alreday aware of the canon/fandom/cinon (may be I spelled wrong but it means movies, not books) or about all of it somehow (usually after the deadly accident - roadkill/lightning struk/ etc) awaken in one of the heroes of the saga, and it is time when something hits the fan.

I have read tons of it in Russian - it even has a special term - Popadanets (Get-in'er - the one who get in somebody) - but can't find any in English.

Can you name me the stories/authors with such plot?


** Those are commonly called "Self-Insertions", or "SI" for short. There are a couple, but I cannot name one off-hand.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/Harry-Potter-Self-Inserts/115644/99/0/1/0/0/0/0/][Here's a list of some examples]] - I haven't read them though.

*** Out of this list, I can say that linkffn(A Curse of Truth by butalearner) is pretty good.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.
