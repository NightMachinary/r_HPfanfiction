Hello everyone!

The Tales of Everest Scamander has just been updated.

Chapter Eight: The Vow. Everest starts her first day of classes and has an ominous conversation with her Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

For those who haven't read this story yet, let me tell you a little bit about it.

This story is about a young girl who was born into the Scamander family during the time of Harry Potter. Inheriting the legilimens ability, her Grandparents decided it was best to send her off to America to live with Queenie. As time passes the young Everest follows her natural path to attend Ilvermorny. Everest thrives there, but due to dark and terrifying circumstances she must transfer to Hogwarts. At her new school she must face her own darkness, along with the great danger that is to come.

Future pairings are DracoxOC and FredxOC

Let's go on an adventure together!
