** Commit to your new universe or world. There's nothing more boring than reading an AU fic where it's canon with a green paint job or whatever. It makes me irrationally angry when we get the same “oh no I am in a different world just like my own, better go along with how I did things the first time because I need to hide and my author just wanted to do canon but with a harem”.

***** To expand on this for [[/u/Geminise][u/Geminise]]:

The purpose of this exercise is to test how well your story's universe is built. If it all falls apart just because you had to change something in it then obviously something needs work. By doing that kind of thing occasionally you will lose some time but safeguard yourself at least somewhat from poor world-building.

** Motivation. What do people want? Is Harry is travelling reality then why? Is he trying to escape, is he chasing something or perhaps it wasn't his choice. Either way, what matters is the motivation because than tells you how they would behave. Nothing is more jarring than characters going against what they want for plot purposes. A new reality can be a fresh start or a second chance. In reality swapping tics we expect things to be different, understandably different but different. Make sure your character reflects on this to find if their motivations fit. Perhaps they came to help but aren't needed, perhaps the people they wanted to save are so different Harry no longer cares.

** I'm a really big fan of this type of fic. All I can say is try to avoid cliches that you've already seen in other ones. I know I failed at this, but try to be inventive and add stuff not normally seen. Good luck.

  I'm not sure about avoiding cliches.
#+end_quote

Well, avoid using cliches for the sake of using them. If you can construct the alternate universe so that the cliche absolutely makes sense and is justified in the context of its existence then using them is absolutely fine.

For example, you could have a world where wizards to actually have magical cores. It's something that's considered cliche as f...ractal, but if you can justify in a way that seems natural for the world that this world had changes that resulted in wizards forming magical cores and you use both the reason for those and those themselves as natural elements of your story that are not there for power-level--wank then that's absolutely a fine thing to do even if the thing itself is very cliche (heck, I can think of at least one good reason for such a thing off the top of my head, though no I will not share because creativity resonance [i.e. you work better with your own ideas]).

Heck, Harry becoming Lord Black and then Lord [insert whatever] is another cliche, and there are fics that played it like a fiddle. Just for two examples, there's “A Black Comedy”, where Harry and Sirius are both Lord Black and it's utterly nonsensical and you have to laugh at it, and “Inheritances” (by Luan Mao since that's probably a common title) where Harry inherits a bunch of titles that do nothing, outside of it being “likely to aid in ‘pulling the birds'” (in the words of a goblin), and has to deal with the resulting mess.

So, if you care about my personal opinion, then I think it's not as much about which cliches they are as it is about knowing what you want to do with your cliche and having an actual reason to add it to the story rather than (as it is wont to happen) adding as many of them as you can just because they sound good to you.

** My personal recommendation? Avoid the angsty "I can't tell anyone that I'm a dimensional traveler" or "I can't change the timeline" bits. They are boring and annoying; the whole point of going to a different universe is to change things, and most of the time authors don't come up with any particular good reason to not tell someone better equipped like, say, Dumbledore about important future events.

(As an example, in a fic I've been writing on and off for awhile now, Harry is immediately caught after his dimensional/time travel and announced to the wizarding world at large. He doesn't actually have much useful information due to events, but the Ministry claims they magicked him into silence anyway to protect him while they act on what little information he could give them.)
