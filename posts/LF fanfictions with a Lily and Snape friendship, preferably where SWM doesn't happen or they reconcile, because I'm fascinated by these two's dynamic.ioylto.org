** I feel the same, not sure what SWM stands for but I assume you mean the incident Harry learns of in the pensive?

I always assumed that I'd have to read a story that actually centers around the Marauders to read any Snape/Lily interactions and I honestly don't enjoy reading about them as a group.

Are you looking for their friendship to develop into romance or looking for a fic where Lily maintains a friendship with the poor man who will always pine after her in a romantic sense, perpetually keeping him friend-zoned while she begins a family with his arch nemesis?

Also during school or after Harry is already born? I'm just looking for some more parameters for what you're looking for.

*** Just to be clear (since OP never mentioned it) for the future: SWM is indeed short for Pensieve scene. It stands for "Snape's Worst Memory", the chapter name in ootp where the scene takes place.

*** Anything is welcome; after school, during school, when they're senile fifty year olds. Preferably no bashing, but I guess if it isn't central I don't mind, just something that builds into their little dynamics where it isn't just Lily who is Snape's therapist, his adorable wife, his truthful friend, the real genius behind the Half Blood Prince he was copying everything from, his archangel. You know, a real friendship like the one Harry and Ron have. Any recs?

I'm also fascinated by how a friendship or reconciliation between Snape and Sirius/James would look like...really hard to pull off but Snape's dry humor could complement Sirius's biting wit. I just feel if you tried to attack these two, you're toast, individually and together. If they weren't so hateful of the other they could've made a good team.

***** The (very rare) occasion where I see Lily-bash of the Ron kind (it's usually twisted into the kind you usually see with Hermione-bash with her being not outright evil, but just shortsighted to the point of being an ass to everyone around her), it's usually that she uses Snape to learn about magic as a child and then keeps him around later for his sheer skill -- helping her with school (in bad faith, such as writing her homework etc). She eventually ditches him in favour of marrying James for the money.

** Snily or platonic?

For platonic Severus&Lily: linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles; They Didn't Know We Were Seeds) (the latter has a brief romance but they dismiss it due to a lack of passion -- they were just going through the motions). I especially like the former because it's the only fic I've seen that shows Lily and Severus' friendship develop from the very beginning until its eventual destruction (it's canon compilant, showing Snape's life from his life as a toddler to his death by snake). I haven't seen any other fic do a close look into their pre-Hogwarts friendship.

For actual romance: linkffn(The Path Not Tread; The Peace Not Promised)

I personally recommend you read The Path Not Tread. It puts a major focus on their interaction over time and have them work out the issues they share over time. However, I personally don't like how long-winded the fic has a habit of being at times, with the psychoanalysis going a bit too far.

EDIT: If you want to see a proper natural reconcilation/forgiveness develop between Snape and the Marauders, I recommend The Peace Not Promised linked above. It's my personal favorite Snily fic, but more notably for your interests, has a natural transistion between a Snape that still detest the Marauders (with it first being mutual), and once they want to reconcile, slowly over time develop as a person to a point where he's willing to resolve the differences between them.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

  Sometimes all that's needed for enormous differences is a small change, as small as the order of a few sentences in a heated row. Lily Evans unconsciously makes one such change while arguing with her best friend, and the magnitude of consequences her actions cause holds the potential to reshape not only herself and the people around her, but their world's very future.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** I'm not sure what you want, the thing about SWM is, that it seems more like the last straw that broke the camel's back, and with the way Snape and Lily were going this break would probably have happen anyway, maybe just not with such a bang but slowly fated away, or maybe there would have been another moment where Lily couldn't ignore Snape's tendencies to the dark arts and the bigot terrorists he hung out with and was part of. So if you want them to stay friends it would mean that Snape's whole story would have to change or Lily's character as a moral person who stands and fights had to be sacrificed.

*** Which is why it's a fanfiction that veers off the canon railway. For them to reconcile Snape would need to change, and Lily needs to see it, they become friends again and other aspects of their character don't really have to be sacrificed in the process. And I'm in the very unpopular territory here but I do not think for a second that Lily was wholly innocent or didn't also partake in the deterioration of their friendship (like her sisterhood with Petunia), because while Snape takes the cake, Lily shouldn't be a saint. This triggered the request. Either that, or SWM never happened.

**** Oh I don't say she is a saint, but considering the path Snape was on, with throwing himself in with lot that that that time was actively killing muggleborns, her guilt is negligible in compression.

That is like saying both sides are somewhat guilty if one side dodged the fare and the other blew up the bus. Sure the first person maybe wouldn't have been off the bus to be killed...

And if the SWM didn't happen the friendship would have probably broken slowly over time, because Snape doesn't really seem like someone that changes his ways if not be forced to in a major way, it is just possible, that Lily and James didn't end up together in Hogwarts because of it, but those two both decided to join the Order right away and then had time to get to know each other...

​

I'm just really frustrated with the narration that it was just SWM that broke that friendship, it was a trigger, but not the real problem and so many people just handwave that away. That friendship was really toxic to Lily and this danger of toxic friendships if often ignored, never mind the threat Snape helps to create by supporting Voldemort's ideology, even on the smaller scall, that shows a kind of disrespect and psychological danger that shouldn't be waved aside. And yes, maybe the friendship was toxic to Snape too, it didn't seem healthy for him to me at least with the way he acts in the books... This is why I hate the Snily pair more than any other because those that ship it seem to ignore why it is not romantic or healthy

***** Oh, I'm aware of that but it's just one aspect of how Lily is interpreted that really annoys me; she's not a Madonna in robes, please, she's her own person and also not a carbon copy of Hermione either.

To be entirely clear I do not blame Lily for cutting off her ties with Snape as she had every right to. One thing I find entirely plausible, however, is that Lily for example would prefer to hang out with her girlfriends instead of Snape, and she would give him false reassurances of being 'best friends', that kind of teenage bullshit everybody has gone through. For example, he was sitting alone and they didn't exchange a word until James started bothering Snape in the memory, and after he called her a mudblood. Maybe Snape would tell Lily to go hang out in their free time or during a Hogsmeade weekend but she brushes him aside and you'd slowly find him slipping away towards Avery and Mulciber, little stuff like that isn't directly her fault but I feel being popular, she didn't really manage much of her friendships all that well, and that's why we don't see anybody close to her, and only James. Whereas the latter had a tight knit close friend group, Lily is more of a social butterfly with friends from every house, every year, from clubs, etc.

I feel like Snape needs a major wake-up call for him to change his ways, and by major, I mean bigger than Lily cutting off her friendship with him. The only thing with Snape I equate with Regulus Black is that they both need physical slaps (the cave, [insert fanfiction plot device for Snape] in the face rather than anything in the abstract, detached sense. albeit we cannot really judge Regulus that much, so I don't like comparing them because then I start projecting my own headcanons (which is 100% Reggie being a better person but I digress).

Do people really believe that SWM was a sudden thing? I too saw it as the straw that broke the camel's back, and it was more of a chain of events, and Snape directly gives Harry memories of that. Weird. Anyhow, that doesn't change the fact that if Snape caught on soon enough and became a better person before she died and came clean publicly, then I think they could reconcile. I like it as a platonic friendship, nothing more.
