:END:

** Hmm...I can't say I know it; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3689325/1/The-Original-Naked-Quidditch-Match][The Naked Quidditch Match]] comes to mind, but that's the players naked rather than the audience.\\
 \\
Do you remember the site it was on? Was it an adult-ish fic or was the naked-Slytherins a one-off piece of comedy? Is it one you read recently, or from years and years ago?\\
Actually, are there any specific phrases you remember?

I /think/ it was a lesser used one like harrypotterfanfiction.com or maybe ficwad, but that's just a guess. I worry it may have been on a defunct site

It was a smaller portion of a larger fic. I also remember it had canon pairings

**** I know that ive read it but it appears that i didnt bookmark. Ive only read ao3 and ffn fics for the last few years so its much more likely to be on one of those two sites. Additionally, a lot of defunct sites fics were moved over to ao3. Ill be doublechecking my fic read history and subs. Hopefully someone finds it.

** I think that would legally count as sexual harassment, imagine the parents lawsuits over their children having their clothes stolen in such a public place.

*** If the accidental magic was lightless, then they can't track it back to Ron, can they? Then he's safe, isn't he?

*** As opposed to the blatant discrimination and harassment Ron had to endure from one forth of the student population via the song. I'm not saying two wrongs make a right however, OP did state an accidental burst of magic from Ron and as a Wand was not involved, it can't be proven that Ron was the cause in the first place.

**** Indeed.

Additionally, to the best of my knowledge, in the case of a public incident with accidental magic in muggle world, the Obliviators are dispatched, but the child is not punished, and neither are the parents.

Even if it was blatantly obvious that Rn was the source, if he didn't use his want, if he didn't use a spell... Then apparently it was necessary that the Slytherins be naked. Nothing to be done. Praecantatio vult.
