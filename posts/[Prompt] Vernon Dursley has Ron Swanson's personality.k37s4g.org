A silly what-if brought about by watching clips of Ron Swanson on YouTube

[[https://youtu.be/Tch4v0L0GHA]]

/“Just give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Wait... I worry what you heard was, ‘Give me a lot of bacon and eggs.' What I said was, give me all the bacon and eggs you have. Do you understand?”/

So yeah, *what if Vernon Dursley had been blessed with Ron Swanson's personality?*


** Harry still grows up doing a ton of chores, but so does Dudley, and it's all just to build character and teach them useful skills.

Vernon still hates magic, but only because he finds it insulting how easy it makes everything.

Hagrid still has to deliver Harry's letter in the middle of nowhere, but it's because Vernon values his privacy and doesn't like how easily the owls can track him down. But once they get past the awkward misunderstanding and start talking, he and Hagrid discover a lot of common interests and become great friends. (Honestly, Ron Swanson as Hagrid would probably work even better than Ron Swanson as Vernon.)

When Vernon sees Harry's wand, he's appalled because it looks like an amateur's first whittling project. So he makes him a better wand that has ornate designs and is solid enough to whack someone in self defense. (Dudley's Smelting stick gets a similar treatment.) Somehow, this eventually leads to Vernon either providing woodworking services to Ollivander or becoming a wandmaker himself.

When he finds out about Harry's fortune, he convinces him to take it out of Gringotts and bury it in a variety of hidden places, just like he does with his gold.

He thinks that Quidditch is a silly game, but is still proud of Harry for making the team. (Though a Swanson-raised Harry is probably more likely to be a chaser or a beater than a seeker.)

When he meets Arthur Weasley, he is happy to explain in great detail how all sorts of muggle appliances work. This makes them best friends, at least in Arthur's mind.

He decides to forgive the magical world for all of its problems when he learns about fire whiskey. He regularly drinks far more of it than anyone else thinks is safe, especially for a muggle, but never suffers any I'll effects from it.

He applauds the Ministry of Magic for its general inefficiency and uselessness. At least until he learns that it's that way because of corruption and ineptitude and not because it's full of libertarian saboteurs who want the government to be as small as possible like him.

He is completely supportive of Harry's regular life-threatening adventures, because he raised him to defend himself properly. "You killed a giant snake? Excellent! Let's mount its skull in the living room."

Everything about Umbridge insults him personally. The only reason he doesn't march into Hogwarts and deal with her himself is because he taught Harry to deal with problems himself. (And because Harry's letters home are just the words "I am still alive" and a list of recent accomplishments.)

Alternatively, Leslie Knope as Umbridge could also make an interesting story.

** Ron Swanson!Vernon isn't abusive so Harry actually likes him. He'sstrict but only becauase it is character building.

Consequently Harry and Dudley are closer because they are treated the same.

Harty is a lot calmer in frightening situations as a result of Vernon's parenting.

All the purebloods at Hogwarts are convinced all muggles are like Vernon so they are a little more respectful of non magicals because he might be a muggle but Vernon faces everything head on and isnt scared of magic. Harry does nothing to enlighten them.

Hermionie is like Leslie Knope.

He joins the order of the phoenix since the government can't be trusted and this Voldemort is clearly bad news but he frequently derails meetings critiquing their strategy.

It also turns out shield charms don't work on shotguns despite having no magic he has brought down as many death eaters as Moody in a shorter time.

He becomes best friends with Mad eye Moody (the real one) because CONSTANT VIGILANCE.

He can drink more firewhiskey than Hagrid, no one is sure how he is still alive. He also likes Hagrid better than most wizards because he is an outdoorsman type.

Regularly calls Albus by the wrong name to bring him down a peg because he thinks Albus is too chummy. Also does this to Voldemort.

Somehow got into the Hogshead despite muggle repelling wards. He causes a lot of headaches for Dumbledore so Aberforth gives him free firewhiskey.

Somehow got into Hogwarts despite muggle repelling wards.

The twins ask him to teach them about gunpowder, he dies, he also teaches them about grenades and dynamite. Molly is annoyed but Arthur had been sat there for the whole of this tutorial enthusiastically taking notes.

Helps Arthur Weasley fix his flying car because he did an awful job on the mechanics.

Also helps Arthur rewrite laws on muggle artifacts to have as many loopholes as possible.

Goes to the quidditch world cup, he doesnt see the point of the game but it makes Harry happy, also camping. He does not like wizards idea of camping.

Parent teacher conferences.

Personal war against Harry's hair because everytime he shaves it into a buzzcut or crewcut it grows back the next morning.

He keeps shooting owls because he doesn't like they can find where he lives. Its an invasion of privacy.

His libertarian ideals of government non interference and everyone being able to do as they wish in their own home actually gain some traction with dark pureblood until they realize he's a muggle.

He is so proud of Harry's anti government army but annoyed he named it after a political figure.

He is a witness of the dementor attack and called as a witness at Harry's trial, he answers every question with a question.

I'd love to write this but I don't think I could do it justice. I'm not good at comedy.
