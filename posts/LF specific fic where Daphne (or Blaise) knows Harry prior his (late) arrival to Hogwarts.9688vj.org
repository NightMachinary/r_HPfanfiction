I'm looking for a fic where Daphne (and/or Blaise) knows Harry before he arrives to Hogwarts but I don't think he comes in his first year but only later (forced by circumstances?). I think he was good friend with Blaise and he may be betrothed to Daphne but I'm not sure either. I also seem to remember that they (DG and BZ) are surprised that each know Harry (maybe not under the same name though).

Anyone sees which fic it is?


** Linkffn(11237394) this might be it. Harry arrives to Hogwarts from America and he is friends with BZ. He also has to marry DG due to a contract.

  That fateful night at Godric's Hollow, Lily Potter survives. With the help of Sirius and Remus she decides to take Harry away from Dumbledore's manipulations and goes to America. Fifteen years later Harry returns to fulfil his destiny. With the help of his friends and family, the Boy Who Lived will fight a very different battle this time. Powerful Harry! Manipulative Dumbledore!

*** Hmm I don't think that's it. I'm almost certain that Blaise (or Theo but definitely a male Slytherin and not Draco) knew Harry before too (and maybe Harry saved him when they were younger). Also I seem to remember Harry going to the Greengrass when this betrothal thing came up (in a flashback?) and Daphne was quite upset at first.

I hope I don't mix 1 fics but I'm pretty sure I'm not.

Thanks anyway

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

***** Read it too and it isn't this one either unfortunately. Well maybe someone will find it and in the meantime I'll keep looking for it.

But I'm pretty sure of this Blaise early friendship. Blaise who also was friend with Daphne and when Harry arrives in the Express both are surprised that the other knows him.

Thank you. I'll keep you updated if I find it.
