** Biggest one: underage Hermione where it's not a time travel to where they're both teenagers. At absolute /minimum/ make her an adult, and not through 'time Turner in third year' shenanigans. Especially if it's for the marriage law trope. This ties in with the next one.

Second: trivialization of rape. Let's just not. I can totally buy it being something that death eaters did, but don't throw it around like it's NBD, or have a character fall in love with their rapist.

Third: Immediate redemption, or everything he was in canon suddenly being perfectly fine. Just because he was on the good side doesn't make him good. This especially goes for stories that say they're canon compliant up to x book.

*** Expanding on my comment, age disparity is fine. The way that 60% of sevmione fics have Hermione just excuse intolerable behavior on his part because of Severus having a troubled past that disturbs me.

Often in these fics Hermione quickly abandons her support network because they don't approve of her relationship, or intense jealousy from Severus if she talks to other guys, it is really frustrating for me to read.

It is worse when these fics portray their isolation with each other as romantic, act like it's sweet for your partner to need to know where you're at at any given time, and spread the message that you are responsible for your partner's insecurities and jealousy. I can never tell if it is written that way intentionally or if the authors genuinely believe that that kind of treatment is acceptable.

- Alan Rickman Snape.

- Snape described as hot. No, he's ugly and scrawny. That's canon.

- Snape's abusive teaching methods and past history shoved in the closet because he's a love interest now.

- Hermione is secretly a pureblood or halfblood. It devalues the message of the story.

*** To be fair, his teaching methods were pretty rough, but I don't think they were outright abusive. I mean, he generally prevented explosions, whereas a truly cruel, abusive person would have let them be and had them ‘learn the hard way'. That's not to say he wasn't a total ass, but I think his teaching methods were relatively effective, but the bad parts blown out of proportion (kids tend to do that) and part of his strictness was kind of necessary for the volatile environment he was trying to teach in. Definitely still an asshole, but probably a bit exaggerated by me Potter.

********** Not really. If he were truly Voldemort's spy, why would he openly act so biased? It isn't helping him gain credibility with the Muggleborns or with the Order. It's not helping him blend in as "just another professor". Dumbledore tolerated his behaviour, but it wasn't necessary imho. He chose to act that way, either as a way to vent his frustrations from his terrible lot in life or because he sincerely believed in what he was saying and doing when interacting with his students.

As Snape showed when interacting with other Death Eaters who were sceptical of him, he didn't care about their opinions. Voldemort believed that he was a triple agent who was truly loyal to him. Nothing about this situation suggests that he had to act like an utter bastard towards Gryffindors and Harry's friends in particular. Acting like Slughorn would be a far better facade if he were truly Voldemort's spy imho.

*********** Because he was a terrible human being? He was also more useful as a spy if he was closer to Death Eater children. In that context his behaviour is understandable. Don't get me wrong, Snape was horrible. He started as a stereotypical evil teacher in the first 3 books, but he ended as a pathetic being who never got over his crush. Which is really pathetic if you think about it. Also he spat on everything his crush believed and died for, just because he truly hated the man she married. There's no rhyme or reason to his behaviour apart from being a colossal dick.

​

Him behaving more like Slughorn would have made him even more suspicious to the Death Eaters, but not from Voldemort apparently, who believed everything Snape said... again for plot reasons, not for real reasons.

**** Snape's Occlumency teaching methods started out rough and went to abusive. But it depends on whether you count them as "teaching", since it was extracurricular and not regular old Potions. Unlike the movie Snape, book Snape in this scene yells, grabs Harry, and physically pushes him down to the floor.

#+begin_quote
  "So," said Snape, gripping Harry's arm so tightly Harry's hand was starting to feel numb. "So ... been enjoying yourself, Potter?"

  "N-no," said Harry, trying to free his arm. It was scary: Snape's lips were shaking, his face was white, his teeth were bared.

  "Amusing man, your father, wasn't he?" said Snape, shaking Harry so hard his glasses slipped down his nose.

  "I---didn't---"

  Snape threw Harry from him with all his might. Harry fell hard on to the dungeon floor.

  "You will not tell anybody what you saw!" Snape bellowed.

  "No," said Harry, getting to his feet as far from Snape as he could. "No, of course I w---"

  "Get out, get out, I don't want to see you in this office ever again!"

  And as Harry hurtled towards the door, a jar of dead cockroaches exploded over his head.

How do you say that they started out rough? I mean, fanon likes to call it "mind-rape" which is a ludicrous term by itself, but there's nothing that says that Snape's method isn't a good method.

As far as Occlumency is concerned, Harry's effort into learning the art is absolutely woeful. He makes almost no attempt at doing the mental exercises Snape gives him and instead tries to have more visions so that he can figure out what Voldemort is doing. It's basically canon Harry's Indy-Harry phase.

***** I wasn't counting the Occlumency lessons. They're extracurricular, and put two people who hate each other in a room, unsupervised. Harry and Snape never got along and putting them in that situation, where either one can so easily invade the other's privacy was REALLY not a good idea. I blame whoever came up with that bright idea for what ended up happening (Dumbledore.) I don't really see that situation as a good measure of Snape's teaching competency because that was not a situation that could be controlled like in a classroom and he and Harry already had a history of hating each other's guts. It was a situation bound to go wrong.

****** But who is the adult and who is the child? Snape's supposedly risking his life for Harry, yet can't unwind himself to just act decently for a few hours every week during one of the most critical periods in the book? Small changes in OoTP could have changed so much in the outcome of the war imho.

It's always Snape antagonizing and attacking Harry first, never the reverse. While it makes his character compelling and complex, it's very much a failing on Snape's part and not on Harry' imho. Especially considering the difference in age, maturity and authority.

******* Harry was more mature as an 11 year old than Snape was at 31. Come on, the man was so bad that even when teaching Occlumency to the one person who can win this war, and what a useful skill it would be, he couldn't get over his childhood traumas and complexes. His behaviour makes no sense. Teaching Harry Occlumency would very much help the "right" side, but he couldn't help belittle him, even though he knew that Harry reacts negatively to opposition and would benefit more from a mentor like type of teaching. It's amazing to what extent people will go to exempt Snape from any culpability.

​

It's actually one of the points of Stronger than Hope. Probably my most favourite, and in my opinion the best, Harry is mentored by Snape story ever. Snape is as he always is, caustic, evil, petty, insulting. The way the dynamic works in that story is that Harry has a personality transplant due to losing Sirius and blaming himself. That's why he adapts to Snape's teaching methods. Canon Harry would never do that. He's too independent (apart from when Dumbledore tells him something... which is again something I dislike, but that's another discussion).

***** To be fair, Harry knew he shouldn't look into the Pensieve, and decided to do so anyway. There's a reason that sequence was called Snape's Worst Memory because it included his humiliation at the hands of James and Sirius (and Remus and Peter, to an extent), and the loss of his friendship with Lily. It's even worse than reading someone's diary. Also, given that this is the only canon example of learning Occlumency, we have no idea whether or not this is the only method, the fastest method, etc. That's not to say that Snape was nice about anything, but we don't know from which basis he was teaching.

Also, in canon, Harry makes very minimal efforts to do the exercises Snape gave him, and he also hated Snape with a passion. While Snape is the adult, and Harry is the child, neither made any steps to improve the situation, and at fifteen, Harry was old enough to understand the importance of what was happening.

** I used to ship it hard in my teen years, but it was more like... theoretical ship, because I ended up disliking most fics I actually read and never found what I was looking for then, because there were just too many tropes I hated.

- I like Hermione because she is a strong, opinionated, driven person, self-righteous and a bit ruthless, and I want this characterization in the fics I'm reading instead of that of generic romantic heroine or thinly veiled author's stand-in. I also don't see her taking shit from Snape or going along with frankly abusive relationship that's often portrayed as "real love" in SS/HG fics.
- Excusing Snape's bulshit behaviour. He is a shitty teacher not because of his position of a spy. He is just a shitty teacher. His (tragic) past may be a reason for his present jerkiness, but it doesn't justify it.
- Snape as obviously Alan Rickman. Even beside my general dislike for that casting, the age gap becomes twice as big, and I can't ship that. For some reason, SS/HG in particular seem to have a lot of it (all those cringy manips, ugh).
- Hermione working with potions. It's often coupled with her losing friendship with Harry and Ron, and results in her whole life revolving around her love interest. Not to mention Potions is not her best subject and she will not be as good at it as Snape. I want Hermione to be her own person.
- All those Marriage Law and other forced bonding fics. Just... no.

That's probably why, while there's a couple of fics that I really like, I lost interest in this ship long ago.

** all of it? throw the whole fandom away. alan rickman was the worst thing to happen to snape.

a lot of it is just alan rickman lust. older man/younger woman. teacher/student fetish. having the attraction form/romanticising that attraction while she's underage is skeevy. the relationship existing /at all/ when he knew her since she was 11 is skeevy

i don't think it's impossible to 'ship them, but it has to be in AUs where he was never her professor, or never knew her since she was a child, etc. also, unpopular/dark sided opinion: i can more easily see hermione being attracted to snape than snape to hermione

i think the majority of the snape fandom is more or less irredeemable at this point. with the popularity of snape hate, the fandom is torn between people willing to engage with snape and write him as a complex, nuanced character, and people that aren't. except the people that do are locked into the same boring, toxic tropes that were there since 2008
