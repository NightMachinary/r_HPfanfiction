I was reminded of the "Harry Potter is a great example of neoliberal ideology" 4chan post yesterday (for those who haven't seen: [[https://i.imgur.com/d1U9ya5.jpg][i.imgur.com/d1U9ya5.jpg]]; it's not perfect but imo it makes an interesting point) and it made me wonder if there's been any fanfic that addresses this well and really gives Harry (or other MC(s)) a desire to actually improve the world and wizarding society, because I couldn't think of any off the top of my head. The vibe I'm going for is "Harry and the gang proceed to reform the wizarding world, but the work isn't easy and the solutions aren't always obvious".

I did try searching the sub before posting and I found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6a5x9f/lf_fanfics_with_explicit_socialistanarchist_themes/][one post]] with two fics recommended: /Divided and Entwined/ and /The Sum of Their Parts/. ( linkffn(11910994, 11858167) ). I haven't read /Divided and Entwined/, so I'll check it out; /Sum of Their Parts/ is definitely close but IIRC it's very neat? Like there's obvious right answers and the only thing standing in the way of progress are the curmudgeons.


** Well, reforming the country is a theme in many of my stories. You might like "Democracy".

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** That 4chan post has some serious flaws, but I won't get into that here.

I have a self-recommendation. True, this hasn't been updated in a while, but I really am still working on it. Reshaping culture so that people clamor for political reform is hard work. Flashy duels are a lot easier than the societal change that 4chan person is asking for.

  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?

** Linkao3(Swung by Serafim by Flamethrower) leans closest to this. The second half of the fic is just "Jesus, this sucks let's fix it". Though I don't know if it's what your looking for....

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

** No comment on the 4ch post because it's a mix of good and bad points and I don't want to get bogged down. But I'm curious... what are the most important things you feel needs to be changed about the HP world?

Many canon-compliant post-DH fics deal with Hermione's elf crusade and Harry's Auror reform, so that's two. What else are you interested in seeing?

*** 1. Well, those two things would be a great start, and if you have recommendations there I'd love to hear them. (IME fanfic is really had to search for, even with relatively broad requirements; that's why I made a request thread.)
2. Some other things that come to mind as possibilities (not necessarily an exhaustive list obviously): rights of other magical creatures; political reform (how did Fudge + Umbridge get into power, why was Harry's stupid underage magic trial held before the entire legislative body); embrace of muggle technologies and/or research methodologies; addressing blood purity discrimination that's not terrorism but still messes with people's lives; Hogwarts' bullying culture.

** it's either "Liberal freedom for all sentient magical things" vs "Conservative magic is sentient pureblood worship" in this fandom....

But the fact is there's no correct side

#+begin_quote
  if new blood isn't accepted into the pureblood faction then inbreeding will wipe them out(unless fanon magic counters genetic diseases)

  If the discrimination against muggleborns are continued its only a matter of time before this prejudiced stereotyping will result in a self fulfilling prophecy - they will create their own enclaves .....it already happened with were wolves and vampires .
#+end_quote

#+begin_example
                                           VS 
#+end_example

If you give full rights to every sentient magical beings what could possibly go wrong?

How many times goblins attacked the magicals? despite multiple attempts of an alliance from human side?

Can the genius hermione guarantee that house elves if given freedom wouldn't want revenge ?

that things like werewolves & vampires wouldn't even accidentally hurt children?
