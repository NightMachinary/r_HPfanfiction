Looking for romance or fics with pairings that either have heart wrenching scenes, bittersweet endings, just downright sad endings, or some kind of sad element.

Some of my preferred pairings are - Sirius Black/Hermione (time travel) - Sirius Black/OC - James Potter/OC - Tom Riddle/Hermione (time travel) - Draco/Hermione - Lily/James

But I'm open to other pairings! I just want some good quality writing that I can get emotionally invested in!


** Harry's Heavy Heart by Peter Tool is definitely one to read if you like sad romance. It's for people who Harry/Hermione but they don't end up together.

** (Self promotion alert) This is Post-Azkaban Sirius/OC and I think it fits the description. Hope you'll give it a chance :)

  A man does not go into Azkaban and get out unscathed. Sirius Black might be physically safe in Grimmauld Place but he forgets, he teeters on the edge of something dangerous. Still, he holds on with clawing hands.And a woman does not lose everything and comes out with an easy smile. (Canon Divergence after Goblet of Fire)
