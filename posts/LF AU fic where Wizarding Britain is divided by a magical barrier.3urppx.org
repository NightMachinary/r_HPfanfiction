The war against Voldemort reaches a stalemate and, as outlined in the title, wizards are divided into two communities (one Dark, one "Light") by a magical barrier. Dark wizards can't penetrate the barrier, which mostly restricts access to Hogwarts.


** Never knew I wanted to read a Harry Potter Berlin wall fic until Ihateseatbelts posted this. Google only yields random references to the Wall in Berlin fics and America AUs. Looks like you may have to write this yourself... please? :-)

*** Lol, probably not. Even if I felt capable of pulling something like this off, I'm behind schedule with everything as it is! :(

** Is this the one where the people in Hogwarts start to starve because there aren't any light wizards outside the barrier to send food in?

You know... I think that this is it! Thanks! :)

*** This was my thought as well. Both the Death Eaters and the Order/Hogwarts get sectioned off from the rest of Britian.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

*** It's Harry-centric, from what I remember. Quite a bit of Dumbledore, as he was the one to construct the barrier in the first place. Any relationships went over my head, unfortunately lol!

**** Sorry, I got nothing! I know there's a fic that's pretty popular here with a magical barrier. But it's HG focused and I think it was SS/HG. And I think the barrier separated magic from muggles. Hermione grows up in an orphanage. I think Gellert mentors her a bit. So, uh, not at all alike, I suppose
