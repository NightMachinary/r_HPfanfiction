It's a wonder wizards haven't destroyed the earth yet.

Looking for an action-y fic where fighting with magic takes effort. Duellers have to strategize, not rattle off "Stupefy" or "Avada Kedavra" as fast as they can.

Preferably gen, but I don't mind romance. No bashing. No fem Harry.

Thank you!!
