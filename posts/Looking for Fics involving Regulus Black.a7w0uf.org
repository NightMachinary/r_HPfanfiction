I haven't found a recent thread on this so I thought I'd make one!

Looking for recommendations of new or updating fics involving Regulus Black in some significant capacity i.e. Primary character or secondary character where his story is thoroughly explored, not just a passing mention.

Or, completed multi-chapter fics as above!

I've read Nautical Paramour's completed fic Oblivian that was Hr/RAB and enjoyed it, same with The Soul Crossing by KitMay, and enjoyed Ready for The Storm by Calebski (incomplete). Doesn't have to be paired - just exploration of the character and well written.

Thank you!


** I guess /Blackpool/ by The Divine Comedian is exactly what you are looking for. It's a completed multi-chapter fic which focuses on Regulus and the Black family.

I personally loved it, and it gets recommended here quite frequently.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** Are you okay with AU? Another reader recently recommended the Black Sheep Dog series by Izzythehut on Ao3 to me and it's very well written and her characters are fantastic. It's a "Regulus Lives" AU that focuses on the Black family, but Sirius and Orion are probably front and center here (at least more heavily featured than Regulus). Fair warning, though: If you want strictly Regulus, you may find Sirius's constant battling with his parents to be a bit off-putting.

Link for the first part of the series: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14800721/chapters/34243049]]

** One of my favorites that has updated recently is linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin). I haven't reread it recently, and I'm not certain how often it is updated (I don't remember when the update before this month was), but I do remember thoroughly enjoying it.

As far as I remember, it's a Wrong BWL story where Harry is sorted into Slytherin. I don't think Regulus becomes a thing until the second year, but he plays a significant role afterwards and his character is quite fleshed out. If you haven't read it, I don't want to spoil it.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
