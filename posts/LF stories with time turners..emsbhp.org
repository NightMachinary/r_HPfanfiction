NOT "hero travels back ten years and does everything again"

NOT "time travel to another era"

Time turner: Small magic device attached to a necklace. Takes you back a few hours so you can take more classes. Allows you to make things happen that could have already happened before you traveled back.

Not a pocket DeLorean. Not capable of creating a whole new alternative timeline where you can change things however you want. Not capable of creating universe breaking paradoxes. Not capable of erasing and rewriting years of history.

Safe enough for a teenager to use.

Any fanfics with an actual time turner as described in Prisoner of Azkaban and not as in the crazy world breaking plot hole machine from Cursed Child or other tropy fanon?


** Harry, Hermione and Luna extensively use time turners in *Faery Heroes* to ransack Death Eater mansions while having an alibi, and also for some pranking. Their initial time travel is /not/ done by time turners, but by the power of Lilith, queen of the Fae.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny

It's a casino heist oneshot inspired by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/e02l50/comment/f8d2vcj][some of the more zany fan speculation]] that took place during the 'Final Exam'. It has the same style of time turner schenanigans as in HPMOR.

** I'm surprised no one's mentioned linkffn(Forging the Sword). It has Hermione tell Harry and Ron about the time turner as soon as she gets it, and three of them use it to spend extra time studying and training. Fair warning, though, the fic is abandoned and doesn't really have much of a plot.

** [[http://www.hpmor.com][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] has extensive use of exactly this sort of time-turner, and then they put even more limitations on it because Harry's on a power trip. People keep downvoting this fic because this Harry's an insufferable know-it-all, but I think it's fun.

** Well, the first one which comes to mind is the fic which must not be named.

A good fic with time turners, though? linkffn(Harry Potter and the Children of Change) has both forms of time travel. At first, Harry is sent back in time to an alternate universe. At one point prior to his first year, he sneaks into the DOM and steals a time turner which he abuses to no end, such as using it in tandem with his metamorph abilities to pretend to be his own bodyguard.

** This might be turning into a What's that fic? but I distinctly remember a great story in which Harry, when given a Time Turner, instantly decides to make a weird treasure hunt thing for himself that will result in him getting the time-turner, giving his past self clues and so on. Or maybe it's the universe that decided on the hunt, since from Harry's point of view the hunt came first and the time turner second... well, I would need to read that fic again, except I have no idea what its name is. If anyone knows, feel free to inform me and OP both xD

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820][Blood Crest]] all of the teachers have time turners as worldbuilding to explain the bizarre Hogwarts class schedules. There's some fridge horror when we realize what Quirrell could be getting up to with one, and Harry stumbles his way into schenanigans as well.

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. When Harry must face the Dark Lord once more, it is without the aid of magic beyond his ken; only his wits can save him from his fate.Cross-posted from FFnet.
