60k or longer, WIP or completed, well written. Harry and Draco are both in the same House. Sirius is Harry's guardian. Doesn't have to have that, but if there are fics like that then suggest them


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16631777/chapters/38990651]]

Here is one that I have been reading. It takes a slightly different twist of canon, and is something of a creature-Draco fic. But so far? It's fairly decent, seems to update regularly.

Best praise I can offer it, is that I want to know what happens next.

Same with "A Brother to Basilisks"

** I don't read any hogwarts years fics but I have a few post-war/post-hogwarts fics I can recommend, you might have already read them as their fairly well-known Drarrys but just in case

The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/661862][Tales from the Special Branch series]] - Femme is an excellent writer and I recommend anything they've written

The Man Who Lived by sebastianL linkao3(9167785) - fair warning it is present tense, first person POV, and all OCs except Harry and Draco but it really is a great Draco character study

​

Well I started this post thinking I had more obscure fics but after searching through my bookmarks apparently I don't, if you haven't read these, great, if not, sorry :P

  Draco breaks a cup, and one thing leads to another. A story of redemption, tattoos, dreams, mistakes, green eyes, long conversations, and copious amounts of coffee. Set in New York twelve years after the war.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.
