Wether he stays muggle, went to Hogwarts for a short while, or just went to a different school altogether what are some stories that explore that?


** Well, he did eventually get dragged along, but didn't really attend in any /normal/ sense, in linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them).

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): James and Lily were more paranoid here and didn't trust the Fidelius Charm completely. They laid another nasty trap for Voldemort and got him good. They fled Britain altogether after that night, and Harry never went to Hogwarts. Not your average HP fanfiction.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877): Lucius Malfoy showed more bravery and cunning after Voldemort's defeat in 1981. Dumbledore was forced to flee for France with his remaining followers, but they would have their revenge 18 years later. Harry was raised by Sirius and went to Beauxbaton along with Neville and the Weasleys.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10937871/1/Blindness][Blindness]], linkffn(10937871): Harry was blind and couldn't go to Hogwarts, but he had other, great, powers!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11922116/1/Gothic][Gothic]], linkffn(11922116): This is a postwar adventure fic. But the background story is that Harry was raised by Sirius and never went to Hogwarts.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

Still a good story, but it punches a couple of my buttons.

I have the same problem with linkffn(It's My Life by Fyreheart). I find the connection to "Harry Potter" to be marginal.

A couple that I like are linkffn(Harry Potter and the Irish Choice) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marcello School).

**** I think it is scratching at an itch that most authors are too afraid to scratch: exploring within a larger framework. It is easy to re-write characters, but what is truly challenging is creating your own and then giving them rules to play by that you did not make. Thats what I loved about ASCAL.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

** Ill try and remember to post a link when i get home ( i can't even look for it. my work's managed to sort of block ff.net), but there's one where Petunia outright forbids him to go, and apparenty that was good enough to keep him out. He went to Stonewall, and got a job at a garage. Has a flair for art.\\
Huh. I've read it at least twice and I all of a sudden can't remember how Harry got exposed to magic the second time around.
