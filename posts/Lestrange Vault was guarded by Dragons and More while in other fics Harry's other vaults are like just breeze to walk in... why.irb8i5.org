** Because they have to /pay/ for the higher security, IMO. What we know of Gringotts' security measures is: Some vaults (like Harry's and the Weasley family's) have a key. Some (like 713) require a goblin employed by the bank to stroke a finger down the door. And access to some (like the Lestrange vault) requires passing through a Thief's Downfall, then getting past the trained dragon, and then the goblin has to put his whole hand on the door. And /none/ of the vaults can be accessed without using one of the carts, which can only by operated by Gringotts-employed goblins.

The point is that most witches and wizards are happy with the minimum level (Key) because as far as they're concerned, /that's enough./ No-one can get to a vault, even their own, unless a Gringotts goblin takes them - implying the bank is warded against Apparition - and the fact that a *physical key* or the touch of a goblin is needed implies that magic can't unlock the doors.

Gringotts offers higher security - like the dragon - but only those who are a)crazy paranoid over the safety of something in their vault, and b)rich enough to afford it, actually have it.

**** Most likely method: Quirrell walks into Gringotts, asks to make a withdrawal, then (under Voldemort's instruction) casts Imperius Curse on his goblin escort. Imperiused goblin takes him to vault 713 - where the Stone was.

**** u/Nyanmaru_San:
#+begin_quote
  was able to bypass all these protections
#+end_quote

My theory on this was that the vault was empty, so the protections were disabled.

Why maintain protections like that on a place that is empty?

***** The traps were either a mere distraction, or a way to test Harry (and whoever would come with him).

The real trap was the mirror of Erised, since it was spelled to free the stone only for someone who doesn't want to use it.

But it means Dumbledore bet on the fact Voldemort would be the one to come and get the stone. If Quirrell wasn't possessed, then things could have took a nasty turn...

******* We don't even know if Wizards have ways to do that.

I mean, in some fics,(heck, even my own) they do, and I remember one they use a kind of pentagram and a lot of other symbols to do it, and then Nicolas Flamel shows up and traps the wraith in the mirror.

But canonically it could be they just don't know magic to do that.

** Harry stared blankly at the large, draconic head that was nuzzling his chest with its snout. "I have a pet hydra."

"It's more like your family's vault guardian, but yes." Harry looked at Griphook, eyes still blank. A second head had snaked its way around Harry's back and was eyeing the goblin curiously. Griphook swallowed. "Your great-grandfather was eccentric."

A third head, this one looking more weathered and having a pitted scar over an eye with a white, slitted pupil, stared down at the pair just as blankly as Harry was at Griphook. A long, serpentine tongue slithered its way through forearm sized teeth in a mouth capable of swallowing them both whole.

Harry began to giggle. "This is so cool! Luna's going to be so jealous!"

Griphook, taking a step backwards, shook his head as Harry began to fawn over two of the three heads, ignoring the dripping venom creating yet more pits on the vault's floor. "Potters. Crazy, the whole lot of them."

** Are you asking about Canon or Fanon? Because there are a lot of differences between the 2.

In Canon, the Lestranges are richer than the Potter, and have been an "important" family for more times. Their vault is one of the deepest one of Gringott and is more secure than the "normal" one. This is basically a VIP service. While Harry simply don't qualify for it.

As for Fanon . . . well it just depends of the Author really. Some authors give Harry the same Vault than in Canon while other gives him several others and make him the richest man in Britain (if not the World).\\
If the question is "/Why are some authors making Harry rich without giving him a special Vault?/", the most likely answer is that the authors forgot about it (though you would need to ask each and everyone of them to be sure). The "rich Harry" trope is one that you see with young/ novice authors more often than not after all. But even there, there are some fics that do give Harry a special Vault, I remember one where he had something like the Vault N°4, which was even better protected than the Lestrange one.

​

PS: Since I saw some people mention it in the replies, I'm taking advantage of my answer to say that "The Thief's Downfall" is not a normal security measure to reach the Lestrange Vault.

In Canon, Griphook say these lines : ‘ /The Thief's Downfall. It washes away all enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Gringotts, they have set off defences against us!/'\\
The Thief's Downfall is an active security measure that is only raised when the Goblins think that the person trying to enter into a Vault is an impostor. Someone like the true Bellatrix probably never saw it in her life (which is kinda obvious because I doubt she would like to be drenched and thrown out of her cart every time she want to get some money).

** Places like Hogwarts or the DoM have shifting locations. Whose to say the vaults don't move? It's a security feature: you can't break into someone's vault unless you can find it, and Gringotts has the ability to force vaults into security bands. Harry's vaults are up at the top because James and Lily didn't see much of a point in paying for high security on a bit of money (they might have another higher-security vault for family heirlooms).

The Lestranges were storing an incredibly important artifact during a war, so they ramped their security to the max. Hell, in true banking greed, there are only ten of the truly high-security vaults (since there isn't much space near a subdued dragon). The holders are the ten people paying the most for those vaults. If someone wants a spot, they have to pay more than number ten.

While I'm on the subject, , why do they always take the carts down for basic deposits and withdrawals? Is the "one speed only" specifically for the obnoxious people who keep their entire savings in their safe deposit box? Meanwhile the muggleborns are laughing all the way to the bank because Gringotts' actual bank accounts provides a fairly decent interest rate.

** Price I assume. Open a regular account with them and you get a standardized vault and key, but pay and you can get a bigger vault and extra security.

** Easy answer is they knew Harry was hunting horcruxes and paid to have their security increased to the maximum. Maybe Voldemort sensed their destruction and told them. The poorer security on the other vaults could just be the most cost effective ones, or because the characters own the vaults so the protections are deactivated.

**** Maybe the author's don't care? In most fics the vaults just seem like a way to store money, or get rare or useful items from your ancestors. A few fics had Harry get his mother's school books that way, which gives him a headstart on becoming a runes master.

The security is just in the background so most authors don't mention it.
