*Requirements*

- As usual, I'm not partial to length. As long as is necessary
- Dobby appearing when he realizes Malfoy is hurt.
- Dobby being freed, somehow

*Bonus*

- Malfoy getting in trouble because his elf interfered with the match
- Flint trying to score when nobody else is paying attention

How would this work? Lucius would be more likely to kill his elf for breaking his only son's arm (or whatever). Not sure how clothes can feature into that.

**** Would pay (a small sum - not a rich guy!) to see this acted out (and animated, you after all need a CGI-Dobby or some motion capture stuff like with Gollum in Lord of the Rings!) :)
