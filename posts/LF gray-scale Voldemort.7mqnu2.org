I'm looking for stories where the Voldemort isn't totally evil. More like gray-scale.

He still want's to kill Dumble, still want's to take over but isn't monologing, slobbering, murder-happy moron.

Good example would be Riddle from [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7118223][Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer

Be noticed though, while I want not totally evil Voldie, I don't want Dumble or Harry to be evil. They can still be scheming and emotionally unstable, respectively, but not "I expect you to die Mr.Bond".


** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) This AU has a very good grey Voldemort. He is a lot more sane, reasonable, cunning and a great leader although still a dangerous psychopath at times. Harry is good (despite the fact that he is mentored by him somewhat, their relationship is very complicated), and Dumbledore is an antagonist even though he is canon in personality and "good".

linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental Horcrux) Voldemorts horcrux that awakens in Harry's head is very well portrayed and not at all just evil. He is cunning, manipulative, not a good person at all but still brilliant and helps out Harry quite a bit. I wouldn't call Harry evil, but he does end up influenced by Tom a lot and is more dark and morally and emotionally messed up than in canon.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** linkffn(Honey by Mark Geoffry Norrish) reminds me very much of the Voldemort from linkffn(Elsewhere but not Elsewhen), both in how he converses with Harry as well as his general likeability.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.
