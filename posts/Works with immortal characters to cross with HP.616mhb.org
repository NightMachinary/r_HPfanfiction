I'm working on a series where a terribly bored true immortal (never die, never grow old) Harry Potter travels to different dimensions with immortals such as Death Note (Shinigami), Supernatural (Angels and demons) and Percy Jackson (the gods), completely destroying the plot in the process. What are some other works you'd like to see Harry interact with? I'm running low on ideas

Edit: I should clarify that when I said works with immortals, I meant ones where they can be killed but don't die of old age/sickness/whatever. Even if there is only one way to kill them, and that way involves some conveluded prophecy or rare object not seen in centuries, it counts


** Highlander!

** Well, I'm pretty sure Ash Ketchum from Pokemon is never going to die of old age at the rate they are going, so he could count as an immortal.

It's not a serious suggestion, though. The serious ones I have are the entirety of Tolkien's created world (the Valar are basically gods and the Maiar are kind of immortal-ish), Castlevania (Dracula and Death could both count as immortals, and the world of that series has its unique kind of magic), and Sacrifice (an RTS released in 2000; it has a cast of five gods who are basically ageless).

*** Ah, I'm sorry, I haven't published any part of it yet. I've not actually finished any one part, sorry. I spread myself out and don't just work on one chapter then the next and so on.

Elves and dragon riders from Inheritance Cycle,

** Maybe Eru Il√∫vitar from lotr, but he's straight up god in that universe.

Aslan and the Emporer Across The Sea (Jesus and the Christian God) from The Chronicles of Narnia.

Q from Star Trek. Though (spoiler) they can become mortal if they want. Maybe in Star Trek there's The Great Bird of The Galaxy, but that's really just a joke.

So many things people say aren't really immortal, unless you mean like Biologically immortal where you just don't die of old age like Elves in lotr. Your examples, angels and deamons, and greek gods. They all die left and right. The only way you're going to get a truly immortal character is if they are ommipotent and the god of their universe, and there is nothing outside the universe in their story.

*** Ah yeah, I suppose I should clarify. When I said immortal I did mean can't die of old age but of other things

** Highlander, babies are found around the world and are raised like normal people until they die, whether it was a accident or not. They then rise from their grave becoming immortals never aging a day, never getting sick. The only way to actually kill a Immortal is to remove their head from their shoulders. Doing so released their essence which then enters either the one who removed their head or the closest Immortal this process is also known as the Quickening, it gives the victims memories to the victor. So knowing this most Immortals walk around with some type of bladed weapon to defend themselves and to play the game (some use blunted weapons like maces and crush or otherwise destroy the enemy skull which also works) why take the Quickening of other immortals? Well there is a prophecy that there can only be one immortal, one that will win the prize. What is the prize, no one knows.

** Some lovecraftian gods would be really cool, if you don't know what they are, think multi-dimensional power houses. There is nearly nothing stronger then them in fiction.
