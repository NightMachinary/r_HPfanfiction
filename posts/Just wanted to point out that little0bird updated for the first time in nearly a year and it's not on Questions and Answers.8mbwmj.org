I was just looking through profiles to recommend fics, and I saw that little0bird just uploaded a new Sirius fic. Now don't get me wrong, the writing's great as usual, but I can't help but feel like a methhead that just discovered the new batch is just rock sugar.

I get that authors should have the right to write what they want, at their own pace. But I'll be damned if I don't want her to say something, maybe telling those of us that check her profile almost daily to see if she updated (as of 2:03 am UTC +8, just me as far as I know) that she's working on it, or have decided not to finish it, or something.

Excuse me for rambling. I am very sleep deprived.

Linkffn(Questions and Answers) for the curious.


** Well, I've found you often reach a block on a story, so it might not be Q&A or a new story, but rather a new story or nothing.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.
