I am looking for stories where, after finding out he is a horcrux after watching the memories of Snape, instead of going to his death, Harry Potter refuses to die.


** The only issue with this is you'd need to change most of the Canon to make this happen, as Harry isn't the sort of guy who'd decide "Nah rather live", if you kept it the same and just did that, you'd make him OOC and OOC characters usually suck.

*** Not really. It could be that Harry doesn't believe the memories were truthful. Or perhaps he decided to find another way to remove it because he realizes that the prophecy states Voldemort can only die by his hand.

** I've seen one that uses this as a premise for a slash time travel story, if you're interested?
