** I don't think that would work. From what I make of it, his blood protection was against Voldemort (and his marked followers). It didn't work when Umbridge sent the Dementors after him, and wouldn't have worked with the blood quill

*** Did Snape never touch him...? Would he have started burning if he had?

**** Good question. We'll have to check the books to make sure. Does Snape's change in loyalty count or not?

***** The protection also actually protected him from spells, since that's why the curse reflected as a baby.

BUT does Moody never cast a spell on/touch Harry? What about when he imperiused him?

****** You're right. I think it rules out voldemorts followers then, only coming into effect if they attacked him at 4, Privet drive. The protection must only work against voldemort then.

******** But Quirrelmort was able to jinx his broom in Philosopher's Stone, and was only stopped by Snape / his friends creating a distraction. The intent was clearly to hurt him, yet the protection didn't kick in then, even when Quirrel had Voldemort inside of him. Yet the protection kicks in when Harry touches Quirrel, so... fucked if I know the rules on this one.

********* I would say that's because Quirrel jinxed his broom and not Harry. I imagine if he had levitated a big rock above Harry and then cancelled the levitation, the blood protection wouldn't help either. And that should work for Voldemort too, so if he had been just a bit more creative and a bit less proud he could have easily killed Harry.

*** Even stricter than that. It only works on Voldemort, though the wards it's linked too on Privet Drive must be less specific.

** Blood protection on Harry himself that allowed him to burn Quirrell was specifically against Voldemort, and it stopped working after Voldemort used Harry's blood in a resurrection ritual anyway.

Blood protection on the Privet Drive is only against Voldemort and Death Eaters, and it presumably protects Harry against them only when he is inside / close to the house.
