** Just finished the first chapter and wanted to share some thoughts. It is an interesting start and I do enjoy a good Hermione/Marauders fic whenever I find some. Overall impression was pretty good but there are just a few spelling mistakes like non instead of none or an when it should have been and. I look forward to reading some more, and I am curious to see what romance is included especially because you put only Hermione as a character.

*** Thank you for the review! No one else pointed out the spelling mistakes. I proof-read before posting because I have a crappy laptop keyboard but others seem to be lack of knowledge then (non/none). I'll be extra careful, I know how annoying it is to see mistakes while reading. Romance is coming up soon, it is a very slow developing story. So thank you for reading :)
