** I've read one similar to this. James is also partly responsible for Snape and Lily's deaths. James and Sirius see the kid as the next dark lord or something. I can't for the life of me remember what it's called though.

** I have read a fic with this, ages ago. I cannot find it however, even with my Google fu.

I don't think James was anywhere near as bad as Snape was, but I don't think he was completely unbiased. I think it was more he was looking for Lily in Harry, and found Snape, and was disappointed. Took it out on Harry somewhat.

****** Eh no, i haven't actually read it. I was just reacting to what [[/u/BrynmorEglan]] wrote.

I guess I really shouldn't comment on things that I didn't read but I couldn't help myself. I came across a lot of Snape glorification and the accompanying James bashing recently and I immensely dislike it.

I just feel like James is often unfairly judged because of one scene that was taken out of context in the books while Snape is a certified childish bully throughout the first six books and gets away clean in the eyes of a lot of fanfiction.

I realize that i went totally off topic here but I was annoyed with some of the stuff i'v read recently and i guess i needed to take it out on something... Sorry about that.

#+end_quote

While it was taken out of context, it was depicted as a normal occurrence. Snape would fight back, but it always seemed obvious to me that James and Sirius were the aggressors.

What really bothers me is when people claim it was 4-on-1. The books clearly state that Snape would get them back with /his/ friends, too.

the books very clearly /never/ stated that, and jkr describes him as an outcast

#+begin_quote
  James could certainly have been kinder to this boy who was a bit of an outcast. And he wasn't. And these actions have consequences. And we know what they were.

  Remus functioned as the conscience of this group, but it was an occasionally faulty conscience. *He did not approve of their relentless bullying of Severus Snape*, but he loved James and Sirius so much, and was so grateful for their acceptance, that he did not always stand up to them as much as he knew he should.

********* I didn't say they never ganged up on him singularly. Just that he sometimes came back against them with his own friends.

#+begin_quote
  He reportedly was friends with a gang of Slytherins who later became Death Eaters, including Avery and Mulciber.

  Other Slytherins that Sirius mentioned as being friends with Severus included Evan Rosier and Wilkes. Severus also had contact with Lucius Malfoy, who was a prefect during his first year and greeted him kindly when he was Sorted into the Slytherin House.
#+end_quote

While I don't have one of the books in front of me to get an exact quote, he was friends with /many/ of the Slytherins. He even invented spells during his school years that were dangerous that they could use against others (including Levicorpus, which Harry's father stole from him).

I'm not sure when JKR describes him as an "outcast" considering he was relatively popular among his own house.

********** yes, but there /isn't/ anything in the series about him coming back against them with his own friends. you're misremembering. sirius mentions him belonging to a gang which included bellatrix, who wouldn't have even been in school at the time. we don't know what his dynamic with the other slytherins were, just that they were vaguely affiliated with him

there isn't anything to suggest he was popular among his house, and i don't see why he would be. he's poor, unkempt, a half-blood, and bullied by two other popular students, and hangs around a muggleborn

Maybe not in a conventional way, but he certainly wasn't an outcast. He /had/ several friends and he was being groomed for the Death Eaters by a pretty popular prefect in Malfoy.

Perhaps you're right that I'm misremembering coming back against the Marauders, though.

************ Except that there's no way he wouldn't have come back, with his own friends, to get revenge. As you said, he was friends with the influential ones who were recruiting him into their inner circle, and created many dark spells.

It's just ignorant to assume he wouldn't respond in kind or worse. Hagrid certainly mentioned that they both attacked each other.

To put paid though; As an education professional, he used his authority to bully small children. Fuck Snape.

  Sort of inverted Severitus. Harry's world is turned upside down at the start of First Year when it is revealed that he is the son of James Potter and not Severus Snape. Now into Fourth Year.
