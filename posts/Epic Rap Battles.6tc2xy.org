Here's posting to prompt/compile Harry Potter-related rap battles in the style of Epic Rap Battles of History, having just composed one myself as part of a self-produced series; I am rather obsessed with the genre.

I am ONLY interested in crossovers here; I don't want to see any battles/ideas of a Harry Potter character Vs. Another Harry Potter character, which defeats the purpose of the ERB genre.
