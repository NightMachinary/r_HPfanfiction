This also works as a Prompt, If you feel inspired to write something in the comments, feel free!

Basically she refuses to let him live a life of abuse by the Dursley's and raises him from the tender age of one by herself. He arrives at Hogwarts at eleven, preferably not cocky and bigheaded as I doubt Minerva McGonagall's son would be.


** Not age of one, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11585823/1/The-Art-of-Self-Fashioning]] is something that is very good.

*** Well, a bit anyway. IIRC, she does take Harry, but she takes him to some OC relatives for them to raise, rather than raising him herself.

  Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away. HHr
