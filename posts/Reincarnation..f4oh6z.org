Hey, are there any stories where Hermoine Granger wakes up as Isabella Swan or her sister or other variations, and make twilight interesting???


** the only crossover i have ever read of the two is linkao3(21006551), but i don't think it fits into your boxes: - it isn't about hermione; - it's not reincarnation; - it's very short.

still, i think it's one of the best fanfics i have ever read, so i'll recommend it
