I need help with Fleur's accent, was never good with writing accents and need help if you could give me pointers on how to write her accents.


** I suggest cheating. [[http://www.payneful.co.uk/projects/french-accent-translator/#][Here's an English to French Accented English text translator]]. Looks to work pretty well, should work for Fleur well enough.

Looks like it doesn't work well on names so you'll have to mangle those yourself- like Arry for Harry.

** I'd suggest not overdoing it, it can get pretty tiresome real fast reading overdone frenglish. Throw a couple of "oui's" here and there, couple of z's instead of th's when she's excited that kind of thing.

*** Thanks for the advice. If I have Fleur in my story at all she normally don't speak too often, just on occasion because as I said I couldn't get her accent right before.

** Like others say, in Fleur's case it's better to tone down her accent, especially if she has a lot of dialogue. (And especially do not go the Chris Claremont route of just inserting minor French words in her speech like "oui" or "non.")

If she has a lot of spoken lines, less is definitely more. Have her drop the "H"s in the beginning of words, maybe a couple of "Z"s instead of "TH"s, that sort of thing.

One thing that might go a long way, though, and won't mess up the reading, is to remember that Fleur never used contractions. She never says "I'm" or "you're or "it's" or "can't"... it's always "I am," "you are," "it is" and "cannot."

** Please don't.

The fact that JKR writes out accents all the time /really/ doesn't mean everyone has to do it - it's painfully bad and very difficult to withstand. At most, it's best to pick out a few particular sentence patterns or particular words and emphasize the words in those.

Everyone knows she has a French accent. It really doesn't have to be agonizingly pointed to in every badly written word.

*** For me personally reading a story where Fleur doesn't have a French accent or it isn't used as often as it should be just seems very weird. Oh sure we know that she has a French accent, but for me at least it's nice to see authors taking the accent into account. (But that's just me personally).

**** You can take an accent into account without putting in silly phonetic bits, though. /Everyone/ has an accent, so I don't see the particular thing about phonetically doing some accents because they're not the typical "British" accent.

***** True but for me at least showing an accent like Fleur means that you care enough to write the accent down, taking more time with it. I've read stories where the author doesn't even try with Fleur's accent, and it just feels wrong reading a story without some sort of emphasis on her accent. But, maybe that's just me. Plus to me at least it give the story a little more of a personality of sorts.

****** The thing is... As a french reader I find these so-called french accents really badly written most of the time. It really breaks my immersion to read poorly written french and it's obvious that the author doesn't know anything about the french language. I can assure you that no one in France speaks english like how it is written in those fictions.

** Replace "th" with "z" and "i" (in words like it and is) with "ee".

But to be honest, I wouldn't do it at all unless she only has a handful of lines in the entire story.
