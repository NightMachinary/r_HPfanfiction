Hi all,

I'm looking for a fic I read quite a while ago now, and I've had no luck finding it on my own! I remember it being quite good and wanted to see how it's stood up.

What I know is in it:

The fic features several ways to block the killing curse including a 'metal shield' and an 'apparition shield'

Dumbledore gets put in some kind of cursed sleep by Voldemort

Harry gets quite powerful; Harry is still at Hogwarts

What I THINK is in it:

These may or may not be in it, I've read hundreds of fics in my time and sometimes the components blur.

There is a stone? Possible related to the founders or otherwise used for a ritual that Harry and Voldemort are searching for.

There is a major battle on an island?

Harry is an animagus?

The story is Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny

There is a duelling tournament at Hogwarts.

Mad-Eye & Kingsley tutor him in duelling, maybe Dumbledore as well

I think it was on HPFF.com

Thank you for your help.


** Maybe linkffn(The Butterfly Effect)?

  Edward's fall from grace destroyed not only his life, but the lives of those he loved the most. When he passes out teetering on the edge of total destruction and wakes up 17 again, how many times will he have to repeat the same day to set things right?

**** Next time you get a dodgy ffnbot link bust out google and check if there's another of the same name. Good luck finding your fic because you won't be getting any help from me!

***** Well I must apologise I'm inexperienced with both this sub and ffbot. I assumed the link you gave me was the correct one you intended.

**** Fanfic bot got confused, there are multiple stories on fanfiction.net with the same name. Not the OP but I believe he meant to link this linkffn(11254763). Have also read the story and from what I remember it could be what you're looking for.

Sometimes you might want to hold back on the sass a bit when people are just trying to help, okay?

  A chance remark on the night of Halloween 1981 could have changed everything. Fate throws baby Harry into the custody of Kingsley Shacklebolt, assisted by a certain Mad-Eye Moody. And oh boy, heads will roll and history will change when this gets out. Dear Wizarding Britain: Your saviour has arrived.
