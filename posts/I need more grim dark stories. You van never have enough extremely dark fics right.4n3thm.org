** Seeing as you've read Elizium, I'm going to guess you've read some of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Evoiceofthenephilim][Voice of the Nephilim's other stories]]? If not, you should definitely check out his other HP stories.

linkffn(Anything but Slytherin by IP82) is pretty good, as is linkffn(Evil Be Thou My Good by Ruskbyte).

If you like these ones, I'd also point you towards checking out works by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Eseriousscribble][SeriousScribble]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Emasterslytherin][Master Slytherin]].

And before I forget, what else says grimdark better than Warhammer 40K? linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens) is a decent crossover from what I've heard, though I haven't gotten around to reading it yet.

Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
