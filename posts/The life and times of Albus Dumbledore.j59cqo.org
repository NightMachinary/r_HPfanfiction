As a baby, his parents were killed by a Dark Lord, he was taken by his godfather, and raised in the magical world.

At 11, he went to Hogwarts, arrogant, and conceited.

At 12, a girl died.

At 14, a tourament happened, and the headmistress pulled out his name, he was happy. He won, but lost. For the Dark Lord had returned.

At 15, he was different. He realized how powerless he was, and strived to gain power. This was the year he inadvertably got his godfather killed.

At 16, the Dark Lord was in power, and quite openly, they put a bounty on his name. 100,000 galleons to be precise.

At 17, he went to Japan to learn from their greatest sorcerers. He went under a pseudonym, Wulfric.

At 21, he finished his advanced training, and got under the tutelage of the Grandmaster. This man was a chronomagus.

At 35, his training was finished, and he himself became a Master. That was when he met his wife. They had a son. He contemplated his own situation. He realized he should never have been raised by his godfather. The man was not capable.

At 41, he got over the fear of what happened to him and returned to Britain. The Dark Lord may have been a tyrant, but he was not stronger than the Muggle forces, thus he stayed in Wizarding Britain, where he claimed the seat as their ruler.

At 42, he became the person the Dark Lord feared the most, what he learned under the Grandmaster was spectacular.

At 44, after learning that he was unable to permanently kill the Dark Lord, planned to seal him away. He had 6 years to learn how to do so.

At 50, his own boy was 15. When the Dark Lord came back, he was not home, but his wife and son were, they were killed.

At 51, he forever trapped the Dark Lord in a mirror. This was the Mirror or Erised.

At 60, weary he was. An old Dark Lord from before his time returned to power. He was the first target. This one was more dangerous, and held the power of the Elder Wand. He stood no chance.

At 61, a year under captivity changed him. As was he not fed, his powers kept him alive, but he was weak, and very tired. His magic imploded, and he escaped from prison. Nurmengard had its first escapee. This time, he realized the wizardfolk agreed with the old Dark Lord, he found allies in no one.

At 64, he returned to Japan, and met with his Grandmaster. He was offered a choice. He left without making a decision.

At 66, he was known as the White Wizard by his Japanese students. He found it amusing, and quite liked the moniker. It comforted him, being likened to someone like Gandalf.

At 67, with a wave of his hand, he destroyed the school he once loved, it was a fortress ever so powerful, but a base for the old Dark Lord. The grounds next to it were also gone. The brits gave him a new nickname, the Valley Destroyer, the one who pierced the fortress. Percival. The ICW gave him a title of nobility. He didn't care.

At 71, after a period of contemplation, he returned to his Grandmaster. He accepted the offer, and went back in time. The chronomage turned his body young, at his behest, he looked 8. The old boy was adopted by a nice couple. They asked his name, and gave him their last.

At 120, and 57, he met the child version of the Dark Lord that he once killed. He decided to give him a chance.

At 127, and 64, he fought the old, but recent Dark Lord, and beat him. He changed his castle, and made Nurmengard inescapable.

At 152, and 89, his old pupil, the new Dark Lord, came into power. He regreted not killing him.

At 154, and 91, he saw his parents and godfather again. He didn't know how he felt.

At 162, and 99, he saw himself born again.

At 163, and 100, when he found out the Dark Lord was after the child of his old parents, he offered to be their secret keeper. Instead they chose his Godfather, and then the rat man. He knew what was going to happen to them, so he let it play out. He sent one of his own to make sure his godfather couldn't get a hold of his younger self. He watched with a steeled heart as the innocent man was taken to Azkaban. Reluctantly, he brought the child to his aunt and uncles house, where he knew he would be mistreated.... but kept safe from the true harm.

At 174, and 111, he met his child self, and vowed to steer him in a direction where he would experience the least hate. This plan to trap the Dark Lord failed, foiled by his own past self. The Mirror of Erised broken.

At 175, and 112, with abject horror, he realized why the Dark Lord didn't die.

At 176, and 113, he helped his younger self and friends save his godfather. He owed the man.

At 177, and 114, he pulled out his younger selfs' name, and the boy watched the Dark Lord rise... for him, it was a fleeting memory.

At 178, and 115, he came too late. His godfather died, just like the first. His plans weren't coming to fruition. He watched as his younger self cried in anguish, breaking his office.

At 179, and 116, he found the horcuxes. And realized the boy would have to die. Only temporarily. He was murdered this year. Intentionally, of course. His grandmaster asked him if it was worth it, he said yes.

As a ghost, he was tethered, and waited for his younger self, for he could never move on until the boy did. The boy came, naturally, but he returned to life. He was pleased how everything was going. The boy would lead a happy life, free of the worries he went through.

When the boy was 82, he realized just how much he looked like his old headmaster. But there was no loop. He lived on.

Albus Dumbledore, nay, Harry Potter was happy. Everything went well.

*** Not really, I'm basing it off of Mahoutokoro ([[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/mahoutokoro]]). Obviously, there is a lot of room to change the concept to what I want it to be.

Edit: It's a prompt idea I have that I'm working on (an actual story), its based on the cliche concept of a manuplative Dumbledore, on with the difference that Dumbledore was, and always will be Harry Potter. This version lived a very shitty life (without the guidance of a stronger teacher, instead the headmistress was Minerva), and only did what he has done to make sure that the younger version of him ends up with a good life. This story humanizes Dumbledore, instead of being this old manipulator hellbent on changing things for the greater good (a concept in the fandom)

Edit 2: I am partially a weeb, but not too much. But it won't focus heavily on Japanese culture

That, and I have creative freedom. You can't say you haven't read weirder fics. It's not possible.

**** ...I didn't read it, but I did stumble upon the concept of Fallout Equestria. Stories crossing the Fallout video game series with My Little Pony. Which...yeah. that's just wrong.

Came across it while trying to find a decent wallpaper for my pc on DeviantArt.

***** While it is wrong, Fallout Equestria is a very good story that started out as a parody. It also has amazing worldbuilding and character development that's not a "Fallout 3/NV but with ponies". Sure it starts similarly and has a lot of callbacks to all Fallout games but hey, a parody. I would recommend it, it's a very good read if you can stomach a few gory descriptions later in the story.
