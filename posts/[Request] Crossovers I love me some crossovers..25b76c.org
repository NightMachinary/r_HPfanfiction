Anyone know some good ones? I don't mind what HP is crossed with, though I do prefer it to happen during Harry's school career, though any time is good. I also strongly prefer non-slash, though if it's good enough I'll read it anyway.


** The first that comes to mind is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat Green Eyes]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]]. I'm sure there are a bunch of other good ones, although I haven't read much crossover.

Edit: Oh and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter the Last Avatar]]. Sadly most crossover I do read is wip.

** *[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil Be Thou My Good]]:* Nine years ago Vernon Dursley brought home a certain puzzle box. His nephew managed to open it, changing his destiny. Now, in the midst of Voldemort's second rise, Harry Potter has decided to recreate the Lament Configuration... and open it... again. /(Crossover with Hellraiser, though you needn't be familiar with the film to understand this fic.)/

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6947125/1/][A Study in Magic]]:* When Albus Dumbledore shows up at Baker Street with strange demands and baby-filled picnic baskets, Sherlock Holmes is less than thrilled.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3991385/1/][Sherlock Holmes and the Ravenclaw Codex]]:* A Sherlock Holmes mystery set in Victorian Hogwarts. A valuable artefact has been stolen from Hogwarts School, with a Muggle student the only suspect, and Headmaster Black summons Holmes to retrieve it. But the case is not as clear cut as it first appears.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10292645/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Snow-Princess-Part-One][Harry Potter and the Snow Princess]]

#+begin_quote

#+begin_quote
  Chaos Magic has always been a sore spot for the TSAB. No matter their knowledge of magic and advancements in technology, they could never get it to do as they wished, instead having to seal it away in the bodies of its wielders. Now the method to control it has been discovered, but to get it they must deal with a society that resists change at all costs.

***** Well, you could always give [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7325453/1/Nanoha-Takamachi-and-the-Horrors-of-Ineptitude][mine]] a shot if you'd like.

You should also read "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10166402/1/Nanoha-Takamachi-and-the-Wizarding-World][Nanoha Takamachi and the Wizarding World]]" since it's the sequel to "Nanoha Takamachi and the School of Witchcraft."

edit: It's not Nanoha, but if you like HP/anime crossovers I just started publishing [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10365494/1/Revenge-is-a-Dish-Best-Served-at-Body-Temperature][this]] which is HP/Hellsing. Note: it's rated M for impending violence and bloodshed.

** Try [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4388682/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-World-that-Waits][Harry Potter and the World that Waits]] by dellacouer. It's a X-men/Harry Potter crossover and is very well written. It hasn't been updated in quite a while but it's worth reading. Also, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] by Books of Change, a Harry Potter/Sherlock Holmes x-over. This is different than A Study in Magic by Vixit which is already linked in this thread.

Edit: Also, there's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince that was Promised]] by cxjenious. A Harry Potter/Game of Thrones x-over. Well written.

HP x Game of Thrones crossover. WIP.

#+begin_quote
  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold, dead things. He is only the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.
#+end_quote

The best HPxGoT out there. So far not an OP character in a world where he seriously would be. He only has some of the knowledge from his previous life. So far, he is writing his own story in the GoT universe rather than trying to slightly change what is there already.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7403329/1/Auryn]] HP x Naruto crossover. WIP

#+begin_quote
  Based on esama's 'Subject of Change', no pairings yet. When Harry Potter died, he didn't expect to end up meeting a giant fox, a pervert, get changed into a girl and end up with some kid who had was capable of giving Snape the warm and fuzzies.
#+end_quote

Actually quite a funny story, especially if you are into the anime genre. Goes over some of the remarkable similarities between the two worlds, among other things.

** Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds. Harry Potter + Dragonriders of Pern series Crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7591040/1/The-Queen-who-fell-to-Earth]]

SG-1/HP X-Over If Isis hadn't died in the canopic jar, things could have turned out differently. Harry goes to the airport at the wrong time. What will the wizarding world do if Harry leaves Earth? These three chapters will spawn two different stories. Stargate: SG-1 + Harry Potter Crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4564625/1/Isis-s-Bane]]

AU. Abducted by Loki, rescued by Thor, Harry grows up fast in a much wider universe than he ever imagined existed. Trained extensively by the Asgard, he is now ready to set his own course in life. The Goa'uld need to be dealt with, and he has questions concerning his own past and powers - the answers to which will only be found on Earth, at Hogwarts ... whatever the hell that is. Stargate: SG-1 + Harry Potter Crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9245090/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum]]

When Hagrid arrives at the Potter cottage in Godric's Hollow, he finds no sign of Harry Potter. It takes five long years for Harry to be found, in the care of a distant cousin, having been dropped off by his Great Grand Mother. Harry Potter + Bewitched Crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7051218/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Elder-Sect]]

This is an extremely AU crossover fic that asks the question what might have happened if Petunia Dursley hadn't found a young Harry Potter sleeping on her doorstep on the morning of the 2nd of November 1981. After all, Dumbledore was a bit careless with Harry Potter + The Destroyer Crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source]]

Sometimes, an average family has secrets. The residents of 1313 Mockingbird Lane have more secrets than most. Perhaps their biggest secret is how family comes first and foremost.
