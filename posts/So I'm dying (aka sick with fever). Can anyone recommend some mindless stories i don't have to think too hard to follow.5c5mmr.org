Crack, one-shots, funny fics with uncomplicated plots, cliches or anything of the sort. No angst/drama and no mainly romance please! Thank you!

  Also known as 'Harry and Voldemort Explore Fanfiction Tropes Together'. Different Harry Potters visit Little Hangleton, and Voldemort's the only one with much sense around here. I almost feel sorry for him. Includes Slytherin!Harry, Fem!Harry, Plothole!Harry, Flamboyant!Harry, Joker!Harry, Dark!Harry and more.

** Oh God, Not Again! is a classic of the funny stories.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]

The Wendell That Wasn't is very humorous. Snape is forced to haunt Harry as a ghost and neither of them is the least bit happy about it.

And this one is just brilliant. Calvin (and Hobbes) go to Hogwarts.
