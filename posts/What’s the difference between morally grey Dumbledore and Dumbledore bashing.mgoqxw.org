** Difference in him being morally grey is exactly what he is like in canon, calculating general making many questionable choices. Some good, some bad. It is certainly questionable to orchestrate his own demise by making Snape his scapegoat. Very much questionable and debatable. Especially because of the ownership of the Elder wand. I don't buy that he did it so he could die undefeated. My speculation the first time l read the book is that he expected Harry to kill or overpower Snape.

Dumbledore bashing is him being horribly evil and manipulative causing harm to all sides for his own purposes. Something like love potions, stealing, core blocks, setting up people to die, knowing about Harry's abuse by the Dursleys etc.

** Bashing is when you make a character have exaggerated undesirable traits because you want to show the audience that you don't like that character, such as making them inexplicably super evil and uncaring, despite not being that way in canon.

Morally grey characters are those with complicated morals. Dumbledore as a young man held some bigoted beliefs but he learned better and fought against bigotry in the wars. He made strategic choices during the war that saved many people, while others died due to those choices. From Harry's perspective he was a war hero but he was also the man who lead him along the path that would win the war and sacrifice Harry's life. Harry felt very conflicted about Dumbledore for a long time because of the things he learned about him, but ultimately respected and idolised him as we see in his child naming decision. Dumbledore is not a perfectly angelic character because no war leader is angelic, they are the ones who decide which pawns they're putting into a battlefield, so they will always be the cause of some deaths and the saviour of some lives. Dumbledore made mistakes in his life that had terrible consequences, and he held a power monopoly that, as an adult reader, is not comfortable, but none of that meant he was motivated by cruelty or greed, he was motivated by doing the right thing. He felt that Harry's sacrifice was necessary because it meant Voldemort would be mortal and that meant he could be killed far sooner than if Harry were protected forever. A morally grey character has to make hard choices like these, where there is no perfect solution, and they have complicated moral histories, they don't always make the best choice, they can be motivated by more than just moral good but they aren't solely motivated by selfishness or cruelty.

A character who decides that the best way to avoid a war is to indoctrinate a man into becoming a genocidal threat and start another war seems like a character who is unnecessarily replacing one deadly prospect with another and does not have an understanding of consequence. Do you have good reasons why you would make this decision if you were put in your character's shoes? Or is your character mainly inspired by covering his own back?

Dumbledore was not acting to cover his own back in the books. He wanted to take the path of least casualty to end the war, even if he made errors. He wouldn't want Voldemort to exist to distract people from a war with muggles, he would be campaigning and using his influence to try and avoid bloodshed. His actions might have bad consequences and cause problems like in any good story, but he wouldnt think that actively harming the wizarding populace is a good alternative to wizards finding out about ww2 and potentially causing a war.

What do you mean by "make Tom a dark lord"? Did he cause Tom to take up and act on a moral worldview that villainised and dehumanised muggles, did he cause Tom to develop the psychopathy he displays in the books, or did Tom already exist as an amoral, cruel, bigoted individual and Dumbledore thought he would be a good person to give power to? Because any of those would be Dumbledore bashing yes because that would be an awful decision, since he would have the understanding that his actions would directly result in death and pain, which is out of character.

Of course I don't know what your actual plot is, I'm just giving examples of things that would be Dumbledore bashing, because anything where he actively and knowingly promotes wizard hitler would be making him uncaring of human life or ignorant of obvious consequences- it would be inciting domestic terrorism. To make it not bashing, he would need a very good reason to think that the best possible solution to avoiding a war is to do this, or he would have to be doing this as a mistake, ie he was trying to do something much better but he accidentally caused Tom to go on the path to Voldemort.

Just remember, you can write whatever you want, if you want to write bashing that's your business. I assume this question is about how to identify bashing in your plot idea so you can tag it correctly, not whether you should write. You should always write.
