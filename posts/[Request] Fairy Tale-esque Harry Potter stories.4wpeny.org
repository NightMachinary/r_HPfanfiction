** Not what you're looking for, but you might want to consider linkffn(Muggle Fairy Tales are Mad). Hermione recounts old Fairy Tales to Ron and Harry, while Ron keeps finding inconsistencies and plot holes in them, much to Hermione's frustration.

*** Thank you, I had failed to consider more light hearted fairy tales (I tend to get absorbed into things more along the lines of Grimm fairy tales or Neil Gaiman-ish things). I'll definitely tuck into it though, feeling everything is alright with the world would be nice.

  Sequel to To Play the Devil. Harry and Tom left our world behind, but the world they face now has dangers beyond imagination. Myths and legends walk the earth: the washerwomen guard the fords; reapers stalk the noon-day fields, and the Gentry are riding. Worst of all are the plans of Death. He will walk beside them every step of the way. AU.

** Linkffn(Fairy Tales by Perceval23)

Literal crossover with fairy tale stories. Well written and worth reading, even if it hasn't been updated in a year and a half.

  Harry failed to learn the Power the Dark Lord Knows Not, so he, with Luna's guidance, must undertake a journey to learn the true history of the Wizarding world, and find himself in the process. Multi-crossover.
