Does your friends and family and so on know you read fanfics? I haven't told anyone myself, and was just curious:)


** My sister knows because she reads them too (although we don't send each other recommendations or talk about it, we just know we both read them but have 0 idea about each other's favourite ffs or tropes)

My mother knows although I don't know if she really understands the concept of fanfictions, she knows I love the books and read "stories" about them, but I think she just assumes it's like filling the Canon gaps. Not also completely different plots.

I don't hide it from my friends, they are just not interested in it and never ask about it.

I used to be ashamed of it years ago in highschool, but now I openly share them/talk about it on social media.

** My husband knows and likes to read my writing. My family know because my sister borrowed my laptop and accidentally stumbled across it. A friend knows because we spent ages kind of dancing around the topic then finally just admitted to one another that we both read and write fanfic. Honestly I'm old enough now that I'm umbothered if someone thinks it's dorky or cringe or whatever, at the end of the day it's a harmless hobby that brings me joy. Definitely when I was a teenager and in my early 20s I kept it quiet though.

** Yap. It makes me happy. I'm not going to hide the things that make me happy.

People but so much work and effort into writing, why is it still shameful to say I read it? What sense does that make? People laugh at me sure but like, why?? I don't understand.

** Yep, my mom and my sister both read my fic, other family members know I read and write fic. One of my coworkers knows because she's in the same fandom I'm in, the rest of my coworkers don't.

** My family knows. They were all a little weirded out at first but eventually came to accept and even like some of the stuff I told/continue to tell them. My mom even said once that she didn't think it was so weird after she realized that the King Arthur legend is basically the original Fanfiction, what with how many people wrote about him and others in his stories

** My mother is my beta reader. My brother has read my story. I have mentioned my story to a friend and one of my cousins. My father and stepfather also know that I write Harry Potter fan fiction, but they know the canon so poorly that I haven't even suggested that they read my story. Oh yes, and my grandmother knows too, but she doesn't understand English, doesn't know the canon at all and I don't think she even understands the concept of fan fiction. She probably thinks my story is just my English practicing project.

I've got high standards which means I don't write anything I would be ashamed of if people found out. The vast majority of fan fiction is of poor quality, but it doesn't mean fan fiction couldn't be of high quality, and I'm confident that my story is very good.

** When I told my family when I was 13 that I'm writing fanfiction they were proud of me at first... especially that I had about 50 reviews after posting my first three chapter. But when they read it they were like "what's this crap and why are people enjoying this shit?" so I never told anyone IRL again about my passion for fanfiction.
