  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.

*** Oh my god yes. It's also got the Voldemort D&D scene. I'd been trying to find that for so long it's not even funny.

**** And let us not forget about the hilarious [[/spoiler][Draco/Ginny]] pairing-esque subplot, one that actually makes sense within the story (which makes it better at doing that than 90+% of stories created for that very purpose).

**** Selling gold for dollars is actually alright.

However the third line of the story includes the words "He handed over a twenty pound /bill/" so it may not be in the story because gold prices are an international thing.
