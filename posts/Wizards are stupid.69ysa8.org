Wizards are stupid, let's just get that out of the way because they are. why are wizards stupid from a biological and/or metaphysical standpoint rather than because of wizard society?


** Well, if suspension of disbelief or ignorance of the laws of physics affect the range & potency of certain spells (easier to cast leviosa if you don't understand how gravity works etc), then it may well be that ignorance is actually an informed choice for most wizards and witches (see what I did there).

It also gives another reason for purebloods to hate muggles, whose drive to uncover the mysteries of the universe is making it really easy for wizards to accidentally absorb information about how the world works just by walking past a TV or radio, making it harder for them to use their favorite magic down the road. That drive to entrap them in the realms of reality could be seen as a conspiracy perpetrated by muggles in the know if certain of the nuttier nuts in Voldemort's nutella are to be believed.

** They're "stupid" for 2 reasons:

1: They can have anything they want with a magic word.

2: Their society depends on isolation from muggles.

Ok, so there's no real incentive to make any kind of progress, since magic already does most of the stuff we invented technology for. And they can't simply import technological or philosophical progress from the muggle world because the vast majority of wizards will live out their entire lives without ever having a meaningful interaction with a muggle.

*** Your reasons are also stupid. I mean, don'T you remember that the ministry sent cars to the Weasleys? Doesn't that mean that they know about it? That they import some stuff from the muggle world? Also why should they travel with a car when they could apparate? It's stupid to invent something if you can already do it, better, cheaper and quicker.

***** but they have it so why should they bother making anything better is the wizard mentality and if that's not good enough then you have brooms and floo. besides who would want to travel in some death trap made by some filthy muggle anyway.

**** I don't really get what your point is here. Yes there are some wizards who have a basic understanding of what muggles get up to. Arthur Weasley is the head of the misuse of muggle department and treats muggle items as a hobby. There's also the obliviators who must understand how to navigate the muggle world in order to destroy evidence of wizards. Plus some ministry higher ups have some connection, the minister of magic meets with the prime minister for instance.

But, it's demonstrated multiple times that the wizard world is, as a general rule, largely ignorant of what's going on the muggle one. Even Arthur, who is supposed to be the resident expert, makes several basic errors, such as not knowing how to pronounce electricity.
