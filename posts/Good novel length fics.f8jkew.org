I just really want some good novel length fics, they can be a WIP, just please don't recommend abandoned works.

Rules:

1: Protagonist has to be either Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape, there can be other protagonist, it just has to focus on either one as well.

2: No Abandoned works.

3: Has to be a novel length fic.

Optional:

1: I prefer Ao3, really it just has to be well written.

2: I have an absolutely HUGE time travel kink!

Thanks in advance! And even if you don't have anything matching this, thanks anyways!


** Is it okay if it's dark? Like the world-is-bleak dark. Are you okay with Dramione also?

**** I don't know if you have read this but [[https://my.w.tt/jy1LbJZqk4][Draconian by hepburnettes]] from wattpad is in Draco's POV most of the time. It's a dark fic and is what gave me the start to read fanfictions. It was already complete but the author decided to take it down and now has put it up again chapter by chapter. I don't exactly remember the plot but I remember loving it. It's been a few years since I've reread it.

I have other dark dramione-centric fanfics that are well-written and well-plotted but it doesn't fit your criteria. Hermione being the primary narrator of the story, but has elements of Draco's perspective. It really is daunting to find an excellent Dramione fic seeing it's the most common ship and most fics are not really well executed.

Now I also saw your Severus Snape fic reqs, this is also an SS/HG rec but it's worth the read. Has a time-travel element in the story but it's probably not what you expect. I think it's complete last time I check and is very lengthy. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11053807/1/Sin-Vice][Sin & Vice]] ffnbot!directlinks

When I stumble upon something that fits your request exactly, I'll be sure to send it your way. :)

  When Harry is accidentally sent back to Hogwarts 1982, he discovers a more bitter and angrier Snape than he knew in his school years. Tasked by Dumbledore with teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts and befriending Snape, as well as finding out how to get back, Harry knows he is in store for a difficult year. Despite their arguing, Harry can't help but find himself drawn to Snape. If Harry and Snape can get over their past and learn to be just a little selfish, their relationship may stand a chance.

  Charlie is just trying to get on with life post-war with his beloved dragons and forget. Draco just wants to get out of England and somehow manages to wangle his way into a placement on the reserve. Charlie doesn't expect him to last a week, but his dedication, perseverance, and obvious love of dragons are impressive, and it doesn't hurt that he has a damn fine arse. Charlie's just not sure he can trust Draco.
