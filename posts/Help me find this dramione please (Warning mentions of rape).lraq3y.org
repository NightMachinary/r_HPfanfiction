:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi all,

I'm looking for this fic I loved and lost. It starts with Draco waking up in a cottage and finding bloody raped Hermione, he's very confused and not remembering the rape, but it's clearly his doing and he's pretty horrified. Later they figure out that he was under influence of some spell/potion that made him do terrible things during last couple years of war (I think perhaps it was a potion administered by Bellatrix). He takes care of her and they stay together at the cottage (safe house) for some time, cooking lunchmeats and gathering wood, becoming friends.

There's also a sequel where Draco lives in the USA and goes to a therapist, and after a while comes back to England.. I'm not going into more detail in order to not spoil it for you if you only read the first part.

Thanks for your help!
