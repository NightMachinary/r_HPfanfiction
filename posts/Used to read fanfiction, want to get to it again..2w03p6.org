Hi there! I used to LOVE reading HP fanfiction. I'm a few years older now and I don't remember when I last read fanfiction. However, I think fanfiction is a great way to get in some reading time if you're busy because you're already reading about characters you love. With that said, I remember my OTP was Snape/Hermione. Does anyone have any good fanfic stories they could recommend? I haven't been in the fanfic world in a while and I can't remember my favorite authors/stories. Thanks!

The same thing happens the next day--and the next--but no one seems to notice except Snape...

** This [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2navg3/hermionesnape/][thread]] should help. Those are some of my favorites though I would not really rec For the Potion Master's Amusement.

*** Thank you. I started reading it and it just made me a bit uncomfortable. For example, I loved Care of Magical Creatures but I couldn't get through FtPMA.
