I mean, not everyone is going to hate them. And while many muggle-borns would be freaked out by them at first, that's a lot of time to not have at least one person aside from Harry that's nice to them. Sure, many people suck but a lot would still be polite (and not just verbally abuse a goblin for absolutely no reason.)


** I feel that the best way that you could spin this is that:

- Harry Potter, as the Boy-Who-Lived/Chosen One/Lord Potter depending on what is happening in the story, has or potentially will have significant influence in the magical world.
- His attempt to be polite to them suggests that he might be amenable to building an amicable relationship with them in the long run, which would give them influence in the wizarding world by proxy
- The actual resources they put into this are minimal, so they lose little by trying
- The possibility of Voldemort setting his eyes on them if he wins is large enough that they would prefer him to lose, but officially breaking neutrality would harm their professional reputation long term, this allows them to interfere deniably
- Often these are indy!Harry stories with Dumbledore bashing, and it gives the goblins a free way to taking shots at Dumbledore and they are being petty
- The above means that they have no reason to piss him off or sabotage him even if he was a raging bigot. A valuable client can still be important to keep even if they are an arsehole.
- Harry is a young boy who doesn't understand any of the above and assumes they are only reacting to his actions.

There is also the possible fun subversion that the goblins really are all human-hating baby-eating savages which the wizarding world only managed to subdue through great effort and bloodshed and stripped away as much power as they could so they wouldn't have to genocide the whole lot of them. The goblins finally break free by duping this ignorant wizarding hero into restoring their ability to wage war, and as thanks he shall be given pride of place as the slave of the Great Goblin King to watch first hand the fall of wizarding Britain and the rise of a new Goblin Empire.

An aside, on Goblins and their kings, I remember more than one fanfic taking David Bowie's character from the /The Labyrinth/ and making him the canon ruler of the Goblins.

** Are you talking about this trope where the Goblins of Gringott all bend backward for Harry just because he remembered one of them and was polite (usually by saying a sentance like "May your gold and the blood of your enemies flow")?

I'm not a fan of this trope (which fall into the "Power trip" fantasy), but one of my main problem with it is that, just as you said, other people are probably polite to Goblin, and we even have Canon examples:

- Hermione was polite toward Griphook after the escape of Malfoy Manor, and it didn't do her any good when he betrayed them.
- When Bill was warning Harry of Griphook, I would also consider him as "civil". He basically said "I know Goblin because I work with them, and no matter what you are planning don't fuck with them because it's a BIG no no in their culture".

Anyways, my point is that there are people civil toward Goblin in Canon, and I doubt the Goblin are even less scornful for that, let alone treating them as "friend". Wizards may be partly responsible for the "difficult" relations between the 2 groups, but Goblins are also far from innocent in this.

** Being 'polite' to a goblin shouldn't mean a thing. Every Slytherin would know to be polite to them if it brought them significant benefits like those in so many fics. Goblins wouldn't care for nice words - from what I understand, all their peace treaties with wizards were broken before the ink on them dried. 'Actions speak louder than words' would be their prime motto.

I think the goblins could be impressed only if you offer them a deal that greatly benefits them without needing to. I don't remember the fic, but in it Sirius destroys the cup inside of the Lestrange vault (which he can only inspect as head of family, but not remove any belongings) and alerts the guards unwittingly. Instead of trying to squirm his way out, he's upfront about the whole issue and offers to surrender all goblin-made artefacts from his vaults in order to smooth things over.

Since it isn't exactly a deal made because of desperation (he had failsafes in place), but because Sirius doesn't really care for the Black fortune and feels it's fair for goblins to own these things, he actually achieves a working cooperation.

Probably the idea that they are nasty vile creatures is a result of the many revolts and wizards and goblins generally see each other with contempt. However once you work with them and get to know them on an individual basis you become less judgmental.

** Everyone else already commented on why politeness by itself really shouldn't change anything, so I'll bring up my own point about this. The issue is that people take racial tensions and context for those tensions from our world and transplant them into one that is utterly removed from that context. In our world we are all humans, all the same species, and we are and the top of the food chain by such a wide margin that deaths to other species are treated as tragedies.

In HP world however, humans barely if at all at the top of the food chain. There are dozens of species that hunt and kill humans, many who hunt /exclusively/ humans like dementors, boggarts, ect. Humanity has literally compromised to feeding them the souls of criminals to keep them contained since they cannot be killed. There have been multiple entire /wars/ between species, where it was literally everyone of us vs everyone of them. There are territory lines /IN THE MIDDLE OF COUNTRIES/ where you are under the jurisdiction of species that eat and murder humans. Goblins are the most visible of these examples. Rather than transplanting our worlds "oh no the poor oppressed goblins" we need to take it in the context of the HP universe where wizards live significantly longer and several have living memory of when the entire species was at war. That would definitely breed some hard core racism, and unlike our world racism which is stupid and pointless, HP world's racism might well be rational and justified.
