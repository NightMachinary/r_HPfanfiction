Hello! I would love to hear what your recommendations for reincarnation fics are. I really don't care about any tropes except fem Harry... that's just not my thing.


** What would you consider a reincarnation fic versus a time travel fic? For instance, fics that take up Reptilia28's challenge have harry dying, meeting death, and being sent back in time to try again. Do you consider those fics as reincarnation fics or as time travel or both?

**** Most of these stories put the older mind/memories into their younger bodies in the past. That's why I would consider them more time travel stories then reincarnation.

IMO I would consider a reincarnation story to be more of you die and then are reborn into another identity but no time travel into the past.

** I'm not sure if this counts, but there is New Divide by AislingSiobhan on ff.net and ao3.

I'm not sure how to link it.

This is the summary: [LV/HP] Harry Potter was the Boy-Who-Lived. But by some twist of Fate he was also the reincarnation of Voldemort's murdered lover. Harry has enjoyed the past few years at Hogwarts, but this one looks set to be even more intriguing. Suddenly smarter than he was before and plagued with memories of his past life as he sleeps, Harry gets set for his school year. But then Voldemort finds out who Harry really is. And every thing changes. AU. Slash. LV/HP. Past LV/OC (Harry). Violence. Language. Character Death (OC). Flashbacks.

It's a bit dark, but it has a happy ending. And it's consensualish. It's not non-con, though. So there's that.

*** To use the bot, simply take the number in the link.

Links are made easy to read, for each / there is a new 'folder' so to speak, and each fanfic gets its own number id. All the fanfics on ao3 are in a folder names 'works' and all the fics on ffn are in the folder 's'.

So for this fic the ao3 link is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/129360/chapters/183778]]\\
The first number inside the folder "work" is the fic ID number: 129360\\
so to use the bot you write linkao3(129360)

On ffn the full link is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5874614/1/New-Divide]]\\
The first number inside folder 's' is the fic ID number: 5874614\\
so to use the bot you write linkffn(5874614)

​

Funfact: the links ffn use also makes it possible to see wich chapter you're on for that fic: /s/fic ID number/chapter number/

Ao3 on the other hand gives each chapter a number in the sequense they were posted.\\
So you can see how many other fanfics/chapters has been updated between two chapters.

For example a fic I follow had one chapter posted on May 16th, with chapter number 58297513 and the next chapter came out June 6th with chapter number 58473961, this means that from one chapter to another ao3 got 176448 new chapters for all the other fics, which is around 8402 new chapters/fics every day! That is crazy!

​

Thank you for the rec, I'll check it out now ^^

** Linkffn(dodging prison and stealing witches) is problematic in terms of Harry blatantly grooming young girls as an adult, but if that's not a dealbreaker (and frankly, it's hard to avoid in reincarnation fics IMO) the plot is well developed, lots of world-building, and a solid Slytherin!Harry fic.

Linkffn(three to backstep) avoids the grooming problem, is complete, and also rather well-written if a bit cliche

**** Bad phrasing, there are definitely lots of fics where 2 people go back together or there's no romance at all. But it's hard to have any kind of appropriate romantic relationship where one character has a significant discrepancy in physical and mental age and the other character is somewhere between 11 and 17. DPSW is way way more blatant about the grooming, but any Peggy Sue where just one character goes back and is dating someone “their own” age inherently is grooming

  Thanks to a ritual in his first life, he's been reincarnating for millennia. Every death has resulted in being born anew nine months later. He's always magical, always male, and always in possession of all his memories, but always in a different body and of a different family. This time, he has been born to a naive young couple with high ideals and little understanding but an enormous well of love for their son that he cannot fault. This time, he is called Harry Potter.This story is a Work In Progress. It is not finished. It may never be finished. Updates will be sporadic. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

  Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death, some of them not human, none of them exactly like his old one---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now he's Harry Potter again, but his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is going to be to support Jonathan in his defeat of Voldemort. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort comes that Halloween night, discovers what Harry is, and kidnaps him. The story of a long fight between Voldemort's sadism and Harry's generosity.
