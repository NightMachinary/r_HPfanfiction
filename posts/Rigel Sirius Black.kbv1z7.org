Think about the fandom you're working with right now. Now imagine that your character is friends with Rigel, a man with curly raven hair, dark eyes, pale skin, and sharp features. Said friend has a shady backstory, is an orphan, his father didn't do it, and strange things happen around him sometimes.

You're welcome.
