I have a soft spot for fanfics where Harry is taught or reinvents a magic system from another work of fiction. Things I've read and liked are linkffn(5846162; 9596404). I'm fine with anything from full-on crossovers to AU to Harry simply recreating some different type of magic from scratch. They don't necessarily have to be good, just not absolutely horrible. Thanks for any suggestions!

  A 7 year old Harry stumbles on a box of old Naruto manga. Inspired, he reaches deep within, using chakra to quickly become a phenomenal ninja. And thus begins a curious tale. Read and see how it ends! Read 1st chapter A/N...story is officially abandoned.

** Yeah, so I'm going to be reccing this absolutely everywhere. It's not exactly a magic from another work of fiction rather but:

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/309447]]

It's a premise that doesn't sound all that good at first - Loki rescues Harry from the Dursleys and adopts him, and it takes a while to get to the main point (currently the fourth installment, and it's very long) - but the main point is Harry and other students he gathers around him realize that muggles and wizards are heading towards a collision since at some point technology will reveal the existence of wizars, and they start a space program to get all wizard kind off earth and onto another planet. It is brilliant and in depth and has a lot of discussion of magical theory and stuff - they actually terraform a plant to make it habitable and such, they mine asteroids...

Seriously, it's one of the best things I've ever read in the fandom, even if it does start off a bit slow. I urge you to give it a chance. It's not heavy on romance though there is some as they get older. It has some character bashing in the first part (Dumbledore, Ron and Hermione) but then everyone grows up and turns into more round and mature characters, so if bashing is not your thing don't worry about it.

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
