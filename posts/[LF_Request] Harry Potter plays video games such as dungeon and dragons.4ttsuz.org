Looking for a Harry Potter Fic where Harry plays video games. I have already read Harry Potter the geek.


** Calling Dungeons and Dragons a video game is like calling Spider Man "that kid from a Captain America movie".

  The summer before his fifth year, Harry obtains a computer and an internet connection. Two months later, he emerges a changed person, for what has been seen cannot be unseen. AU with the whole Harry Potter timeline moved forward to the modern day. References to internet memes, video games, anime, etc.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

** Ah yes, I remember back when I was into DnD. It got too expensive after they started shipping each yearly game with day 1 DLC and they went with a Pay2win business model.
