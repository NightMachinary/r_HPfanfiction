** You mean the one where Harry is fifteen and Tonks is already with Lupin? And Sirius' will was accepted without much fuss because of plot?

If so, you mean this one: [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600023065]]

I've never finished it past the 1st chapter. It's, uh, not so great imo.

  AU post OoTP. Poor Harry. Sirius left him far more than a house and some money. Dumbledore is the Dark Lord? And what is he supposed to do with the women he was left? Sometimes, Pranks suck and others they are opportunities. H/Multi
