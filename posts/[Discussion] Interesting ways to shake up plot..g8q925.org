The Ministry has a Portkey office, right? Why?

The fanfic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13391615/1/Pack][Pack]] uses this in an interesting way.

#+begin_quote
  Portkeys were a highly regulated form of magic, according to Arthur Weasley. Hermione had, of course, researched them further after they had used one that summer to get to the Quidditch World Cup. She discovered that international portkeys required coordination between countries.

  She also discovered that portkey usage was highly prolific and that it was likely that there were at least a hundred used every hour in Europe alone.
#+end_quote

TL;DR: Barty's unauthorized triwizard cup portkey collided with an international portkey. Quidditch player ends up in the graveyard, Cedric goes to the beach, and Harry wins an all expenses paid trip to Jurassic Park. Cedric goes to jail, Quidditch player captures Voldemort, and Harry plays with dinosaurs.

â€‹

See? This could be a new trope to play with. Want to explore MACUSA? Have an international portkey from there in the accident. Magical Japan? Russia?

Does Voldemort get overrun by the other party? Does Wormtail capture them? Are they used for the ritual? Or do they wait? Does everybody else find out about Voldemort? This could get rid of Umbridge in a way.

Not to mention the crossover potential.

** you could probably use this as a crossover prompt, too. something like, "Oh two portkeys colliding ripped a hole in the universe, just as the doom slayer entered his portal."

fun stuff

*** Doomslayer lands in the graveyard, Voldemort yells to kill the intruder. Gets 12gauge buckshot in response. Harry gets dumped on Hell-on-Earth with Cedric.

I wonder how the cup's return portkey would work?
