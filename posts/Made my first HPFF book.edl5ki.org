I have the entire book written out just releasing the story over a few days. Gives me time to work on another fic as well without stress. It's is based on [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/e9k1jj/harry_chooses_ancient_runes_as_a_subject_and/][this prompt]] by [[/u/asifbaig][u/asifbaig]] Harry follows canon until after the Goblet chooses his name. From there things take a drastic change. Hope you all enjoy it and please let me know what you think!

** Your chapter 2 formatting seems to be fucked up, while on mobile every indent says p class="MsoNormal" Enjoying the fic though!
