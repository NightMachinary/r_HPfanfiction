Hi everyone, I've had this thought for a while but have never seen it used, and wondered what others thought of it.

Quite a few fanfics have Harry/whoever figure out there's a basilisk and use a rooster to kill it, then harvest everything.

I like the idea that the crow of a rooster basically disenchants the magic of the basilisk thereby destroying the magic viability of it's various parts. The venom won't corrode, the skin is just skin, and so forth.

In this case to gain the benefits of basilisk parts, it's slayer would actually have to risk injury and death to defeat it and actually slay it.

For fics where only the death of the basilisk is the aim, using a rooster would be the absolute best way to kill it, but I feel like there should be a penalty for taking the easy way out.


** Headcanon adopted

I also feel like it should be a special rooster. Roosters just aren't rare enough for basilisks to be threatening if any old rooster will do. Like Harry bringing Hermiones note to McGonagall -> she apparatus to a nearby farm -> game over

*** I think that's more due to Basilisks being rare and artificially made creatures than any link to Rooster-rareness, so they'd probably be found more often in dark dingy dungeons and hidden lairs off in the middle of nowhere than by Farmer Maggot's prize carrot crop. I don't imagine the Rowling-World tends to get many Dark Lords keeping chickens, so they'd be mostly safe unless intruders knew a basilisk was around and could handle a distressed Rooster well enough to drag it into a deep dark dungeon.

*** It could be that the rooster needed to be in an area of high magic concentration. A normal rooster would just scare the basilisk for a few seconds, but then nothing more then that.

**** I believe the note said something like "the cry of a rooster is fatal to it." Maybe the argument could be that while fatally damaged, death is not instantaneous for the basilisk? So it has time to fight back... maybe a smaller basilisk might die quickly, whereas a fully-grown basilisk might still live for days... think of a rooster-cry as poison to the basilisk, instead of an Avada Kedavra.

***** That makes the most sense in my head. I've also seen in some fanfictions they add the fanon that it's only the genuine cry from the rooster at dawn that is fatal. It seems appropriately magical and mechanical but of course there's no canon evidence for it.

****** Oh! This is interesting. In my fic, Harry absorbs the Basilisk venom like the sword of Gryffindor... it becomes part of his genetic make-up. I haven't quite decided how it is going to manifest, though, and need to consider that he's now susceptible to the cry of the rooster.

****** I wonder about the sword of Gryffindor... It is imbued with the Basilisk venom. Does it's power to slay horcruxes become null and void if it's in the vicinity of a crowing rooster?

******* Goblin blades only take in what makes them stronger if I remember correctly so it should be fine. I was thinking that maybe Harry in your story would get the basilisk stuff by a combination of basilisk /blood/, basilisk venom(maybe) and Phoenix tears. To make it more rare so that questions about it not happening already don't crop up, maybe Voldemort performed some ritual on his soul to make it more accepting of snake-like qualities.

** The only instant death from a rooster I've read in a fic is a crack fic. The rest have the whole frantic death scene where it's wriggling around and screeching. Usually doing more damage to the heroes than the battle itself.

​

There may be more.

​

But HP really screwed the pooch on the basilisk lore. Could have sworn it was the egg of a ROOSTER hatched by a toad. I knew this. Or is that cockatrice? One of them.

​

I headcanon it by saying "Crimes against nature always receive an easy-ish counter." Still have yet to think up a good one for Horcruxes though. I vote patronus. Probably something stupidly easy. That the Unspeakables know of. But hide as Dark Lord bait. Hell, it gives more credence to the Love is the power he knows not.
