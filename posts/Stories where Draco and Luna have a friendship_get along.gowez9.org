I'm not looking for romance between the two of them, but I like the idea of them getting along despite their differences. They can be minor or major or secondary characters, I'm fine with whatever.

Would rather not have Seer Luna. Would rather not have Weasley bashing.

Would rather not have OP Harry, Harry smarter or stronger then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable, like he worked hard for it.

It can be as canon compliant as possible or as AU as possible. It can be on any site, it can be any length, the story itself can be anything, I don't care what the plot is. It can be older or newer.. Anyone can be the main character.

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated, but if not that's fine.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)
