Muggles have things like abortion, privacy, suicide, gay marriage, sexism\racism, etc to argue about. What similarly controversial issues would wizards have in their society that would define their political spectrum and a wizard's place on it?


** Here are some I can see happening.

Whether:

- Time Turners, Veritaserum, Legilimency, Pensieves, Unbreakable Vows (?), and Imperius should be used in crime investigation or if it's a violation of wizards' privacy and their freedom in general;
- Unbreakable Vows should\could be used as a form of law enforcement;
- usage of polyjuice for gaining access to someone else's body (without their consent) should be illegal, and what punishments should be deemed adequate for various misuses (sexual gratification, money fraud, defamation, etc);
- a supervising group should be allocated for the Unspeakables or if security through obscurity is necessary in their line of work and\or more important;
- Dementors should be pacified by feeding them souls or if [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/42z2c5/showerthought_i_wonder_how_dementor_exposure_was/][Azkaban]] prisoners should be relocated and Dementors fought against;
- Ministries of Magic should allocate any resources for muggle protection --- if any at all (argument against: trying to actively protect them is pointless anyway, since if a wizard was interested in muggle hunting, nobody would know about their practices unless they were being stupid with their planning);
- cross-breeding with magical creatures should be legal or not, and to what extent;
- Unforgivables should be allowed if the target has consented to be subjected to them;
- someone can be made into a slave if they are under heavy debts and\or are agreeing to it themselves;
- pleasure and addiction inducing spells should be legal or not;
- the general pureblood\mixed blood subjects, as well as rights (or lack thereof) of muggle parents regarding magical children;

*** Inter-species relationships would probably also be a big thing.

On that note, dark creatures with human-level sapience, magic and communications ability. Should they be granted the same level of rights as wizards & witches or not?

Should a magical person using magic to commit crimes in the muggle world, crimes that are against muggle law but have no similar offences listed in the local magical Ministry's books, actually be considered a crime under Wizarding Law if there are no breaches to the statute of secrecy?

Also, the practice of individual/community secession from the magical government in favor of the muggle world or the establishment of their own enclave-just how should the magical world respond to such events?

Infrastructure vs. individual enchantment-what's the right balance to have? With floo networks and the Hogwarts Express being the only evidence of magical infrastructure (the Knight Bus piggybacks on the muggle one), just what is the role of infrastructure in a world that can negate most of its benefits through magic going to be in the future?

Taboos, censorship & magical surveillance-how far should the Ministries go with it?

In the state I live in, and many other places in the world, no person can consent to being hit, or the like, so BDSM is actually illegal. I'm curious if it would be the same in the Wizarding world, but for curses.

Because "this historical event happened" is totally "how things work"

Like shit, most of it just boils down to "I don't like it, so it's not true". Well you don't have to like what happens in the books either, and you're free to come up with your own idea of how things work there too (I mean, just look at all the AU fics). It's the shitty half-justification of "she said it, not wrote it, so something something 'death of the author' that doesn't mean what I think it means" that I take issue with.

***** A lot of Pottermore is written by third-party sources, and it's not part of the books. Canon is a highly subjective thing, too - look at the Bible. Catholics and Protestants and Jews don't agree on which books are canon and which are merely apocrypha or deuterocanon. Why shouldn't that be the case with Harry Potter? JKR isn't God; we don't /need/ to take everything she says as gospel.

****** It's true that much on Pottermore is written by third-parties. But it is still endorsed by Rowling.

While it is true for the religious scripture, it isn't true for for Harry Potter. The Potterverse was created by Rowling. So in a sense Rowling is its God, deciding its creation and history. Because without Rowling there would be no Potterverse and no squib rights marches (SRM) to argue about.

But okay let's say that the previous statement isn't correct. Then what is and isn't Canon? [[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/canon][Wikipedia]] states

#+begin_quote
  canon is the material accepted as officially part of the story in an individual universe of that story. By that definition anything accepted by Rowling would be canon.
#+end_quote

What do you consider canon? Is it only the "main" storyline consisting of the seven books? Does that mean that the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Beasts_and_Where_to_Find_Them][Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] and all of the companion books aren't part of the canon? What is the differentiating factor? Does it need to be a physical print or is a wiki article from JKR enough?

*EDIT*

If this comes across as hostile that's only because I'm a clumsy at expressing myself. I am genuinely interested in your opinions on this matter so please do respond :)

Finally, in my opinion, fictional canon is decided by the actual rights holder. If <author> decided that he/she wanted to do an official book within the Potterverse the validity of that authors book would be decided on by the rights holder. Maybe it is accepted as canon in an off-shot dimension. Or maybe the rights decides that it is heresy and sues the alternative <author> out of existence.

Sure one could argue that a grouping large enough could splinter off from the Potterverse main canon and start a sect where <authors> work is canon. But that is, as stated, not part of main canon.

The point that I'm trying to make in my ramblings is this. The creator/rights holder of a fictional universe possesses the final and absolute say in what is and isn't canon. No one else.

/Personally/, I consider canon to be the seven books only; the companion books are semi-canon, but not quite. They're like mods to a computer game; you can play with or without them. Pottermore used to be part of that for me, but then it started spouting off stuff like "Muggleborns are descendants of squibs", for example, which kinda invalidates a lot of the anti-prejudice sentiment in the books, and it lost all credibility for me. There's other stuff too, but I can't think of it right now.

I think what I was trying to say, and didn't succeed in saying, was that there are different degrees of canon (at least to me). I'm not denying the existence of supplemental materials, but I think what really gets me is that a lot of what JKR came out with after DH gets in people's minds as "this is how it is" (which I guess it is, if I take your word for it) and almost ruins the original ideas that fans come up with. Because the HP fanbase is so broad, there are a lot of different opinions and theories and a TON of originality and creativity.

And this brings me to another point: because the HP series was so massively successful, it's become a cultural touchstone. People use references to it in everyday speech. And I think in some way, it belongs more to its fans than to JKR now (even though that's legally not the case). So for JKR to come in and say "oh guess what, there's some stuff I wanted to add, and guess what IT'S OFFICIALLY CANON NOW", feels /wrong/. Despite having written the series, I think the time for creation is over now and she should leave it alone. It's been eight years since DH was published.

This also doesn't really sit right with me. But I try to view it in the following ways.

1. Since I couldn't find (or remember) a dating when this became a proven fact, it could be argued that within the context of the books it has yet to be proven.
2. It has been heavily downplayed/ignored by Pureblood parties as this is against their rhetoric (citation needed). Much like the Heliocentric vs. Geocentric theories

#+begin_quote
  I think in some way, it belongs more to its fans than to JKR now
#+end_quote

I strongly disagree. The fan owns their experience with JKRs stories, but the story itself is unquestionably JKRs. And as such I feel that it would be within her rights to do whatever with it. I detest retcons but I still feel that it is within her rights to do so.

#+begin_quote
  Despite having written the series, I think the time for creation is over now and she should leave it alone.
#+end_quote

Again I disagree. The author should be able to do whatever with their creation, even if its just a sleazy cash grab. I would, however, prefer that any story told; is one that the author wished to tell for contents sake.

** I think that the age at which muggleborns are introduced to magical society could become one. Lowering the age of introduction for the family would help keep wizarding culture intact (the kids would have the idea that magic is real through their primary schooling, so they wouldn't be so set on something like house elf rights maybe). However, one can argue that the mixture of both worlds on a child (<=8 yrs old) and their family could be detrimental to the child's development - that their minds cannot separate the two worlds adequately (due to the secrecy).

Think about putting someone from today even a hundred years back in time. It's certainly an interesting dynamic of old vs new that could very well be possible.
