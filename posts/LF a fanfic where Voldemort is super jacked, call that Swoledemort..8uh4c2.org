I want to see an AU where instead of being an emaciated noseless little snake-man, Tom Riddle emerges from the cauldron buffer than an entire Mr. Universe competition.

In all seriousness, I swear I read a fic once where Voldemort summoned a bunch of alternate universe versions of himself to fight by his side and one of them was a pro wrestler who went by the name "The Flying Death". Not knowing that fic's title keeps me up at night because even though I know in my heart that it was probably a garbage fire of an Edgey Brutal Overpowered Lord Harrison Potter-Evans-Verres-Black-Slytherin-Peverell Magical Cores fic, I still really want to read goofy nonsense about a swole Voldemort. If you know that fic, or any others involving Voldemort being able to crush Hagrid's head like a sparrow's egg between his thighs, I would be super grateful.
