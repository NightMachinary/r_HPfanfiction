Any of you lot know of any fics where Ron and Harry go to the ball together and have a good time.

I don't mind slash, so they could be going as bro's or as actual romantic interests.

Thanks in advance!


** YES!!! :) THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE EVER!!! :) :) It is also still one of my top ten favorite harry potter fanfics in general. :) Yes it is so good and wholesome the whole way through and I love it is just so relaxing and happy!

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happens during 4th year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groans out the important question, "Why can't we just go together?" - Pure Harry/Ron fluff for a 5 AU Headcanons prompt.

**** :o Maybe. I think the text on AO3 is larger and that makes it look longer? FF.net text is always super thin and smooshed to me!

***** I had nothing better to do so I checked.

"Oliver Wood had kept trying to..." This sentence is only in AO3.

Lee and Angelina narrating the ball is also only in AO3. And the foot joke from Cedric and Cho as well.
