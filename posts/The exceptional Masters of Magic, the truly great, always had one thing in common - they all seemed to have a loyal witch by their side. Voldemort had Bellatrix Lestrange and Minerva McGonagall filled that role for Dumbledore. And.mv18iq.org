I will die for my dogs, but I would never put them in the same level as my human friend who I would mock when they fall into a hole, because it would be disrespectful and degrading to their humanity.

** This strikes me as a bit... unintentionally sexist and homophobic. Sexist because it seems to indicate that a witch's natural place is as a sidekick to a powerful man, never achieving power of their own. Homophobic because Dumbledore's closest partnership was with Grindelwald, not Minerva McGonagall, who was several generations younger than him and a follower of his, not really a partner. Positioning McGonagall in this way feels like an attempt to force a heterosexual dynamic.

*** I honestly hadn't thought about it like that and if it comes across that way then I do apologize. But I don't really think it does.

I never said it had to be a man, really, I simply provided the examples that Canon gave. Id have absolutely no problem with, say, Morgan Le Fay having a loyal male side-kick by her side back in her own time.

Also, homophobic? Where did that come from? I never implied anything about attraction at all.

But yeah, apologies again if it came across as offensive, it was never intended to be so.

New AU where the witches have the ability to "give" Magic to a chosen male, and the strenght of a Wizard is determined by the size of his Harem.

. . . It would make such a terrible story I'm surprised it doesn't already exist.

**** Funny you should say that, considering that it does exist...

In the /Firebird Trilogy/, witches established a dystopian matriarchy to prevent exactly this uber-wizard scenario.

**** Oh, it does... well, perhaps not /exactly/ like that, but definitely stories where Harry's wizard power are somehow related to a harem. (My recollection in the 2-3 stories I can think of is that they're both around some sort of timed element too -- Harry has to have sex with a bunch of women pronto or else bad things will happen... but if he does, he gets magical bonus points somehow.)

Generally a crack fic scenario.
