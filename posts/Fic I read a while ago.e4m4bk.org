Hello. Some time ago I read a fanfic (unfortunately I lost my name) from the Severus Snape.

Basically he survived the final battle and became director of Hogwats, and he became friends with Harry. In that same fanfic Dora, Remus and Fred had survived and in the end Remus was hired as a DADA teacher.
