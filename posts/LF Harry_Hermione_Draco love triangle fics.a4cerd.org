Anyone know of any well-written love triangle fics with Hermione caught between Harry and Draco's affections? I prefer post-Hogwarts, but it doesn't have to be.


** To Bad, no one has asnwered your request with a relevant Rec. I would be interested too.

**** I do, actually, thanks for asking.

What I find more amazing than that is you managing to get downvoted on a subreddit that upvotes everything.

Congratulations.
