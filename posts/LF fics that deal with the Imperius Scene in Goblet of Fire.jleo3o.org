I've been rereading C'est La Vie and it got me curious. What other fics exist that do the 'Crouch casting the Imperius on Schoolchildren' scene in an interesting way? Basically, anything that isn't just another identical rehash of the way it happened in canon. I don't care what the rest of the story is or is like, I'm just curious about that one scene.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).
