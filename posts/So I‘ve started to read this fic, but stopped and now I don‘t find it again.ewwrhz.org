:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It goes like this: Harry travels to an Alternative Universe after defeating his own Voldemort. He meets his female counterpart, who is at this time between third and forth year. He adopts her and attends his 7th year in Hogwarts as a Slytherin after a talk with Dumbledore who finds them. He stops the Seventh Years from harassing his female counterpart by claiming she‘s his family. He helps her through the tournament by claiming that he‘s a seer. POV changes between Harry and female Harry. I think he is also addicted to some potion?\\
It is not Harry Potter and the Girl who lives, it is better even if the plot starts similar. Any ideas?\\
(sorry if my English is bad - not my mother tongue, reading is easy, writing is hard. It‘s my first post here)
