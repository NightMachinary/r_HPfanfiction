I ran out of fics to read again and started scrolling through my favorites looking for something to reread. I was a little dismayed by how many of these fics, some of which I've read more than a few times in the past, I just can't get into anymore.

The bashing is out of this world on some and the writing is horrid on others. I start to wonder why I liked them in the first place sometimes. Other times I can remember why I liked it, and how much I enjoyed the read, I just can't get past the issues they have and my changing tastes.

How do to handle fics that you used to enjoy but probably won't reread again. Do you keep them in your favorites to remember that you did enjoy them at one point? Or do you Marie Kondo them off of your list?


** I'd say that there are two kinds of stories you can't reread.

1. The ones which were fun, but the jokes/twists simply don't have the same kind of effect if you already know them. A lot of comedy fics suffer from this, because while they still make you smile, you aren't laughing at the punchlines anymore. Or mysteries where the tension isn't catching you anymore since you know how it will end. I'd still keep them around in your favourites, even if only for the sake of the authors (since Follows/Favs make your stories easier to find). After all, you still like the premise, you've just read that fic enough times that reading it again feels pointless.

2. The stories you can't enjoy because your tastes have changed. Maybe you've come to see a character in a new light. Maybe you have read too many examples of a trope and are now sick of it and/or the characters involved. Since you no longer enjoy reading them or are even wondering how you could ever enjoy them, I'd say removing them is fair.

** I actually just went through this problem. So for me, as for the stories I can't reread, I deleted them from my Favorite's List. (The most recent deletions were Hermione's Plan, and Notebooks and Letters, both by chemprof.)

****** Ooh! I've read all of these! And I unfortunately agree with you.

Especially about Harry Crow...I don't know what I saw in it.

I remember hating Harry McGonagall though, I only read it because my friends were.

** HPMOR and Natural 20 are the main two for me. The former gets into wankery so fast, and the latter gets boring about 5 chapters in.

** Depends. If I can remenber why I loved them (and it´s not 'I was obsessed with this trope and read everything I found with it.') I keep them, if I can´t I don´t. I don´t see why I should keep something that has diverged so much from my tastes and ideals, that I can´t even remember why liked them at all.

** It has happened to me with the fics I read wehn I had started reading fanfic. I actually can't even remember the names of some of them now. But when I do remember what they were about, I cringe. I've recently remembered a fic from another fandom I loved and I do know why I loved it and might even check if it has been updated, that is, if I can get over my shame lol. A lot of it has also to do with the fact that I'm no longer interested in certain things. Now I'm just waiting for my interest in HP to vanish. I don't know if I'd delete those fics from my favourites list, because then I'm bound to keep thinking about them simply because I deleted them. But I know I wouldn't reread fics that have the sort of characterization I dislike. I might read that fic once, but I just know it will be the first and last time I'm reading it.
