In Harry Potter, despite seeming more ancient, the wizarding world is always shown to be more advanced and superior to the muggle world. Are there any fics set in the future where the muggles have made huge leaps in technology, almost to the point like Star Trek?


** It was actually showed to be equal or slightly below it they live with a dystopian lawless government their stupid enough to believe as far as I know the 1 newspaper in the nation that anybody with a Brain after Harry Potter smear campaign can and will be bought the population is small and an american 6th grader could have wiped the wizarding world out in a year if they had Voldemort's power
