Hello! I posted almost exactly a year ago (about a year and a week, I think) when I posted the first chapter of my most ambitious project to date, Flutter. I am now posting again because I have officially completed it. What I thought would be maybe 10 or so chapters ended up being 16. What I thought would be about 60,000 words, maximum, ended up being just a bit over 100,000.

In short, I'm very proud of this accomplishment. It's not the best fic ever written but it's mine, and I wanted to share it with you all. I lurk here often, searching for recommendations for fics to read. I'm glad to be able to give back. Hopefully someone else will read what I wrote and it will bring them some enjoyment!

*Description:* This is a light AU that takes the trauma Ginny experiences from the diary a little more seriously. Ginny is the main character, and it takes place mostly during the summer after Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban.

If you read and enjoy it, and have the time, I'd love of you dropped a comment. Feedback, constructive criticism and critiques are always more than welcome!

So, uh, yeah. That's all I had to say. I hope you enjoy!

  The traces of Dark magic aren't swept away with a summer and a trip abroad. It leaves marks on its victims, deep gouges in their soul, and just being in its presence can irrevocably change a person. You can never really overcome Dark magic, only survive it and hope for the best. This is Ginny Weasley, doing her best.
