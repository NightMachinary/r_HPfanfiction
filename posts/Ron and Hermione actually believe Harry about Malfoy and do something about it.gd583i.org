6th year just seems wonky as a whole, but Ron and Hermione not believing Harry about Malfoy being a Death Eater was just out of character. Ron especially should have jumped at the chance to believe it. I want to see a fic where they actually do believe Harry, even if it's through a Logical Argument of Harry's. "Malfoy threatened Borgin with Greyback before and threatened Borgin with his bared arm. it's not like a Dark Wizard like Borgin would be afraid of a 16-year-old's bare arm unless it's got a Dark Mark on it"

This causes them to realise he's telling the truth and they actually stop the "Let's let Death Eaters into Hogwarts" plot, either by getting Malfoy expelled, arrested (finding proof of the necklace/drink being done by Malfoy and reporting it to the Aurors without Dumbledore knowing) or finding the Cabinet, Hermione knowing it's a Vanishing Cabinet and Harry remembering seeing it in Borgin and Burkes and they incinerate it, leaving nothing that Malfoy can repair.


** Here's my take on the premise, unfortunately in script format rather than prose.

--------------

/[In the Great Hall, Harry and Hermione are eating breakfast.]/

*Hermione:* [slams down her utensils] Fine! I honestly don't think that Draco is up to anything, but the Cruciatus crosses the line. Lend me your cloak and that Potions book.

*Harry:* Um... OK.

--------------

/[Next day, Harry is in the Great Hall eating lunch. Draco is conspicuously absent. Enter Hermione.]/

*Hermione:* Harry, we need to go to Myrtle's toilets right away. I'll explain on the way. We'll resolve this Draco situation right now.

*Harry:* What happened?

*Hermione:* I spent the rest of yesterday practising nonverbal casting of the Stunning Spell and brewing Draught of the Living Death using Half-Blood Prince's improved recipe (which, I would like to point out, Slughorn had validated in class, so I wasn't brewing recklessly, /unlike some people/). This morning, I used your cloak to ambush and stun Draco and fed him the draught. I've left him in Myrtle's Toilets.

*Harry:* Why Myrtle's Toilets?

*Hermione:* Because, that's where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. You're the only one in Hogwarts who can open the Chamber of Secrets, so if we leave him in there for the rest of the year, nobody will find him, and we can have a quiet year for once, without any inane mysteries to solve. Happy?

*Harry:* I guess that's as good a solution as any.

--------------

/[Late June of 1997, Hogwarts Express, after Dumbledore's funeral.]/

*Harry:* Hermione, is it just me, or have we forgotten something important?

*Hermione:* Well, it can't be that importan... bugger.

--------------

/[Spring 1998, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Hermione:* That was brilliant, Ronald! I had no idea you were so good at voices!

*Ron:* I am a man of many tale... What.

*Hermione:* /[with a sigh]/ It's a long story of forgetfulness and procrastination. Just leave him there for now.â€‹

--------------

/[Later the same day, Chamber of Secrets.]/

*Harry:* Open! Open!

*Hermione:* You're speaking English, Harry.

*Harry:* I am?

*Ron:* Yeah, you are, mate.

*Harry:* I guess Parseltongue was from Voldemort as well...

--------------

/[Even later...]/

*Ron:* Hshsshssshss! Shshshs! Hsshhh!

*Hermione:* Come on, Ron! I know you can do it!

*Ron:* Hsssshshshshs! Hshshhhs! Shsshsh!

*Hermione:* Don't give up!

*Ron:* My hongue hurh.

*Hermione:* I guess it was a one-in-a-million fluke...

*Ron:* Why dih you even puh him ih here?

*Hermione:* Yes, Harry, why did we put him in there? We still don't know if he was even planning anything!

*Harry:* Hey, you're the one who came up with the plan! I just wanted you to help me investigate!

*Hermione:* Oh, so now it's my fault for not wanting to waste my valuable time on your wild speculations?!

*Ron:* Honh ahgue oeh him. Mahfoy ih a phat.

*Harry:* That he is, mate.

*Hermione:* Very well... That Draught was exceedingly good, if I may say so myself. It should last another decade, at least. Plenty of time to find a Parselmouth.

*Harry:* Yeah, no rush.

/[Exeunt.]/

They eventually believe that he is telling the truth and after finding evidence Hermione presents it to Dumbledore only to be ignored. They decide to deal with it by asking Dobby to stay in the room during night and then take turns during the day skipping the classes.

*** The first few chapters are just a Hermione POV rendition of why she's always right and not-so-subtle Ron-criticism (not quite bashing...yet). And she didn't even apologize for the bird attack to Ron (Harry made a good point here). I'm also getting strong Tsundere/"I'm not like other girls" vibes from Hermione towards Ron (He's a git but I miss him) and Lavender ("Apparently being so focused on one's appearance did have a practical use.") Ron is acting more mature than Hermione in this fic which is a very pleasant surprise. Maybe because it's in her POV, but I don't feel sympathetic to her character at all.

**** I'd recommend reading the rest of the story. The great thing about this fic - and Importance of Intent, which is by the same author - is that characters can have flaws without them being bashed. I'm not gonna spoil anything, but the flaws you pointed out about her character are things that Hermione, throughout the story, realizes about herself and really tries to fix. Harry, Hermione, Ron, all three of them are dumb teenagers with dumb teenager flaws and issues, but they try their best for each other. It was really refreshing to me.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.
