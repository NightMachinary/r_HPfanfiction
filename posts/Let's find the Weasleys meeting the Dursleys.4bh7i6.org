Recently reread the whole ton tounge toffee incident, and want to see more of the Dursleys having to deal with Weasley madness. If the Weasleys confront the Dursleys about how they treated Harry, that's also a guilty pleasure of mine...


** They meet in linkffn(weasley girl)! That's the only fic I've come across that has that.

Edit: it actually happens at the beginning of the sequel.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED
