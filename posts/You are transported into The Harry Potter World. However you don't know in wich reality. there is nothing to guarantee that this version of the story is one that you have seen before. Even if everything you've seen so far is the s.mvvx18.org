** I'll just tell everything I know to Dumbledore. Either he's manipulative and would use legilimancy on me anyway so keeping it to myself is useless, or he's not and he's competent enough to know how to use the info.

*** Or he is a poser. But it's quite OK because then Voldemort is a prep.

** Depends if the world follows basic causality rules. As in, can I conclude that if Action A happens, then Dicrect Consequence C will also happen, unless changed by another event (E).

But most likely? I'd move to 'Murica, take a loan, pull up the tech schematics I have downloaded on my mobile to create a prototype of my laptop - using 2009 technology.

I then use a non-emergency avenue of contact to sell the newly created computational powerhouse to the military.

With my status as a golden goose secured, I spend the rest of my life in comfort, pirating other inventions and media.

** How old am I? Boy or girl? Do I have a family? If yes are they muggle, half/half or pureblood? How much money/stuff do I have access to? What house am I in? Who am I friends with?

Need some/all of that info to even begin making plans. That said... as soon as possible I get one or more house elves to bond with me (assuming I don't have my own already). Then I head to the RoMT and clean house. All the books go into a portable library/trunk. Anything valuable goes in also, sorted into "shit to sell for mad galleons" "shit to keep and use" and "shit useful as gifts." The horcrux goes into storage until needed or until I can get the RoR to help me cleanse the diadem. Vanishing cabinet put out of reach of Draco_plans.

After that I would learn every last bit of magic available from school, house libraries, fellow students, etc. And I'd do my level best to hook up with as many hot co-eds as possible. Involvement in the war depends too much on my background.
