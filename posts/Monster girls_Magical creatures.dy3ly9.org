After reading that one mermaid fic I'm interested in reading fics that contain Harry with some sort of humanoid monster girls (apart from veela). Does anyone have anything like this?

****** The author is re-doing the first few chapters exactly because of that, she's been bombarded by flames from cunts. She started writing them over 15 years ago and changed a lot over the years, obviously. If you get through till after Hogsmead battle, it should be more accurate to the reality of the fic.

  Horcuxes were the pits. Dark Lords with prejudicial god complexes were worse. Ones that abducted and experimented on every magical variant they could get their hands on to 'enhance' power were enough to make Harry outright murderous. It didn't help that his girlfriend was a variant, and Harry really wanted to hang on to the only girl crazy enough to snog him. Dark Harry/OC
