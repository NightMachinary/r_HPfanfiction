Looking for complete FanFictions - no specific genre, pairing or sexuality - that involve Nicholas Flamel. Be that as a mentor, ally, or someone the Dark Lord Harry Potter decides to assassinate in his quest for immortality.

I've read this one - '[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7801230/1/With-You-by-My-Side][With You By My Side]]' - which peaked my interest in all of that. Harmony fics are nice, though it's a touch lacking in blood. Easy - kinda fluffy. No angst. I like it. But I like a lot of different things.

**** linkffn(2354771) No worries. Sorry I forgot to link the story once I got to my computer. This is the first of the Trilogy. No smut, the rules of magic are more like suggestions, and the true battle is against boredom. Now excuse me while I go re-read this series once again. :) Cheers

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** In linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat) Flamel tutors Harry for a decently sized portion of the story. It's not complete, unfortunately - but look at the size of this thing! Funny how I got to recommend this story just yesterday for a completely unrelated reason.
