In this story, Ron and Ginny die in a car accident I think and Harry and Hermione live together taking in their deaths. Towards the end of the story Harry and Hermione get together. It is M and I think it is at least a couple hundred thousand words. Anyone know what it is?


** It must be "Love Lost, Love Found". It used to be on Portkey, but that site got shut down last year.

Fortunately, someone backed it up here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPharmony/comments/5nee0z/i_come_bearing_gifts_over_6200_portkey_fics/]]

*** Do you happen to know the author? Also, I read it on FF.net but it could be on portkey as well.
