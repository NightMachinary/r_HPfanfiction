Genuinely don't remember anything else for certain, other than the fact that Harry went to meet Elizabeth Bathory and she was an actual vampire who bathed in a room full of blood to maintain her power and youth. She flirted with Harry during the scene.

I think Harry was either a vampire or aligned with vampires. Fairly certain it's an unfinished fic as well.

*** I don't think it's this one. I'm pretty sure it wasn't a crossover
