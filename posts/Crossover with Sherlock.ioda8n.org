A 5-year-old Harry is caught by his aunt having a midnight snack and his magic reacts to his fear of being punished. It kills her. Naturally, Harry doesn't see any other way than running away.

The case at Privet drive is tricky. They found the cupboard and Vernon got arrested but they have no clue who killed the woman, where the nephew is or if he has seen something that could help. Lestrade calls Sherlock. But then Mycroft shows up telling them about the royal ancestors the Potters had and that the Queen wants Harry to be found and brought to the palace at any cost. What kind of Harry will come to Hogwarts when he is adopted by Prince Charles and Princess Diana, being the older brother of princes William and Harry and knows how to play the game of politics? What friends will he have and who will be his "enemies" this time?

Sherlock's, John's, Mycroft's and any other age will be changed accordingly.
