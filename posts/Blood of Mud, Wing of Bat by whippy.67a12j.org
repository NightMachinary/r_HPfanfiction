Hey everyone. If you're looking for a fantastic HP fanfic to read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/593158/1/Blood-of-Mud-Wing-of-Bat][this is it]]. The author is simply brilliant. I don't know her and she didn't ask me to shill for her. I'm just sad that her latest update has received very little attention and I think she deserves a lot more.

Here's the summary of her fic in her own words: "Two decades post-Hogwarts, Hermione is married to Chudley Cannons Beater Ron Weasley and working for successful inventor Sibyll Trelawney. Then she is asked to work with Draco Malfoy. Can her job and marriage survive the test?"

It's supposedly a Draco/Hermione but honestly absolutely nothing even remotely romantic has happened between the two in 51 chapters. But as an avid D/H fan I say you should read it anyway. Hermione is fantastic in this fic. I've never read anything like it before. Looking forward to seeing other people's opinions.
