any fics like this ..? For whatever reason


** Are you looking for stories that Focus on that aspect, or simply stories where Harry never sees Snape's memories for whatever reason? Since a lot of AUs with a POD before year 5 have that happen, but generally, nothing much comes of it.

** Adding on to this request, I read a story at some point where Harry never found out via Snape's memories the work that he did spying for Dumbledore. He killed Snape in cold blood due to his percieved betrayal, and only Harry's significant other (I believe it was Daphne Greengrass) found out about this. She then buried this information as finding it out would destroy Harry.

Anybody else remember this?

** In [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=256173]["I'd rather be a Mudblood than a Mudbrain"]], Harry never saw Snape's memories and refused to watch memories left for him by Dumbledore, which led to him thinking Snape was an enemy.
