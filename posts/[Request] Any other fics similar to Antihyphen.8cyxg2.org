Does anyone know any fics similar to The Gray Maze's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7796463/1/AntiHyphen][Antihyphen]]? It's been one of my most favourite fics and I miss the whimsical nature it had. Angst is fun, once in a while, but it often feels tedious. Same with treating the magical world like it was a muggle world but with waving a stick. Basically a magical world that is MAGICAL. A fic that is not angst ridden (though that is not strictly necessary). And a fic that shows wizards to be more... wizardly. I guess. I like the more JKR's approach to the HP fanfiction and was wondering if any of you have any recommendation.


** I haven't read Antihyphen in a long time so I'm not /quite/ sure but I think you might like the currently updating linkffn(The Life He Leads) - it's one to keep an eye on and it nails the mystical side of magic really well, I feel.

*** Not quite. I like The Life He Leads, but it's not what I was looking for. Something more light-hearted maybe. And with the magic being more magical, rather than just a tool. Although he has that magic deer in that fic, which is kind of cool, but not enough.

  Harry Potter had led a quiet life up until his fourth year at Hogwarts. As a remarkable series of events occur, his life is irrevocably altered. Harry navigates the difficulties of the magical world, while mastering primordial magic and working to fulfill his true potential. AU.

** I haven't read /Antihyphen/ (could you give me a summary?), but if you've had enough of angst, I recommend linkffn(Like a Red-Headed Stepchild), linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor), linkffn(We, Harry Potter), and especially linkffn(Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them).

*** Antihyphen features conniving, crazy Slytherin Harry who wants to rule the world, a somewhat murderous, crazy Lily who might be out to kill Snape, Harry's apathetic Gryffindor twin sister who just wants everyone to leave her alone, and James who's just totally in love with all of them. Pretty much the only twin fic where everyone's happy. Sadly it was abandoned years ago.

**** I would not agree with that. Harry doesn't want to rule the world, just the school. Camellia is not apathetic, she's just shy. Lily is not murderous per se. She's just very protective of her family. James is just James from canon. Also Dumbledore is awesome in this one.

*** Antihyphen (there's a link there in the post) is one of those fics that treats wizards and magic as being slightly crazy by muggle standards. Magic is more mystical and mythical and generally mysterious. It's also a very humorous fic about a Girl Who Lived and her older brother (both James and Lily are alive, and Lily was a very ... evil... you could say person). All in all, it's a great fic that has great characterization and is really fun, I really recommend you to try it. Shame it didn't really go anywhere.

And yeah... The Elves one is a great choice. I read all of them, though. Thanks.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.

  Down in the Chamber of Secrets, as Harry was dying from the basilisk venom, something awoke within his blood, starting his transformation into something else. The destruction of the horcrux in his head kicked that process (and Harry's soul) in the nads. Now what are Harry, Harry, Harry, Harry, and Harry to do as a literal five-headed dragon?

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.
