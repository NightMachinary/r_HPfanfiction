:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm pretty new to reddit, and I guess I should learn how to freaking save my place because I was reading this amazing fanfic about Hermione getting stuck in the Mauraders Era after using the Time Turner and falling in love with Severus Snape (I know, weird and not my usual taste or preference, but it was so good - it's nearly made me a Snermione shipper).

Long story short, I've been reading it through the reddit app for like a week and then...the app closed and now I can't find it. Halp.

** The other bit was that the POV would switch between herself, Severus, and their daughter Aurora - who was a student during the trios time and had to navigate not telling them that Hermione was going to disappear.

‚Äã

Luna was a present character, and Malfoy was befriending everyone (which was honestly really cute).

** Go through your reddit history - it should keep track of what posts you've opened. In the app, it should be top left, then middle left. Might take a while, but it is very likely you'll like it. Definitely post it afterwards!

*** I was reading it through reddit. I just kept it open on the reddit app.

Starts at the end of the trio's third year. Hermione gets sent back 20 years and goes to live with the McGonagalls over the summer. So she starts her fourth year with Lily, Severus, etc.

It was an epic.

She was still in Gryffindor

She still used her last name

** Describe it best you can and someone will likely be able to recognise it.

In the future click the ... button in the top right (for android, other OS may differ) and click 'open in chrome' or safari in apple. That will take you to the browser version.
