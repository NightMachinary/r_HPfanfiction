** *I've had a good amount to drink and there is a dog that has been barking for two hours next door to my Airbnb as I try to sleep. I'm not in a great mood. Here is my evil version:*

And, it turned out that the one thing that Dumbledore completely hated, was Goblins. Professor McGonnagal would go on to swear that it was the biggest regret of her life, allowing Albus Dumbledore to "fix the problem in a jiffy."

Most of the students who had been waiting for a classic Dumbledore fix to a funny situation were dumbfounded by what happened next. Albus Dumbledore didn't convince them in gobbledygook to leave, create an ice slide all the way to the gates, or offer them all Madam Rosmerta's famous mead and laugh with them about their grand misunderstanding.

No. On that day, Albus Dumbledore was in no mood to put up with a species that had slaughtered wizards and his beloved muggles. For Dumbledore that day, using Avada Kedavra was too kind; no, he showed Snape the true ability of Sectumsempra, slicing the goblins into pieces. Their slaughter could be heard throughout the castle. The screams reached all corners and the younger students ran for the dormitories and the poor Ravenclaws had nowhere to go. Luna was on the ground crying. Hermione was silent with tears streaming down her face and Ron had buried his face in her shoulder. Harry was both intrigued and disgusted. For once he felt that Dumbledore would go to any means to protect him, but he also understood what "any means" meant.

None of the professors was brave or powerful enough to take on Dumbledore in this rage. Even as Flitwick ran to save his family, he had both his arms sliced off as Albus, his old friend, laughed in his short face, leaving Filius to bleed out.

"Swish and flick now, motherfucker!" He quipped merrily, "and don't worry, it's just a flesh wound. HAHAHAHAHA." Turning back to the survivors, Dumbledore showed everyone why Grindelwald had surrendered in their 1945 duel, cutting through them like a hot knife through a cauldron cake.

Some moments later, as most of the students stood in shock in the Entrance Hall, he appeared, walking down the grand staircase, looking at the aghast and terrified students, "All over. Don't worry, you can all go back to your dormitories; though I must say, there has been a little redecoration in the Ravenclaw common room. I hope you all like taxidermy; it's all the rage in West Hollywood speakeasies right now! That's where I had my summer vacation by the way."

McGonnagal made a terrified mewing noise and Dumbledore realised the situation and decided that no explanation was the best explanation. He began to whistle Kashmir by Led Zeppelin, and with a spring in his step, about turned, and jaunted off toward his office.

** "We have wands, right?"

"We are at a magical school, stupid!"

"Well, they don't."

And that is the story of how a group of twenty goblins found themselves floated out of the windows of Ravenclaw tower and dumped outside the Gates of Hogwarts.

*** We know goblins may have some wandless magic by how they operate certain vaults. Although it could be runic magic or something in the vaults themselves.

  â€˜Stand back,' said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
