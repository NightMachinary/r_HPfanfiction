*Same as the title, if you were elected to make a fake school in the HP lore what would you make & what decisions would you make for the school. Here is an example I made in my head at work and typed up on my phone when I got out. Feel free to let me know what you think as well!*

*Location*: U.S, around Sequoia and Kings National Park

*Students*: primarily North American students, although allowing for foreign students as well\\
*Name*: Eden Navitas

*Rank*/*Sorting* : Celestial Bodies -Suns, Moon, Stars, there are subdivisions for each house based on the merits and qualifications of the student. Prior to the school year or at sanctioned times of the year a student's magical/academic progress may be reviewed to be promoted in rank, however they may be lowered in rank at any time of the year as punishment if sufficient evidence is given that they deserve it.\\
*House of the Moon*: Quarter Moons, Half Moons, Full Moons. Value (Charisma & Intelligence) - Usually the most charismatic students, much like the Moon's influence on the earth's tides, they tend to have a gifted ability to pull others towards them or push others away due to their strong persona. Their uniforms are dark blue with a white moon emblem on the back and tidal waves towards the bottom of the robes.\\
*House of the Stars*: Morning Stars, Evening Star, Shooting Star. Value (Freedom & Idealism) - These students tend to value freedom and choice most, many becoming travelers who enjoy experiencing other cultures and ideals. Their uniforms are a dark purple with twinkled silver/gold stars all throughout the robes.\\
*House of the Sun*: Nova, Supernova, Hypernova (Resolve & Strength) - These students value the resolve to weather any distraction or condition and seek stability in the chaos of life. They may often be seen by others as the strong one or one that others many look to representing stability in their lives. Their uniforms are a dark nebula red with a bronze/gold sun in the center and light rings radiating towards the edges of the robe.\\
*Sorting*: students are sitting on the floor in the middle of a room inside a large sequoia tree. On the inside ceiling and what appears to be the inside of a magical planetarium/orrery. The cosmic map in the room shifts until the light of whichever house's celestial body begins to shine while the others dim. The light radiates down on the students bathing them in that a glow corresponding to the house. They are then given the robes for whichever house they have been elected too.\\
*Pros-* The school specializes in how the cosmos may influence a wizard/witch or magical being\\
& tried to understand the nature of magic beyond earth. As such they have leading experts on being such as werewolves who are influenced by the moon and they are even welcomed there as students if they submit to supervision.

*Cons-* the school has a reputation of a meritocracy as students of higher ranks generally are given more influence, respect, and privileges than those of lower rank.

There is obviously more I could do and plenty of stuff I could fix like the subdivisions of the house if the sun is not quite matching up with it properly, but this was a fun first draft to break up the monotony of work. Sorry for any format mistakes. I typed this on mobile. What schools would you make? You can add or detract as much information as you'd like though I think it'd be interesting if you said why you'd pick what you did!


** My fianc√© started to think of ideas for an HP fanfic set in America but decided he waved to change so much that it was worth taking the extra time to just make it his own story. We are creating a magical school in Colorado that is a mix of a boarding and day school with more opportunities to go home.

** I made not one but two magic schools a long time ago while brainstorming during empty classes instead of doing homework:

1-) Tigadissi Institude of The Arcane

Location: Under the Red Sea, From the Coast of Yemen.

Organization: Tigadissi teaches their students for 12 years instead of the standart 7 years of ICW. Students are separated by gender, but there are no houses. Tigadissi allows an extra ten years of research time for those who wish to study wandlore and Alchemy.

Accepts Students From: North Africa, East Africa, Arabia and Indian Ocean Islands.

Famous Graduates: Herpo the Foul, King Solomon.

Other: Oldest school of magic in the world, constructed by ancient kings of Punt(a legendary state in east africa) around 3500 BC.

First wands were invented in Tigadissi, These first wands were carved from ivory of thousands of years old elephants and filled with clay made from phoenix ash and griffin blood for a core. Tigadissi, to this day owns the only public works on wandlore.

Since the burning of Library of Alexandria, most magical works in the library have been relocated to Tigadissi, giving the school, worlds third largest magical library in the world.

--------------

2-) Shehrazabad Academy of Magical Arts

Location: Hindukush Mauntains, Afghanistan.

Accepts Students From: India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, Bengladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan.

Organization: Shehrazabad teaches their students for the standart 7 years of the ICW. Students are sorted in their fourth year to one of three houses depending on their favored subjects. House of Umay takes up those that are good at hands on magics like herbology and Potions. House of Agni takes up those that are good at spell based magics such as charms and transfiguration. House of Mazda takes up those that are good at calculation based magics such as Arithmancy and Enchanting. Students are then educated further in the advanced forms of their respective fields.

Famous Graduates: Avicenna, Guru Lahimyo.

Other: Constructed around the School, and perhaps much more impressing than the refurnished old buddhist temple that makes up the main part of the school, is the city of Zinjabad, largest purely magical settlement on earth with an impressive 3 million population( all of afghanistans magical population and a chunk of pakistans).City is self sufficent, holding parks, zoos, libraries, temples, farms, even an army of 16000 strong hitwitches and hitwizards.

Shehrazabad is famous for pioneering the field of arithmancy and separating it from divination. The three domed ceiling of the main entrance is enchanted to show the sky, much like hogwarts. However, these domes use the weather patterns to predict future threats to the school and the city through complex arithmantic calculations. Revelations given from this calculations have saved the city from being sacked twice by mongols, and once by mughals.

Shehrazabad is the only magical school that is technically polylingual. There is an ancient enchantment over the school, carved into its very bricks. This enchantment automatically translates any language to listeners mothertongue. Parselmouths are known to hear everything in Parseltongue.

** Akren Mountain School of Magic from Miranda Flairgold's "A Second Chance at Life" series.

Linkffn(A Second Chance at Life)

You've obviously thought a lot about this. Write a fanfic where Harry goes to this school after 5th or 6th year.

You got this!
