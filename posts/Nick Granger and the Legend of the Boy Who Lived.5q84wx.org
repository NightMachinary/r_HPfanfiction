It's a story about Harry being raised by someone else other than the Dursleys.

** At least give us some incentive to read your story. Your title is bland and doesn't draw me in so I'm not going to bother reading it until you put in some effort to actually grab our attention.

**** I think you're misinterpreting what they are asking of you. I think they are asking for an overview of the story.

***** Oooh okay. I'm sorry I thought they might just be mad for linking a self rec.

Basically it's a story of Harry being adopted by Hermione's aunt and uncle and living in the States under a different til he got his Hogwarts letter. He goes to Hogwarts, quickly learns to distrust Dumbledore-who wants to keep Harry Potter's existence a secret. He's sorted into Slytherin where he's an outcast and works with his siblings and friends in Gryffindor to uncover more information about the Boy Who Lived and what it has to do with him.
