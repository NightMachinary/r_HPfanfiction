Like the magical equivalent of North Korea or whatever. Reading that stuff is a bit of a guilty pleasure for me.

*** Yah, a lot of fics with Independent!Harry tend to treat magical Britain as being backwards.

Unfortunately, the only thing that comes to mind right now is a short aversion in a short one-shot in a collection; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8527691/13/An-Incomplete-Potter-Collection][Tom Riddle goes travelling around the world and discovers that despite how sucky magical Britain is, it's still a forerunner culturally and morally speaking.]]

**** but those never make the rest of the magical world better. if britain is a backwater than would the rest of the magical world not be? I was actually going to post a request for fics where the rest of the magical world is acknowledged as superior to britain (except maybe china or russia because communism.) and that is actually used so i'm just going to leave this nugget here which will manipulate you into thinking about that /one/ fic you read

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)
