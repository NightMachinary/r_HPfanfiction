HP has been around for over twenty years at this point and HP fanfiction has been around for almost as long, creating quite a large number of stories along the way. Clearly, out of that huge number of stories there's usually a handful that are recommended over and over again. What are some of the ones you consider "foundational" to the fandom? Either as a starting point or essential reading for a certain take on Harry, a pairing, a genre, etc.

Edit: We all know that a lot of the older stories aren't really that great in hindsight or at least have their problems, I was looking at this more of a compilation exercise. I think it'd be interesting to see all of the foundational/influential fics in one place. It's kind of a big picture view of the fandom and I think, especially for older readers, it'd be interesting to see where we came from. And for newer readers they may see fics they didn't know about or learn where some of the common tropes and such started.


** If you are looking for anything like a compilation or history of the fandom, you also need to include notes about how old it actually is, having started while the series was still going on. This may seem like a minor points, but it definitely has its effects.

For example, fics set around OotP are extremely popular/widespread in large part because there was a push to create fic that saved Sirius Black from dying after that book came out ( and then later using that death to lead into Lord Potter/Black inheritance sorts of fiction).

And while Severus Snape has long been well established as to who he is, for fics that are old enough, the question was genuinely open given the reveal didn't happen til DH. So what may seem as Snape bashing in older fics is actually a completely legitimate take given the information available at the time.

As others have stated, truly foundational fic tends to seem somewhere between boring and cliche as others have taken the good bits and done them to death. But any compilation of foundational fic needs to include Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. If it wasn't the first Peggy Sue Harry Potter fic, it's the one that established that part of the fandom linkffn(2636963)

If you want something to show to new readers, to show what fanfiction can be I wouldn't go with particular ideas or tropes. Indeed the one I'd pick is even canon compliant- Cauterize linkffn(4152700)

** The big issue with the foundational fics is that in their time the ideas they were based on were still fresh and interesting to read. Shopping trip for new clothes, inheritance test at Gringotts and love potions by the Weasleys were a novelty. Those ideas interested so much that the often subpar writing that went along with it was forgiven. Nowadays when those same old plots resurface the quality of the writing hardly matters since those ideas are so worn out already.

*** Okay so here's my question, then. Let's say you've got someone who's new to fanfic in general, and HP fanfic in particular. It's all new to them so they're not tired of the "same old" stuff because it's not old to them.

What are three or four stories with ideas that have been done to death, but if you slapped a fresh coat of paint on them, made the quality of the prose actually /good/, and tightened up the stories considerably you could end up with a really serviceable quality read for those new to the fandom?

**** I personally enjoy stuff by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie]] in that regard. It's not too complicated, some interesting takes on the old reliable tropes and most importantly completed stories. It's a good place to start for an introduction to fanfics.

I also am of the personal belief that despite it not being the best-written fanfiction anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]] should be read before you dive too deep in fanfiction. Once you've read better fanfics it becomes way harder to enjoy it since those fics are mostly the standard tropes. The bonus is that there's a lot of it and it's easy to read. I rarely recommend a robst story since it's not for the more experienced reader, but for starting out it's a good foundation. So it's more that you read it at the start or not at all. Bonus is that there also a lot of completed stories.

I think there are more authors that kinda fill in this hole. Not being the best, but in many ways did lay the path for other authors. For instance if you want to read multi fics then you have to read linkffn(The Harem War) which starts of far from a literary masterpiece and goes downhill from there, but still is such an essential fic in the trope (in my opinion). Those kinds of fics are maybe best to read now before you are spoiled by better fics.

Both authors write novel-length fics and that's generally what people want when they start reading fanfics.

A lot of fics that I would recommend are not beginner fics, so they don't fit into this category. There are undoubtedly good fics out there that are also good places to start out.

** I agree that many old stories don't read well, but there are definitely a few which got attention through writing quality rather than hitting on a popular theme.

linkffn(By the Divining Light by enembee) is still one of my favorite stories in the fandom---really, most things by enembee are going to be good. This story in particular isn't necessarily unique in any specific way, but it's my favorite example of his writing and he's quite active on DLP, which has had a major effect on the fandom.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time by joe6991) is the only story I know which plays a godlike Harry straight and isn't awful.

linkffn(The Strange Disappearance of SallyAnne Perks by Paimpont) is a great story in a similar style to canon, a self-contained mystery.

linkffn(Latet Anguis in Herba by Slide) is still one of the best stories featuring Slytherin characters around.

All of these are from 2010 or earlier. Looking at more recent fics,

linkffn(Stages of Hope by kayly silverstorm) is one of the better dimension-travel fics I'm aware of, a very prominent genre in the fandom.

linkffn(The Green Girl by Colubrina) is the best Dramione fic I've read. If you despise the pairing, I doubt it will change your opinion, but I usually hate fics which even approach Death Eater apologism and still think it's worth reading. Pygmalion is probably the more popular of their stories, but I prefer this one (been a while since I read it, so take this with a grain of salt).

We need to fit some humor in here, so I'll mention linkffn(Professor Riddle and the Quest for Tenure by Zalgo Jenkins). I don't see this recommended a lot, which is a travesty.

Also humor is linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus by CarnivorousMuffin). Their stories are a practically a genre on their own, but this is the classic. Some people love it, some people don't---you'll probably be able to find out which category you land in within a few thousand words.

linkffn(Emperor by Marquis Black) is the only large-scale Muggle/wizard interaction story I've ever enjoyed.

And just because I feel like I haven't made a successful comment if I haven't shilled for inwardtransience, linkffn(To Reach Without by inwardtransience) is a gender-switch story done right. The only one I know of, actually---Son of Potter, Daughter of Black and Season of Change are the two other big ones I know of, and they're both disappointing in one way or another.

I usually don't like posts which just throw out a bunch of titles, but I guess I belong to the dark side now.

  Clearly, out of that huge number of stories there's usually a handful that are recommended over and over again.
#+end_quote

I'm gonna be honest here, most of the "old guard" do not read well nowadays. Many of the stories which shaped fanfiction (for better or worse) are outdated because their unique ideas have been overused ever since or because tastes shifted. The whole "Lord Potter/extreme bashing/Slytherins are Politicians by 11" thing used to be very popular a few years ago and while you will definitely still see these ideas, they are nowhere near as frequent as they used to be.

Let's demonstrate this with a couple of examples. You have "Summer of Change", which is a 14-year old Harry/Tonks story. And it sucks. It unquestionably has its good moments, but they are buried in thousands of words of pointless exposition, the whole thing is a powerwank of the first order and it uses a lot of nowadays overused tropes. Yet it remains one of the Harry/Tonks stories with the most favourites. And you could drastically improve it by cutting half of its wordcount.

To keep with the pairing, there is also the R-Series. Similar age, but that one is a 7-book epic which has Tonks deaged to match Harry. A still unique idea, has very cute friendship moments and a slow burn. Sounds good so far? Well, it also has exaggerated Dursley abuse, Andromeda and Dumbledore do absolutely nothing about it despite knowing (Harry shows up beaten up), rehashes canon quite a lot, the OC friend tries way too hard to be special and again, it is very bloated.

And that trend is very common in older stories. Ideas have evolved and that often leads to situations where you want to curse the author for ruining their story with bloat or excessive bashing.

*** I'm totally with you. My example is that I was a huge Jeconais fan when I first started reading fanfic and used to think it was great, but honestly, outside of competent writing he basically writes the same story over and over again: powerful Harry, beautiful and perfect girl, and a threat that never really poses a challenge to him. He's still one of the "old guard" you see mentioned a lot though. He also started writing This Means War in like 2004 (?) so he did a lot to establish a basis for Super!Harry, especially with Legilimency/Occlumency and wandless magic stuff. Not to mention his stories were so sappy at times "Jeconais" became a synonym for fluff.

That's part of the reason I made this thread though. It'd be interesting to see what stories have survived in popular consciousness over the last several years and seeing which ones are good and which ones live on through a combination of nostalgia and serving as inspiration to "better" stories. I also started reading fanfic in 2007ish, so I missed the first wave of post-OOTP/post-HBP stories. I'm sure many of the people on this site started reading even later than me so it'd be interesting developing a sort of timeline of the fandom.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew.
