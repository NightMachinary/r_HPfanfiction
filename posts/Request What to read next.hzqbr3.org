I've re-re-read murkybluematter's The Pureblood Pretence series (I love the idea of the lower alleys), and I've just caught up with The Sinister Man's Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin (and all the twisting of the tropes! though I do wish the author's notes were shorter) ...but what do I read next?

Looking for something long, spanning (childhood and) the school years. Doesn't have to be Slytherin, or even Hogwarts. Although both these fics happen to have Harry's parents still living, that's not a requirement - I'll happily read orphaned/adopted/wrong parents Don't care about romantic pairings/ships (though 11 is far too young, and someone in Harry's generation in a romantic relationship with someone from Snape's generation while one of them is school aged is grooming/abusive/unacceptable). Preferably no OTT bashing, or non-magic AUs Complex, involved, and convoluted plots welcome. Evil people being creatively evil also welcome as Crucio can be pretty boring to read about. I love fics that take the original idea and expand on it, or ones which purposely poke fun at tropes and stereotypes. No problems with slow burners.

I've read an embarrassing amount of fanfic over the years, don't worry about reccing something you think everyone must have read by now, I'm happily rereading fics at the moment. Except HPMOR. I've read it, I while I didn't hate it, I found it a bit too self-congratulatory-aren't-I-smart?-(and-poorly-written) to stomach for a second reading.

ff.net preferred, as I use the text-talk function on the app most of the time.

Other than that, recc away

** I read The Venom Peddler recently and it was refreshingly unique. Maybe give that one a try? linkffn(13330853)

There aren't any pairings, and beware the chapter that's just a giant fucking author's note.

I prefer AO3, because in theory I can skip the author notes entirely. Download the story with Calibre's fanficfare plugin (skipping notes and summaries is a setting), put it on my phone and use an ereader app that can do text to speech. [[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prestigio.ereader&hl=en_CA][This one came up in a google search]] but I can't tell you how good it is. Personally, I read on a kindle 99% of the time and get annoyed whenever I see a full page of notes, or most of the first page is the exact same disclaimer that I've seen a billion times already. Hence the ao3 preference lol.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

*** Thanks for the recc, it looks interesting

I can and do download fics (isn't Calibre great?) and then use a third party app to listen to them, I'm just currently working away with only my phone and feeling too lazy/tired at the moment when fics on ffnet take no extra steps to listen to.

If you want to recc a fic that's ao3 or elsewhere, feel free

**** Calibre is amazing, especially for managing the ridiculously long list of in-progress fics I've read (it's currently at 88 - I really should check them over and move some to abandoned).

If you're okay with slash, then Of A Linear Circle has a twisty convoluted plot that'll keep you busy for a long, long time. The story isn't a romance, so even if slash is iffy it's easy enough to skip over the rare romantic scene. First part is here: linkao3(11284494)

And since you already use calibre, here's an anthology of the 'core' stories in [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J59EbRpWZ-7AVRq3CtpDbFpSZzAalOkw/view?usp=sharing][epub]], skipping the Ravenclaw, Gryffindor and Exile sections which are backstory. Part 9 (11 in Ao3) is currently a WIP and recently started being posted.
