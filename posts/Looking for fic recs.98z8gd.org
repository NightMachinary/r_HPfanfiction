I'm looking for any good fic recs with the Gringotts Goblins helping out Harry, enlightening him to his properties, wealth, lordship status, theft etc. Longer fics are preferable, I don't care if there are or aren't any pairings (het or slash), must be a complete fic


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): I have to say the Goblins were very cooperative and critical to his success here.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** Have you read linkffn(Harry Crow) yet? The Goblins there are so helpful they actually adopt Harry and make him a goblin Warrior.

  What will happen when a goblin-raised Harry arrives at Hogwarts. A Harry who has received training, already knows the prophecy and has no scar. With the backing of the goblin nation and Hogwarts herself. Complete.

When a more studious Harry Potter enters Gringotts with Hagrid, the Goblins managed to talk to him privately - Dumbledore never saw that one coming

I've been reading this in the last few days, it's not bad.
