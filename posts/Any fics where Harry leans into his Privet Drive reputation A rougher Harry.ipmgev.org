Harry is a resilient kid. He's tough, deals with things no one else has to go through but comes out of it relatively normal. Does anyone know any stories where he leans into his reputation on Privet Drive? Where as a kid before or during Hogwarts he says “Well if everyone is gonna assume that I'm a hardened criminal/hooligan/wild child, I might as well act like one?” I guess I'm looking for a fic not where Harry is “dark” or angsty or edgy, but where he's a survivor. Maybe takes on an Ender Wiggin mentality of winning not only the fight he's in now, but all the ones to come? Not psychopathic, but just a little rough from having to look after himself. Something that leans into the fact that an eleven year old child saw that his touch was burning a man alive, and put his hands all over his face to stop an enemy?

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in a non magical Sci-Fi AU. By the end of Year 3, he could already seriously rough up Vernon. This Harry, in its author's own words, is a "very dangerous young man".

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
