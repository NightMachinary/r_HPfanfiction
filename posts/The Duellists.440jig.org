My first proper foray into writing Harry Potter fanfiction. So far I've only uploaded the first chapter but any advice would be lovely!

** I usually try to work on one or two things each time I write a chapter. I pick two things at which I want to get better, and I focus on them with that chapter. I'll give you two things to work on:

1. Add content that isn't just dialog. Dialog is important, but it can't be the only thing on which you focus.

2. Add more content. The more time you spend practicing a craft, the better you become at the craft. So, instead of spending an hour or two on 2-3 pages, try to push out content >3k words. There is a reason a lot of the better fan fiction out there has large chapters. The more time you put into something, the better it will be.

*** While I agree, practice makes better, some stories need a shorter chapter. Having chapter breaks can give a good reason to switch perspectives, change locations, or just "fade to black" on something we don't need to be shown. Sometimes a break within a chapter is enough for this. Sometimes it is not.

An authors note I read one time sums it up nicely: shorter chapters tend to keep the energy and intensity up, while longer chapters tend to provoke more thought and drama.

That said, you don't need to stop after one chapter if you want short chapters. If the story is flowing, keep writing. A backlog of unposted chapters can help you keep a set schedule for posting, which your readers will appreciate. Plus, you can always decide to add Or remove a chapter break later during editing if it works better that way.

**** I can definitely see your point there as well. I think it goes both ways however. Some chapters need to be small while others big. It all depends on what you're trying to convey I think.

**** While that's true, I believe most first time authors are better off trying to produce longer chapters, as its more about practice and creating flow over a long work. Chapters early on in an author's career, so to speak, should be about controlling the message or section of the story they want to put out, rather than one session of writing. When I see 800-1k words chapters, for the most part they are all chapters that someone dedicated an hour or two and made. It's not a bad thing to dedicate an hour or two, but don't let your writing sessions dictate your chapters, is what I'm trying to say.

I'm not saying that there is no fan fiction of quality that has short chapters, rather that 9/10 times it's a sign that not a lot of forethought was put into that chapter. It usually means the person wrote for an hour or two and then posted it.

***** You do bring quite an important point actually with that comment. I tend to write small chapters because I just want to get something out there, which I agree is a bad habit.

I'm actually in the process right now of writing a chapter right now though, and I'm attempting to take more time with it in order to make it longer and in turn more entertaining to read.

****** Exactly this. It's not that shorter chapters are bad. It just shows a bit of inexperience, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it takes me a month to write a chapter, but I'm certain that it's exactly what I want to put out after that month. That's not always a good thing.

What's important is that you enjoy writing and keep up with it. Honestly writing fan fiction has helped me write in school and later with my job. It really is a skill that helps you in the real world, that can be improved upon by creating something fun.

******* Very true. I haven't done fanfiction before but I have dabbled infictional writing. They were always rather short stories though as I found it hard to condition myself to write for longer periods of time.

******** Do it in increments. Try for one that is 3k, then 5k, and work your way up. I promise it will help you grow as a writer!

***** I see what you mean, super short chapter (<1k words) really break the story immersion and are generally a sign of inexperience.

I think we may have been considering a different length when approaching short vs long. I take short to generally be in the range of 3-5k words. Long would be more like 10k+. The difference in reading the chapter in 5-10 minutes and 25+ minutes.

****** Yeah. Normally I classify short as 3k-5k and long as 10k+. In this case I was talking strictly sub 1k. I do really like your point of thought and drama being longer chapters vs. energy in shorter chapters. I may have to try that in one of my fics in the future. Thanks!
