Reading hogwarts houses divided and it got me wondering about a darker teddy since he's the son of a werewolf, a child of a marauder, and a war orphan.


** Curious.

What purpose does killing the children of Death Eaters serve? I doubt all of them were sympathetic or supportive of the cause.

*** One would presume he's snapped and wants revenge and targeting their children is crueler than targeting them.

*** Well, some Death Eater children might continue to champion their parents' ideology, such as [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudrun_Burwitz][Gudrun (Himmler) Burwitz]]. So Teddy eventually snapped and went after those.

  Teddy Lupin thought his fifth year at Hogwarts would be just like all the others: full of fun with his friends, work, and perhaps a bit of drama. Then the muggleborns started disappearing, and everything changed. The war might be over, but the darkness remains.
