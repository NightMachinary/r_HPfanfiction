I recently thought that a Discord for the subreddit might be cool. Would anyone be interested in having a Discord server alongside the IRC channel where we can discuss fanfiction and stuff? (I've received negative tones about this from the IRC, so I thought I'd ask you guys)

BTW, for those who don't know, a Discord is an online chat where people can hang out and chat.


** A) The fuck is a Discord?

B) I won't stop you.

** The IRC seems quite active.. but I prefer Discord over IRC. Not sure about anyone else though.

*** No, unfortunately not. I ended up creating a Discord for another subreddit. If you want, you can visit the IRC channel :)
