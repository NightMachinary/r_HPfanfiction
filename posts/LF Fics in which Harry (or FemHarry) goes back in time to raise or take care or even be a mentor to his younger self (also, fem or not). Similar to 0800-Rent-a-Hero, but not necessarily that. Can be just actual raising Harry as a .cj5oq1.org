I've read Intersecting realities and a couple other with a somewhat similar premise to 0800. Just trying to see if there's any new or old ones I might've missed.

EDIT: Oh, if possible, keep the bashing to a minimum, I hate Dumbledore and Weasley bashings. And even though I hate Hermione with a passion, I hate bashings of her as well.


** I'm gonna take a swing in the dark and assume you just hate fanon depictions of Hermione. She's great in canon and great in many stories where she's a main character, but not the protagonist.

Also, this list would not be complete without linkffn(Harry Potter and the Girl Who Lived by AgnosticsPuppet). Shout out to SilverAegis who was the original author. This fic has not aged well.

Also try out Linkffn(Holly Polter by wordhammer) which is the gender flipped version to this.

You might like Linkffn(Equal and Opposite by Amersion), which is almost certainly the best Harry/Fem!Harry fic in the fandom.

Lastly, Linkffn(I'm Still Here by kathryn518) kind of does this, but at its current state, Harry and his counterpart are just getting to know each other.

  fanon depictions of Hermione
#+end_quote

Not all of them, I love when she's just a good friend of Harry's, but isn't overbearing. I especially hate when they make her yell Harry's full name as if that's the way you should scold her peer. There's a new fic called Far Better things, in which its a great trio friendship fic (though its Hr/R) and that is the perfect example of a Hermione I love. Another one is from Grow Young with me. Its mostly because I find her personality, even in canon, a bit grating. She simply grinds my gears.

About your recs though, I've read them all. Loved HP and GWL, though the ending was weird as fuck.

I didn't particularly asked for Harry/FemHarry, it could've been just friends or mentor-ish kind of relationship, but I do like this pairing.

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them.

Disillusioned to Dumbledore's meddling in his life, when he discovers his fifteen-month-old self in a basket on the Dursleys' doorstep, Harry does the only thing he can. He takes the child with him.

Despite his influence nothing changed in their secluded society and eventually he just stopped caring. With Hermione's blessing he eventually decides to perform a ritual that jumps universes, and somehow ends up the caretaker of a female version of himself. Chaos, of course, ensues.

** There was this one 1-3 chapter fic where Harry goes back in time to be a teacher to younger Harry & Dudley. It's younger Harry's POV, old Harry ends up teaching Dudley to be a great cook and also tells his younger self about magic. Can't seem to remember the name, may or may not have been on AO3 or fanfic.net. Unfortunately it's not in my favorites/bookmarks so I don't think I'll be able to find it. Though it was a pretty cool fic!

Edit: Actually I don't think it's what you're looking for. Uh, sorry about that. May have seen another one tho, cant keep track of my time travel fics
