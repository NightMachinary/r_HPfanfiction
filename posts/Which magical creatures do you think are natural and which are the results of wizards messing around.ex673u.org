Skrewts: Artificial (made by Hagrid)

Hippogriffs: Very likely artificial

(probably all half/half mixes like centaurs and merpeople are artificial too)

Dragons: Probably natural magical relatives of dinos

Unicorns: I think artificial. There's no evolutionary reason to have a virginity detector, but it is the kind of thing a wizard might include in their creation.

Basilisk: We know it can be created artificially

Phoenix: Could be natural


** Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure unicorns having a "virginity detector" is fanon. They preferred a woman's touch, not virgins.

***** I was talking about the widespread and widely accepted mythology/folklore and whatnot on magic.

Like how unicorns are virgin detectors, and their horn can purify all sorts of stuff.

Or how you never thank the fae. Or centaurs are known for raping.

JKR accepts a lot of the traditional stuff, ignores a lot, and rewrites a bunch.

****** And I was just looking at the creatures in the context of the HP world. In larger mythological context, house elves are brownies... but house elves don't leave when they're insulted (or baptized, haha).

I'm just saying it's safe to say that HP creatures aren't the same. (In other words, not disagreeing with you, but looking at the question as one of what's canon/not canon.)

*** I mean, we also don't know if it's just human virginities they detect, or if they detect those of other unicorns too. The latter would be adaptive in that often gross natural-world way of infanticide and reproductive-organ scrape-clearing.

** I am quite sure that house-elves do not occur naturally. I mean, given their prodigious magical capabilities ( Kreacher just waltzed into Voldemort's cave), natural selection would almost certainly favour elves to be a free species, and their servile instincts seems very unnatural to me.

**** I imagine them beginning kind of like the Ood from Doctor Who. Living freely and utterly docile somewhere until Wizards came across them and modified them for their needs. Since magic alleviates the need for eugenics there, they'd quickly run out of natural-born House Elves and there'd be only the enchanted/modified ones left.

** I would say that any creature that can be used as a wand core is more than likely a naturally occurring animal, as magic predates wands, and it stands to reason that the original wand makers used the cores of the most naturally powerful magical creatures to make their wands.

I would also say that the creatures that are any kind of chimera (ie there is a defined separation of parts that seem to come from other animals; hippogryphs, gryphons, manticores) are more than likely a wizarding creation that could breed.

Everything else is a bit iffy, because things like basilisks and skrewts were confirmed to not occur naturally, but there's never any actual evidence for any other creature one way or the other.

*** I don't think it would likelt have occurred naturally, as it's pretty hard-coded into griffin lore that they fucking hate horses, and vice versa.

Perhaps some weird animal Romeo and Juliet happened.

Acromantula

Flobberworms

Cornish Pixies

Veela

Grindylow

Point is that some are a bleed-over from our myths and JKR's HP-universe.

So have fun and fantasize.

** I don't think /any/ of them are natural.

Since wizards rule the world, rather than centaurs or goblins or elves or giants or anyone else, I have to assume they came first. Everything else was made by them. They made some creatures as weapons, they made some as tools, they made some as slaves, they made some as pets, they made some by just random messing around, and they made some by accident. Some, maybe, made themselves (spontaneously or otherwise) - but only because wizards enabled something like that in the first place.

Unless wizards are themselves /also/ artificial, of course. Maybe all magic comes from aliens or something, wizards included.
