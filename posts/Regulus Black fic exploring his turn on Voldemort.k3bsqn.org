Does anyone know of a /well-written/ Regulus Black fic which explores how he got to a point where he decided to take down Voldemort on his own? He never even tried to reconcile with Sirius.

I am fascinated. But I would like it to be as well written as All the Young Dudes if possible.


** I have a suggestion but Regulus is not the main character. Love me like my demons do on [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26276281][ao3 link]] is very well written. It's James / Sirius during the war with Regulus turning to Sirius for help. It's the right time line though!
