The story should preferably focus on the actual teaching part of the story and not "Oh-Look-Voldi-is-here-again!..." if you know what I mean :D


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7619993/1/Calculation][Calculation]] is about Harry being headmaster. Sadly I don't know of any good fics where his teaching is the main plot.

*** First I thought this is going to be a serious fic but after I reached the part where Harry is being sorted, it sort of became obvious. I mean really? Not going to spoil to anyone, but don't expect a serious read :) Fun neverthless of course. Anyway, thanks for the suggestion.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7172319/1/The-Headmaster][The Headmaster]] should fit the bill. Its not complete though and the last update was January.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4464089/1/Yellow-Submarine][Yellow Submarine]] by Deadwoodpecker has Harry as Defense professor committing all sorts of ethics violations with a younger Ginny.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5386877/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Veil-of-Mystery][HP and the Veil of Mystery]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3129767/1/The-New-Defense-Professor][The New Defense Professor]] both come to mind. It's been several months since I've read them, but I think they'll both fit your criteria.
