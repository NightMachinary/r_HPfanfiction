... without bashing her. For some reason this kind of Fleur only seems to appear in fics where she is a threat to the main pairing and antagonistic. Often presented in combination with slut shaming for being flirty.

In Fics where Fleur is involved in the main pairing or when she appears as a main character she is always completely milquetoast. As in: Oh, of course, Veela are such poor misunderstand creatures, who aren't sexually promiscuous at all (as if it's the worst thing in the world for a woman to have an interest in sex) and she's just demurely looking for a life-mate. It's so boring and annoying. They are supposed to have a temper. I think the only fics I've seen where Fleur strays even a little bit from the typical love interest are PWP smut fics, whose authors are usually less stuck up (*).

Also okay if you recommend fics with other Veela that are interesting. No male Veela though, that's dumb.

I guess this came across as more of a rant, but there has to be at least one story that does something slightly original with Fleur, no?

(*) Honestly, there's way too many Robst-like authors in this fandom who seem to secretly (or not so secretly) pine for Victorian values.

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

*** Does Fleur ever say she doesn't identify as a Veela? As far as I remember, the closest we come to a statement about her is in GOF when Harry thinks to himself that she's part Veela. That is hardly a statement about her feelings on the matter. Heritage can mean a lot of things to different people, so an older professor's opinions are not necessarily applicable to a teenage girl. Flitwick never seems bothered about being partly goblin, but Hagrid is definitely ashamed of being half giant. Fleur could feel whatever the author wants her to feel on the matter.

It's an annoying cliche, but that's a matter of how authors overuse it poorly. Coming of age stories are all about young people figuring out their identity and can be really interesting, if they're done well. There just hasn't really been a Fleur story that's well done.

They are clearly based on the myth of Siren and they are always women.

My biology courses are a long while back, but I'd also expect them to be immediately wiped out. They appear to have no problems with inter-breeding, so how exactly aren't they immediately assimilated into the gene pool and everyone is like 1/1024 veela. Are you imaging some kind of secret veela colony where all the veela racists live who refuse to have sex with anyone who isn't a veela in order to keep the veela race alive?

IMHO it just doesn't work.

But you're right, canon doesn't seem to make it clear one way or the other, unless you count Pottermore.

****** They're not actually based on Sirens, but on, well, Veela, who exist in French folklore. They're all-female, too, mind, but they're also said to be the "ghosts" of young maidens who drowned themselves, so clearly theyr mythical background isn't much indication of what they might be like in HP.

As to Veelas being "bred out" into mankind... well, I get you, but you could say that of nearly all magical sapient species. Goblins, Giants, and probably Elves can all interbreed with humans (or at least wizards) with no issues. I think it mostly comes down to the fact that only a few weirdoes on both sides, in the cases of Giants, Goblins and Elves, are going to find the other species attractive enough to mate. Obviously, Veelas would be a more serious issue, but maybe Veela society strongly disapproves of marrying humans --- with Veelas being so much more attractive, they might see it as marrying "beneath" them. There may even be serious deterrents in place on the Veela side --- like a Veela who marries a non-Veela not being eligible to inherit their Veela family's belongings, for instance.

It makes perfect sense to me that Fleur would downplay how much veela blood is in her, considering their society.

Male Veela sounds just as nonsensical to me as... male Amazons. But I'm probably strongly biased against the concept by all the ridiculous "Draco is a male veela and desperately needs to boink Harry" fics.

*** I very much like this story. The story can be too much tell than show at times, but overall the quality of the story I would put at the 90th percentile of HP multiship fanfics. I also like that Veela, being non-humans, will only submit to their mate when the latter can dominate the former magically and sexually. And oh, he impregnated Fleur's grandmother, fucked her mother, and took Gabrielle's virginity, not to mention many of the Veela living on Hadrian and co.'s private dominion serve as his mistresses so to speak.

As for the pairing, I would prefer someone like Daphne instead of Luna (Luna can be done right, such as in /HP and the Rejected Path/), because as amusing as she is in the story, left alone on her own devices, she will get eaten alive.

*** Eh, allure immune Harry doesn't bother me as much since he's also immune to the Imperius Curse at fourteen.

What does bug me is that he's usually allure immune /and/ unimpressed by her attractiveness. Fleur isn't some hag that happens to project a love potion flavored brainwave. She's supposed to be stunningly beautiful, which (normal) Harry has no business writing off entirely. Especially since he was fairly shallow about Cho in general.

Also, "true love" granting allure immunity to teenagers is dumb. Older, experienced men, sure. But not random teenagers that have had a girlfriend for six months.

In my opinion, allure immune Harry is usually just a way for lazy writers to have Fleur interested in a younger man without actually doing any character building or having meaningful interactions before romance.

** I think the "Victorian" values are Americans since the whole purity thing is rather common there (together with some weird fixation on virginity). I think quite a few authors are uncomfortable writing characters who diverge from the "media ideal", especially when it comes to promiscuity because they fear their characters being called "sluts". You get that kind of review when you write sex-positive characters.

Hogwarts is a big school with maybe a dozen adults and hundreds of children. Realistically speaking, that would lead to sex, and lots of it. Yet, the only stories where this is somewhat accurately depicted are smut. Besides that, the Power of Love series is the only one which I can remember actually having a rather detailed Veela culture which is sex-positive. I know it had Fleur and Gaby as "good" and confident characters, but I am not sure how bitchy Fleur was. It takes some time for Fleur to become important, however. Has a Fem!Harry/Hermione romance with quite a lot of coming out angst (which seems rather ridiculous for characters to have after winning against Voldemort more than once) and a lot of world and magic building, but is nonetheless good.

**** That part sadly drags on throughout the series, although the Veelas are opposite of that. It just feels like the author tried to stuff everything from detailed worldbuilding and dealing with prejudice to detailed magic and sex rituals into it and lost track of the main plot along the way. After having fought Voldemort and the Basilisk, a pretty normal reaction to bigotry would probably be lashing out. Backing down to social pressure after slaying a Basilisk with a bloody sword seems like an odd characterisation.

***** The characterization is just completely unbelievable. He just turned 11... even if he were 16 I'd have trouble with him turning so feral in the midst of civilization. An 11 year old boy on the streets will not regularly be involved in physical altercations. He will focus on survival and running away, because everyone else is stronger and older than he is. The idea that he would regularly beat people up and curb stomp their faces is just so dumb.

Also he was in London during the 90s, not in the iraq war. It's completely over the top and beyond ridiculous. Look at how children on the streets survive in large cities with poor people like Delhi: they focus on pick pocketing, diversions for the older criminals or scam artistry. They are trying to blend in and seem innocent, not run around playing "gangsters".

Yeah seems like you are right. Pottermore is ridiculous sometimes. Hogwarts was supposedly founded in 990... how could Merlin possibly have attended? The Arthurian legends are supposed to have taken place in 5th or 6th century.

And yeah, maybe the Merlin from the Potterverse isn't the Merlin we know, or Rowling is just demented... Who knows. TBH, sometimes I think Hogwarts should be older, 1k seems a bit young for wizards that live over 100 years, that's only 10 generations, doesn't seem enough time to create such massive legends as if the founders were Demigods.

Perhaps, but the statute of secrecy is from 1689, so before that Wizard & Muggle tech should be on par. Hogwarts as a castle is already really pushing it, by supposedly being build 990. It can't be much older.

Edit: Oh and in regards to wizard live-spans... you're right, but there are much more immediate concerns about that in regards to canon: Why are families so small?! Where are everyone's Great-great-grandparents and hundreds of 2nd degree cousins, aunts and great-aunts?
