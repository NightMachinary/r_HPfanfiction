  Harry's now going into his 3rd year again & it's getting complicated. Sirius still escaped & Harry has to deal with Slytherin politics & some extra timetravel on top of old drama. Rescuing Sirius is the number one mission, but things keep reverting & Harry is worried he can't change a Thing. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 3rd in series. Rated M coz I'm paranoid. It all belongs to Jo!

** Well, two I'm currently reading that are in the third year of the fic would be linkffn(Red Sorrow by lupinlaughed) and linkffn(Child of Hogwarts, Part II: The Marauder Legacy by AimeretVivre). Both are fun fics, and very very long reads. Red Sorrow has a lot of angst in it but I love the premise of the story and the storybuilding that has gone on. Child of Hogwarts can get slow at times but the focus on Harry's life and relationships with the professors had he moved into the castle is a really fun read, and one I've enjoyed so far.

  Sequel to COH, Part I. Follows Harry through Year Three at Hogwarts. See Part I for the premise... With Remus Lupin returned to Britain and Sirius Black on the move, Harry, Albus, Minerva and Severus continue to adjust to their changing realities and prepare for an uncertain future... while the ghosts of their pasts refuse to lie dormant. Mentorship; Training; Adventure.
