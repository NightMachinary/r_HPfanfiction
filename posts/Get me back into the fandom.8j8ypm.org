I dropped the Harry Potter fandom a few years ago. The problem is, to my mind, its popularity. The fandom is /huge,/ and it's where most people get their start with fanfic. It has /hundreds of thousands/ of stories on fanfiction.net alone- I would not be surprised if there were at least a couple million across the internet. It's the one that /everybody's/ familiar with, and it's where most people get their start. The problem is, this means that there's a very, very, /very/ large number of fics which are, quite frankly, of very low quality. Don't get me wrong- it has many, many excellent stories too, even a small handful which I would go so far as to call genius. But if Sturgeon's Law states that 90% of everything is crap, that means that those gems are buried among hundreds upon hundreds of poorly written stories. But I like the world, setting, and characters. So, impress me. Give me the best, most well written fics you can think of with a solid, well thought out plot, believable characters, and well done world building. Preferably at /least/ 60-70k words, please- I enjoy doorstoppers.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][Reclamation of Black Magic]] linkffn(12058516) The build-up for this one was fun and some of the initial pay-off was nice. Some issues to work out since it's ongoing (Harry isn't fun to read yet), but the characterization for the witch coven (especially Cassie) is really good, which is a relief since they are the main characters up until recent chapters, where Harry and Hermione have more pagetime.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]] linkffn(11080542) by [[/u/Starfox5][u/Starfox5]] - Nice "wizarding world is still literally in the Victorian-era" premise, and the world-building was well done. In fact... at least according to my FFN app I still need to finish several chapters. Oops.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11752324/1/Limpieza-de-Sangre][Limpieza de Sangre]] linkffn(11752324) by [[/u/TE7][u/TE7]] - Not gonna lie, the ending was kinda pants, but the sequel just started so hopefully that's sorted out. The story is still solid.

*** Actually, Patron's basic world building idea is "The Wizarding World isn't stuck in the Victorian era". I wanted to create a Wizarding Britain that is in some areas far more progressive than muggle Britain, in others more archaic, but in all areas more magical. For example, the average wizards considers the muggles prudes - and the British muggles, at that. They have far different customs than in canon, with magic playing a far bigger role. For example, while the school robes look conservative, the robes of the average wizard or witch can be anything, from robes and dresses to clothing made of illusionary fire - and the more spells on it, the better it serves as a status symbol.

***** I just wanted to say, thank you and fuck you for introducing me to this story. It's fantastic- exactly the kind of thing I like. Well written, a solid plot that makes sense, characters that act like /people,/ interesting and fun politics, worldbuilding, and a powerful, interesting protagonist. I spent last night binge-reading the damned thing and gave myself a migraine that could kill a yak.

Edit: I do have a /few/ reservations, obviously. Putting Hermione in Slytherin is just... What the hells? How does that even make sense?

****** Hahahahaha, the reaction is much appreciated. I had a similar reaction when I came across RoBM. It was just so well done after I'd gone through a bunch of same-y stories.

Yea, I wasn't sure what I thought about that. I suppose Hermione could be considered cunning later on in HP, but the Sorting sequence did feel a bit forced, seeing as apparently you can't pick your House if the Hat doesn't feel like it.

******* Eeeeehhhhhh. I never really agreed with the perception of Hermione as /inteligent,/ much less /cunning./ She's good at regurgitating information and little else. She's not even very good at /researching/ that information- her approach seems to just be to throw as many books at a problem as she can and hope one of them has relevant information.

******** How so? There's no real way to be the top of your class and not be intelligent, especially with something like magic where you have to actually be able to do the things, not just regurgitate what you've read. I think the case of mastering the Protean charm one or two years early is an instructive example. As for cunning, my main thought was jinxing the paper the DA members signed.

********* It was very much an informed attribute, though. Yeah, she was top of her class, and a bunch of people talked about how smart she was. But she only rarely /displayed/ that intelligence. The protean charm is arguably one example. As for the paper she jinxed, that always struck me as rather pointless. Sure, they knew who revealed the group, but it was just revenge. If she'd been /clever,/ she might have warned them after they'd signed it. And again, it's not something that was displayed /often,/ regardless of whether or not that incident can be said to count.

********** I'm not sure what you mean by her not displaying it. The early spell mastery shown as soon as book 1, no? (pretty much in every class commented on (charms, transfiguration, potions), save for the flying lessons) Book 2 she brewed a NEWT-level potion (polyjuice), 4th year selected and helped Harry master all the spells needed to get through the tournament (especially for the 3rd task). I'm not saying she didn't have any idiot ball moments (I'd say even Dumbledore had such times). Anyway, I thought they did warn people afterwards? They just didn't say why not to do so, heh.

*********** An important aspect of intelligence is, to me, the ability to use available information and logical deduction to solve problems, often in unexpected or unconventional ways. When you give somebody an IQ test (which yes, I know is not a perfect measure of intelligence), you don't measure academic achievements, you give them a series of different kinds of puzzles and see how well they solve them. Hermione did not demonstrate this kind of intelligence. Her method of problem solving is, as I said, to throw as many books at a problem as possible and hope that one of them has something relevant. Throughout the books, Hermione demonstrated little in the way of problem solving or logical thinking- most of the ways she showed "intelligence" involved regurgitating something she'd memorized, be it a spell she's learned, the ability to follow instructions to brew a potion, or remembering random information from one of the many books she'd read. Her best showing was, to me, figuring out that the monster in book 2 was a Basilisk, and that it travelled via the pipes in the school- /that/ was an impressive conclusion to come to, given that (IIRC) basilisks in the setting are supposed to just kill, not petrify.

************ She literally solved a logic puzzle which (stupid though the idea is) would have stumped most wizards. That's about as close to a logical deduction as you're likely to get. Similarly, again, I'd argue the Protean Charm used to send secret coded messages in an innocuous way counts as solving a problem in an unconventional way. I don't think there were really any times where she just threw a book at it, most of the time she had just already read the books that had the information (yes she reads lots of books but they're ones she thinks will be relevant, as opposed to going for any old book). And again, you can't really regurgitate what you read to get a spell going well, you have to understand it (that;s why she kept telling Harry that learning the theory ought to help him overcome his block with Summoning charms).

It's no coincidence that all the most powerful wizards (and the most intelligent ones) are also the most widely read ones.

************* Are you talking about that riddle in the first book? Cause that riddle was easy as shit. And I've already conceded that the Protean charm counts. As for spells, we really have no idea how easy it is to learn them from a book. Harry's not exactly a model student, and we have very little information on what actually goes on in the casting process. What little information we do have seems to indicate that you /could/ learn them from a book fairly easily- it seems to be primarily a matter of making the right movements and sounds, and with magic, the movements can be shown with animated drawings. More to the point, learning spells still isn't problem solving or critical thinking.

************** There is no indication that learning magic from a book is easy. In fact, given magic is a thing you have to do it's not something that can transition like that, otherwise every student that bothered to read would be equally good but that's impossible to believe from canon, there are too many examples against it (Harry's issues with the Summoning charm is again a good example, he read the theory a bunch).

It's not just the Protean chatm, I already mentioned the book 1 examples and Polyjuice. Potions isn't just following instructions, you have to use spells in class for it to work (JKR said that's why Muggles can't make potions). And if spells don't count at all, then the only recourse is academic achievement. Otherwise whatever you mean by intelligence is too opaque since no relevant example will suffice.

*************** There's no indication that learning magic from a book is /hard,/ either. We have almost no information on it.

I've already addressed the book 1 example and polyjuice. Plus, even if we accept those- that's three instances of genuine intelligence over all seven books. The fact that there arent more relevant examples is my /point./ There are very few occasions across the books where she demonstrated a high level of intelligence- beyond that, it was an attribute we were informed of, not shown.

Anyway, I think we've gone on about this long enough. It doesn't look like either of us is going to convince the other, so agree to disagree?

**************** If learning magic by books alone were easy or even mid-difficult, most wouldn't find it hard, but the series seems to make it abundantly clear in classes that magic is rather hard, because you have to do it, not repeat it. Book 1 explicitly says this (paraphrase): "Harry learned there was a lot more to.magic than saying silly words and waving your wand" (which is what you'll primarily get from a book). If simply reading it was enough, Madame Pince would be stronger than Dumbledore.

There are other examples, those are just the obvious ones since they were some of her main contributions. This doesn't make sense to me. You're essentially suggesting that because Hermione isn't running around doing logical derivations when she's onscreen she isn't "really" intelligent. Her being cunning or not is debatable. But being the top of your class is pretty much unimpeachable in this regard. Being an "informed attribute" (which I don't think is true) seems besides the point, she's chiefly portrayed as the intelligent one.

***************** And yet book 1 also seems to demonstrate that magic is /nothing/ other than waving your wand and saying some silly words. When Flitwick is teaching the levitation charm, there's no discussion of anything other than wand movements and pronunciation.

Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Intelligence requires the ability to use logic and reason to come to conclusions and solve problems. If it primarily happens offscreen, or we're primarily told about it via other characters or superficial accomplishments (such as having high grades), then it is, by definition, an informed attribute. We're /told/ she's the intelligent one, but we are not /shown/ it.

****************** And yet all the other students besides Hermione (who had read the theory of the spell in the textbook) failed to do it, so Harry's observation about magic is correct.

I don't know what this is supposed to mean here. Whenever there is a problem, and Hermione is present on-page to help solve it, she does do so using reason, not just regurgitation. Since she's not the MC there's not really much you can do, this applies to any series but it would be seen as silly to say "Oh those are just informed attributes" since that seems to suggest it's not really the case that they're smart.

******************* Except that their mistakes were simple ones of getting the movement wrong or mispronouncing the incantation. There was /no/ mention of literally any element beyond that at any point.

As for her ability to learn spells from books, again, we have no indication of what that entails. It's possible- even likely- that it's just indication of a near obsessive use of trial and error- the reason it would be difficult to learn from a book would be that they cant clearly show the movements and pronunciation, so it /would/ take a great deal of effort to figure out how to cast, but it would just be trying every interpretation of the instructions until you get it right. That's not something that requires a great deal of intelligence, but it's /definitely/ something I can imagine Hermione doing.

Like I said, i don't really think either of us is gonna convince the other. To my mind, there are very few instances which I can recall that Hermione demonstrated what I consider to be intelligence- the only ones that come to mind are the Protean charm idea, and figuring out the basilisk. Her early mastery of spells is certainly noteworthy, but we lack any clear information on what exactly that entails to be able to draw a conclusion from.
