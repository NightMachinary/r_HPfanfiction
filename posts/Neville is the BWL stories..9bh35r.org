** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7u7jup/request_fanfics_with_bwlneville_that_dont_degrade/][I've asked the subreddit for BWL!Neville fics that don't degrade Neville or glorify Harry a while back]] and got very few recommendations that fit the bill.

I hope that you will have better luck.

  Ten years ago, the Dark Lord Voldemort murdered Frank and Alice Longbottom. When he tried to kill their son, Neville, however, the curse rebounded and he disappeared, thought by many to be dead. Now, Neville is attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, learning to adjust to his fame, and trying to meet everyone's high expectation of him. AU, obviously.
