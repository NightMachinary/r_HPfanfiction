I'm not talking about Cursed Child but stuff like Harry's grandparents. Why include Charlus and Dorea Potter if they don't matter? After so many years spent thinking they were James' parents, I have this head-canon that Charlus' grandmother forced him to go by his middle name, Fleamont, and out of sympathy for him, Dorea goes by her middle name, Euphemia. Since Fleamont (Charlus) was so rich and a pureblood, Euphemia (Dorea) wasn't disowned from the Black family.


** I consider anything written in-universe canon (story/in-world encyclopedia format). So, that includes Pottermore stuff but excludes interviews or tweets.

Headcanon is a different matter. Harry is still a parselmouth to me too, and Hermione is not Minister for Magic.

*** Yeah, I really don't see Hermione as the Minister. In my stories, she works in the Department of Law. Then she retires from the Ministry sometime around 2010 to become either the Muggle Studies or Charms teacher (I still haven't decided, so it's ambiguous), and after that she becomes the Headmistress, because true change starts with the children. (Oh and Neville is the Deputy.)

** Generally I accept that anything Rowling says is canon, assuming it doesn't contradict itself and then adopt whatever headcanons necessary to make it fit in my mind. Fanfics need not stick to canon though. I don't mind if fanfics get details wrong, especially if they're working outside book canon. It's not like I know all those minor details either. I still don't know how old Bill and Charlie Weasley are and there isn't consensus in the fics I've read either.

**** Canon doesn't say. All we know is (1) all heirs of slytherin can natively speak is and (2) speaking it is regarded as the mark of a dark wizard.

The second gives me the feeling that very few people can actually speak it, which I don't think would be true if it was learnable.

***** It's hard for me to explain. It just feels like it broke a pattern. Fleamont is very distinctively a wizard name, whereas Charlus, James, and Harry sound more common. And with three examples it starts to seem like a pattern, and you know how people like patterns.

** It really doesn't matter much because most of what I write is AU. Sometimes it is a small change, like Andromeda being the oldest sister, sometimes it is a bigger change, like disregarding the entirety of the canon plot past the beginning of the story. Deciding which bits of canon to use depends on what I'm writing. "No longer alone" is a GoF story, and none of the changes I made will stop the Tournament, hence there's the Tri-Wizard Tournament. But "Dawn of Darkness" is a complete canon divergence, so the HBP plot is useless for me.

I see fanfiction as playing in a sandbox. Most of the time, you are building a castle, but once in a while, building a submerged Harbour in a tunnel network is what you want.

** FYI Charlus and Dorea were never James' parents. JKR had said years before that James parents were "old by wizarding standards" when James was born, so Charlus and Dorea never fit the bill. Thone who believed that they were simply were wrong, even before the publication of Fleamont and Euphemia.

Anyway, my rules of canon are as follows:

Firstly, that JK Rowling is the only source of canon. Secondly, that officially released materials have greater authority than informal comments. Thirdly, that the written word has priority over other media such as movies. Fourthly, that materials embedded within a story have greater authority than commentary. This produces a hierarchy of canon as follows:

1. The original 7 Harry Potter books.

2. The side books (Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Quidditch through the Ages, and Tales of Beedle the Bard).

3. Pottermore and JK Rowling's old website (accessible via the Way Back Machine).

4. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (movie script).

5. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child (play script).

6. Merchandise materials created by JK Rowling herself, such as the Chocolate Frog cards.

7. JK Rowling interviews, tweets, and other informal statements.

The original Harry Potter movies are not considered canon here, as they frequently directly contradict the prime source of canon (the original 7 books) and they are also not written by JK Rowling. Also not considered canon are video games and merchandise not created by JK Rowling.

A word must be said about The Cursed Child. JK Rowling has stated that she considers this canon, but we must account for its nature as a play. There are certain aspects of the format which make it problematic. Over time the cast will change, as will staging decisions. These therefore cannot be considered canonical. Furthermore, we must consider theatrical licence. For example, during Harry and Draco's duel in Cursed Child, each one pauses to allow the other to cast their next spell. This is obviously not how duels happen in the books, nor how two people fighting would realistically act. It is a writing decision driven by the desire to show off the clever special effects on stage: the audience has time to appreciate the effect of each spell before the duelists move on to the next. This is fine for the stage, but it makes The Cursed Child's status as canon difficult. The position I adopt, therefore, is that we can take the broad strokes of Cursed Child as canon (such as the fact that a new type of Time Turner was invented with different effects from those in Prisoner of Azkaban), but that we cannot rely on the fine detail. In any case, there is not a lot of worldbuilding in Cursed Child so its canon status is not really so important.

Not much in the way of quantity, perhaps, but what facts we do learn are pretty major. The Greengrass Blood Curse, the existence of Delphini, the New Time-Turners, Nott as a magical genius, Lucius dying relatively young, Hermione as Minister, and, heck, the personalities of the Next-Gen, all that seems pretty important.

** Canon goes: primary media (books for Harry Potter, comics for Marvel, TV shows for Star Trek, movies for Star Wars), adaptations, official promotional material (Pottermore for example), and lastly word of God (tweets, interviews, and so forth). If it isn't in the books, it can safely be ignored, if it contridicts the books it isn't canon. The movies have a special movie!canon and fics/fanart using that should be labeled as such. If a writer wants to change their work they need to do so in the primary media or its just a fancy head canon.

** I accept Pottermore, JKR interviews/Tweets, and other extended content as canon-optional. As in, if I'm trying to figure out a thing from the books, be it family tree or the history of the Goblin Rebellions, I consider all potential sources of information, including stuff that could be considered apocrypha, like text on the game cards. Then, I use what's useful and ignore the rest, though I absolutely weigh what's in Books 1-7 far more heavily than the extended content.

I see no reason to amend your headcanon for Harry's family tree, since nothing in books 1-7 directly contradicts it. If you end up writing your headcanon, all it takes is a disclaimer that you're disregarding Cursed Child & Pottermore to forestall any complaints.

My headcanon is that Snape faked his death, and nothing, not even JKR can convince me otherwise :D
