I love betrothed stories and have read a lot with Daphne and other girls but I want someone else this time.

Anyone have a story where Hermione and Harry is betrothed from the beginning? Like Mr and Mrs Granger meet Lily and James and get to know them and for some reason sign a betrothal contract (political reasons, safety for Hermione etc). But when Lily and James dies they assume/get told that Harry is dead too and they forget about it and never tell Hermione, until she reads about him before school starts. Or doesn't tell her parents about Harry being alive. Then Harry discoveres at Gringotts that he is betrothed. Bonus if he discovered that he is a lord and that Dumbledore tries to manipulate him (I adore those stories)

Thank you!

  An old house sits at the end of a lane. Abandoned and forgotten, no one would have guessed who was going to buy it... or how full a life that old house was yet to live. Harry/Hermione
