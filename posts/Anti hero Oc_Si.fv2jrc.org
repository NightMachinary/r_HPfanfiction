A protagonist that fights against corruption or what ever the presented antagonist represents but will do things that the average protagonist would find horrible disgusting and terrifying such as soul magic, necromancy, demonic summoning, rituals and anything else your average hero wouldn't be able to talk about it without being called evil. I am asking for recommendations about a protagonist that will use any method available to them to achieve their goals no matter if its moral or not.


** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?)

Pretty much that. SI Voldie cancels the whole mudblood genocide thing as part of a general change of strategy but continues with taking over the country and doing crazy dark experiments. Like "Dumbledore said murder harms the soul? Let's kill hundreds of prisoners to see if we can measure the effect!"

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

#+begin_quote
  A Sith Lord ends up reincarnated on Earth with a few simple goals - make a fortune so he could enjoy a long overdue vacation, uplift the local technology for convenience sake, because not having a proper planetary datanet is simply so bothersome and pick up an apprentice. After all, someone has to deal with any new (or old) up and coming Dark Lords and the British Wizarding World.
