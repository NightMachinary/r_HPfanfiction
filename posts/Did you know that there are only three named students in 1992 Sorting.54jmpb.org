Ginny, Luna and Colin. That's it. Ginny even dates older students, with both Michael and Dean, and we never get a single name of her or Luna's classmates. There's also Harper, Slytherin mentioned in HBP, but he has exactly one line and no surname.

Now excuse me, I'll go write a shit ton of OCs...


** I'm writing a Ginny-centric story myself... creating OCs is both infinitely easier and incredibly difficult to write, which is annoying. I'm worried that having so many OCs will turn off my readers but, well, you literally can't write from Ginny's perspective without them. Ugh.

*** Fuck people who hate OCs. They assume any OC is a mary sue. I am sick and fucking tired of people whining about OCs. I was reading a story where every character was rejiggered to be used---friend!griphook was the most egregious---and i reviewed it saying they would never be able to expand as a writer if they can't learn that the "canon" characters they write are so out of character they ARE original characters!

** Had Harry been able to attend it, we might have learned more names but this series is about Harry and his time at Hogwarts, not the students of Hogwarts.

*** Nope. She is from the Sorting of 1993, although she may be born in late 1981 and be relatively Ginny's age.

*** I'm fairly certain she was a fourth year in Harry's sixth year.

** Sounds like a classic case of Chekov's gun. Rowling became a better writer between books 1 and 2.
