So I'm currently writing a Harry/Luna fic where the two travel to the Magical US. the story will be set 4 years after the war where Harry is a disgruntled (alcoholic) Auror who's been put on desk duty because he keeps killing dark wizards instead of taking them in for trial.

Life hasn't really gone the way he wanted it too and he's coping with the war being over, friends being dead and his job not being the way he thought it would very very badly. So when he eventually snaps Robards tells him he's being forced on Vacation for 4 months and Luna eventually shows up and takes him on an adventure to get the blood pumping (and sober him up).

What I'm asking is how do you think I should characterize Luna? What pitfalls should I avoid when writing her? Harry is going to be a lot more grumpy than in Canon and I kind of want Luna to play off that.

He's still Harry, he's just more jaded and drunk than normal, but I kind of want to avoid having Luna just be "Lol Nargles" I still want her to be creepy but I want her to be the character that really breaths life into Harry over the course of the story if that makes sense?

Can anyone give me some advice? this is going to be my first long Harry Potter fic so I'm trying to get some input while i work on the first chapter.


** Are you writing manic pixie dream girl, but gothy? Because if you are, maybe avoid doing that.

*** No. I'm writing weird and silly Luna. Kind of like Newt Scamander in fantastic beasts but less socially awkward

** I'd say Luna is at her best when she's aware of and understands everything, but understands it in a way very different to typical people. Basically, where typical people would say "1 + 1 = 2", Luna would say "1 + 1 = Window". It's still technically true, from a certain perspective, but will confuse anyone until they work out what the heck she's talking about (if you draw 1, a plus, then a 1, then draw an equals over that, you get a square bisected by two lines, which is a 'window').

So, if you have her approach every situation like she knows exactly what is going on, but came to a completely different conclusion about it than everybody else would, you'll probably get a good Luna.

Plus, sometimes those conclusions can be dangerously wrong and lead to her doing dangerous things, so that might help you get some more plot drama out of her too. :)

EDIT - Oh, and I definitely wouldn't try to explain her weird. Just make her weird and leave it at that. Explaining it always kills it, just a little, no matter how it's done.

** You can have a conversation where harry is drunk and Luna is sober. Harry asks her whether the creatures were a coping mechanism she created at Hogwarts because of bullying(general fanon) . She replies that she was like this since the death of her mom. You could go a bit off cannon in saying that her mother was a magizoologist and the creatures she talks about are what luna found in her mothers notes after her death. So if you still make the essentric luna you would have less criticism from readers. The reason some readers hate escentric luna is because the authors generally don't give a good explanation about her charecter. So even in a serious fic sometimes luna becomes a sort of a crack charecter.

PS what is the link of your fic. Would love to read it.

PPS English isn't my first lang so there may be some grammatical mistakes
