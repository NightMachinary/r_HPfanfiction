I'm looking for stories that focus on the characters discovering and researching new things. Their own mysterious superpowers like in The Perils Of Innocence, the intricate details of spellcrafting like in The Arithmancer, the muggle world like in Exile, anything goes as long as the main character learns new things and takes the reader with them on the journey.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
