I notice in fan fiction that people tend to go out of their way to point out how dangerous things are. Oh no, ghouls and monsters are on school grounds! Oh no, ancient artifacts are on school grounds! Oh no, deadly secrets are on school grounds! So many fics focus on politics, people's reputations, and bureaucratic power plays. Others point out the various dangers from the books. I'm rather sick of it. Politics are boring in the real world and in fiction. The wizarding world is filled with infinite potential for danger, excitement, and discovery. No one ever uses it. Magic is almost always strictly a tool to cement op lord Potter or lady Granger's combative superiority in addition to their political superiority. People keep adding rules or making the government a central aspect. It's exhausting. I've never seen a story where anyone says fuck the rules and runs off to play with magic. There is a silent rigidity with how fanfics in this community are written. Power fantasy or romance. Both are fine in small amounts but that is all we have. And they're all the same. You read one HarryxHermione fic you've read them all. Same for op lord Potter. He's either politicking or going off to be an edgy lone wolf. Sometimes both. The concept of magic is fantastical by its nature but it seems that everyone wants to pull the setting back into the mundane. There's a reason fantasy exists. The real world seems to choke away adventure and danger alike and it's turned the world into a rather boring place. Fantasy is an escape to a world where you could die. But you could also overcome challenges and succeed wildly. That's more fulfilling in my eyes than passing some bill could ever be.


** To be fair, even in canon no one seems to ever use Magic in even a partially realistic way people would use it if it was somehow real.

Other than a few really mighty trailblazers that are born every few centuries, that either revolutionize the understanding of magic or go down as mighty dark lords, the vast majority of people in canon seem to be content with their pitifully broken Renaissance fair limbo, or with lame power plays and bribes.

As for how prominent power-wank is in this fandom, I don't think it's strictly because authors are a bunch of 'edgy teens', like it's automatically assumed, it's because HP magic is incredibly OP, and the worldbuilding Rowling made was pretty much just for the sake of it, and thus anyone with half a brain would be able to abuse it to their heart's content. The Wizarding world of HP is the easiest fantasy world that I know of in which you can become ridiculously OP very quickly.

*** That's a fair view. I don't know about becoming ridiculously op quickly though. In the books people trained but by the end of the series it came down to a magic bull crap beam struggle. Harry does some ridiculous stuff early on but that doesn't really continue into the later series. What you're saying is actually a really good basis for a story. People are generally fine with the status quo in the real world and change has to be forced. Having your main mess around with things could be interesting.

  Politics are boring in the real world and in fiction.
#+end_quote

The only thing bad about politics in HP FF is that they are usually done terribly. Your sentence should read, politics are complicated in the real world, which is why only few people get it right in fiction.

But that aside, beyond asking for diversity and not wanting politics and romance, I'm not sure what you /do/ want. Towards the end, you seem to want more danger, but at the start, you're disliking stories that point out there is danger? I'm honestly confused.

 

Anyway, perhaps there's something in this answer for you: HP magic /is/ a tool. At its heart, HP is a blend of boarding-school novel and coming-of-age, set in a functioning modern state. It's not high fantasy in the sense of questing (and thus, learning to use magic to survive). HP-world is a mirror of our contemporary world, just one where people use magic. Adjusted for different norms of "safe" and "unsafe" (that is, looking at it the way a wizard would), HP-world is /safe/. Dragons live in reserves. Giants have been driven away. Criminals are locked up in Azkaban. The biggest danger is getting hit with a fine for violating the Experimental Breeding act. Etc.

And, to be fair, for me, while I certainly agree that /for the reader/ the wonder of magic should be there (and many stories achieve this, not least HP, the books, itself), a big part of the fascination is precisely the "mundane" -- or more accurately, very /recognisable/ -- world they live in, /just tweaked/ by the added magical component. Or the contrast between the two, anyway. The world's not radically different. It's not fake!Medieval Europe. It's modern, perhaps 19th century Europe, and people use magic. That's all. But that's also /plenty/.

And in line with the thematic space this creates, FF is written in ways that stays faithful to those original, most basic intentions. So you could ignore all rules, and write stories about people going crazy with magic and essentially write about anarchic structures and chaos and danger. But it breaks HP as we know it, and if you want to do that, I'd argue you'd be better served, already on an economics-of-writing basis, to either pick a different, more convenient source material, or write original fiction to begin with.

*** Fair enough. As far as the danger thing goes, I meant that people tend to point out how dangerous the book scenarios are and then use that as a springboard to depose Dumbledore or generally give criticism to the adults in the story. They're not wrong it's just usually done in a really odious way.

** "The wizarding world is filled with infinite potential for danger, excitement, and discovery. No one ever uses it."

Am I allowed to shamelessly self-promote? I've just started writing a globe-spanning adventure fic, with the idea that the wizarding world is basically the wild-west with magic, eg. essentially lawless and with more ways to get yourself killed than you could possibly imagine. I always imagined the British Ministry being so Orwellian and overbearing was an effort to compensate for that.

Lots of curse-breaking, tomb and temple exploring, and general mayhem. That sound like something you're interested in?

EDIT: Sorry for the delay, I literally /just/ published the latest chapter, and I wanted to finish it before linking it! linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28511457/chapters/69863514]]) Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13784563/1/The-Grand-Tour-of-Messrs-Potter-and-Riddle]])

***** Taure is one of the few fanfiction authors who is both creative and writes with a tone that matches JK and can write whimsy (well). They have alluded to being in the law industry and their talent for writing from that career is noticeable. In other words that are one of the very very few authors who writes in jk sandbox and you know it's still jk sandbox. (I love the sinister man hppos but it could have been built on any fantasy with the writing style)
