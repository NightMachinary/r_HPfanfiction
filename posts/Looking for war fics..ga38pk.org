Are there any fics that depict the absolute horror of bloody wizarding war? There was one timetravel one that had Harry and bellatrix throwing enough unforgivables at each other in enough quantity that europe thaught there was a war breaking out. Anything similar?


** Very little comes to mind for that. You might like linkffn(Weapons Free by angelicxdiscord), or linkao3(Seven Names by angelholme). The first is a war story, and the second is looking back decades later.

  We've been fighting this war for a long time. Muggles, they call us. They struck first. England fell. Then France. Spain. Italy. It took us ten years of tactical withdrawals and air strikes to stop their advance. Now it was our turn to push back.
