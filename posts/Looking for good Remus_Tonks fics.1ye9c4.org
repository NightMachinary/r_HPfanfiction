Especially that follows them through OotP. :)


** I'm not a big fan of this pairing, but this is exactly what you're looking for. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2712711/1/The-Werewolf-Who-Stole-Christmas][The Werewolf Who Stole Christmas]]

And the summary:

Remus manages to rob Tonks of her Christmas spirit, but helping her to get it back proves the catalyst for something a tad more lasting than a kiss under the mistletoe. RemusTonks romance through OOTP and HBP. Started before DH.

** I love this story. It defined my Tonks-Remus head canon, plus it has a dose of Tonks-Charlie near the beginning.

** Anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1613656/Scandalacious-Intentions][Scandalacious Intentions]] is brilliant in my honest opinion. She does The Marauders perfectly and she even does some AU with Remus and Tonks after the Battle of Hogwarts.

** Chelseyb's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7053607/1/Running][Running]] explores their post-OOtP relationship from Tonks's perspective, though you may not like the content. (It's not a storybook marriage.)

  Married people should be happy. New parents should be happy. War heroes should be happy. And if you're all three of those, you should be happy. You shouldn't be running. Post-war, AU. Oneshot. Rating for language & adult situations.

** When this subreddit was brand new, I posted a whole bunch of [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nknx2/a_collection_of_fics_for_remus_lupin_fans/][Lupin fics here]]. Most of them are Remus/Tonks, so you'll have quite a bit to choose from.

If you're only interested in finding one good one, I'd recommend Consequences (which is also the one cambangst linked in this thread). It's one of the best fics I've ever read. If you like it, [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/os7ng/tonksremus_fan_fiction_consequences/][my comment on its thread]] has links to several one-shots that round out the story beautifully.
