I know that some wizard like Snape,Voldemort and Dumbledore mimic it by using Legilimency to read there opponents surface thought in battle.But are there any stories were harry learns actual battle precognition as a branch of Divination?

or harry learning to do basic precognition while at the Durselys as a child to stop himself from being ambushed by Dudley and his gang during harry hunting.Like if harry reaches and intersection and Dudley and his gang have people waiting to block off Harry's escape on two of the paths from the intersection harry's magic will help him pick the path that is unblocked? and then have him get slowly better as it over the story.


** linkffn(8629685) Harry is a seer in the firebird series and at one point(in one of the sequels) learns how to use battle precognition. The first part of the series is pretty good the sequels are not as good and quite controversial but they are still entertaining.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Star Wars Crossovers are probably your best bet. I think I remember some precognition in these:

*** Yea jedi and sith are trained to use force precognition to try and predict their oponions movements. Its why fights in star wars are made to look fancy and choreographed both fighters are trying to throw off the others ability to read what they are going to do.

** linkffn(11759933) Star wars crossover (jedi have a battle precog) story, its pretty decent. author has a sequel up as well that is in progress now but it has dragged on a bit too long imo.

I know a few other star wars crossovers have precog as an ability of note as well but im not sure which ones off hand.
