I am looking for fics where Harry has a different group of friends. No Weasley bashing. No Draco unless it is very AU.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

Slytherin! Harry with Tracey and Daphne. Starts off pretty dumb and Harry is really Mary Sueish, but gets better towards the end. Still, ivery much prefer fics where everyone is working together and not trying to be angsty and go at it alone. Ron is sidelined but he does play a big part at the final battle of hogwarts IIRC
