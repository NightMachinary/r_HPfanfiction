Would like to read a more confrontational, more ruthless professor Dumbledore. Someone whowould go out of his way to remove people like Fudge from office, and replace them with either proper men f honour or at least his own sycophants. Someone who would expell Malfoy Jr. for bullying, and quietly liquidate Malfoy Sr. as soon as he knew about the diary horcrux. Someone whose willingness to play dirty and methodically wipe out former Death Eaters would compel Voldemort to return far sooner than in canon, out of sheer desperation. Someone who might actualy defeat the dark Lord in an honest-to-God duel (and possibly have to deal with the fallout from the public now seeing him as even more dangerous). Someone who would openly take Harry as his apprentice/sidekick in order to train him for the final battle, rather than orchestrate a convoluted masterplan to fulfill the prophecy. Someone who would regularly visit the Dursleys after foisting Harry on them, not because he fears mistreatment especially, just as anybody in this situation would, out of common sense. Is the child doing ok? Does he have genetic defects? Is he all good, all healthy etc? Someone whose repeated visits might actually soften Petunia and Vernon by breaking the image they have of uncaring, cold and heartless freaks just dumping the baby on their doorstep.

Basically Dumbledore as a full-on protagonist with Harry more of an unfortunate victim in the background would be nice for a change.


** That's my usual take on Dumbledore. I write him as someone who abhors killing, but would rather shoulder that burden himself than let others do it, and who would rather kill the guilty than risk the innocent. He does a lot of what you ask in my stories "Patron", "Divided and Entwined", and "The Dark Lord Never Died" and is similarly ruthless if a little more restrained about the extrajudicial killing of people like the Malfoys in "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief" and "Uncle Quentin's Spy".

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.

** Dumbledore takes a more active (and morally questionable) role in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19372750/][Phoenix Insurgent]]. It's an AU starting in 5th year with the premise that Dumbledore gets fed up with the ministry's corruption and incompetence. He resolves to start taking matters into his own hands, even if that means abandoning the moral high ground to get results. linkao3(19372750)

In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13893606/][souls touch, and the future changes]] Dumbledore is more active and competent during the /first/ war. Just like in canon Dumbledore suspects that Riddle might have used dark magic to achieve immortality, but unlike in canon he doesn't twiddle his thumbs and wait to see what happens after Voldemort is 'defeated' by the 'chosen one' in the ruins of the Potters' home. Dumbledore personally tracks down and destroys all of Voldemort's horcruxes himself, ensuring that the Dark Lord is well and truly gone for good. In the years afterward he capitalizes on the fame of having defeated two Dark Lords in order to shape wizarding Britain to his ideals. linkao3(13893606)

#+begin_quote
  Albus Dumbledore watched two visionaries start as driven, powerful, brilliant young men, and become monsters. He has no heir, no protege of equal power to step in should another one rise, and he is old. So when he hears of a Chosen One with power the Dark Lord knows not, he thinks maybe he doesn't want this boy prophesied to defeat Lord Voldemort to grow up in the Wizarding world. He thinks of the bonds of family, and the opportunity he has to shape his world's politics, and of a corrupt magical elite who've signed on with two Dark Lords over hatred of Muggles. He thinks Harry Potter should grow up loved by his family, and Voldemort be destroyed so there is no need for Harry to ever realize his power, and he acts to make both of those things happen. Because he's Dumbledore and what he wants, he gets. Usually. When you dabble with improvised ritual magic, you should be aware there might be unforeseen consequences. For example: souls touch.
