** linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels have possibly the best Dumbledore I've ever read, it's like taking a smart manipulative!Dumbledore and making him into a reluctant mentor for Harry. Their relationship is very strained, but Dumbledore is just about the only person Harry respects. Dumbledore teaches Harry about systems of magic and constantly tries to redeem him, covers for him and lets him take a central role in the war, but doesn't truly trust him either.

You don't really need to know about the Dresden Files to enjoy the fics, I hadn't read a single book when I first read them.

*** I highly recommend this story. It's an amazing trilogy with well fleshed out characters, well written plot, satisfying conclusions for each installment, and an excellent exploration of the mixed magic systems from each universe.

Out of my curated HP fic library, (which has some 250 fics all 100k plus words in length), this is easily in the top 10.

*Why I love it:* This story is a love story. There is little to no fighting, its all post deathly hallows, its just romance. That said, this is the most powerfully human story I've /ever/ read. Not "the most powerdully human fanfiction" I've ever read, the most powerfully human /story/, I've ever read. It captures the essence of emotion, from the highs of joy to the lows of grief, this story has a dynamic range of feeling unlike anything I've ever experienced in literature. Not only that, but it has life. It's not just a static record, it feels like it breathes. This story had captured what it means to love and lose, and then to find love again, and it has /put it into words/. That is why I love this story. And it's not even done yet.

*Why I love it:* This is one of the earliest fanfictions I ever read, just when I was getting into fanfiction at all. And still it has only ever been passed by one other story in nine years of reading fanfiction. This story is an Independent!Harry story. Except, it is nothing at all like what that phrase makes you think of. This is masterclass in trope writing, just because something has been done before does not mean it cannot be done better. Thia story takes the idea of a Harry who decides to be better, and to become so on his own terms, and explores it to perfection. This is not its only highlight though, as it contains the best explanation of blood magic I have ever encountered. As well as a climax that, while you could never see it coming, once it has arrived you will find yourself thinking that it could not have ended any other way.

*Why I love it:* This is a story about responsibility, grief, love, family, and most of all maturity, in that order. It explores each theme and does so to a standard of excellency found in every work by this author, and it does so without the reader ever realizing whats going on. (Now that you know what to look for you don't count, that's cheating.) It explores the core of Harry Potter as a person, from the child whose hearta desire was to merely have his parents and family surround him and look upon with love and welcome, to the man to walked willingly to his end so that others might be saved, it explores it all. It also has some the best characterizations of Andromeda Tonks and the Malfoys I have ever read.

*Why I love it:* In a word, Power. This is a story about power. About those who seek it, about those who have it, about those who bargain it away. But it is not only about power, but about a very literal evil as well. What defines evil? Can an evil person do good things? Can a good person do evil things? Can an evil person, someone who is utterly selfish and who desires nothing save their own benefit still be a force for good in the world by choosing to act in ways that will certainly benefit themselves, but others also? I don't know, but this story explores the question. It also has really cool magic and explosions in it. And swords, swords are cool too.

*Why I love it:* "What if we lost it all? What if had a chance to do it all again? What if we didn't have a choice?" These will be familiar words to anyone who reads time travel fics, and while I admit this is perheps the most contentious of my choices it is also here for a reason. This story is sends harry potter back to before the first blood war began, and it explores that time period thoroughly. It was time of shadows and intrigue, and as a result Harry must learn to be a part of those things. It has one of, if not the, best exploration of Bellatrix's character I've ever seen. Not only who she is, but who she was, and how she became who she did.

*Why I love it:* This is Voldemort's Story, also known as Emily Riddle. (Technically a spoiler but its in the first chapter) Emily Riddle is hands down the best version of Voldemort's character I have ever read. It explores her journey of transformation from beginning to end and manages to make her a genuinely noble character, even up to the end. It is indescribable, and truly worth the read.

*Why I love it:* This is a western. It takes the themes and motifs of the old silver screen and tumbleweeds and translates them perfectly to the world of Harry Potter. Not only that, but it manages to achieve that zenith of dynamic storytelling and make its readers laugh and cry in great measure, sometimes on the same page. A journey comprised entirely of mountain tops or valleys would be little more than a slightly twisty road with view or lack of view respectively, this story takes from the top to the bottom and back up again.

At what point do the scales tip, how far is too far, and once you've started that path how far are you willing to go? This is the story of how a good man donned the face of evil to change the world for the better, and how his closest friends decided to march along with him.

This is not a small thing, this is not some insular british community of wizards. This is the story of Harry Potter, who forsook the magical world and decided to conquer it all instead. /"For there are some men who it seems are born with fire to swallow the world"/

About those that are doomed to end all too soon, and yet are worth it anyway, and about those that last a lifetime and more, and for whom friendship is an unassailable fact as sure as the rising sun. (Note: This story is technically incomplete. It ia told out of chronological order and contains three stoey arcs. Thw girst two are the most inportant, and are both connected with each other and complete. The third is incomplete and extraneous, but worth reading).
