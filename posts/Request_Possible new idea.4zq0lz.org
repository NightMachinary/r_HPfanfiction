Is there a fic, where the various Horcruxes of Voldemort barring Harry all get their own host? Like the diary was sucking out Ginn'ys sould and making Tom Riddle come to life. The locket I assume was doing the same. Is there a fic where all of the varied Horcruxes come to life, and create a whole group of infighting voldemorts of various levels of knowledge?


** There're several fictions where locket possessed Sirius or order member. An example would be Harry Holmes series where locket possessed Sirius.

In "I'm Still Here" story, the ring possessed Bellatrix.

  Harry meets Bella and Sirius during the Azkaban Prologue... He comes out a little brassed off, and a whole lot apathetic... Then there was the Goblet and the Tournament... By fifth year he's a whole different animal... Heh well, the world wants its Hero...

** I'm not sure I've seen any where they all come to life, but I've seen a few where one or two of the horcruxes do.

linkffn(7932144) has the diary come to life at the end of second year.

I remember starting to read one where all the different horcruxes were alive and had different names, but I never got very far into it (no idea why) and I tried to find it but couldn't. I remember one of them went after Hermione to try and kill her and they ended up having sex.

  When Harry is kidnapped by a seemingly sixteen year old Tom Riddle at the end of his second year, he's convinced that he would do absolutely anything to escape -- but "anything" can be a dangerous conviction to have, and even heroes can grow tired of fighting without hope. Sometimes, survival means making a home in the dark... Warning: Deals with Stockholm Syndrome and dark themes.

** I think linkffn(souls abound) is what you're looking for.

It's robst, so if you hate that, I guess that's too bad.

  This story came from an idea of there being more than one version of Voldemort running around, due to his horcruxes being activated. Story begins with the Tom - Harry confrontation in the Chamber of Secrets. H/Hr
