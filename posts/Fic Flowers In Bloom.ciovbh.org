*Title*: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20004682][Flowers In Bloom]]

*Author*: Me ^ _ ^ EmeraldLight!

*Rating*: G at the moment, probably will be NC-17 by the end (most likely a slash fic)

*Description*: In which father said to do ANYTHING to get Harry Potter on their side... I don't think he meant this.

Welcome to Gryffindor, Draco Malfoy.

Things are going to be different, aren't they?


** I'm intrigued! Bookmarked

*** ^ _ ^ Huzzah! I really hope I don't disappoint. I am going to do everything in my power to actually finish this one... I'm bad for losing my muse rather quickly.

And you find AO3 hard to read on mobile? I don't have any issues with it...

***** He has... ideas.

I don't want to spoil anything.

The first chapter doesn't contain anything remotely Drarry, so you're safe to take a peek.
