*** Yea this was the one i was remembering. Felt it got off the rails with the capture/torture of Harry. One of the rarer cases of too much world building, needed a tighter character arc. Decent writing overall

** I remember this one. Harry was found in the potter estatebso the potters have to respond to protect his younger sister. Also a bit of james telling lily harry is unsavable.
