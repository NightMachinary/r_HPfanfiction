We are looking for fics where Tom Riddle has a childhood friend , that is a witch or wizard. Time travel fics are acceptable as long as Tom Riddle meets the character during his Hogwarts years or younger. Well written fics only please :

So far the list is:

** I suppose [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10942056/1/][Crawlersout by Slexenskee]] would count, its a time travel fic where fem-harry and voldemort literally couldnt live without one another so after fem harry beats vildemort she then goes back in time to try and save tom as a kid from his future so that she can both make the world a better place, and also keep her own sanity. It is very long, absolutely incredible and not yet completed although the author is active on the subject so it seems likely it will be finished, the author is just a slow writer. It almost doesnt fit the criteria as fem-harry takes on more of a mother role for tom than that of a friend, but it is still worth reading.
