I'm looking for a story that I read a few years ago, in it Dumbledore rescues Harry from the abuse of the Dursley's and takes him to live with the Weasley's. a short while later Dumbledore returns with Hermione who was also getting abused by her parents who are drunks, after a going to court her parents are sent to jail. Harry and Hermione remain at the Weasleys until it is time to go to Hogwarts during their first year Hermione's parents are released from prison and then kidnap Ginny who was sitting on a fence at the edge of the Burrow' property while under their "care" the try to get information on where Hermione is referring to her as "their daughter" even though they lost custody they torture Ginny to the point that after rescue she is forced to use a wheel chair.

I know this might be a long shot but I hope the story is still out there and can be found

(Also I know the story sounds dark, It is but it is also about healing)


** It doesn't sound dark, it sounds stupid.

*** Dunno why you're getting downvoted. This is a legitimate opinion - and one I happen to agree with.

**** I think there are downvotes because answering a "can anyone help me find this fic" request with "this sounds stupid" is neither helpful nor on-topic. It wouldn't be the case in a discussion thread.
