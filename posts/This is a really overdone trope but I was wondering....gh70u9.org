If anyone has any “Harry joins the Dark Side” and “Harry is the Dark Lord's Equal” fanfics. Preferably ones where he's disguised and he reveals himself at the Final Battle. I also like ones where they are secretly dating and Harry has to sneak out of Hogwarts to see Tom or he's gonna burn the castle down.

Thanks
