:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The fic was set a couple thousand years in the future where Voldemort has taken over the world successfully. Some things I recall were that muggle and magical worlds were mixed and all human populations were condensed into cities so that the natural magic of the world could recover.

The fic had like, technomagic devices and stuff. Iirc Harry was found perfectly preserved in a chamber deep underground in some kind a temple and woke up after being given the antidote to draught of living death.

If you know this fic, pleeeease let me know.

  “Hush, Harry,” came Voldemort's soothing voice. “I shall take... such good care of you.”--“I desire our reunion sooner rather than later. Come back to me, and I will ensure that you are as utterly comfortable as I can make you. You may be assured that I will never rest my immortal body until I have you once again.”--“I did not intend to -- ”“You did so intend! Well? Will you finally stop moping now that the box was not-empty for a night?”“No,” Voldamort snarled. “This fixes nothing.”--A retrospective tale of language gaps, of untrustworthy memories, and of the culmination of a millennia long affair between a Dark Lord and a counterrevolutionary. -- (summary edited 2020.12.19)
