** At the beginning, all Harry is, from Ginny's point of view, is just a figure of wizarding stories and history. Ginny is just excited to see him. However, even Ron and Hermione do the same. Hermione, for instance, instead of squealing, she was busy talking about him in all the books she had read. Fred and George exhibit similar reactions. They are all excited to see the BWL, and who wouldn't be? Why should Ginny be singled out?

Also, it is confirmed in Goblet of Fire that Ginny's crush on Harry began only in /Chamber of Secrets/, not in /PS/, when her reaction changes to having actual, genuine feelings for him, even if immature, since she knows about him a lot more. Why would this be the case? We get the answer from Arthur Weasley: “Good Lord, is it Harry Potter? Very pleased to meet you, Ron's told us so much about --”. Being his best friend, what Ron said made a very nice picture indeed, and Ginny starts to understand him a little better, and therefore has a crush on him. In fact, she even knows that Harry doesn't like the fame, and defends him on that basis from Draco Malfoy at the Flourish and Blotts bookshop. Therefore, even in /CoS/, she does indeed see him as a real and genuine person, compared to characters like Romilda Vane. And in /OotP/, again, when Harry is complaining about the Daily Prophet, Ginny understands that he doesn't want his fame.

However, not only is there is an explicit difference between the way Ginny acts in /PS/ and the way she acts in /CoS/, Ginny's character is portrayed fundamentally different to Colin's, who is someone who is definitely a fanboy. Ginny acts around Harry, and the way Colin reacts, which is how you'd expect a hero-worshipper to react - as well as a clear difference between her reaction in /PS/ and in /CoS/. Colin follows Harry around, he takes pictures, he's always trying to get Harry to talk to him, and Harry is constantly annoyed with him. Ginny is quite the opposite: she is quiet, shy, and gives Harry his space, and he holds nothing against her.

One other key moment that is used to tar Ginny with the “fangirl” label is when she says in /Half Blood Prince/ “I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that's why I like you so much.” However, Ginny did not mean that Harry was all smiling to go to war with Voldemort. She meant that she knew that his personality and morality could not deter him from his mission, because he could not let Voldemort continue rampaging, and she knew that he was going to do the right thing no matter what. Ginny knows that Harry wouldn't be able to bear leaving her, but she also knows that he wouldn't be able to bear not confronting the Voldemort threat, which was alluded to in Harry's conversation with Dumbledore earlier on. And Harry knows exactly what Ginny means, because he isn't taking an issue with it like he did with all the swarms of fans during the earlier books.

I'm just putting this out there for anyone who is genuinely wondering (and this is a genuine question to be asked), because this is yet another troll topic, by [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8esbrp/why_is_ronhermione_hated_so_much/dxxt288/?context=3&st=jgfsg1zr&sh=68961d7e][someone behind all of these accounts]].

Not everyone acts the same way. When it comes to fangirls/fanbois, those who obsessively follow their idols around are probably even in the minority. Most of them just admire/adore them from afar and idolize everything about them.

Which is still an extremely one-dimensional approach to Harry's character that casts him in the role of the hero in his very own movie. She clearly sees him as the guy who charges to the rescue of the damsel in the Chamber of Secrets and she doesn't appear to have any understanding of or appreciation for the complexity in Harry's motivations and emotions about Voldemort, the death of his parents, protection of his friends and a prophecy over his head.

**** Actually Ginny of anyone does understand the complexity of his emotions towards Voldemort since she is the only one touched in the same way as him. Honestly, I don't see what point you're trying to make here. Nothing in their interaction suggests a lack of understanding of who Harry is. Quite the opposite, Ginny has the read on Harry exactly. She does understand the depth of why he feels the need to go after him. She is his friend and is familiar with his history. She knows that Harry would not rest until he took down Voldemort, could not be happy living a life knowing he was still out there. Think about why she was so accepting of the break up, /because/ she fully understands his desire to protect those he loves because of those he lost.

Sure, that may be the case. But you saying this to defend your stance that "Ginny-is-a-fangirl" shows that you are simply working backwards from your conclusion. Something obviously changed between Ginny's reactions in the first two books. If she was indeed a shallow fangirl why didn't she just keep her reaction from the first book? Again, why was she shown to understand Harry's struggles with fame even in /CoS/?

Hint: it's because she isn't one.

"He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. "I'd want him finished," said Harry quietly. "And I'd want to do it.""

He is saying that he wants to be the one to hunt Voldemort down. Ginny is literally saying the same thing. Also, it's written that at that moment "they understood each other perfectly". Sure sounds like Ginny doesn't understand anything of what Harry is going through, or that she's having a "one dimensional approach".

Maybe, but when it comes to this issue, Harry not reacting the way he does to shallow hero worshippers does prove my point. The issue is what Harry thinks about fangirls/fanboys, which is clearly negatively. Externalizing it to the other things that he ignores doesn't help your argument.

It's a narrative device. This is closing a part of Harry's arc in the heroes jorney: He is accepting his mission and does what needs to be done. Ginny on the other hand is explaining to her romantic interest why she is acting completely out of character and staying behind like a demure little house-wife. I'd certainly want to express myself clearly and not make such ambiguous statements if I truly had this great connection to my partner. I'd want to make it clear that I truly understood them, by not saying something that could have been said *exactly the same way* by someone who has no understanding of Harry at all and only knew him from the Daily Prophet.

She is lucky that Harry is such a gentle soul and always wants to think the best of people no matter what (unless he's throwing a tantrum). He's probably going through the same mental gymnastics you just did so that he can understand her perfectly.

Ginny would never just sit back and let Harry do his thing, just because he is worried about her safety or something like that. So JKR had to come up with this stupid line for her, because she missed the train on including Ginny in the trio. Would have been awkward storytelling-wise to suddenly bring her along.

Again, the misunderstanding is not on my part, but on Rowling's. Ginny - as she has been previously characterized - wouldn't demurely respect her husband-to-be's wishes. She would flip the fuck out over Harry's "I'm going to protect you by breaking up with you" and not just stand there, smile at him and tell him that she totally understands and expected this.

This is the girl that broke up with a boyfriend because he was trying to help her too much. It's as if Rowling replaced her with some kind of pure-blood princess who's waiting for her arranged marriage, knitting tiny little sweaters for their future kids.

That scene is a complete joke.

** Not sure if this is going to be a very productive topic. People are just going to believe what they want to believe: H/G fans are going to cite their fight in Grimauld Place as a sign that she doesn't put Harry on a pedastal and people like me are going to point out that she probably knows Harry just as little as we get to know Ginny and that she seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding about who Harry is ("I can't say I'm surprised. I knew this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn't be happy unless you were hunting Voldemort").

At the very least - if you want to claim that she fell in love with Harry - you'll have to imagine some very deep heart to heart conversations between the two in HBP. This requires a huge leap of faith, because for some reason they weren't important enough to be in the book.

Edit: Oh and I forgot to say that the problem is exacerbated by the fact that Harry's side of the romance is terrible too. The "chest monster" has been mocked more than enough already, so I'm not going to go into it, but it may have helped if Harry's attraction hadn't felt so artificial (it was in fact so badly written that it inspired tons of PotionQueen!Ginny fanfics)

Depends on what you mean. For me "heart to heart" conversations doesn't mean just "lovey dovey" stuff and I think the trio had plenty of 'intimate' (for lack of a better word) moments. Also we already know that they spend a lot of time with each other and actually have substantial conversations (that aren't just about the weather or elbows in a butter dish) so I don't have any difficulty imagining plenty of those "off screen".

IMHO Harry had more intimate moments with Luna than with Ginny, but I'm probably just trying to get him away from the Weasleys.

***** I always point to the scene in HBP in the common room where Harry and Ginny are casually chilling and cracking jokes. She's reading while leaning on his leg. I think this points to the fundamental difference between Ginny and Cho. With Cho it was awkward, but with Ginny it's entirely comfortable and normal. It's not much but it does show a realistic, intimate relationship. Anyone who has been in a LTR, truly loving relationship can point to similar moments like the one they shared.

I agree there was far too little of these intimate moments, but there were enough to show that Harry and Ginny's relationship was deeper than typical high school romance.

*** On topic: I actually never heard of that rationale in which Ginny has a /fundamental misunderstanding/ about who Harry is. Of course, thinking about it makes a lot of sense even if I do like Harry and Ginny together. I think what bothers me the most about their romance is that they "fell in love" when they were teenagers on the eve of a civil war. Molly said it best that desperate times make desperate people in Half-Blood Prince (when she was referencing Bill and Fleur's upcoming wedding). Harry doesn't seem to change all that much from before the Horcrux hunt to after it (which is surprising given all that he'd witnessed and been through). Things of that nature don't casually wear away but stick with you for a good remainder of your life. And while Ginny may/could have helped him with memories (or nightmares) from the war, she couldn't have done the same with the Horcrux hunt. This could've lead down the road where she doesn't understand what he /went through/ paired together with a misunderstanding of who he is as well. Interesting, Deathcrow, very interesting.

**** I respectfully disagree with the premise. Part of what supporters of the pairing like myself constantly point to is the fact that Ginny works well for Harry in part because she /does/ fully understand who he is. Ginny is actually completely right; Harry won't be happy unless he is the one who hunts him down and finishes him off. But Ginny also understands what Harry wants in life, which is just a normal life. That's what she provides him those few weeks they are together. And Ginny knows when he is about to break it off that it's coming and why it's happening. /Because/ she fundamentally understands who he is and what he needs. Think about all the major moments between the two from OOTP on. There is a pattern of Ginny knowing just what to say to Harry, or just what he needs.

Honestly, I don't think Rowling necessarily intended for them to be totally in love during school. I think she really was just planting the seeds for them to wind up together. Clearly, Rowling portrayed them as quite compatible.

That's okay. It's completely fair for them to have a normal high school relationship, which would be one among many in their young lives. What's just bad is to then turn around and go "Oh, btw Harry and Ginny are total soul mates and live happily ever after with their amazing family and everything is amazingly perfect" in the epilogue. That's what you have to show if you want to make definitive statements like this... or leave it open and everyone can imagine whatever they want. Imagine for a minute if it had been "Millicent Bullstrode" instead of Ginny... that's a little bit how people feel who don't get the Harry/Ginny thing: "Huh? Millicent? ... but... why? Okay I guess"

Fantasy stories, which are escapism, usually also have fantastical relationships. Fantasy readers will very easily accept (or even expect) that two people might be destined for each other. It absolutely boggles my mind that JKR knew beforehand who she wanted to end up together and still gave Ginny such a minor role. There would have been so many great opportunities to show how an amazing couple might complement each other, but I have the sneaking suspicion that JKR really doesn't see this in the same light as I do, considering how she wrote Ron/Hermione. It probably would have been even worse if Ginny had a bigger role.

But we do know a lot about her and her character is quite complex. She has a compelling backstory (the possession), character growth (shy girl around Harry who was "weak" by being taken in by the diary to strong woman leading the resistance while winning Harry's affection) and strong motivation for her actions (fear of being caged), yet sometimes her actions betray her desires, furthering her depth.

Being possessed doesn't make your character deep. Nothing about that incident was shown to have changed her and it had zero ramifications for her down the road. I've no idea what you're talking about with her not wanting to be caged. I don't really care to hate on people for their ships (unless it's just some bizarre shit like Harry/Riddle or Hermione/Any Death Eater), but Ginny's character was basically: she's the sporty one like Harry, she had a childhood crush on Harry because reasons and she can be tough (because of some unexplored hex she's good at). I mean, take away those extremely minor character traits and she's as undefined as, I dunno, Daphne Greengrass.

They each had their moments but this was primarily a story revolving around the trio, no disagreement there. If you are going to argue Ginny as a irrelevant side character, you have to say the same for Neville. I wish she played a greater role in the series overall, but it is what it is.

I never said the possession made her deep, but it did allow her to have a specific tie to Harry that no other person could relate to. I agree the development was off screen and we don't really see much of its affect on Ginny. But there are snippets. The effect Dementors have on her, for one. And of course when she calls Harry out on forgetting she was possessed, it demonstrates that it still to that day had an affect on her. I wish we saw more of that, but it's ultimately not Ginny's story.

Regarding not wanting to be caged, Rowling put plenty of subtext in the book to show Ginny wanting to be seen as an independent capable witch who didn't need to be sheltered. Examples include:

- fighting her mother to be allowed to hear what's going on with the Order in OOTP
- stealing her brothers brooms to go flying
- arguing with her mother to be able to fight in the last battle
- her patronus being a wild mare
- she broke up with Dean because he tried to coddle her

Ginny's character certainly wasn't in your face. But it's there. She us far from a Daphne Greengrass, who literally has one reference. Here are some things we know about Ginny:

- she has a dry cutting sense of humor, and does some good impressions, and Harry and her share their sense of humor
- she can be jealous
- she can be a bit childish but desperately wants to be treated as an adult
- she is fiercely independent (in the battle of the Department of Mysteries, she refuses help after hurting her ankle; also her relationship with Dean)
- she is very loyal, particularly to Harry
- she knows how to attack someone at their most vulnerable point
- she has a hot temper when challenged
- she has a good understanding of what Harry needs in a given moment (library scene in OOTP, Christmas confrontation at Grimmauld Place in OOTP, defending Harry after the Sectumsempra incident in HBP, accepting the break up in HBP)
- confident in herself

Despite not having a huge role in the series, we do know a lot about Ginny, and these are not irrelevant traits because a lot of them relate to her relationship with Harry.

I would totally agree with you that we didn't get enough of her in the series, and the actual relationship with Harry could've been done a lot better, but it's simply incorrect to sa she had virtually no characterization.

Um, sure, I guess? I meam, Neville probably had more dialogue since he was around more, but otherwise I don't think this comparison does much for Ginny. Neville wasn't anything until OoTP, and really wasn't relevant until the end of DH.

Well my mistake. You mentioned it immediately after saying she was complex. And the only role that played afterward was a brief line to get Harry to stop acting like an idiot. And even then, unless I'm misremembering the sequence of events, it required Hermione to get to that point. Also, I don't recall the Dementors affecting Ginny in any particularly special way (maybe I've forgotten).

Ok, this seems to be a shift. Not wanting to be coddled, wanting to be part of the action, and going for joy rides without parental permission has nothing to do with not wanting to be "caged". It's literally the /most/ teenager-y behavior. Hell, even in HP basically all those things you listed happened for other characters (with the exception of the Dean thing). PS mentions several examples of students at the very least boasting about solo escapades on brooms. Every teen at the Grimmauld Place in OoTP argued about being in the Order and wanted to fight in the last battle.

That list you made makes my points for me, just look how trivial many of these are (especially in fantasy, even more so in HP):

  she can be jealous

  she can be a bit childish but

  desperately wants to be treated as an adult

  she is fiercely independent she is very loyal, particularly to Harry (I don't think this is even true, or if it is literally every actual friend Harry has would be equally so, some more than her)

  she knows how to attack someone at their most vulnerable point
#+end_quote

These apply to nearly every named character or friend of Harry's, and those that don't are traits everyone exhibits at times. My point is pretty simple I think: Ginny just had hardly any characterization and so she just couldn't be made a complex character. And really, there was no way to do it given when she entered the series, her family situation (same happened to Ron, completely irrelevant after Book 2), and the friendship H/Hr/Ron formed in book 1.

I don't hate her, but in my view, that's only because there's not enough to her to hate (although I suppose one can target their dislike at that lack of characterization).

******* You are saying she lacks characterization. Whether some of her characteristics are shared with other characters doesn't negate the fact that she does have characterization. You literally said she is just a sporty girl who had a crush and can be tough, which clearly is not all there is to her.

You did forget about the Dementors.

My list of her traits is meant to show she isn't just a blank slate, that there is actual characterization and yes, some of those traits are flaws. It's what makes her an interesting character, in that she isn't just this perfect embodiment of a partner for Harry. She has flaws, desires, personality. The traits I listed could apply to other characters, but they are very important to her character. Her desire to rebel against the constraints placed on her is far more pronounced than any other character. Hermione never displays some great desire to be seen as an adult and let loose, nor Ron, nor Harry.

Regarding the caged point, I would just disagree with your interpretation of what it means to be caged and whether Ginny was fighting against that. I think the text is clear she is in a constant fight against others trying to keep her safe or protected. Sure, it's a teenagery thing, but in the books, Rowling specifically highlights this trait in Ginny. I think only Harry ever truly has equal moments of despair over the adults not including him in things.

Where you are correct is that the way Ginny is brought into the story makes it difficult for her character to be fully fleshed out and expanded upon. Being from Harry's POV, where he doesn't really notice Ginny as a big part in his life until book 6, it is tough to see Ginny as more than just some random character. But the same is mostly true of the vast majority of characters in the series, save Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and a few others. Rowling does give Ginny characterization, just like she does the rest of the Weasleys and most of Harry's housemates. Occasionally she becomes more important to the story and we learn more about her, just like other characters. It ebbs and flows. I am simply arguing that she is a strong character who Rowling doesn't allow to reach her full potential. There is complexity there but Rowling never pauses long enough to allow us to explore that.
