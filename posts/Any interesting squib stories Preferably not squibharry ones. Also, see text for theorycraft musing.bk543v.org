Theorycraft: a character is forced to make a horcrux. That horcrux is placed in the magical's wand. The events are wiped from their mind so they can never regret the murder. The wand has no hexes on it like riddles' horcruxes. Does the soul piece migrate back or does the wand remain a horcrux?

** Linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider)

She's a squib. She can't use spells. But who said she can't raid tombs in Egypt with the Gringotts curse breaking team?

Rocket launcher-wielding badass!Petunia who never married Vernon and properly raised Harry.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

** linkffn(The Second String) deals with squib issues brilliantly. There's Fakesquib!harry though, but it's a time travel story, so he pretends to be a squib so that in case it's not an alternate dimension, he won't wind up in the middle of Hogwarts and the wizarding world possibly interfering with him and his friends being born. He's still magical, and still practices in secret, but the gambit leads to really interesting developments of how squibs are treated.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in the past, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort. Some slash much later.
