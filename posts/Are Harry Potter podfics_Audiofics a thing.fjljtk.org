As the title says, are they a thing? For those who don't know, podfics/audiofics are just audiobooks of fanfiction. I saw a post on the Fanfiction reddit about them and now I'm curious because I haven't seen many for this fandom. Is there actual interest here in making or listening to them?

If you know any websites for them (eg. [[http://audiofic.jinjurly.com/about-this-site]] for non-HP specific podfics) or have any links to posted ones that you'd recommend - please do recommend them! Audiobooks are cool, yo.

And are there any voice-actingly minded folks who'd be into the idea of reading some fics?

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** I've heard that some really popular fanfics have them. But the best one is easily the 3 part series by internet historian on the infamous masterpiece that is "My Immortal". [[https://youtu.be/Ffh7cWRrqF4]]

****** Really? Huh. I expected it was more of an intermittent thing done on occasion than an actual phenomenon. That's pretty cool. A friend is in voice acting and I'm mildly obsessed with Critical Role, The Magnus Archives, and Nightvale, so I'm well aware that VO is both harder and easier than most might expect. I'm very glad it's a thing - we need more audio stuff in our lives.

******** Enjoy. Critical Role is a bunch of Voice Actors playing D&D (there's nearly 200 episodes of the visual stuff and it's about 450 hours of runtime total) and Magnus Archives is a cranky dude doing the archives filing for a Lovecraft-XFiles type group.

There's also a thing called The Leviathan Chronicles that I'm semi-listening to, but I have no idea if I like that yet. It started off like Dan Brown wrote Highlander after playing Bioshock and watching extreme fishing documentaries for a week and now it's getting more like H.G Wells writes weird government conspiracy theories.

Oooh. Girl in Space looks very cool. Kind of reminds me of a game I played recently called Deliver Us The Moon. Probably a dash of The Martian in there too, only featuring Quirky!Clara from the Asylum of the Daleks episode of Doctor Who instead of Matt Damon. Marsfall does sound like someone wrote their Surviving Mars game into an audioplay and I am totally down for that. Any particular thoughts on either of your recs that you think might be nice to know before starting them?

********* Well, I am still early on in both podcasts (I listen slowly and read the transcripts - I am a visual person not auditory, so it's hard to listen without the words.). The music for Marsfall is original, and it might not be to your tastes. I think it's fine. Girl in Space is more appealing to me (maybe because I am a girl who would love to go to space - where is the TARDIS?!). It's got more humor than Marsfall, which I like. I'm not so much into grimdark, especially these days. Yeah, sort of reminds one of The Martian in terms of ordinary people put in extraordinary circumstances.

********** Hmm. Magnus Archives might not be your thing, then. Still worth a try, because the humour is delicious, but it is a horror thing so there is a dash of bleakness. I guess it depends on what you see as Grimdark.

Since you've given me yet more links - immensely grateful for that, thank you, and boy do nearly all of the podcasts linked look interesting - if you like music with your story, there's a semi-audiobook experience called The Mechanisms that you might also enjoy. They're more burlesque, story-telling album than actual podcast or audiobook, but they still tell a story set to music and you can find lyrics on most of the generic 'lyrics dot com' type sites. I recommend giving each of their albums a try, if you're interested - they're all quite different in style, but they're all sci-fi steampunk re-imaginings of old myths and tales (One is on Greek Myths, one on Norse, one on Fairy Tales, and one on Arthurian Legend).

Cool, good to know. I'll keep an ear on the music and an eye on the humour. :)

Space is great though. Gotta love space. Space. Spaaaaace. I think most of us in the Nerdy Spheres would probably want to go at least once. :)

*********** Thanks for the additional rec. (Part of why I love WtNV is the music.) To me, grimdark is more about torturing the characters than the story. I need a thread of hope for the characters I like. I'm a re-reader, and if a story is super depressing, I can't re-read it. Basically, I get emotional when I read or watch media, and the effects linger in real-life. Hence my not being able to read shallow, poorly written romance or pairings I hate, because I can't identify.

************ Sure. And yeah, the Weather Reports are almost always great songs I immediately add to my playlists. Though I am quite far behind - I lost some of my motivation to catch up after they started reducing the everyday-ness of the weird stuff. It wasn't a "A giant meteor landed on John Peters' (you know, the farmer?) car today - must've been illegally parked, as that is the Sheriff's Secret Police's way of letting you know that you have a ticket!" kind of tone anymore. Are you still keeping up with it?

Hmm. I think Magnus Archives might be somewhat interesting to you, then. The entire premise is that this cranky guy is recording statements made by people who ran into supernatural weirdness and they vary from 'a thing tried to eat me in a dark basement and then I ran away and convinced myself I imagined it' to 'things went thud in the night and it was scary and I had nightmares for the rest of my life'. The first episode is fifteen minutes long and pretty representative of the bulk of the series (though the length of later episodes does vary), so you won't have to waste much time deciding whether you like it or not. The main character's voice actor is actually the lead singer of The Mechanisms.

And The Mechanisms definitely isn't Grimdark. It's often more... bittersweet, I suppose? Like the Lemony Snicket series. The good guys win, but they lose something at the same time. It's very Film Noir, Steampunky in that way. I'd recommend giving Ulysses dies at Dawn a go to see if you like it (that's the Greek myth Album). The music is stellar, though.

Ah, fair. I'm similar - though I process those emotions quite quickly. I'm not an overly big fan of that sort of Grimdark either - though it's mostly just pointless edginess being really uninteresting to me. I've only had about a half dozen fics really get to me like that where the feeling lasts for awhile afterwards.

** I thought that PotterCast used to do some episodes where they would read out fanfic, but maybe I am misremembering. Though my googling did turn up Fangasm, which has voice actors read out HP erotica, among others: [[https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-potterotica-podcast/id1195467221?mt=2]]

I always thought it would be awesome to have more fanfic as audiobooks to make them more accessible.

*** Sames! Not just for those hard-of-seeing, but for people who don't have the time or inclination or headspace to sit and read a half-million words. Critical Role does a podcast for people to listen to on commutes and such, so a similar pattern could be quite cool here.

Erotica isn't really my thing, asexual as heck here, but it's cool to know that's a thing. I can look into the PotterCast thing too.

**** Yea it does seem a bit odd. I'm not really sure of the legalities myself, but from what I know the author has actually been in contact with Rowling in the past, and has written a number of original novels, so assume its most likely all above board.

Regardless of whether you listen to the audio books, I'd still definitely recommend reading them.
