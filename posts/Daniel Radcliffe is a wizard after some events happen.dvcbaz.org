All I remember is that Radcliffe is somehow Harry's twin (not sure, but I think it's mentioned) and at one point I think a child asks Harry (or Daniel) for an autograph thinking it's the other person and get disappointed when they sign it. And JK Rowling is a witch with a time turner apparently. It took place after the goblet of Fire.
