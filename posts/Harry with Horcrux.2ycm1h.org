So I was wondering if there are any fics where Harry either makes his own Horcruxes or becomes a wrath like Voldemort and has to take over someone else's body? It would be an interesting read I think :)

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7774132/1/Oops][Oops]] Crackfic where Harry creates a Horcrux, problem is he didn't mean to, and his Horcrux is really, REALLY rude.
