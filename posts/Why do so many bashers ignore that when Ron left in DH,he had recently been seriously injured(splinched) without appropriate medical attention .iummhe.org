  It's okay to quit saving the country if you splinch yourself cause you're bad at apparating.

** Because most bashers dont care about any justifiable reason for Ron and instead want tp hate on him for their precious Harry/Hermione or Harry/Brick ship.

** Bashers ignore whatever they have to to make their point. That's the whole point of bashing. You pick an element to exaggerate and 'deconstruct' in the way that fits your perception of the character.

That specifically, I would imagine they ignore because it's not important enough to give up being the single line of defence between a genocidal immortal lunatic and everything they care about, or because it's not useful enough a reason to make a character 'bad'.
