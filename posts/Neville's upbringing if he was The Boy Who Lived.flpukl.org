If Neville was BWL would his upbringing have been different?

Canonically his home life and treatment was bad, and I mean really bad.

  My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad. "

This is taken from chapter 7 of PS. Moreover his Grandmother made him use his dad's wand for most of his Hogwart's life. It is mentioned in the books that she did not approve of his interests and that he should do better like his dad.

So I was wondering would he be treated differently if instead of Harry, Neville became the BWL and if so what would he be like at the time he starts Hogwarts? Would he still be timid or would he be more confident like he was in the later books or something else entirely?


** If the weight of expectation of living up to his father nearly crushed him, trying to live up to the expectations of a nation would destroy him.

** Until Hogwarts, his life would either be quite similar to canon (his grandmother was already overbearing and had a lot of expectations for him), or worse (more expectations).\\
Canon children don't seem to leave their house much (some may visits children of acquaintances, and maybe some visit to Diagon Alley) but BWL Neville would never be able to leave his.

Once at Hogwarts, it would mainly depend of his wand (does he still use his father's wand or did he get one that fit like maybe the Holly Phoenix Feather one?). With a good wand, he would probably be in a similar situation that Harry, with his father one he would be like in canon but worse (imagine Draco taunting if the half squib is the BWL . . .).

Anyways, I think he would probably be timid in this scenario. Neville seem to be sensible to positive reinforcement, and his grandmother would give him none of that as a normal child, let alone as the BWL.

*** If they are alive then this is what would likely happen. Either way he would convince Augusta to take Neville and go into hiding with or without the relatives so that the death eaters can't hurt them.
