:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Okay so I cant remember the name or who wrote it. I really hope i can this fic again. But i know that i read it on FanFiction.Net.

The story starts on Harry's 7th or 8th year, i think, and the DADA teacher ask them to, yknow, use riddikulus and get rid of the boggart. So, when it's Harry's turn, he expects a dementor, when suddenly, he, himself came out. And that boggart!Harry was super dark and calm and he was also intimadating and everyone in the class was just watching and wondering what's going on. Ron and Hermione also was there. And i think somehow draco was involve but like he was helping harry somehow (?) then when the class was over, harry hid behind somewhere and draco found him and like said his fear was a noble fear(?) and it was like they were friends, joking around.

It was NOT a Drarry story. I think so yes? And it is a oneshot. I think? Also, i cant remember if there was the war or if it was after the war. But i was absolutely sure it was a ONESHOT.

I read it a long time ago but i forgot to favourite the fic. Please help me find it or inform me if the story has been removed or whatever.


** Oh man, I totally know this one. I really thought it was by tigersilver (a rare non-slash fic) but I don't see it. They get drunk together and get caught stumbling through Hogwarts and when Harry gets to the common room Hermione is horrified but Harry doesn't really care.
