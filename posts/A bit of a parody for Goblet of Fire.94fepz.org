For some reason today I was thinking of what I call Moody 2.0 (Crouch Jr of course). And how Voldemort never had to come back at all that year. The first defense class is the unforgivables and as I recall he tells the class that they could cast Avada Kedavra as much as they like at him and he'd probably only get a bloody nose at best. Imagine if Malfoy or someone took him up on the offer and Avada Kedavra'd him on the spot, successfully. Crouch Jr is dead, which means no portkey.


** Hmm. Well these aren't exactly that but they both are results of characters being intrigued by the casting of the unforgivable curses.

Summary: Monsters exist in ordinary people. Ordinary people like Neville Longbottom.

Summary: ONE-SHOT: Harry asks an obvious question during his first class with Professor Moody...and everything changes.

** This would also be good because you have a ready-made plot to replace the canon one you just ruined--what happens now that a student has just murdered a teacher who turns out to be a Death Eater?
