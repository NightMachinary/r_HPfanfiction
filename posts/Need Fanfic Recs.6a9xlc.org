I'm looking for fanfiction and headcanon recommendations for the sole purpose of developing characterizations for a story I'm writing. I'm struggling with the Death Eaters, and would love some short, well-written fics that really give depth to them. However, I'm only looking for recs that deal with these individuals throughout their childhood, school years, and/or young adult lives, or their actions and motivations in the first war against Voldemort.


** While not comprehensive, I think you can get some insights from linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by rannaro). The pre-Harry years are the best part and give insight to Snape's view during those years.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
