So, from my [[https://np.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/5u61vc/lf_rick_and_morty_but_with_dumbledore_and_harry/][last post]], I got inspired by own idea and decided to run with it, resulting in this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12369316/1/Dumbledore-and-Harry]]

It's my first foray into fanfiction, so don't hesitate to shower me with critiques.

** I really liked it! My only critique is the marriage law bit. Felt very out of place in the grand scheme of your chapter.

*Edit:* And I logged in to give ya a review too!
