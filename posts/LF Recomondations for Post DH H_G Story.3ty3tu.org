I am looking for recommendations for any good novel length post DH Harry/Ginny stories. Either starting right after the battle or soon after. I've read one or two in the past where it was about them coping with the after effects of the war but that's not really what I feel like. I am looking for something where there is a new conflict. A new threat to the wizarding world rises up and Harry/Ginny play a big role in that conflict because everyone still looks to him as their savior or something. If anyone knows any stories like that please let me know. Thanks!


** There is an amazing story called "Harry Potter, Post Script: Heroes, Hopes and Horrors" by midnightephemera linkffn(10292446).

It also has a sequel (though the sequel isn't complete, and hasn't seen an update since April 17th of this year, I even PM'd the author recently but never heard back.) linkffn(10826195)

**** I honestly don't mind them. I know they're clich√©d and all, but as far as soul bonds go, the one in this story isn't actually too bad imo.

  A continuation of the Harry Potter series after the demise of Voldemort. What happens in the 19 years before the epilogue? How do the two new couples deal with new responsibilities and one more year of school before them? (Mostly Canon compliant) Edited 3/2015. Complete!

  A continuation of the Harry Potter series after the 7th novel. Sequel to Heroes, Hopes and Horrors. Fate always seems to have it in for Harry and his family/friends. Can he put everything back to rights, while starting his career and chasing down a mysterious new enemy? (Read PS:HHH first!)(Mostly Canon compliant, Harry/Ginny centric but covers all of our favorite characters.)

**** Actually, just thought of another, "Essence of Revenge" by tgfoy. It's not complete, but it does have updates semi-regularly (last one was on Nov 1st, I feel like it's never longer than a month between them, sometimes shorter) linkffn(10855152)

#+begin_quote
  The battle was over. The victors woke into a new dawn, a new era had been born. They were free to live, free to find happiness, free to love. But a cloud drew across their world almost unnoticed, a darkness gathered strength. A new plot vengeance approached. Harry must face a new battle, a war for his very being. Expanded version, of an original which is still on another site.

*** Not OP, but I had a two month window in which to see the play...the website timed out and I was unable to get tickets. So until someone posts an illegal recording, I cannot see it. Bring on the fanfictions. I'm bitter as hell.
