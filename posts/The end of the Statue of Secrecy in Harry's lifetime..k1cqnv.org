Something really interesting about the worldbuilding of Harry Potter that is never outwardly discussed but I find to be extremely likely and often think about is that

Harry and his friends are likely going to see the end of the Wizarding Statute of Secrecy within their lifetimes and honestly, it's already on its last threads while he's at school. With everyone so busy with what Voldemort is doing, the entire Wizarding Community fails to see what the Muggles are doing.

It's the 90′s. Our 1990′s. The internet is starting to grow and comes into nearly every UK and US household. Video cameras are becoming thinner, sleeker, more user friendly, and above all, cheaper. By the time Voldemort is dead, the first camera phone is only three years away from being made.

Yes, these things don't work in Hogwarts, or likely in the Ministry either, and maybe even the biggest Wizard towns block electronics, too.

But Muggleborns exist. They exist and canonically are able to do uncontrolled magic, with eleven years of life before their questions about how and why are even begun to be answered.

It's 2015 and there are more than a few eleven year olds who have their own cellphones, which now almost all come standard with cameras. Or they have older brothers and sisters who have them.

YouTube exists in the modern world and anyone with an internet connection can post to it easily.

Even if the Ministry has a new special division to monitor the internet for leaks, they don't REALLY understand most Muggle technology and this isn't likely going to be any different. They won't be able to get every video and picture and post.

It starts with a video of some kid blooming a flower in their hand like little Lily Evans did in front of her sister some forty years ago. People will just think these are pranks, tricks of editing and lighting like that one guy does with his Vines. But then some other kid sees it, and recognizes it as real because they can do this same thing, too, and no one believes them, either.

Muggleborn children start finding each other on the internet long before Hogwarts finds them.

Hogwarts is still, quite literally, in the Dark Ages. They're too slow. They're too outdated. They can't keep up unless they change.

The world is different and a big secret like the Wizarding Statute of Secrecy isn't going to stay hidden for much longer.

Maybe not even “19 Years Later.”

In canon we are shown that Wizards do work with the Prime Minister, but that's it. We are not shown whether they are Wizards in other government departments who could try and hide leaks. Even if they were, Muggle communication is controlled mostly by private companies. We can assume that they are Wizards in companies like Facebook or Twitter but it's highly unlikely since Wizards have a non-intervisionist.

Another thing, other Wizarding governments might not even work with Muggle governments like the British Ministry does. For instance, MACUSA doesn't even work with the President of the United States. Making it more likely for the Statue to be broken.


** I don't think wizards have anything to worry about. Both societies interact only at the fringes with one another. There are only small number of people who interact with the Muggle World on regular basis. Considering the very low Wizarding population (e.g. according to JKR around 3k in the entire UK) occurrences would be rare and easily dismissed.

Yes surveillance technology, computers and video sharing are all blooming in popularity - but so are Photoshop and video editing software. Anyone can nowadays add effects that just a decade ago only specialised companies with million dollar budgets could pull off.

Besides who says entire Harry Potter book series and the Movie franchise wasn't released on purpose to the Muggles? Who on earth would now take seriously claims of some wand waving, cloak wearing people who seem to do the impossible? Plausible Deniability.

Magic operates on a level beyond physics or science. It has power to alter reality, not just the mundane. Who says Memory charm can't be adjusted to delete data from Muggle Computer systems just as effectively? The idea that wizards are backward and lost in modern world is the usual trope in FF - I however think that wizards are perfectly capable of matching any Muggle innovation with magical variance. I am certain the Ministry has teams whose job it is to research Muggles and counteract their advances / perceived threat.

So in short, I think as long as Wizarding World wants to stay hidden - there is absolutely nothing the Muggles can do about it.

  Mr. Roberts rummaged around in a tin for some change.

  “Never been this crowded,” he said suddenly, looking out over the misty field again. “Hundreds of pre-bookings. People usually just turn up...”

  “Is that right?” said Mr. Weasley, his hand held out for his change, but Mr. Roberts didn't give it to him.

  “Aye,” he said thoughtfully. “People from all over. Loads of foreigners. And not just foreigners. Weirdos, you know? There's a bloke walking ‘round in a kilt and a poncho."

Giant attacks, for example, are explained as a hurricane so well even the PM and his entire government believes it.

It was pretty early in the book, so that means kids with a month or so of Muggle Studies under their belts probably know much more about Muggles than Mr. Weasley.

Wizards can match Muggle technology any day of the week, no one doubts. The main point of my post is that Wizards have not been keeping up with Muggle technology. They look down my muggle technology thinking it's inferior, and most of them don't understand, and that could be what breaks the statue.

Even if they have a spell that can erase the proof from the internet or a computer. Once the information is out, it's out.

We have the Department of Mysteries in canon. Something such a research team would be located within, but it's not there.

A camera with magic that produces moving pictures is better than a camera without that can't. Etc. pp. You can take any technology and make it better with magic. The only reason why you don't is because you don't feel the need to -- because you like what you have, because everything needn't be done with technology.

Wizards /could/ use charmed ballpens if they wanted to. They don't because charmed quills work just fine. That's not "backward", that's the same reasoning people use when arguing ecology and sustainability. Not everything that can be done actually needs to be done.

Yes, see, this is what I mean. I am assuming wizards have a way to erase knowledge from everyone's mind in one fell swoop if they truly needed to, because we are factually shown such kind of magic exists. You don't, because it's not literally shown. I think that is wrong reading of books and HP magic, but y'know, ¯_(ツ)_/¯

I'm not forgetting that, I'm saying it's irrelevant. Obviously wizards could fly to the moon if they wanted to. Your nuclear bomb can be stopped with a simple shield charm. If there ever was need for more large-scale destruction spells, someone would create one. Apart from the few restrictions mentioned in the books, magic is limitless. And technology will always be limited.

** To be fair, I don't think it will be videos of children that break it. It will be security videos from places like Charing Cross Road, Kings Cross Station, and the phone box that they use for accessing the ministry. These have very high traffic and in the late 90's early 00's were regularly hacked for fun as computer security hadn't caught up with the massive increase in network access available to the general population. To start with, these videos would likely be posted to newsgroups and bbs. But once sites like myspace and youtube get going you'd see them on there as well.

It would probably be posts like, "Guys, did you know that there's a pub on Charing cross road? It doesn't appear on this camera [clip], but if you zoom this camera [clip], this camera [clip], this camera [clip], and this camera [clip] you can clearly see that there's a pub there, though the angle's not good enough to see the name. You also get loads of people in renfaire costumes walking in and out, and occasionally disappearing. If you want to check yourself they're on these MAC Addresses with the polycom port numbers for the city of london wan."

** Conspiracy theorists would be having a field day.

Though the whole 'wizards know nothing about muggles', while somewhat in line with canon examples, cannot be true. They'd have outed themselves a long time ago if every person in the ministry was Arthur Weasley. Hell, they would have never disappeared if that was the case.

IMO the explanation is twofold:

-People that are actually responsible for keeping up the statute - obliviators and some ICW secrecy unit - know what's what. They must, or you'd end up with a lot of weird accidents like people forgetting what a TV is because they've been obliviated of the concept of moving pictures.

-Arthur Weasley's work has nothing to do with muggles - he's basically an unglorified, everyday cursebreaker whose only job is to make sure that whatever muggle artifact leaves his office is 100% magic free.

However, internet and mass media of today, while changing the enforcment somewhat, wouldn't endanger the SoS if the wizards are even minimally competent:

-change the recruitment scheme to visit muggleborns the moment they manifest accidental magic and not on their 11 birthday

-up the strength on muggle-repelling charms so that almost noone can walk into the Leaky Cauldron or see weird stuff on King's Cross

-get major, mainstream news outlets to portray some video feats as nice editing and to riddicule anyone getting too informed as a tin-foil hat conspiracy theorist

-have ICW deal with governments in places where local magical government is purposefully obtuse and refusing to deal with their muggle counterpart (this would propably have to be going for a while anyway)

​

Wizards are kinda OP when it comes to secrecy. The statute couldn't be broken without them willing it to be so, and while it could definitely be something to be dealt with at the brink of the XXI century it would require multi-year preparation of mobile taskforces of healers, charm masters, potioneers and herbalists, preparing production lines, products and services to be sold to the muggles after the SoS is broken to offset most of the negative reaction or potential power struggles that would errupt once people know how powerful and useful magic is.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** I think it'd be a case of Muggle-baiting that did it, most likely, or somebody like Daedalus Diggle being careless. Some pureblood would use magic overtly in front of one or more cameras during a live broadcast/livestream, and thousands or millions of people would see it before Obliviators even knew there was a problem. It could even happen /during/ canon if Death Eaters attacked somewhere near where a TV reporter was live. The Obliviators might wipe the memories of the nearby witnesses, but are they really going to know how to deal with cameras that transmit offsite?

In the Internet era, perhaps things could be kept under wraps through the efforts of a more technologically-aware magical nation. Who's to say that there aren't "ghosts in the machine" courtesy of some technomancers out of Japan, scouring the web and reporting/tracing/altering/erasing any evidence of magic as soon as it's uploaded?

What. Lol. Do you think the Ministry is google's complaints office and looks at flagged videos? I raise you Videotus Deletius, and poof, everything is gone. Without even knowing what it was, where it was, and who put it there. For that matter, you can simply charm things so they can't be recorded in the first place.

I realise this is probably futile, because you have fundamentally different idea of what magic is, but none of what you say is an issue ... because magic. Muggle Tech can be literally Star Trek level. The wizarding world is still hidden. Because magic. They don't need special devisions, they only need what they already have. Because Magic. Magic is literally a fix-all, and in a world where you can bury secrets such that you can't even find them /with/ magic, keeping them in the face of no magic is so easy it's not even worth the five minutes you devote to pondering that issue while in the shower.
