:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I apologise for the bad grammar but I am looking for a fic I read on fanfiction which starts around Goblet of Fire but I don't remember well enough but I do remember that Harry becomes a perfect in his next year and makes a custom map based on marauders map for the new first year students to use and also has a fallout with Ron and Hermione. He does help out with the DA club but only every now and then. In the last chapter I remember the DA club was caught by Umbridge and Harry's in trouble as well as Hermione entered his name in the list of students. During the confrontation in the headmaster's office harry gets pissed off and scares Fudge and his under secretary while Kingsley and Dumbledore stand impressed and towards the end Amelia Bones enter the office and I don't remember after that.


** I can see Harry getting really pissed off at Hermione. This would be the SECOND time he was falsely entered into a binding contract. Now I want to read this.

*** If I remember right the fallout from 4th year never mended and he did go on to become a better prefect and also became popular among the new students since he helped them out a lot

THIS I remember. Shit. Lemme go through my calibre library:o

EDIT - Found the fic that I was thinking of, and it isn't the one you want. On Punching Gods and Absentee Dads has Harry making maps for all the firsties and becoming a favourite of them in chapter 34. I'll keep looking, but tentatively there's going to be a nope from me :(

*** Ok, leaving a tactical comment here in case you actually find it. I'm getting the tingles with every little detail mentioned here, but I can't remember where I read it either. Fffs- I hate my stupid brain sometimes.

**** Yeah. I'm bringing out the big guns and indexing my whole damn library so I can search inside the stories because it's bothering me. Converting 458 stories into .txt and then we'll see: it wasn't jumping out at me from descriptions alone. Here's to hoping I didn't hate the story enough to delete it (I have some pretty awful stories saved that I didn't delete sooooo.)

Bad news is... the keyword is map. Fuck me. Good thing I'm trying to put off cutting the grass, right?

***** That's why I save in Word rather than calibre. I can use the basic Windows folder search... if I can figure out a search term to use that narrows it down. I haven't indexed with keywords.

****** /Most/ of the time I can figure it out by the tagging system I use (genre, pairing, tropes) and then reading the summary, but for random little details? Nuh uh. I will say though that Calibre shines for in-progress fics: hit the in-progress tag, highlight everything and press a button... and it'll search for updates for every single one. Then I can go to the right page and read/comment on the chapter without having to deal with a billion subscriptions in my email.

I had also forgotten that recoll (the indexing thing I use) has epub indexing available. So I converted everything to txt for no reason at all, apparently lol.

  Harry decides things need to change, or this year at Hogwarts would be like the previous three years. Even though what he does is extreme, he finally gets the life he wanted.
