We all know the old goodies, the legendary fanfic that gets debated so much and you re read many times.

But what about the new unheard of fanfic.

What fanfiction would you call an up and coming fanfiction of the year?

Share what you have read that was first posted in this year and is being updated as we speak or that is already complete.

It doesn't matter if it's epic length or a short one or even a one shot, the only requirement is that it was first posted this year.

​

I will start by Adding a Fic that attracted me personally and is being updated every Tuesday

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13315643/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Vault-of-Time][The Vault of time]] which is complete

And Its sequel which is currently being posted

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13374289/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Hands-of-Justice][The Hands of Justice]]


** Saphroneth's /Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay/ ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay]] or [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548]]) fits the bill. It started in March of this year and updated just this week (just yesterday on Spacebattles). Features a charming, laid-back feel while maintaining a substantive plot.

**** Is it important to enjoying the story that you're familiar with the books he reads? I recognize the Discworld series in the first chapter, but the early nineties were before my time so I doubt I'll be overly familiar with a lot of it.

***** I don't think it is that important. The fic itself is witty and fun with solid enough plot. I haven't read all the books they mention either. But the mentions of Discworld and Belgariad make me feel like home in a way.

*** Honestly i remember coming across it but i hesitated to start it as i din't know what to expect

​

I remember reading a creature fic before and that was not a good experince, i remember that the troop was everyone suddenly developing old inheritance and for someone reason everyone is gay and it becomes a male harem

​

While i have nothing against slash, i prefer it to be well done and not the main point of the story like Again and Again

​

So can you give me a brief idea about this before i hit it and start reading

**** So far, there haven't been any mentions of old inheritances iirc. No male harem, and, if there is any slash, it's minor enough that nothing comes to mind.

The basic premise is that a young, pre-Hogwarts age Harry suddenly and irreversibly turns into a dragon. Due to how the Statute of Secrecy functions in this fic, none of the nonmagical people around him notice this, so Harry assumes that turning into a dragon is something that just happens to some people.

I'd say the fic is structured like a slice-of-life series that explores what it's like to study at Hogwarts as a nonhumanoid student, with overarching arcs that comprise of unique takes on canon plot events.

** Birds of a Feather is good, In the Bleak Midwinter, The Gloriana Set is a damn good read, The Cactus made me do it ,is epic and hilarious, time travel with Abraxas Malfoy Desperately trying to get last piece of pie before Lord Voldemort in their seventh year. He keeps miscalculating this time turned turns and ends up at random points in history. He critiques Draco's bouncing Technique as a ferret. Replaces Lockhart As the second year defense against the dark arts professor, and actually teaches in between baking tips on have to get the flakiest Apple pie crust, and he beats Lucious with a broom for giving Ginny Weasley Tom Riddle's diary, because molly Weasley makes the greatest pies in existence. And Father Time is a talking Cactus named Tony that is in heated negotiations with Dumbledore to get Abraxas back to his own time but they need his lemon drops to do it. It's on AO3 the last time I read it.

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** I second "Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay".

And to add to the thread:

Linkffn(13326497)

Started posting in July this year as the first story of a new author and updated a few days ago. Already at 380.000 words and ~1500 reviews and I love it. I'm not even into Marvel, I think Iron Man 2 was the last MCU movie I watched, but the whole story is just fun. And well written.

  power level in this?
#+end_quote

Pretty high. Harry is pretty on top of things right from the beginning, and capable of pulling his weight when he starts teaming up with the locals.

But this story is more about making friends, having a lot of dinners together and using magic to help people out in between the action-y bits. It is a nice and easy read, very little actual conflict. I found it incredibly relaxing
