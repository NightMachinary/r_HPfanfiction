** Just the one, but I have been tempted to create another one for a cliche-ridden pile of crap. My concern is that it would be more popular than my proper account.

** /THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE---/

Ekhm. When I write a shitfic on purpose (that day will come, of that I have no doubt), I want see how quickly it'll eclipse my other stuff in popularity.

** One, but I also have an AO3 account for stories (and I use this term loosely) that would get me banned from FFN.

** Two, technically, but one's abandoned. I made a second when I needed to hide shit from a controlling ex who didn't like me writing certain stuff. Not long after the relationship ended I cleared the account out, changed the username to something generic, and let it go because all the stories were crap anyway.

** Two. But it was because I wanted to make another community and FFN doesn't allow an account to found more than one.

** Probably like 6-10. I really wanted to write reviews when I was younger - I'm sure my feedback was totally useful and valuable (jk, teenage me was a shiiit reviewer). I'm sure I made several accounts.

** Just the one on ffn since like 2003! I don't write enough stories to ever consider making a separate account, and my username never managed to embarrass me enough to abandon it.
