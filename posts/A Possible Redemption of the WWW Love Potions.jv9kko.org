Love potions are, when one thinks about it, horrifying. They're a form of mind-control that happens to be almost tailor-made for use as a date-rape drug. While there are possible uses for them that are ethical, those all rely on the consent of the drinker. If they're being sold at a joke shop, that kind of implies that they're not intended for such uses. This has long been one of the more problematic bits in canon, but what if a little tweaking could fix that?

My idea is this: The WWW-branded love potions have been specially formulated to make the imbiber briefly but intensely infatuated with the subject, but also completely, stridently asexual. They'll want to be close to the object of their affections, maybe hug or cuddle them, but otherwise they'll just make eyes at them and recite terrible poetry. It'd be embarrassing for both parties, but not something that could be taken advantage of. As a possible bonus, it could also somewhat protect would-be victims of more serious love-potioning when their "admirer" goes for the easily-accessible potion rather than brewing one up themself, exposing their intentions without successfully ensnaring the victim.


** Mind control is mind control, imagine being forced to cuddle with someone you find disgusting or personally hate, or not even do any action but make you feel atraction towards someone you really don't.

It's still horrifying, it's a potion that violates the body and the mind taking away your control of both, even with reduced effects it would be way worse than just embarrassing.

*** If you are keen to protect the sanctity of your body and insist that others must not trespass upon it - don't go to Hogwarts. Your goals are not unreasonable, but in the Wizarding world as depicted in canon, I guarantee that you will have all manner of things done to you, as an accepted and normal part of your education, that you will find thoroughly objectionable.

**** When one really looks at it critically, the Potterverse is a dystopian horrorshow. For example, the government can throw people in prison without charge or trial, and said prison operates by continuously torturing the inmates. The guards responsible for said torture also inflict a fate worse than death on escapees and as a form of capital punishment /that they switched to/ */from/* /something far more humane/.

** The only thing even remotely close to love potions that I might give a pass is something that prompts someone to look at a person objectively and judge them by actions, suppressing their existing prejudices, and where tolerance build-up is rapid. And even that is dubious; prejudices aren't all bad, they can help you survive by discouraging you from associating with people you know are likely to bring you harm.

Love potions are immoral unless consent is given, and that was clearly not the case with WWW potions.

My headcanon for why they're legal in first place is that the Wizarding World is still into arranged marriages, and love potions can be used to force passion if you were unable to legitimately fall for your match. This does NOT make them okay, it only explains them being legal.

*** One of the folks I used to follow on Tumblr had a series of askblog-based AUs, one of which, [[https://luminousalicorn.tumblr.com/tagged/potions/chrono]["potions"]], was written by somebody who (1) had been dosed by a love potion, (2) was now brewing that love potion to keep dosing herself, and (3) would happily debate the ethics of love potions with anyone who cared to ask.

It is so incredibly weird to read.

** My preferred way to make love potions less horrible is to have them enhance feelings that already exist / make you want to act on them.

That said, love potions as a concept are terrifying

*** I like this idea. On one hand, the potion will have no effect on the target if they don't already hold an attraction to someone. But on the other hand it can still be dangerous/immoral because it forces someone to act in a way that might be outside their comfort zone. In other words it nullifies some of the darker aspects while retaining its questionable effects.

Also, I can see some psycho types justifying their use of the potion because /if/ it works, then "It's fine, because they already liked me to begin with."

Someone like Merope Gaunt might have used that excuse.

** White Squirrel's Arithmancer series had a similar idea. I remember there being more than one kind of love potion, but they were all mostly harmless like the potioned person wants to kiss the keyed person (so a kiss potion, really) and it stops after the kiss.

*** But imagine the most horrible disgusting person you know and you end up snogging that person until the potion wears off. Now how would you feel?

Sorry but those potions should be illegal and any use of them should have the "gifter" in prison at the least.

**** Considering mind control/mind wipe is considered a civic duty of the wizarding population so as to maintain the Statute of Secrecy, I don't feel like a kissing potion would be as any sort of harm. I don't think love potions should be made or used, but the fact is they are something that exists and a 'part' of the wizarding world. Fred and George are also not ones to think much about the potential harm their products can cause.

** I like that, but to be used as a study aid. A temporary infatuation in a subject at school to make you want to learn or want to study. Good for when you just can't stand a subject or really need to cram the night before an exam.

** The closest to an "ethical" interpretation of one I can imagine is as a focuse potion, making the drinker pay attention to the target.

** What about treating it as a mental suggestion potion? Key word being 'suggestion'; when you drink it you get the mental equivalent of 'Prompt; declare your love to Oriana Chadwick' (or if you prefer, Selene Innsbrook) and a little 'go on, you can do it' nudge.\\
So the only real effect would be to reduce your inhibitions/nerves, and point you in a direction; your actions (and how silly they are) would be up to you.\\

It's probably not compatible with canon, given what happened to Ron with the spiked cauldron cakes, but I think it might be a good way to handle them.

** This has always been my interpretation. Their love potions just makes the person want to confess their love, and they'll actually turn violent if anything sexual is tried.

** My take on it is that the less dangerous ones (Amortentia excluded) is that they are aphrodisiacs that enhance the desire for a specific person. In real life, oysters are powerful aphrodisiacs but you don't lose control after eating them and in order for them to have an actual effect on the brain, you still need to be attracted to the person. Ron was a teenage boy and, as most horny teenage boys, he found attractive most decently looking girls. Also in the books it's stated that the more aged the potion, the more potent it gets, which was probably was a side effect that the twins not aware of. All in all, love potions are not considered dark magic in universe and most likely the consumer still has some autonomy over their decisions.

** But almost all magic is shown to be as moral as its intended use instead of possessing an inherent morality. Even Crucio is called "gallant" by McGonagall when Harry uses it on one of the Carrows. Not to get dark, but Petrificus totalus could be used for rape or sexual assault, and it's a first-year spell.

I think the WWW love potions were meant to be taken more seriously by readers than some people suggest. One of those love potions indirectly leads to Ron almost dying, and WWW sold the Peruvian darkness powder the Death Eaters use the night Dumbledore is murdered. There is a dark side to the Wizarding World, even the "good" part of it.
