[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10402749/1/War-Paint][War Paint]] by provactive envy

#+begin_quote
  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9097983/1/Without-Thorn-the-Rose][Without Thorn the Rose]] by Threadbare Threnody

#+begin_quote
  A bittersweet coming-of-age story for fans of good writing. Lily died, and left James to raise a stranger's son alone. In the shadows of Azkaban, Harry learns from Dementors and Death Eaters, while in the caverns of the sea a mysterious power awaits the chance to steal his soul. Warnings inside.

*** Wow, War Paint is quite something! Dark, but electrifying. I really thought I had been through pretty much everything good on FF.net, so happy to be surprised by something new! Every time I discard a 'ship as being too ridiculous someone comes along and does it plausibly.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/After-the-End][After the End!]] a completed post-Hogwarts tale written before OotP came out, counting 632,204 words. Because it was written so early and before all the clichés became those clichés it reads like a breath of fresh air. Even though the pairings are HP/GW and RW/HG. There is a good amount of Angst (not only Harry's, Action, Romance and some Fluff. No Prohpecy, no horcruxes, no Deathly hallows, no Black family or other Houses.

** I started out my HP fanfiction journey on MNFF *well* over a decade ago, and apparently still have an account there (?!) which has some favorites bookmarked (?!?!). The first two I specifically remember liking, the third was a bookmark that looked like it may be interesting to others, if a little melodramatic...

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=85107][Girl Talk & Goodbyes]] by WeasleyMom [COMPLETE, ONE SHOT, hints of Hr/R, missing moment type of fic]

#+begin_quote
  The wedding cake is gone; the bride and groom are honeymooning. Yet Molly Weasley cannot seem to relax and enjoy the family that lingers in the aftermath of the celebration. She knows the easy laughter they enjoy tonight will be short lived, because three teenagers are leaving in the morning with a job so serious no one will even speak its nature aloud. Molly knows no magic that will stop morning from coming. But she can make stew and fan the flames of laughter; she can tell someone something she's been wanting to say for years. And she can hold them all while she has them.

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=60226][Draco, The Babysitter]] by mgle_teacher [ABANDONED, Chaptered, not a Dramione, humor without crack!fic]

#+begin_quote
  After a potion goes awry, Draco finds himself as the newly appointed babysitter of one Hermione Granger, age: 4. As if that wasn't humiliating enough, his wand is confiscated by Potter and he is forced to do everything the dreaded Muggle way.

[[http://fanfiction.mugglenet.com/viewstory.php?sid=16049][24 Hours]] by snuffles2984 [COMPLETE, ONE SHOT, haven't re-read]

#+begin_quote
  Sirius Black has just lost everything in his life worth living for...now all he wants is revenge. Takes place after the Potters' death. Rated T for some violence and language.

#+begin_quote
  The Dark Army has no place for a man who can't kill, yet Draco Malfoy is not about to join the Light... is he? Stuck in a house with Remus Lupin, it's well past time for Draco to reflect, grow, and make the choice between what is right and what is easy

A great fic with a very in character Malfoy and Lupin. Has a few flaws but overall is really well written. GEN.

** It just started and is only 9 chapters in but one of the best HP romance fics I've ever read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young With Me]]

#+begin_quote
  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.
#+end_quote

Summary is a little generic but it is one of the best stories I've started in awhile, and the relationship feels very real.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6337450/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Turning-of-the-Sun][Harry Potter and the Turning of the Sun]]

#+begin_quote
  AU past OP-After Harry is thrust back in time, he has to survive his final years in Hogwarts and live his new life around people he knows will become Death Eaters. Can he beat his prejudices and give people a chance, or will he crumble under the pressure?

It's pretty interesting, and the only Harry/Bellatrix story that remains true to the original characters, and their friendship/romance is very well done imo.

*** I like this- it gets me right in the feels. I don't often like Harry/Ginny, but him as that wreck of a person trying to hold his life together for his kids seems so in-character for canon!Harry. And the depressing setting isn't merely whining and angsting, he's actually trying.

** I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10511318/1/Just-Another-Orphan][Just Another Orphan]], sadly it hasn't been updated since November, but in a PM the author told me the story is not abandoned, so there is hope ;) Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.

*** This was a good fic. The feels between Theo (Harry's best friend, in this fic) and Harry were real. It was a very natural take on being a teenager during the dawning of a war. Not at all overdone. Thanks for the rec!
