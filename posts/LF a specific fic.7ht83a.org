I read this a while ago and would like to read it again. It had an indy!Harry who lived in a tent in the Dursley's yard which contained the ghost of an Asian man who taught him stuff. He also had a chain with some sort of concealing enchantment that Dumbledore didn't like and disabled it, leading to him being unhappy and persecuted during the Heir of Slytherin crisis.
