In some fics that I've been reading recently, there has been one particular trope that continuously bugs me, which is that of Molly Weasley trying to force Ginny and Harry together, which leads to the total annihilation of any relations to the Weasleys, sometimes leading to Ron being killed.

Where does this come from in Universe and why does it seem to be popular?


** Harry Potter is so full of scenes that can easily be interpreted as manipulative, set-up and forced, that the quick and rough romance of Harry and Ginny may seem like a set-up as well to the cynical mind.

The random encounter at Kings Cross is one of those scenes that can easily be explained away, or used as evidence for the evil austrian-archduke channeling Molly Weasley to marry her children to as much money, prestige and magical power/knowledge as possible.

If you want the Weasleys to be greedy bastards, then you can start at Book 1 and end at Book 7 and you'll have the greatest conspiracy to make Harry Potter their capital, ready for your story to use. There /are/ more convoluted plans in this series. Drugging Harry with lovepotion isn't so far out there.

I hold the opinion that once, long ago, this trope could've made a good story. Unfortunatly, Weasley and Dumbledore bashing destroyed that hope for all time.

*** In the scope of a self contained book ( here meaning that Harry Potter wasn't a series) I fully believe that the Kings Crossing scene is easily explained.

But once we delve into the works and the world I cannot do so.

So how do you? I'm genuinely curious.

I'm not one to jump on the 'Steal all Harry's shit' theory but I can't just explain that scene away.

**** Imagine you have a bunch of kids. Every year you send some off to school. While doing so you have to occupy the minds of the kids that are not send off, but will be all focussed on their older siblings leaving. What many parents do in such a case is making the kids in question feel included /useful by asking questions. It probably is a tradition that those kids not going to school are supposed to answer.

It also makes sure the younger ones know where to meet if you get separated.

Now, Molly's "littlest kid" is ten, not five, so that tactic is probably not overly sucesful, but Molly knows it is different this year, with ALL of Ginny's brothers leaving and, not quite knowing how to help her feel better, she resorts to old parenting tricks, even if her child is actually a bit too old for that.

--------------

At least that's how I always interpreted the scene.

**** The most innocent explanaition: A game. Remember that Ginny is 10, Ron is 11 and the twins are 12. It wouldn't be too far out that Molly is just teasing them by asking where the gate is.

Or we could entertain the thought of it being planned, but with benevolent reasons. Dumbledore knows that Harry isn't even informed of the wizarding culture, but refrains from too direct an impact. He asks Molly to place herself at 9^{3/4} and guide Harry through.

The reason why ROn sought Harry out can also easily be explained away by the fact that he's the Boy-Who-Lived and Ron was curious. Taking a leap of faith he decides to sit with the hero.

And so on and so forth. There are many explanations out there.

** For some reason I thought that Molly is seen talking about love potions with Ginny and Hermione during the visit to WWW in HP6. I think she even states that she used one to get Arthur's attention, but I might be mixing up canon with fanfic.

It could be innocent, joking girl-talk or not. Makes some cynical readers assume that a love potion is the reason for Harry and Ginny's relationship and Hermione and Ron's relationship.

** It doesn't come from in-universe. It comes from butthurt Harmonians, who never cared much about canon in the first place.

In fact, in canon Molly is unhappy about Harry and Ginny being together. In the beginning of DH, Ginny has to confront Molly about it, IIRC.

Molly also wasn't happy at all about the marriage of Bill and Fleur, despite Fleur's "prestige".

** 3 lines does not qualify as a rant, buddy.

Anyway, if you've read fics like that, you've probably noticed that they come from the same group of people, A.K.A Harmony shippers. Arguably, the most infamous subfandom within the entire Harry Potter fanbase. Not to say that they are all awful, but they haven't given themselves a good name.

They generally try to justify their points by calling Ron an abusive second coming of satan as well as calling Ginny a one-dimensional fangirl, all the while conveniently ignoring any moments of character from either of the two and also while forgetting any of Harry and Hermione's flaws.

In fact, if I remember correctly, when Molly talks about using a love potion with Ginny and Hermione in HBP, Hermione's reaction is giggling. Yet Ron is of course the person who drugged her for realsies.

It's not nearly as popular as you think though. Keep in mind that only a very small percentage of the HP fanbase read HP fanfiction. I guarantee that if you that if someone were to go the HP reddit and say that Harry and Ginny were drugged by Molly with love potion, they will stare at you like you just sucked off a Hippogriff.

*** But it also isn't limited to Harmony shippers. Really, a lot of stories out there that /don't/ have Harry/Ginny try to justify it by making Ginny completely incompatible. What is the easiest way to do this? Make any possible canon connection a result of love potions!

I've seen the love potions plot in Harry/Luna, Harry/Daphne, Harry/Severus, Harry/LV, Harry/Draco and Harry/Richard B. Riddick (yes, from Pitch Black) to name a few. The love potions plot comes up fairly often in slash stories to also justify Harry changing his sexual orientation.

Why people don't just write the events in their stories to not include Harry/Ginny in the first place I don't totally understand, but it probably comes back to the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStationsOfTheCanon][stations of the canon]].^{Warning:} ^{TVtropes}

Because a lot of fanfic authors are bad. Since they're bad they fall back on cliches and overused tropes. I'm not saying that's always a bad thing and sometimes they're used well or in interesting ways.

But 90% of the time it's because an author is lazy or bad or both.

A good author might explain away the Harry/Ginny relationship by simply ignoring it happened or adding a line about how they tried dating but in the end decided to be friends. If you want a decent reason perhaps Ginny had trouble living up to the expectations of being Harry's partner. Being the girlfriend/wife of Harry Potter probably comes with a lot of public scrutiny that she may not want. (It doesn't really work in canon since she becomes a famous Quidditch player but a good author could find something)

Instead bad authors fall back on overused poorly explained cliches like Molly and Ginny using love potions to force Harry to love her. (Even though we see how love potions work in HBP and that's not even close to what happens with Harry) They're probably the same authors that think having a love interest walk in on a rival forcing themselves on Harry is good relationship drama. Spoiler alert it's not.

** In HBP (iirc) Mrs. Weasley cracks a minor joke about love potions. Maybe it wasn't even a joke, I don't have the book handy. Of course, to the avid Harmony shippers out there, this is clear evidence that she is involved in an evil plan to get Ginny and Harry together. I think it's also a symptom of the "chest monster syndrome" that Harry seems to have - the vociferous crew decided to latch on this as ultimate proof of the Weasley matriarch's corruption, even insinuating that that was how she got Arthur.

Pretty much all Weasley-bashing can be attributed to radical Harmonians, as a rule of thumb.

Just because Rowling has a few fleeting doubts about the Hr/R pairing doesn't mean that Harry and Hermione make sense by default. I don't think JKR writes romance very well at all, so I'm quite happy that things ended up as they did.

****** To provide a similar rebuttal, but not being as frothy-at-the-mouth-y as the other bloke was, JKR never did say she would have put Harry and Hermione together, when looking back. She was much more diplomatic in saying that it might have been a valid path to go down (or, "it /could/ have happened"). The only thing JKR stated unconditionally was that Ron and Hermione aren't very compatible, and that she ended up pairing them together for reasons more personal than they were narratively sound. She went on to say Ron and Hermione's marriage would have required a lot of work to last as long as it does in canon. She didn't ever say that Harry and Hermione should have married; that was just a misquote the media ran with.
