** I don't have any fan fiction for you but I just wanna say that I've been in a similar spot to you so I'll just say: fuck the other person, they didn't treat you right and deserve you no matter what bs they said or made up. So on behalf the HP community I also want to say that we are here to support you as we are all a family that got tied together because of something beyond incredible and decades on we are still together which makes us a better family than I (and many others) could ever ask for to help in hard times. You will get through this and we are here with you. Together we will make it through anything.

** I am very sorry for you, to get dumped right before Valentine's day must be awful. There is one fic I know that may be good for you right now, and it's [[https://iulia-linnea.livejournal.com/523403.html][His Mother's Son, by Iulia Linnea]]. It's a oneshot focused on Ron Weasley and deals with the dissolution of a relationship. While the side ship of this story is quite improbable, there is no bashing involved toward any character, and the topic and its consequences are dealt with in a very mature and sensible way. I understand that these are not the topics you asked for, but I'm not very in this fandom so I don't know many fics, and the fic is quite respectful, so perhaps you may find it interesting anyway.

Again I am very sorry for you, and wish you to find someone better who treats you right and whom you may be happy with. Best wishes for a good year, and may you feel better soon!

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6943436/19/][Chapter 19: Epilogue of A Pureblood Princess]]

You can by all means read the story itself. But I didn't care much it. I actually read the epilogue first and it got me hooked to the point of finishing it. Went back to the story itself afterwards and it just didn't hook me like that epilogue did.

It easily reads as a decent length standalone one shot.
