What trope/cliche in Harry Potter fanfiction do you find to be the least annoying out of all the bad ones?


** Runes having magical properties. And yes, I know there's no evidence of that in canon. But I like that it makes the subject more useful, and it ties in nicely with belief that writing has power (like Roman curse tablets or Japanese omamori).

*** To be honest I actually think the topic of runes needs to be extended in order to make it into a viable subject that students can take for 5 years at school. For example, this is an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry about the futhark runes: "The Elder Futhark (named after the initial phoneme of the first six rune names: F, U, Þ, A, R and K) has 24 runes, often arranged in three groups of eight runes called an ætt[2] (pl. ættir)."

If ancient runes was only about learning this kind of stuff by heart (and even extending it to learning languages that are written in those runes) it just doesn't seem like a particularly difficult subject and it doesn't have much of an application for wizards other than reading old books. To me the whole subject becomes a lot more interesting when it's extended to cover things like creating objects with long-lasting magical effects, like in The Arithmancer.

**** ...I mean, in real life, 3-5 years for a class to learn to read a language is probably reasonable, plus they only meet a couple times a week. JK Rowling also based some of the general structure of magic on real life, so presumably or rather, at a minimum, the half-dozen runic alphabets that exist in real life could easily fill five years. Even assuming they don't learn how to "speak," it's not like you really need more "material" to cover in a language class.

I don't /mind/ and sometimes enjoy when they extend them to be magical, if done well, but many authors treat it as "runes/arithmancy are an ultimately powerful form of magic, Harry + Ron in canon are completely stupid for not having studied them." It'd still be plenty hard for ~13 year olds to pick up and memorize, even before you start to include magical symbology or using runes to create magical objects or whatever the author feels like doing.

***** Totally true, but it doesn't seem like canon even includes learning a lot of linguistic constructs, it just looks more like "this one means protection, care, empathy, etc." Kind of like learning flower symbolism or something like that rather than learning an actual language. That's why I think it either needs to be more academic (e.g. more linguistics) or more magical.

But I definitely dislike the "Harry + Ron in canon are completely stupid for not having studied them" approach. It's just going into bashing of characters for no reason.

****** That's fair, and I think I mentioned above that I'm more of a fan of the academic interpretation. And while learning to recognize them doesn't take long, recall and writing takes a fair bit longer. One possible interpretation is that "Runes" doesn't just cover runic (i.e. Germanic) alphabets, but also "ancient languages" that may be important a la hieroglyphs, Greek, cuneiform, etc (hence why Bill Weasley goes cursebreaking in Egypt). Even before you get into linguistics/usage, there's a lot you could cover.

Still, fundamentally we don't actually know what they cover in the class. I do think you can say that

#+begin_quote
  it doesn't seem like canon even includes learning a lot of linguistic constructs,
#+end_quote

considering that the only time we /really/ see them in canon is Hermione talking about mixing up two of them and their meanings. If that's the level of questions that they're getting on their OWLs, after 3 years of study, maybe you're right they're not covering linguistics at all, or only covering at the NEWT level, but maybe they are and we aren't actually shown it. Maybe there's more to the symbolism and symbology than just what we would associate with them in flower symbolism, considering how we see long essays in other subjects and full individual books that have been published and cover only a single spell. I just don't think that that directly translates to "more magical" aspects.

The students take years of Astronomy, and there's very little indication that it really ties into other magical fields of study, especially when the practical portion of their canon OWL in the subject was filling out a blank star chart. I don't necessarily see why the material in something like Runes needs to be any more complex than that. I like the interpretation that they're using it since it impacts spells or potions or herbology in the future, but it's not really something that's explicitly stated. For all we know, Hogwarts could be fashioned like old-school universities, where the main purpose is for people to gain a general breadth of knowledge in esoteric fields rather than anything "practical."

Again, I think it goes back to the fact that Runes are something that exist in the real world, that there are scholars, books, professors, and entire departments that focus on runology, and that most of what Rowling covers magically has some analogue in the real world that she used as inspiration.

For me, I've only really seen runes use to handwave in super-magic, which is why I'm generally leery of them in fics. Prince of Slytherin seems to be treating them well, but in a much more deliberate manner. Crosswinds of Fate talks about Runic Magic, but that's because it crosses over with a world where that actually exists as an active type of magic, and runes in the HP-world still follow canon by not having any inherent application of rune-based magic in the base Ancient Runes class.

There are several mentions of Hermione performing translations, which would seem to indicate that Ancient Runes is not just the study of the runes but logically also the languages which used said runes as an alphabet.

Here's a link to a collection of canon quotes regarding runes:

******* This will likely always come down to personal interpretation but to me, those quotes do not necessarily prove that they are studying an actual language. There are repeated mentions of Hermione using dictionaries and syllabaries but nothing more complex than that; no grammar references, conjugation charts, etc. For all we know, The Tales of Beedle the Bard could have just been written in Middle English, making it difficult to translate due to its use of archaic words and phrases rather than actually being written in a separate language. They might have studied other languages, but I don't think there's any evidence to say that they definitely did so.

I also don't know about the abuse in general- JK Rowling was basically drawing on a common trope in British children literature with no further thought put into it, and while Harry was clearly affected by his time at the Dursley's, some fics run with the assumption and treat it as canon that the Dursley's broke a dozen bones in Harry's body before he was 6. Like, why berate /canon/ characters for stuff that /authors/ make up for the purposes of their fic?

*** The cores themselves aren't the problem. It's when they are considered measurable that the trope becomes obnoxious, because magical power then becomes a dick-measuring contest. It's the essence of show vs. tell:

"He's got a 10609! Even Dumbledore's is only 9444!"

"Yeah, but what does that /mean/?"

The author has reduced the mysteries of magic to a game mechanic, and changed the nature of most arguments about whether someone is magical or not. It also puts an artificial restriction on acts of heroism -- 'You must be greater than 9000 to properly engage in battle with a Gamma-class wizard.' Most of the theme of the series was the idea of capability not being in-born but a matter of how one engaged the world. Great acts can be done by modest people, and even the uber-monsters can make mistakes and exhibit flaws.

***** A lot of authors do, and it can be annoying. There's certainly some level of stratification in magical ability, but that can be attributed to multiple sources, and Harry Potter has a strong bend of conceptual magic to it. Furthermore, from Harry's use of Sectumsempra in canon, the common fanfic-trope of magic only working because of visualization, or worse yet Wishcraft, isn't necessarily a hard and fast rule
