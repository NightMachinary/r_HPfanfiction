Not sure what to add. No jilted Ginny I guess.

Edit1: I Just think Harry's courtship of Luna would be hilarious. At every base Harry gets to Luna would say something scatter brained to throw him off his game

**** Some parts, especially Year 2, track canon too closely for my taste. But Year 3 plot is excellent. Harry/Luna actions begin in earnest in Year 4.

The sequel *Animagus at War* completely left canon track though.

I also like how Dumbledore is depicted in this fic. He made mistakes, he was manipulating things, but he was honestly trying, and he had to fend off tough enemies, both domestic and foreign.

**** Harry and Hermione have a true sibling relationship in this story. Ron is still their friend, but Neville is closer. Overall, Weasleys play a less important role than in canon.

Both good and bad guys are much stronger. The Carrow twins are quite the comic relief, Barty Jr is really smart, and La Pantera is so cool.
