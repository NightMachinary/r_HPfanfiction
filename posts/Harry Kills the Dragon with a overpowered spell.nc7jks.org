:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
hello i need some help find a fic that i read ages ago it was a goblet of fire fic i can recall few details to help with search but I've had no luck finding it the details are the following

im 50 % percent it on fanfiction .net

i cant remember what the pairing was but defiantly wasn't a slash pairing but i know it was a harry pairing

before the first task harry discovers the dragons in the forbidden forest

then his either attacked by karkaroff or another death eater in the forest and is thrown in the dragon

enclosure / pen / cage with the horn tail harry cant escape and the dragon handlers including Charlie Weasley run to try and rescue him but they cant get past a ward or shield so harry on his own harry kills the dragon with a overpowered spell and claims the dragon carcass

even with all these details I couldn't find it so I'm hoping someone will recognise it and can find it

any help would be much appreciated thank you in advance


** It may be A Sirius Matter by witowsmp. There's a scene in that story like you describe (Chapter 28).
