So the title says it all. I'm currently reading (and anxiously waiting for the next chapter of) "The Memento" by Theine. I love the premise of Harry finding a snake in the Dursley's garden and befriending it. I like the changes it brings I to his life (though I am hoping for more Hedwig). I was wondering if any of you had any good recommendations. Preferably no Harry/Ginny or Hermione/Ron pairings. It doesn't have to Harmony and it doesn't have to be romance but I really don't like those two pairings Hermione/Ron most of all. Thanks in advance!

  The first time Harry became a snake slithering through a forest, he thought he was dreaming. But he soon realised that in fact he was switching bodies with a magic snake. A very special snake who swiftly became his childhood friend -- for when he came back to Privet Drive after body-swapping things were always better for him. Harry & Voldemort friendship, pre-Hogwarts, Dark!Harry.

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  Until he befriends a grass snake in his aunt's garden Harry believes his relatives when they say there is no such thing as magic. Looking for a place to belong, he ventures into an elusive world shackled by age-old prejudices and fear of a man who may or may not be his father. What he finds is more than he expected, but less than he hoped. First Year AU

** You might enjoy these fics in which Harry has a snake friend/familiar.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10748108/1/A-Brother-to-Basilisks][A Brother to Basilisks]] - Harry bonds with a basilisk hatchling from the Chamber of Secrets near the beginning of year 4. Everyone is less than happy about this, especially Dumbledore.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis]] - A WBWL story. Harry rescues a snake from the zoo (not the constrictor) when he is very young, and it becomes his closest (only?) friend. Compared to "The Memento", this fic is a much heavier take on what Harry's life might have become if he grew up without loving caretakers. If you start reading this fic, prepare for an emotional roller-coaster (that mostly only goes downhill).

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
