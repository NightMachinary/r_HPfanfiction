Harry's in a best place and perhaps the best thing for him is to just leave. It's fortunate that the Group has recently perfect a piece of magic that allows people to move across the multiverse and it's better still that he's been tapped to chart worlds as they prepare for a tourism venture.

But Harry has never been particularly lucky. The first world he travels to is filled with strange magical people, stranger rules and, worse yet, strange creatures that just /destroy./

He has no other choice but to help them, even with all the trouble that might bring.

(If it sounds cryptic, it's because I'm a bit iffy on what constitutes spoilers.)


** I tried reading it, and for what it's worth, I think it was well written. But I couldn't get past all the OCs in the Worm universe, they just weren't that interesting to me. If it had been set in Brockton Bay I think it would have been a lot better.

*** I stumbled across this fic the other day, (hell I only found out about the WORM series last month) and I kinda have to agree with you. It is well written, but I haven't found it to be all that engaging so far.
