Only the most vocal people on this sub, but if you search "bashing" you'll see a bunch of requests for everyone from Neville to Draco.

Except maybe Harry, but that's covered by trope subversion prompts and requests.

**** Canon by definition cannot be a Harry Bash because its entirely written from Harry's point of view. Even the beginning of SS even though he cant remember it . The only scenes in all 7 books i can think of that are not from his view was Snape's promise to Narcissa at the beginning of HBP. By definition he was the hero ,even if he was an idiot hero of his own story. Everything is justified because it was his choice. A alt POV story from Draco of all 7 books, that would be bashing. Not shaking his hand in book 1. Making him look bad in the quidditch game in book 2. Getting him punched by Hermione in book 3. Getting him turned into a weasel unjustly in book 4. Attacking him on the train back in book 5. Attacking him without provocation in the bathroom in book 6. And making him and his mother defend that wanker in book 7.

Most of the characters are just so . . . stupid in HBP, that sometimes Harry feels like the only one who is not blind: "Harry, there is no way that the guy who came from a Death Eater family, who was seen hanging out with Voldemort's supporter, who bragged being a Death Eater and acted suspicious as shit since the start of the year is a Death Eater.

****** Yup, exactly this. The idea that Voldemort would be setting Draco up with a nearly-impossible task that would likely lead to his death, as a punishment for his father's failings would simply not have crossed their minds - and why would it? While Harry has by this point seen, heard, and experienced some pretty dark and intense stuff, Ron and Hermione have largely experienced the bulk of it secondhand (not downplaying what they did experience prior to the Ministry expedition, to be clear), or simply less of it. They would absolutely conceive of something more simplistic and grounded in reality: Draco simply being made a Death Eater, which would be absurd because there are so many other fully-qualified wizards who could do Voldy's bidding more effectively.

****** The only possible explanation is that the book's annotations allowed Harry to not properly study, causing him to fail when not relying on the book. However, Hermione's entire message is "using books is bad". Which is clearly an in-character response for someone who holds book knowledge, with certain exceptions, as gospel

That, and the extent of Potions consisting of following instructions (how does it take seven years to learn how to read a recipe?).

***** HBP was just a huge mess looking back at it. Everyone's characterisation went to shit. That book really made it feel like Harry had no agency at all. I know his character isn't supposed to be some prodigious superhero, but he showed plenty of initiative learning the patronus charm his 3rd year, learning spells for the tournament, teaching the DA, etc, and it feels like he does fuck all the year after he learns there's a prophecy and he'll have to fight Voldemort. Like your telling me if someone else was put in that situation they wouldn't be trying to learn as much as they possibly could?

I think HBP is largely the reason why I've became more dissatisfied with DH as I've gotten older, instead of an earned victory Harry's able to win after several deus exs.

** Nah. It's specifically Weasley-Bashing that they are against (especially Ron). Everyone else is fair game. We're at that point in counter-culture where Ron is the exalted one and Hermione is garbage (in terms of general fandom trend). I'm really hoping this phase passes by quickly, and fandom gets to that point in counter-counter-culture where we all understand that the story gave us nuanced characters and that everything would be much more interesting if we actually maximized that nuance. This new trend is just so tiring.

** Well, I haven't looked at the subreddit in a while, but Hermione-hate is pretty, well, 'normal'. Or at least hate on the perfect fanfiction version of Hermione. It seems like the people that like Ron and dislike the heavy bashing that has been going on for the last 10 years or so, has to take a sort of 'revenge' on Hermione. Because in some fanfiction she's portrayed as perfect while Ron/Ginny get heavily bashed.

I personally don't agree with bashing in general, I very much avoid bash fics and at the same time, I don't condone people taking 'revenge' on behalf of Ron/Ginny, just because some people enjoy writing or consuming bash fics it doesn't mean you can shit all over them. I think we should live and let live, honestly. Sure bash fics might not be the most beautiful character study you'll ever read but I personally think ignoring their existence is the best course of action.

This "I'll bash your favourite character because you bashed mine" is sort of petty. Fandom wars have always been, after all.

** One thing to realize with this sub is that it's got a different population than the typical Harry Potter fanfiction community. Sometimes that's a good thing - the view on Ron/Weasleys, for instance, is a lot more positive (which is a breath of fresh air compared to more standard Weasley-bashing).

But that also manifests itself in a much more negative view of Hermione. It's been that way for a long time at this point - and that'll lead to requests bashing her (or having more consequences for her actions) being upvoted.

Similarly, you'll see the same with Draco and Snape, who are viewed more negatively here than elsewhere, and perhaps Neville.

She's so smart, and powerful, and perfect for Harry hurr durr. Or that she worships those with authority, and will always tell Dumbledore/Mcgonnagal everything about Harry, because they(Harry and Ron) obviously don't know any better, completely forgetting that she lied to Mcgonnagal within the first two months with the troll.

*** Canon Hermione has her flaws which are rarely taken seriously though. I personally haven't been too interested in her character but I think it's worth noting that 1) she held a human being captive in a jar for an undetermined amount of time (some say a year, and I've seen her get praised for that by fans?? But I think it was “only” for a few weeks) and 2) she permanently disfigured one of her classmates - both of which she never expresses any moral concerns with. The reason these cases are noteworthy in my opinion is that these were not battle-like circumstances, not life or death. Again, personally I really like ambiguous characters and I don't really care for either bashing or glorifying but it is interesting how several of canon hermione's characteristics are downplayed in general.

** In my experience, when you search for Hermione centric fics you often find yourself reading a story where her canon flaws are barely touched upon. If any of the flaws are allowed to have some kind of consequence it's of no importance. Perhaps this is why requests are made for her to be more flawed in fanon.

I love it when you find a fic that explores both Hermiones "good" and "bad" traits without tipping over into /Mary-sue-mione/ or pure bashing, but they are hard to find and probably tricky to write.

** simple. Backlash.

1. For years the general hp-fandom has brutally bashed and shat on characters like Ron for such things as 'being mean to our precious mistress Hermione' despite her being just as awful to him at several points through the story, yet no one ever calls her out for anything, not even in the story itself.
2. The fandom in general has worshipped Hermione to the point where it is just common that she is a mary-sue character in fanfics. People are getting sick of this shitty writing and awful representation of an actually good character and are finally pushing back and reminding people that Hermione has actual flaws.\\
   And because of how insane the Hermione-stans are, the pushback is just as harsh and brutal.

Edit: I am not saying I agree with it, I am just giving reasoning because I can fully understand the mindset. If others hadn't done it by now, I would likely be doing it myself, as I am a Ron fan and pretty fucking tired of everyone shitting on him for years.

** And yet there's no new recs huh?

/cracks knuckles/

Fanon Hermione irritates the /fuck/ out of me. To copy a previous comment of mine (which was originally written by a Redditor who has since deleted their account):

Canon Hermione is just walking talking bossy exposition at first, then becomes this near-perfect wonderwitch that rarely, if ever, gets taken to task. The movies made it 10x worse.

But fanon Hermione...It's /fanon/ Hermione that I cannot stand. Fanon Hermione, who is practically Einstein levels of intelligence in First Year. Fanon Hermione, who can come up with an immunity to the Avada Kedavra. Fanon Hermione, who is a beautiful Goddess, sexier than any Veela. Fanon Hermione, who is Harry's only REAL friend, not like that bastard Ron who rapes kittens and is just a Death Eater in disguise.

I hate Fanon Hermione because she's just so damn /perfect/. I understand why so many people make Fanon Hermione like that. Guys like her because she was played by Emma Watson, girls want to be her, so that's the image of Hermione in their heads.

But that doesn't mean I have to like it.

It seems as though every fic I read, Harry becomes best pals with Hermione. Dark!Harry? Hermione is right there getting dark with him. Squib!Harry? Haha, guess the name of the dentists he starts going to. Harry runs away from home? Where else would he run to but the Grangers? Racist Harry calls her the magical equivalent of the N-word? Naturally, Hermione forgives him because she isn't like that bitch Lily.

It's a fucking cop-out. She's used /everywhere/, look no furthur than [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jtvjft/promt_ron_post_book_7_comes_down_with_a_disease/][this thread]] where someone suggested Ron could be Walter White. Immediately the Hermione stans came in like, /snort/ "WhAt If HeRmIoNe WaS wAlTeR iNsTeAd?" /snort/. I'd love to see /other/ characters get the damn limelight for once. Maybe Harry winds up meeting Dean before Hogwarts or something? Harry befriends the Creeveys? Ron and Fleur friendship fic? Dean and Ron bond over Quidditch and football? There are hundreds of ideas. Just stop it with this home at the Grangers crap.

And I haven't even gotten started on how H/HR seems to be shoved into pretty much everything, often including Ron/Ginny/Molly bashing.

/end paraphasing

The amount of praise that's heaped on Hermione in 95% of fics is directly proportional to the amount of hate Ron gets in the same fics. If I want to find a fic were Ron betrays Harry and Harry stays friends with Hermione, there's hundreds. Harry and Hermione never befriend Ron? It's there. A Ron-bashing "crack" fic? (/cough/ HP and the Champion's Champion /cough/) You got it. There's even plenty of fics where Harry bails on both Ron and Hermione and goes his own way (Indy!Harry).

But if you try to find fics where Ron and Harry do their own thing w/o Hermione? It's the same 4 or 5 rec'd every time. Fics where Hermione is bashed and Ron's left alone or the hero? Same thing. Every time a popular fic comes up in recs there's a good chance MarySue!Hermione will make an appearance. The only times she /might/ get bashed is when Harry is or starts dating a Slytherin, and Ron/Ginny/Molly/Dumbledore are often included.

I don't have a problem with bashing characters, but no one can deny that some get hit harder than others, and Ron is the hardest hit after Dumbledore.

And the most hilarious thing is the Hermione/Harmony shippers that bitch about there not being enough "Hermione-centric fic" or whatever. It's the 10% complaining about being taxed too much or some shit like that.

Don't believe me? Check these conversations out:

*** Not to distract from the main point, but... I kinda feel like a fic presenting Hermione as Walter White would be absolutely /brutal/ to Hermione.

Like, Walter's whole deal is that he was once a brilliant scientist, did some great things in his youth, and then spent thirty years losing his friends and ruining his life beyond repair entirely because of his own pride and irrationality. He started making meth with a drugged-out, flunked student thirty years his junior just so he can prove to himself before he dies that his life wasn't over in 1985.

You know, it actually kind of hurts, thinking about Hermione that way? Imagining a version of Hermione whose absolute highest point was helping Harry defeat Voldemort at age 18, and from that point on her life plummeted irrecoverably down a cliff. And, like -- I can /absolutely/ see it of her, too, she /is/ that pointlessly prideful at times... :(

**** For me, there's a spectrum of bashing. You can start with the character making decisions that they might have made according to their canon characterization that make them antagonistic, which isn't really bashing. From there, there's minor bashing with the character's negative traits from canon being amplified. Then there's the character just carrying the idiot ball and existing only to be an antagonist, and of course you can mix and match and have stuff in between. I think most of us are thinking of the third type, and maybe a bit of the second, when we talk about bashing and how we don't like it. And that's understandable; as bashing gets more extreme characters tend to cease being characters with motivations and just become plot points masquerading as characters.

But sometimes you want something close to the second, or maybe even heading on the way to the third. Just like sometimes people want anger-free fluffy romance without the threat of Voldemort or whatever overshadowing it all. If we can understand why that might be enjoya le, surely we can understand why it's sometimes fun to see a character just ripped to shreds, even if it's not something we necessarily want to read all the time.

** Personally I am a fan of both bashing and WBWL fiction, when I read a fanfiction I try to separate the characters from their cannon counterparts, and because of this as much as I love Harmony pairings where Ginny is bashed to hell and back, I also like Hinny fics where hermione is bashed to hell and back.

It's less about who is being bashed and more about the satisfaction of seeing a character who acts in a way you don't like being put in place, and searching by who is being bashed gives you a feel for what behavior will be punished, and how the MC will act.

In dumbledore bashing fics, he is usually bashed for being incompetent or manipulative, and as a counterpoint Harry is usually overly competent/intelligent and powerful

For hermione bashing fics, she is usually bashed for her holier than thou attitude, being a bitchy know it all, or for acting irrationally bitchy when someone gets better grades than her. The MC in these fics is usually intelligent, and or is playing a long game against someone else, and they are so far ahead because they're planning something big, or she gets on their case for not studying enough when the MC is trying to fly under the radar. Or she gets irrationally mad when the MC is making advancements in any field because they're the same age and she's supposed to be the smart one.

Ron bashing fics let you see someone who is a fair weather friend or basically is just there for fame get put in their place, or seeing them get their just desserts for being lazy.

Ginny bashing fics are usually combined with a nice romance plot, and it usually lets you see a shallow person who had no life goals other than “famous gold digger” watch as their life plans crumble around them and/or get more and more extreme in their actions as they have a mental breakdown due to not getting their way.

And in WBWL fics let you see someone rise up “against all odds” to show that they aren't worthless and that they do deserve love/respect. It also usually combines with other bashing's as well.

And finally in neglect fics, where there is James/lily bashing, you get to see someone rise above their horrible parents to become a good person, and usually see their abusers end up punished and/or humiliated.

TLDR: bashing lets you see people put in their place and who it is, is just a tag to let you know what the people are being bashed for.

** I love Hermione and write many fics about her but I also enjoy reading bashing fics. There's nothing wrong with a bashing fic if it's written well and lets you see a different perspective of a character.

It's not childish to have likes and dislikes or to want to see a different genre/trope of writing. Many people love to trash Draco Malfoy or other Slytherins in Harmony or Ronmione fics but no one complains it's bashing then.

*** No one complains that Draco Malfoy is getting bashed? I made a post yesterday asking for essentially Draco Malfoy revenge and some Malfoy stan was one of the few people to answer

** I can understand some of the bashing because there are times when you want to hate her guts, both canon and fanfic. Her behavior always grated against my nerves and her closemindedness always made me mad. Her belief that books are 100 percent correct, always, just annoyed the hell out of me. Her trust in every authority figure is just wrong.

As you can tell, there are many factors to her personality that just both me and in most fics I've read, there are similar excuses for her bashing

** Really? Because I haven't seen any in the past day and I've sorted by new. The only post I've seen with Hermione even mentioned is one asking for Powerful!Hermione, which is just about the opposite of what you've seen.

Also, this sub doesn't hate needless bashing, it hates overdone bashing, like with the Weasleys or Chessmaster!Dumbledore-who-somehow-gets-outsmarted-by-an-eleven-year-old. And those fics usually go hand in hand with Mary-Sue!Hermione, which the sub has been complaining about forever. If you really are seeing prompts/requests for Hermione bashing, it's likely people looking for stories where she isn't the can-do-no-wrong fanon version or an over correction caused by a strong anti-Weasley-bashing reaction.

** i don't like hermione so i search for hermione bashing .

last time i checked we still have the right to search or post for things we like & that shouldn't be offensive to real people since it's about not liking a fictional character.

but i am sure "real" people will find a way to get offended.

** Boohoo. Where were you when everyone was writing or requesting recs for fics with weasley(ron specifically) or dumbledore bashing? Now that your favouraite character is being bashed at like 0.1 % level of what those other characters faced, you started crying. Lol. Live and let live.

**** I mean we still get ron, dumbledore etc bashing requests and have had for a long time. If you really cared about it on principle you could have asked this question abou6 those characters a long time ago. You probably asked this now, because you might be unconciously a bit biased rowards hermione even though she is not "apparently" not your favouraite character. Let people who endured hundreds of thousands of perfect miss know it all fics all this time have sime fun as well. This is a cycle and im sure it will rebalance itself when the hermione bashing starts getting out of hand just like it has started to now for the histotically bashed characters. So as i said, live and let live.
