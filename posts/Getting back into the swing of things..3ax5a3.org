Hey beautifuls. I'm in a fanfiction depression, and I need your help.

It's been a long while since I've found anything to read, and I'm hoping maybe this community can help me find something suited to my preferences. I like stories where Harry works hard to become a powerful wizard, takes his education/training into his own hands, or has a mentor.

Maybe to give you some idea of what I have read and enjoyed, my top 3 stories:

- Vox Corporis by a landslide. Really enjoy how he is protective of Hermione in this one. Also enjoy the training outside of school and the Christmases with Hermione's family.
- Can't remember the name, but it's a fairly popular story where Hermione soul becomes trapped inside Harry's scar, and he spends a multitude of years figuring out how to restore her. If you have the name, please tell me, I'm looking to reread this one!
- Toss up between [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6092362/22/Shadow-Walks][Shadow Walks by lorien829]] and another I can't remember the name of. In it, Ron has been missing for many years, it is discovered he was kidnapped and made to live underground. Harry works as head of a department in a secret agency/organization. Looking for the name of this one as well!

I've read most of The Fifth Element, but I don't really enjoy the super power plot device, as well as the long chapters and drawn out story line. It takes way too long to get anywhere.

Thanks so much everyone!


** I think you would enjoy linkffn(With Strength of Steel Wings by AngelaStarCat).

Keep in mind it's a WiP and updates kind of slowly(with big chapters though IIRC). It features a powerful Harry that works for it, although he is quite powerful from the get-go. It also features a mentor at some point.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This Way Comes]] by The Mad Mad Reviewer is by far one of my favorite peices of fanfiction ever. I've read it multiple times. Technically a crossover with Disgaea, and some elements from Silent Hill and Narnia, but no knowledge of the three are necessary. I actually ended up playing Disgaea and watching Silent Hill because of this fic.

Summary as follows: After Cedric's death, Harry and company summon a demon to kill Lord Voldemort. Except, well, when the hell is summoning a demon ever turn out just the way you planned?

Harry becomes badass, as does everyone else, training is not overdone or too cliche, everyone is well characterized, and a pretty decent romance is in there.

*** It's really very interesting. I don't want to give too much away, but maybe to help find it, here's a little more info:

The group all lives in one big manor together. No one knows what Harry does for a living, and I believe the main villain's name is... Vectra, or something similar. A woman, in any case.

**** That sounds like the last fic in the Paradigm of Uncertainty trilogy, [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/HWATF.html][Hero With a Thousand Faces]], which is super old and super-AU. As a heads up, that fic's a sequel to a sequel. Start with [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lori/TPOU.html][this]] instead.
