This fic is one of the best I've come across in the past two or three months. I'm not sure if it was heavily recommended at the time of writing, but I really enjoy the way it breaks down the house system, as well as realistic developments in the relationships between Harry and Snape and the trio and Draco Malfoy.

This fic is happily completed. There is a sequel, although that seems to unfortunately be abandoned due to the author's ill health. The sequel is standalone however - while it depends on the linked fic, the story in the linked fic is complete in and of itself.

Give it a shot! linkffn(the Secret of Slytherin)

** What's Ron and Hermione's role in the story? They're not listed as characters in the summary.

*** They have fairly major roles. I think the story was written back when FF limited you to two main characters, so in this case Harry and Snape makes sense. They remain a solid group though, no bashing or anything like that. Given your penchant for world building, I think you'd enjoy it, although there's no pairings in the first one. There may have been eventual pairings in the second, but I think the author had to abandon it before we got there.
