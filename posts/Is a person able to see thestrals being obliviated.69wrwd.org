Well, he/she witnessed death, then saw thestrals. Then he/she forget about seeing death. What about thestrals then?


** J.K Rowling's been asked on the mechanics of Theatrals before-- I think this quote is rather relevant.

#+begin_quote
  When you find out about the Thestrals, you find that you can see them only when you really understand death in a broader sense, when you know what it means.
#+end_quote

from [[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.][here.]] The full quote gives some more details-- it's worth the read.

If the obliviation removed the person's understanding of death, it follows they'll no longer be able to see Thestrals. If witnessing death was the catalyst to this understanding, and that memory's gone, they won't be able to see Thestrals anymore.

There's room for interpretation here-- mostly because memory's fickle. Maybe it's after the shock of seeing someone's death that makes the realization click, not death itself. Does obliviating the memory of death itself remove all its impacts? Maybe, maybe not. Hard to give a solid answer, but I think it's safe to say removing the memory of death is highly likely to hamper someone's understanding of death, making them unable to see Thestrals.

*** So, theoretically, could someone come to comprehend Death without having seen someone die?

I mean, what do we /mean/ by 'understand Death in a broader sense'?

** It should be noted that Harry didn't see the thestrals at the end of 4th year. It was only after the summer that he had to reflect on Cedric's death and think about it that he could.

It's more about comprehending what it meant, to be able to see thestrals.

**** Hahaha no, your English is excellent! I just thought it was funny. :)

"Would a person be able to see thestrals after being obliviated?" is how I would phrase it. I'm not sure if that's the most grammatically-precise way.

** I don't think so. IRC Harry witnessed his mother's death, but since he was a baby and didn't remember it, it wasn't until he saw Cedric die that he was able to see the thestrals.

*** I dunno, Harry saw the shade of Tom Riddle that came from the diary 'die'. And he most definitely killed the basilisk.

Cedric's death is the first time he witnessed a death and was fully hit by its impact, though.

Which makes me wonder; given that Voldemort has caused tons and tons of death, often by his own hands, but lacks empathy and is unaffected by most if not all of them, can he see thestrals?

**** I don't like the subtle implication of this that you can only 'understand' death if someone you really care about it dies and you're really sad about it. Is that really the most important thing about truly understanding the meaning of death, that it makes those that remain feel something? Seems oddly egotistical...

I know, I'm being hyperbolic, but there's certainly an undercurrent of that somewhere in there. Can Voldemort see Thestrals? Can a sociopath/psychopath?

My honest opinion: Rowling is just trying to fix a plot-hole that she didn't really think through. I think Harry certainly understood the implications of killing Quirrel (he was 11 for gods sake, not a toddler)... I think it's really weird that the death of Cedric is somehow more meaningful, just because he was a friend and one of the good guys.

**** When around dementors Harry he heard a scream which he was unable to identify until he learned what dementors do, he didn't have a flashback to Voldemort murdering his mother.

** This just gave me a idea for a Drama/Mystery story. Main character is the only witness for a murder, is Obliviated and hidden away. They start getting flashbacks and nightmares after seeing the Threstrals and eventually fully remember the murder.

I feel like Manipulative!Dumbledore would fit the role of obliviator well.
