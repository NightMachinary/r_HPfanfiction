Linkffn(Wolf Lord) - Harry turned into a Werewolf, taken from Britain, and raised in the US by Remus finds himself pulled back to the UK once Black escapes. Will he be able to keep his identity and nature a secret or will it all be blown into the open before Black can be caught and the truth of the situation discovered?

Wolf Lord has updated for the first time since I started my editing pass. Hopeful it is better now than it was before. Scenes have been added, cut, and changed in the first 31 chapters and I have hopefully fixed some of the mistakes or errors in the story.

Honest Feedback is always appreciated!


** Is this a story with Harry/Katie? That's a rare pairing, I'll check it out.
