I'm looking for Harry-centric, quality written, gen recs. I'm open to every genre except comedy. I prefer chaptered fics that are completed or recently updated. I'd love to read fics that aren't super well-known. Give me the hidden gems, the underrated stories, if possible. Thanks!

*** Read like 10 chapters. The writing's alright, but Harry seems almost autistic (well, I exaggerate a bit, but he's definitely on the spectrum) and a bit of a doormat. Does the story get better in that regard?

Also what the fuck is up with Harry's cloak? Did Dumbledore basically withhold it and gave it to Neville without telling Harry anything? Cause that's some /bull/shit.

*** Gen means general, meaning no ships. But I'll accept romance if it's a really good story. And this sounds interesting, so I'll definitely check it out. Thinks for the rec!

** I always recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter) and sequels, because it's a personal obsession of mine, but it's not exactly unknown. I mean, it has plenty of followers and a pretty tight discussion forum with some nice regular fans.

It's Fem!Harry (which is something I hated prior to reading it), gen, no romance (Harry is borderline asexual so far), very well-written and satisfying plots, the best Pansy Parkinson that anyone has ever written ever, awesome worldbuilding, and a fantastic array of orinigal characters.

linkffn(11261838) - the unwinding golden thread by carnivorous muffin, this is popular but i don't see it recommended a lot. (technically Tom's POV but it is most definitely Harry-centric)

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.
