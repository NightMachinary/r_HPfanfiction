Any fics where Harry decides to start trying in school. Maybe he learns that lily and James were both top of their class and he wants to live up to them? Maybe he gets better grades than Hermione. Anything works


** There's a short story called Overheard Conversation by White Angel of Auralon that has Harry changing his study habits.

  Harry overhears a conversation between two of his teachers early into the first year at Hogwarts. What he hears makes him ponder about how he's going about his school work. He decides to take action and make his parents proud of his performance. Just how will that little change influence the events taking place at the school?

  After a few too many hard knocks in early childhood, magic has turned Harry into a tough, twisted, somewhat impaired and very ugly version of himself with a severe speech defect.Magic is also going to help him learn how to kick everybody's backside.(This story has a lot of very short chapters and is posted daily.)
