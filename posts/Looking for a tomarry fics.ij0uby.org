1. I remember reading one (or two) fics where young Harry was adopted by a snake and then continued his life with it, changed into snake and didn't care about Wizarding world. Then Tom came and Harry decided it's his mate. Now I can't find it on archive even though I'm sure it was there, any help?
2. There was also this fic where Tom summoned a demon that was Harry and he joined Tom in Hogwart. I remember that Harry slept with Abraxas and Tom was jealous.
3. Besides this, any good recommendation for a fic where Harry is MoD, or just time travelled but isn't on a special mission to kill LV? Just casually befriending Tom and others, not caring about the future?
4. I also need some Harry went to orphanage with Tom trope!! This tag doesn't have many stories on archive though :/ He can either be from future or was born in Tom's time, whatever, but I need them being codependent, caring about each other, children. *I welcome all kind of bashings, but what I am looking for is Tom/Harry not Lord Voldemort/Harry. (Give me handsome Tom!)
