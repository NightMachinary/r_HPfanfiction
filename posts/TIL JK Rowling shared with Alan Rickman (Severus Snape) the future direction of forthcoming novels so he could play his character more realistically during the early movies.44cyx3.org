** Kinda curious why is this here and not in [[/r/harrypotter]]? I mean, it's a cool TIL (and OP already xposted in TIL too), but not really fanfiction related unless I'm missing something...

*** I kinda agree here. It's a cool (although relatively well known) fact, but it isn't something that is related to fanfiction at all... At least as far as I can tell. Better suited to [[/r/harrypotter]] in my opinion.
