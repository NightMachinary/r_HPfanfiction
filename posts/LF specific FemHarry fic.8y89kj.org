** I don't think I've ever read a fem!Harry with femslash that wasn't Hermione (and by that, i mean to say that I've only found H/Hr, which I quite dislike.)

** That sounds like one of the Voldemort memories from linkffn(Limpieza de Sangre by TheEndless7). Although that's fem!Voldemort and I don't remember a second scene, mild or not, between grindelwald and Dumbledore.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

*** Well, it's not this one simply because it's way too recent. Sounds interesting though so thanks so much for the link, female Voldemort is super rare IMO so it'll be an interesting read. :)
