So I love stories where characters go to alternate universes, they tend to be a guilty pleasure of mine.

But so many of these stories have Harry be the one to go; which I understand, he's the main character and all that.

But I always wondered what would happen if say Remus Lupin, Sirius Black, Luna Lovegood or someone else ended up in an alternate universe?

Now Harry can be along for the ride of course, but if he is sent to another universe then he isn't the only one that is sent there.

And note not time travel fics, I'm looking for character goes to alternate universe fics, those are different.

Any rating is fine, am fine with any era and am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather it be completed but if not but a bunch of chapters is fine

Am NOT fine with Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, no offense to anyone who likes either pairing, but I just don't. Any other pairing (if any) is fine.


** linkffn(Stages of Hope) has harry as well as many other characters in an alternate universe. linkffn(A Black Comedy) consists of Harry and Sirius.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.
