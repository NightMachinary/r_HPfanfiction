Has anyone ever read any fics which have a very potter musical in? I want fics to have like small nods, like Ron wearing a headband or eating red vines. And honestly why draco doesn't roll around on the floor and say, "what do you think about that potterrrrrr" in fanfiction will forever be a mystery too me.


** I will forever want a fic where Harry James Potter is replaced by Harry Freaking Potter in fifth or sixth year, and everyone just needs to adjust to the idea of using this douche to beat voldemort.

  The epic tale of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, from their first meeting until their happily ever after.A young werewolf who hasn't experienced human touch for six years meets a young pure-blood who's never known how it feels to be loved. The story follows Remus and Sirius through Hogwarts and beyond. Slightly AU in the beginning (mainly Remus believing he can infect people through skin contact), but goes major AU after the events of Halloween 1981.

** Royal Blood on AO3 makes a reference to the "hidden swimming pool" in the first part of the story (and there is one in the fic) but other than that there aren't any big references that I know of

  Hermione was just a scrappy, autistic child with no name and no past until she was adopted by a wonderful pair of dentists. The summer after she would make the best friend she would ever have from Ottery St. Catchpole. How much more would her life change when she is told that that tingling sensation she felt in her very core is magic? [UPDATES COMPLETE]
