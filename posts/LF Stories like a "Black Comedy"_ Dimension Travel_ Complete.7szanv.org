** You're going to have to specify how far down you're willing to go in quality, since there's not that many stories that are close to it.

** Well, for Dimension Travel there is always linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5751435/1/Stories-of-the-Lone-Traveler]]) by dunuleos, although it's different from Black Comedy in the sense that he doesn't stay in the same universe. In the same vein there is linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners]]) by nonjon, so you will likely enjoy it.

The one imo closest to the quality of Black Comedy was linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567/1/A-Riddled-Universe]]) although I also liked linkffn(Stages-of-Hope by kayly silverstorm; Intersecting-Realities by rightous malestrom), but they are very different from the premise of A Black Comedy while still being a Dimension Travel story.

There is also linkffn(On-a-Pale-Horse by Hyliian), but that is still a WIP and I don't know how that one will evolve.

Honestly, finding a Dimension Travel fic that's as good as Black Comedy will be difficult, but I hope you find something useful in my suggestions that you haven't read before. Of yourse there are always X-Overs, but that's a different problem :)

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

  COMPLETE. In the heat of the battle, he swore a blood oath to defeat Voldemort in every form. But when you factor in his understanding and abilities to travel to alternate dimensions, it presented the sort of problem only a Harry Potter could have.
