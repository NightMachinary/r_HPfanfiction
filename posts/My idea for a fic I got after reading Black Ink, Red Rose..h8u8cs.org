My idea is this: It would be a Warhammer 40,000 crossover. Essentially, it would revolve around the idea that Harry becomes the God Emperor of Mankind from 40k, because Ginny turned evil. Basically, in the original, uncorrupted timeline, she was his moral center, and the woman who helped him rebuild the galaxy, into a utopia for all races. But in the BIRR timeline, a time-travller from the good timeline somehow allowed the Diary to permanently corrupt Ginny. The result of this would be Harry losing that moral center, becoming bitter and angry. He eventually would become the Emperor from Warhammer we all know.

I still don't know exactly how to write this. Any thoughts or ideas/comments?
