Most wbwl stories have harry as a dark wizard. I'd like long fics that don't have that in mind.

Long fics around 60k+ would work great for me.

Not much bashing, slash and for the love of god, no m-preg.

Thanks!


** If you don't mind abandoned fics Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived holds up as the gold standard of fanfiction imo. It's on ffn with a few extra chapters on the dlp forum
