Hi, I am looking for fics with a dark protagonist that isn't presented as justified. Any recommendations?


** There's Black Ink, Red Rose by Bolshevikmuppet99 which deals with a Death Eater Ginny Weasley ( who was led astray by the Diary).

This fic and its sequels have probably the darkest protagonist of any fanfic I've read. Jen (fem!Harry) does some good things, like fighting Voldemort, but not for good reasons, and is generally an bad person who fights even worse people. Lots of very gruesome black magic/necromancy/etc.
