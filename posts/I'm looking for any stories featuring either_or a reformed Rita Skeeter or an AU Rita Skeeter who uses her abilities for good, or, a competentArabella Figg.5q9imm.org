I thought both were interesting ideas to take the characters and I figured asking for both in one might be easier than making two posts. I've never come across Rita allowed a redemption arc, but it occurred to me that the abilities and character she has would make her a great spy or secret agent - being a reporter doesn't necessarily make the most of her unique abilities, particularly her Animagus form.


** Rita is not always bad in fanfics. Politically savvy protagonists often use her as their attack dog, such as in "Escape", linkffn(11916243).

*** I figured with the amount of fanfics out there that would be the case. After all if there's fanfic of Hagrid x Dobby and Hogwarts x Giant Squid, it stands to reason Rita could be re-interpreted.

Thanks for the link!
