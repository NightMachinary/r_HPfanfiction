I have recently finished reading Harry Potter & the Psychic Serpent and am wanting something similar to that. I am looking for hopefully a series but that isn't necessary. However, I would like to read something with an M rating. I do tend to like the romantic/ships/sex scenes. Ha! Open to any suggestions really. Thanks! I prefer HH, HG ships but open to others.

Also, I'm new to Reddit so I hope I did this post correctly...


** Try [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/harry-potter/harry-potter-the-soulmate-bond/][Harry Potter and the Soulmate Bond]]. Harry/Hermione, AU where Harry was raised by Sirius and didn't come to Hogwarts until sixth year (where the fic starts). 386K.
