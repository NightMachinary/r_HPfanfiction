Im taking a Psychology class and one of the recommended books was The Psychology of Harry Potter, which seems like a very interesting read. I feel like both fanfic readers and writers if they read the psychology can start looking for and creating better fanfiction in our fandom.

**** Not a lawyer, but this will most likely fall under fair use, because of several facts:

- It is not competing in the same market as the original work
- It is very transformative, the original content is the majority of the new work
- Its existence will not devalue the original work

and lastly,

- It is of academic value

These are all factors that can be applied towards fair use.

And even then, JKR's or the publisher's lawyers would need to actively persue the authors, and that is probably not happening - they don't have an interest in banning literary analysis.

****** Yeah that's not how it works. Critique/Analysis/Education are usually pretty clearly in the "fair use" category, but that would only be relevant if large portions of the books are quoted, which most likely isn't the case.

Do you think copyright law protects Harry Potter from being talked about? Is this subreddit in violation of copyright? ^{^}

******** Reddit is a commercial enterprise. They are making money off it.

I think we might also be conflating copyright and trademark issues here. If any of those books pretended that they were in any way part of the official Harry Potter franchise there might be more of a problem.

********* They are making money from us watching ads and them selling our data. Not from Harry Potter name.

But it's still using its name. It will get popularity and more sales because of the name. It's using the name for monetary gain even if unintentionally. I mean, even movies fear using brands like "Apple", "Mc Donalds", "Pizza Hut", in their movies. I'd assume it's because of copyright

******** If that were the case then all encyclopedias, textbooks and news agencies would go out of business.

"Fair use" justifications exist because of those kinds of works.

********** Encyclopedias cover topics such as the Harry Potter books, using the name and explaining significant portions of the plot. The book OP linked is much the same, so it would rest under the same justification.

The Wikipedia article on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use][fair use]] gives a nice thorough explanation of why this legal precedent exists and what material it covers.

**** It examines it from a writer's angle, a philosopher's angle etc. Though I'd imagine it requires JK's or at least her publisher's approval before they can get published.

No they don't. Fair use works don't require any approvals from the original creators. If they did, it would entirely kill satires, parodies etc.
