An idea for a story where Tracey Davis (or any other random half-blood from Harry's year) is the actual chosen one from the prophecy. The story would start at the beginning of the seventh year when Tracey is made head girl on Voldemorts command. This is done in an attempt to pretend that there is actually no bigotry at Hogwarts.

By doing so, Voldemort marks Tracey as his equal, as another half-blood head person.

Tracey was born on the 30th of September to satisfy the born as the seventh month dies line.

The three defiances:

Marriage of Muggleborn and Pureblood (Mother could have a prominent Death Eater Maiden name)

Father is a Floo official who could reestablish a Floo connection for one of Voldies high priority targets.

Mother is a healer who was able to save the life of a high priority target.


** I like it.

Would make Tracey more interesting given that most of the time, she's basically an inanimate object for Daphne to talk at.
