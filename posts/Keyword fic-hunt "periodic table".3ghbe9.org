I'm trying out a hopefully fun + structured way to introduce new fics to this subreddit. I wanted to specifically find quality stories that I haven't read and that haven't been discussed on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]] yet. I tried to select stories that the general readership would consider quality writing. Since there are so many fics out there, I put restrictions on my search.

*Here's the general method I used:* 1. Choose a keyword or phrase.

1. Google search '[[https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Afanfiction.net+%22periodic+table%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8#q=site:fanfiction.net+harry+potter+%22periodic+table%22][site:fanfiction.net]]' harry potter /keyword/

2. Add search restrictions as needed (i.e. -crossover)

3. Select 1 to 4 fics that contain your keyword. Preferably fics that are new to you that you find to be recommendation worthy.

4. Share

*So here is how it went for me:*

1. I decided on the key phrase /"periodic table"/. I wanted to find fics where the phrase was part of the story's main plot, and more than a passing reference. It didn't have to be a science themed story, however.

2. /Searching...searching/

3. I restricted my search by eliminating any stories with the words /memorized/ or /Elric/. After an initial search I found that there were to many fics where the phrase was used briefly to establish someone's intelligence

   #+begin_quote
     /Hermione memorized the the periodic table when she was 3 years old/ I also found /a lot/ or Fullmetal Alchemist crossovers, which is fine, but not my cup of tea.
   #+end_quote

4. I found four stories that fit my criteria. I had never heard of any of these stories, and didn't find any mention of them on [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]]. These stories are from a variety of genres and I enjoyed reading all of them.

5. Sharing is caring

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4340385/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Golden-Needle][Harry Potter and the Golden Needle by xenocidender]]. This was what prompted me to start my search. I really enjoyed this story. Harry's summer transiguration homework is to theorize about why it's impossible to break a particular law of transfiguration, and it leads to him being a research assistant for Professor Vector. Sadly it has been abandoned since 2010. Even still, it is worth a read. No pairing. Drama with a bit of adventure. linkffn(4340385)

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/733322/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-OFSTED-inspection][Harry Potter and the OFSTED inspection by Ravenclaw's Graduate]]. Somehow Hogwarts gets noticed by OFSTED (Office for Standards in Education), the regulatory office in the UK responsible for school inspections. The school is forced to do the equivalent of scrambling to clean the kitchen before the health inspector visits. It is a crack!fic, but not too outrageous. linkffn(733322)

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10929787/1/What-s-in-a-Name][What's in a Name? by notsing]]. A oneshot focusing on Hermione having progressive revelations about the significance of her name. The writing is clever. It's technically canon compliant, it just interprets things in an interesting way. linkffn(10929787)

 

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9277856/1/Science-Is-Magic][Science Is Magic by eevilalice]]. Another oneshot. I just enjoy fics where Draco is grudgingly becoming accustomed to muggle influences. linkffn(9277856)

 

What do you think? I hope some found the stories new and enjoyable. If the response is positive I'll do this again sometime, using a new keyword. Thanks for reading!

  In his sixth year at Hogwarts, Harry is faced with an evil greater than any he has seen before, an evil so huge that all wizards, whatever their loyalties, must band together to survive it... COMPLETE!

  Harry has an idea of how to break the rules of Transfiguration, and it actually might work. Maybe. Plenty of other things happen too. No slash and no pairings as yet.

  Hermione shares the true story behind her name with her husband and has a startling revelation. This is my first Harry Potter story and I don't own him, but if JKR would like to give me Ron I'd be ecstatic.
