  No one missed Riddle's pale fist tightening around the useless wand in his lap. "I am Tom," he ground out. "I am here for the sole reason that the alternative was community service." / Hermione moderates a post-Avada Kedavra support group. Chaos ensues.

**** If I remember right, fellow teachers, a landlord, a few students, etc. He also does a lot of stunning and incapacitating people who annoy him. And just about everyone annoys him.
