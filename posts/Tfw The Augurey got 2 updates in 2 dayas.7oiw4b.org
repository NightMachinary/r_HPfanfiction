Year is off to a good start lads. Now if only we finally get the next chapter of Grow Young With Me, I can die happy.


** Is The Augerey actually that good? I've seen it recc'd a few times but the fact that it's focused on Cursed Child plot points makes me mad leery.

*** I read it a few days ago, and tbh the only Cursed Child plot point is the existence of Delphini.

*** If you like H/Hr it probably feels like the best thing since sliced bread.

Since I'm mostly indifferent to the pairing the story is probably... OK. There's no real conflict after a few chapters, so the only thing that kept me reading were the Delphi moments (which are a little rare for my taste). Those were cool. Also I had hoped there'd be more Delphi/Teddy interaction, but it's not looking that way.

**** I also wondered why there was so little Andromeda while the author is pushing Molly as a grandmother, which is ironic since Molly killed Delphi's mother.

**** I think you're underselling the story, personally. The author is a good writer, his handling of character interaction and creating an evocative scene is way above average. Also, the lack of pairing tropes is extremely refreshing, after so many stupid plots where Hermione's break-up with Ron is a cataclysmic family event. They're teenagers in their first relationship and it's no one's fault that it didn't work out, this fic is the first portrayal of what would actually happen that I've seen. Speaking as someone who didn't even like Hermione until a few great fics convinced me to try the pairing, this is a potential classic romance fic.

*** The first few chapters actually had plots, but then it became almost a pure Harmony fic. The baby was barely mentioned in the last chapter I endured before dropping it (the one where he wanked to the thought of Hermione).

*** In my opinion, it's okay but nothing great. The first several chapters are good then for me, it loses my attention.
