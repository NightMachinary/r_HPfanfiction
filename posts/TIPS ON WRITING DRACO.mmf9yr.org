So I'm currently writing/starting a fic and its based around Draco x oc. However, I feel like so far, I haven't really nailed down Draco's character. He's not as snarky as he in the books and I don't find many opportunities to bring him up. If anyone has some tips, I would greatly appreciate them.

PS: I'm starting from second year, so I'd prefer how he acts during the early stages of HP, although how he acts from HBP onwards might be useful for the future.


** Arrogance, haughtyness, a sense of entitlement and casual cruelty, if you're going for an in character Draco.

** If you're looking to redeem him, start peppering in seeds of doubts about his beliefs and moments of him being decent. Definitely don't undermine who he was at that point, though. If you want him to seem genuine, own the racism, bigotry, classism, etc.

*** I can see him still putting on airs (maybe even more strongly than before) even when he has doubts. At least until it finally becomes too much and he can no longer deny his swaying view. It wouldn't come easily, of course, and I'd imagine him being worse before getting better. Much like a child having his whole world being destroyed before it's rebuilt.

** "Hi Draco, how are you?"

/"How dare you talk to me,wait until my father hears about this!'/

"Draco, pass the potatoes please."

/"How dare you ask something of me, wait until my father hears about this!"/

"Mr.Malfoy, detention for not doing your homework."

/"How dare you give me detention, wait until father hears about this!"/

** Well, I guess I'm the only person on here who's hyper-analyzed his behavior, so here goes nothing. I'm going to be leaving his thoughts on blood supremacy out of this, as I feel that horse has been beaten into the ground. I'm also not too interested in information from outside of the books.

Okay, so the most obvious is probably that he's materially spoiled. His parents constantly send him sweets, he expects his father to buy him a present in Borgin and Burkes, and later gets the entire Slytherin team top of the line brooms. However, he does not exhibit the behavioral problems associated with being spoiled.

#+begin_quote
  A spoiled child may be recognized by an unwillingness to conform to the ordinary demands of living in a family: for example, a refusal to come for dinner on time, a demand for attention or for a privilege denied to others, a strategy for getting his or her way by creating a fuss publicly. The spoiled child is likely to be irritable and unsympathetic to others. He seems comfortable ignoring his parents' wishes. “He wants what he wants when he wants it.” ([[https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fighting-fear/201708/spoiling-child][source]])
#+end_quote

This suggests that although he is materially spoiled, he is not emotionally spoiled. He protests when things don't go his way, but he doesn't have meltdowns or refuse to comply. He does what he's told even if he doesn't like it (ie the detention in the Forbidden Forest). In PS, although he says that he's going to bully Lucius into getting him a broom, he either didn't do it or it didn't work, because in CoS when Lucius says he'll buy Draco a racing broom, Draco asks "What's the good of that if I'm not on the House team?" If he didn't do it, he probably knows better; if he did and it didn't work, it means he can't push his parents around like spoiled children can.

Everybody knows how much Draco admires his father; he constantly brings him up. His mother is, by contrast, very rarely mentioned. However, it's made clear that he cares for her. He gets angry and tells Harry off for insulting her, he looks to her for support when Voldemort mocks him, and he's able to use her wand without trouble. This is just my interpretation, but I think this difference is both because Draco is proud of his father/admires him, and because while he feels assured of his mother's love, he does not feel the same about Lucius'.

In Borgin and Burkes, Draco complains to Lucius about how everyone thinks Harry is so smart and wonderful, despite him not being that good. To which Lucius tells him that he has complained about Harry "at least a dozen times already." To me, this would suggest that Draco is seeking assurance from Lucius, but has not gotten it. Lucius goes on to tell him that "it is not prudent to appear less than fond of Harry Potter." This is not particularly useful advice for Draco, who is a child surrounded by people who dislike Harry. It would also seem that Lucius doesn't understand Draco's prideful nature. Later on in this conversation, Lucius publicly shames Draco for his grades.

#+begin_quote
  "I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or plunderer, Borgin," said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, "No offense, sir, no offense meant--"

  "Though if his grades don't pick up," said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, "that may indeed be all he is fit for--"
#+end_quote

Borgin wasn't talking about grades, Lucius brought them up. Presumably, he feels shame is the best way to motivate Draco. Lucius cares about Draco, but their relationship appears to lack warmth. It's not clear if what Draco's relationship with Narcissa is; it may be warm but similarly distant.

Draco's prideful nature manifests in defensiveness and attention seeking. When he first meets Harry, he's polite and pleasant, or tries to be, anyways. He talks about quidditch, repeats what he's been told about blood supremacy, shares some gossip, etc. Point being that he doesn't seem to go out of his way to antagonize people. However, the second he detects any sort of aggression or dislike, he immediately goes nuclear.

Ron kind of chuckles at his surname, Draco responds by insulting his family and poverty. Harry turns down his friendship, Draco threatens him and brings up his dead parents. When insulting people, he always goes for the option he knows will hurt the most. This seems to be something he picked up from Lucius, who does the same thing when talking with Arthur. Additionally, once you're enemies, all bets are off; he's not above attacking Harry's friends just to upset him (Hermione, Neville, Hagrid).

He's casually cruel, likely as a result of his parents' attitudes. Draco is a pureblood and a Malfoy, and that makes him better than other people. He's not very concerned with other people's emotions, not even Crabbe and Goyle's, the closest he has to friends, and is fine with the idea of violence against people he dislikes. However, he's not comfortable with being violent himself. He tends to stick to words unless seriously angered, and later has to be forced to torture people.

And as mentioned, Draco calls attention to himself, sometimes literally. Harry also notes that he tends to be a kiss up (though we only see this with Snape and Slughorn). If you buy into the idea that Lucius (and/or Naricissa) is a somewhat distant parent, you can read this as a lack of self-esteem, which can cause attention-seeking behavior. So can loneliness, funnily enough, and Draco doesn't seem to have any real friends. It may also be that he simply got a lot of attention as a child and is used to that treatment. It all depends on your interpretation of his character.

While I have no issue with the distant parent(s) answer, I think most authors take it waayyy too far. I had distant parents growing up; they were just kinda... there. They only really spent time with me if I initiated it, but they didn't avoid or abuse me. If you want distant parents, that's is how I would do it.

And just to round this whole thing off, Draco is a coward. He brings Crabbe and Goyle everywhere, and even in the first book Harry points out that he isn't so keen to fight when it's one on one. When he does fight without the advantage of numbers, it's usually via ambush (ie the ferret incident, end of OotP).

** All the qualities they mentioned are great but don't amplify them too much (especially haughtiness), just remember he's still a twelve-year-old.
