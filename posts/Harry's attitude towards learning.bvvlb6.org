I know that this thing has been milked dry already, but why does Harry's attitude towards learning suddenly change after going to Hogwarts?

In PS, when he's waiting for September 1st to arrive, Harry is shown to be quite interested in his books, choosing a name from a History of Magic. This attitude completely disappears later, mainly to make way for Ron and Hermione's part as the information source for the story.

Why isn't Harry shown to be knowing atleast something that the other two don't know about? Or is there something in canon which I'm forgetting?


** Before he started Hogwarts he was isolated and had literally nothing to focus on, so even his history of magic text book became fascinating. Then he attends Hogwarts and it quickly becomes the norm and he gets a social life etc. When he returns to the dursleys each summer after that he has something to obsess over instead;

CoS: why aren't his new friends writing to him? Have they forgotten about him while he is locked away?

PoA: how do I get my guardians to sign my Hogwarts letter? I need to be on my best behaviour and not cause Aunt Marge to explode

GoF: wow I have a godfather, wait why am I dreaming these things?!

OoTP: Voldemort returned, friends ignoring him again, saw his mate die etc.

HBP: prophecy, sirius death, dumbledore mission to look forward to

DH: horcrux mission, turning of age, leaving dursleys for last time, Ginny etc.

Harry was smart but lazy and as he got older, there became more pressing reasons for him to procrastinate from studying.

*** In CoS they locked his trunk under the stairs, so i guess it stands to reason he didn't read or anything. Bur in PoA and GoF he really should've read quite a lot. I mean, he is sitting by himself in his room, no TV, no computer, and what, just stares at the wall and thinks for a month or so?

** The worst is after 4th, 5th and 6th year. I understand that he's a child before that and he may prefer to chill. After Cedric's death, maybe it didn't register completely but after 5th year, after seeing Sirius die (not only by his fault but also because he didn't put the effort into Occlumency), Voldemort duel Dumbledore and learning the Prophecy that guarantees he will have to face Voldemort one day or another, it's preposterous that he wouldn't prepare himself more. Even more, he saw that he can't trust "authority" as clearly proven by the Ministry's incompetence and even the teachers'. If this isn't enough to motivate himself he should just lay down and die. And lastly, after Dumbledore's death he tells Ron and Hermione not to accompany him but at the same time he doesn't prepare... AT ALL ! He learns nothing and doesn't prepare any package of any sort. Hermione had to do it all (again). Seriously the 7th book should be called "Hermione and the two useless cretin".

I think that's also one of the reason why there was so many fanfic about book 6 at the time. The frustration of seeing Harry excel in his mediocrity. In this Snape was right, he thinks (unconsciously) that everything will go well and that he doesn't have to work more to actually have what he wants. He doesn't give himself the means and relish in his uselessness. When in fics people makes him say it's not him that did it but the others... yeah that's about right. He doesn't do that much.

He will be raised in an abusive household, living in a mere cupboard and being starved regularly. He will be shunned and celebrated by his classmates in turns, and his best friends will be a loyal (but lazy) boy and the most brilliant witch of his generation (aka moi~ ;-] ).

*** This is the problem with so much of Rowling's canon.

She tells, she doesn't show.

Throughout the whole books we're constantly told how good he is at DADA, how he's top of the class. Alright, half the classes were useless because of the teachers (best school, remember), but let's take that at face value.

Where do we actually see him do /anything/ impressive? When have we seen him cast anything except for the stunner and disarming spell? Hell, that's even what she wrote him to beat Voldemort with.

Literally the only impressive or above-average thing he did was when he cast the patronus in the third book to drive away those dementors. And that was apparently a very overrated spell anyway, since it just needs emotion and he taught it to his contemporaries not long after: j see no reason they also couldn't have learned it in 3rd year if taught.

Seriously, what has he actually done or shown for him to be considered the best at defence? As far as I can remember, almost literally nothing.

This is a deeper problem with the Canon writing. Rowling constantly asserts many things, but they're never shown to be true. Voldemort is supposed to be very intelligent, but he acts like an idiot. Death Eaters are supposed to be very frightening, but a group of school children get away from a fight with them nearly unscathed.

There's a lot of issues.

Deathly Hallows, where he fight Death Eaters on multiple occasions and comes out victorious, just during the battle of the seven Potters he kills like three of them and during the battle of Hogwarts he downs a lot more.

Most duels, Harry favors curses and hexes, even though people like to say its his favourite spell after goblet of fire Harry only uses Expelliarmus three times in combat, and stunning charms are just often the best choice since they reliably take out opponents. He is also very proficient with the protective magic, using reliable protective enchantments on the places they were at and using the shield charm protecting other from curses cast by Voldemort.

***** But what does he actually /do/? Is it anything that half the students in his year can do? As you admitted, he really only uses three spells, over and over - disarm, stun, and shield (protego). I don't remember any enchantments, either.

As for them getting away from the Dep. of Mysteries, half of those injuries were from experiments there (Ron brain attack), not the Death Eaters. Who, as I might remind you, are grown adults who are part of a feared terrorist organization, yet they can't even manage to seriously maim a single student. So yes, pretty much unscathed, I'd say!

And since when do stunning spells reliably take down opponents....? It takes one other enemy to cast "ennervate", and they're back up at full capacity.

I guess you can try and argue that these simple spells are most effective, but then that doesn't really take away from anything I said, does it, in that Harry doesn't do anything impressive to warrant the reputation.

Him beating death eaters with absolutely nothing of note is more of a testament to how pathetic Rowling wrote them to be (in contrast to their reputation), and really further proves my main point that Rowling has a problem of writing one thing, but then failing to show it in action.

also the average grade for them should be acceptable, you dont need a good shield charm to achieve that.

Then there is also the differences in how good you are at shield charms, in goblet of fire Harry could not even block a single jinx cast by Hermione, in Deathly Hallows he protects a lot of people from powerful curses.

Or they just never used it past school and became unable to use it, defense against the dark arts would rarely be used outside of schools, except for the occasional pest like boggarts or red caps.

It's not how many times he succeeds in disarming, it's how many times he casts it, along with the the stunner.

Which curses and hexes? It's been a while since I read canon, I'd love for you to refresh my memory if you're right.

Either way, other students also didn't have much trouble learning it - I fail to see how that's very impressive in the least. It's one of the three main spells he uses.

Anyway - so he's the best at defence and an impressive fighter because Hermione taught him those spells after months of being fugitives?

Again, it's been a while, but I'm pretty sure if you turn to the beginning of Deathly Hallows, Hermione was the one casting them to start and he didn't know them.

Look there are online list of spells Harry casts in the books, I dont really feel like going through each battle and pick them up, but just for example he uses the blasting curse to take out a death eater during the battle of the seven potters and the Cruciatus to take out one of the Carrows and there is this part during the battle of Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the retreating crowd.

  That being said, how would this be impressive? Draco Malfoy and even 3rd Year Ginny Weasley could cast hexes. Or do you consider anything mildly offensive at all to be impressive?

Its not their nature as hexes which makes them impressive but that he has a variety of spells uses to take out death eaters.

#+begin_quote

Its the entire reason why Fred and George were so sucessful with their Shield Hats

#+begin_quote
  *“You wouldn't believe how many people, even people who work at the Ministry, can't do a decent Shield Charm,”* said George. “ 'Course, they didn't have you teaching them, Harry.” “That's right. . . . Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we're still getting massive orders!” “So we've expanded into a range of Shield Cloaks, Shield Gloves . . .”

  Well, a note, that's not what myself (and I think most people) think of when they think of enchanting in the HP world. Afaik the word and concept of "warding" is fanonish, but that would really fall under that category.
#+end_quote

At many points in the books spells like that are called protective enchantments. Just this for example

#+begin_quote
  if we're staying, we should put some *protective enchantments* around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. “Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . . Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . .”

  Anyway - so he's the best at defence and an impressive fighter because Hermione taught him those spells after months of being fugitives?
#+end_quote

No protective spells were explicitly tested for during the O.W.L and thats where he had a better grade then Hermione, also nowhere is it said that Hermione taught him the Spells. Nowhere does it says he didn't know them. She started because she was the one who suggested it.

I think Rowling for the most part did a good enough job justifying Harry's skill (for the most part).

But the bigger problem is just that some readers/viewers have different expectations/standards from the story and how it handles magical skill and combat.

I was never satisfied with Harry's grasp on magic and the manner in which everyone, bad guys included, used magic and learnt it. It came across as incredibly limited and uncreative.

But at the end of the day you have to look at it like Quidditch. Rowling purposefully didn't put much effort or thought into Quidditch because sports don't interest her.

I think she did the same thing with magical fighting, and to a lesser extent how magic would affect and change a society. If it didn't interest her, she didn't flesh it out more because it's not a crucial part of the story she wants to tell.

I think you've nailed it. And I agree with everything else you said.

After so much fanon and other fantasy epics like LotR and ASoIAF, you start to expect much more from HP, even in a weird retroactive way. At the end of the day, it was a children's book scrawled on a napkin, one that was never intended to turn into what it has become.

Looking at it now as an adult, there's so many glaring issues with plot, continuity, characters, etc etc. That's why evil Dumbledore was so popular in mid-2000s, because Book 1 was especially bad when looked at critically - I'm sure you know what I mean...

At the end of the day, even though I kind of hate Canon after seeing everything it could have been in fanon, I do still respect that it inspired so much other writing.

I've kind of grown to actively dislike canon, to the point where I have little interest in re-reading the books or rewatching the films, and there are several fanfics I much prefer to the original works. I sometimes actively avoid stories that self-label as canon compliant.

I'll admit I had a laugh when she anonymously released her crime book, and it was a complete failure with only 1,500 sold the first week, totally dead in the water with lukewarm reviews.... Then someone gave an "anonymous tip" (not suspicious at all) and boom, #1 on Kindle and half a million more books hurried into production.

So really, it's a love-hate relationship with Harry Potter - love the fanon, hate the Canon, lol.

And don't get me started on all the asinine retconning she's done over the years. If there was ever a proper example for virtue signalling, it's Rowling retroactively making characters gay or black in some vain attempt to get social credit.

There's plenty of good literary reasons to dislike the Canon, and certainly plenty of good reasons to dislike its author...

****** First of all, half of Harry's class indeed know most of the same defense spells as him, /because he taught them/. It may seem like stunners or simple shields are nothing, but Harry was about as good is not better than the others champions who were the best seventh year of their respective schools, and most ministry employees aren't even able to conjure a good shield. It's not Harry not the death eaters who suck, it's just that you seems to picture the wizard fights more flamboyant that they really are in canon.

Also props for not mentioning Harry knowing semi-advanced protection charms in DH and learning the Patronus at thirteen. And in a 1 vs 1 a stunner is as guaranteed a win as the killing curse.

Yes, that's what Rowling made Hermione say, but its not true. Let's compare then task by task, shall we?

FIRST TASK:

CEDRIC: "Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground. . . turned it into a dog. . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him."

FLEUR: "And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance - well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire - she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand"

KRUM: "Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye."

HARRY: Summoning charm and flying.

So lets compare. Cedric used complex transfiguration, Fleur put a /dragon/ to sleep completely, Krum disabled the Dragon's eye, Harry summoned his broom and flew. Ranking on complexity:

1. Fleur
2. Cedric
3. Krum and Harry

SECOND TASK:

CEDRIC: "Cedric Diggory, who also used the Bubble-Head Charm"

FLEUR: "Fleur Delacour, though she demonstrated excellent use of the Bubble-Head Charm"

KRUM: "Harry turned and saw something monstrous cutting through the water toward them: a human body in swimming trunks with the head of a shark. ... It was Krum. He appeared to have transfigured himself- but badly."

HARRY: Needed Dobby for everything. Dobby told him who to rescue and gave him the method how. Needed Myrtle's help on where to swim.Zero points. If I really wanted to give him some points, then he did manage to save the most hostages.

Krum performed complex transfiguration, Fleur and Cedric managed charms, Harry...did nothing.

Ranking:

1. Krum.
2. Cedric
3. Fleur and Harry.

Notes: Technically Harry deserves to be at fourth place, but since he did manage his task, I put him with Fleur.

THIRD TASK:

CEDRIC: "as he had done with the skrewt, and shouted "Stupefy!''just as Cedric yelled the same thing."

FLEUR: "I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed"

KRUM: "And then Harry heard Krum's voice. "Crucio!" "

HARRY: (I am only listing spells that managed to acomplish their purpose) Point me Spell, Riddikulus, Impedimenta, Reducto, Stupefy, Solved a riddle, Expelliarmus

Cedric managed a stupify, Krum managed a crucio(although he was under the imperius", Harry managed bunch of spells of various branches.

Ranking:

1. Harry
2. Cedric and Krum
3. Fleur.

Notes: Cedric alongside Harry did win, that's why he is so high up. Krum managed to perform some seriously hard magic, so that puts him up there too. Fleur was useless.

Overall Score:

CEDRIC: 3 times at the second place

FLEUR: 2 times third place, one time first place.

KRUM: 1 time third place, 1 time second place, 1 time first place

HARRY: 2 times third place, one time first place.

Overall rankings:

1. Krum
2. Cedric
3. Fleur and Harry

Notes: Voldemort fight is not added since:

1. Only Harry fought him.

2. It doesn't add anything or change anything. Harry managed an expeliarmus, Summoning charm and thats it.

Summary:

Despite what Hermione has said, Harry was not the best. Krum was. Harry actually came in the third place in the comparisons.

Edit to my last question:

The fact that there were spectres at all was because Harry won the contest.

#+begin_quote
  /Don't break the connection./

  I know, Harry told the music, I know I mustn't ... but no sooner had he thought it, than the thing became much harder to do. His wand began to vibrate more powerfully than ever ... and now the beam between him and Voldemort changed, too ... it was as though large beads of light were sliding up and down the thread connecting the wands -- Harry felt his wand give a shudder under his hand, as the light beads began to slide slowly and steadily his way ... the direction of the beam's movement was now towards him, from Voldemort, and he felt his wand shudder angrily ...

  As the nearest bead of light moved nearer to Harry's wand tip, the wood beneath his fingers grew so hot he feared it would burst into flame. The closer that bead moved, the harder Harry's wand vibrated; he was sure his wand would not survive contact with it; it felt as though it was about to shatter under his fingers --

  He concentrated every last particle of his mind upon forcing the bead backwards towards Voldemort, his ears full of phoenix song, his eyes furious, fixated ... and slowly, very slowly, the beads quivered to a halt, and then, just as slowly, they began to move the other way ... and it was Voldemort's wand that was vibrating extra hard now ... Voldemort who looked astonished, and almost fearful ...

  One of the beads of light was quivering, inches from the tip of Voldemort's wand. Harry didn't understand why he was doing it, didn't know what it might achieve ... but he now concentrated as he had never done in his life, on forcing that bead of light right back into Voldemort's wand ... and slowly ... very slowly ... it moved along the golden thread ... it trembled for a moment ... and then it connected ...

  At once, Voldemort's wand began to emit echoing screams of pain ... then -- Voldemort's red eyes widened with shock -- a dense, smoky hand flew out of the tip of it and vanished ... the ghost of the hand he had made Wormtail ... more shouts of pain ... and then something much larger began to blossom from Voldemort's wand tip, a great, greyish something that looked as though it was made of the solidest, densest smoke ... it was a head ... now a chest and arms ... the torso of Cedric Diggory.
#+end_quote

To be honest, a lot of the things you say make it sound like you have watched the movies but not read the books.

Stuff like the Patronus Charm - it was /always/ the case that the impressive thing about it was conjuring it in the presence of Dementors. As anyone who has read PoA could tell you, Harry is able to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the absence of Dementors /months/ before he is able to conjure one with Dementors present (the incident in which he casts one at Malfoy pretending to be a Dementor). Even after his first corporeal patronus, he continued to struggle greatly against actual Dementors.

What the DA did is equivalent to Harry conjuring the Patronus against Malfoy, not equivalent to his conjuring it against actual Dementors.

Similarly, with the Stunning Charm - in the books, we see this being used to take down dragons, we see Aurors use it as their standard spell, and we know that if a human is hit with multiple stunners, they can die. It is clearly a powerful spell. The fact that Harry learnt it in GoF as part of his tournament preparation (not as part of the standard curriculum) is a testament to his ability; it doesn't make the Stunning Charm weak.

  Harry sat down too. He explained what he'd seen; how, as the nearest Dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry's, a large silver something had come galloping across the lake and forced the Dementors to retreat. Hermione's mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had finished. “But what was it?” “There's only one thing it could have been, to make the Dementors go,” said Harry. “A real Patronus. A powerful one.” “But who conjured it?” Harry didn't say anything. He was thinking back to the person he'd seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been... but how could it have been? “Didn't you see what they looked like?” said Hermione eagerly. “Was it one of the teachers?” “No,” said Harry. “He wasn't a teacher.” “But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all those Dementors away... If the Patronus was shining so brightly, didn't it light him up? Couldn't you see ---?” “Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry slowly. “But... maybe I imagined it... I wasn't thinking straight...

  Resisted the Imperius Curse from Barty Jr and Voldemort himself
#+end_quote

Barty Jr was not in the best state of mind. He was under the imperius for extreme periods of time, and he suffered dementors. It is very much possible that his decreased mental state weakened his will and his spell. Now, it was never stated that your will has to overpower someone else's, but considering someone will a strong will can break free, and considering you highlighted Voldemort as an example instead of saying he resisted the imperius, I'll assume that will is taken into the account, and therefore someone who is heavily independant or dislikes obeying others, would have a good chance or resisting Barty. Voldemort is a different issue. It could be that the horocrux in Harry helped him resist, after all its two "minds" fighting one, or really how effective would be imperius against yourself? And Harry is part Voldemort both in Horocrux and in blood. Nevertheless, I will give you this one too. Him resisting Voldemort is impressive.

#+end_quote

It also wouldn't make sense for Aurors to be less specialized since they have very high requirements and spend years without hiring anybody.

#+begin_quote
  “Yes?” Professor McGonagall prompted Harry. “Well, I thought of, maybe, being an Auror,” Harry mumbled. *“You'd need top grades for that,”* said Professor McGonagall, extracting a small, dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it. *“They ask for a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under ‘Exceeds Expectations' grade, I see*. Then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude tests at the Auror office. It's a difficult career path, Potter; they only take the best. In fact, *I don't think anybody has been taken on in the last three year*s.”

I don't recall any major study problem with them (outside of Harry and Snape issues in Potions), and *BOTH* of them (not just Harry, Ron as well) were doing very well with their O.W.L.s, Harry got eight of them, five EE, one O (Ron got seven and at least some of them EEs).

*** I agree completely. This is the reason for my question in the first place. I don't doubt his or Ron's intelligence (bear in mind Ron won a chess match with some serious handicaps). But he is shown to have little to no exposure to anything in the world. As far as I can tell there is not a single time in canon that he explains/tells anything to anyone. (ignoring the Horcrux stuff that Dumbledore tells him in the first place)

Everything Harry is good at in the books is completely instinctual. He's an excellent flyer, even though he's never ridden a broom before. He's got a proclivity for DADA, but he's never shown to be specifically studying it. Hence we have to assume its his natural talent again.

Yeah he's hard-working. But only out of desperation. He learns the Patronus because he's vulnerable to the dementors without it. He learns stuff for the tournament because he has to. Seriously, not giving the egg any thought, especially when the first task was bleeding dragons?

Ron is shown to be struggling, trying to practice Quidditch on his own. He wants to improve. Hermione is shown to have her own weak subjects that she wishes to conquer. Even Neville is shown to be shit at Transfiguration.

What exactly is Harry shit at? Not Potions, since its Snape that's the problem and not Harry. He gets EE on the Owls and does well enough in Slughorn's class.

Rowling could have shown Harry to be aware of some things in the Muggle world at least, trying to answer some question Ron has (instead of making Hermione the one to answer)

Why was Hermione making the food for the Trio during the Horcrux Hunt? Harry has been cooking and cleaning for the dursleys for a long time. Even though he probably hates it, he'll be better at it than the other two. Its primarily DH that irritates me the most.

You're falling into that same fanon trap that gives us "Harry and Ron are idiots are par with Crabbe and Goyle who would never pass their classes without Hermione's help". Harry cooks all of once in canon, on Dudley's birthday. The implication is that this is not an uncommon thing, but not something he's been doing every single day since he could see over the top of the stove. Similarly, he's only given a huge list of chores that need to be done all in one day once, and it was after he taunted Dudley with made-up magic words in CoS (also the only time we see either Petunia or Vernon try to physically abuse him, the time Petunia swung at him with a frying pan).

** Blame Rowling for this. She wanted Harry to be an Everyman, an ordinary guy who "triumphed" over evil so she quickly did away with all of his exceptional accomplishments beyond DADA. And even that is told, not shown, as part of his OWL score.

She had him master the Patronus Charm, an exceptional feat for a teenager, but then had multiple students achieve the same feat later /in a single session/ what took Harry months to achieve. She was basically pissing on his achievement at that point.

Part of it can also be blamed on the Dursleys. Curiosity and intelligence have to be nurtured and a credo of "/Don't ask questions/" is a horrible way to do it. While Harry should have grown out of it as he went through Hogwarts, he never did as he never gained an adult influence or role model who looked out or stood up for him and encouraged him.

Harry was an abused child in a children's tale and while Rowling tried to mature the story over the years, she wanted to stick to the characters as she envisioned them initially rather than let them grow naturally and Harry's character took the brunt of this. She ended up glorifying Harry's abuse. His lack of drive and passiveness is part of this.

For example, in the summer before third year (OOC-ness, just doing this quick):

#+begin_quote
  "Mr Potter?" Said the wizard, looking fairly nervous, holding in his hands some kind of box.

  "Yes", Harry replied, feeling quite tired after his day spent in Diagon Alley, wanting nothing more than to relax in the hottest bath he could pour himself.

  "I am part of a group that support various causes, the Death Devourers Brotherhood, and we would like to gift you this box of various tokens of our appreciation.

  -The... Death Devourers Brotherhood? Why that name, if I may ask? Oh and thank you very much for the present!

  -I'm afraid that I am not at liberty to explain it to underage wizards. I can tell you however, that our founder, Lord Gaunt, had quite a peculiar sense of humour. However, if when older, you would like to join us, you would be most welcome, our owl address is written inside the box.

  -I see... well thank you very much, I shall think about it.

  -That is all we ask for, Mr Potter." With that, the wizard did a short bow and, having placed the box in Harry's hand, made his way to the stairs, making sure to climb them at a normal pace despite the fear he felt. Soon, he was on the ground floor, nodding to the bartender before leaving via the muggle side. There, he quickly crossed the busy street and, finding an dark alley, put on a invisibility cloak and apparated to one of the roof overlooking Diagon Alley and settled to wait, hoping that the boy would take such an obvious trap, therefore proving (among other things), Dumbledore's utter incompetence.

  He didn't have to wait long, barely an hour when the first floor of the tavern he was watching exploded, showering the street with debris. But what caught his eye, along with anyone in the alley proper, was the glorious skull rising from the smoke, a snake slowly curling around it. The wizard took a few more moments to admire the sight before turning on his heel and apparating in his living room, drunk with joy, success and, soon enough that expensive bottle of firewhiskey he bought years ago for such a joyous occasion.

Most of that routine is attending Hogwarts. As far as we know, Harry always does his homework, pays attention in most of his classes, does spell practice dutifully, and scores pretty well in all his practical classes. So Harry's attitude doesn't suddenly change, it's just that the focus of the story isn't Harry learning magic. It's all happening in the background.

In the brief moments that we do see what Hogwarts daily life is like, we do see Harry applying himself to a fair degree.

** He's lazy like me when it comes to actual work. This is called relatability, which can be used to make characters seem like they could be real people.

*** It's not like he ever missed turning in assignments or straight up didn't go to class. That's what I'm thinking of when I think lazy student. Harry just didn't particularly love school work. I wager this is how most people are.

** It's the effect that Ron has on him. Ron is lazy, unmotivated and entitled as a person, and that attitude rubs off on Harry. Harry himself was an abused child, so he latched onto the first friend that he ever had and began to personify many of his worst traits in tandem. If Hermione had been his first friend, it would have been different, but as it stood, Harry joined Ron in being horrified by her drive for a long time. The silver lining is that Harry never became entitled, but he was certainly a poor student, regardless of the crazy events that occurred at Hogwarts.

Fanfiction really explores this topic in great detail. I don't like Genius!Harry stories because they're OOC, but I do enjoy those in which he is motivated by an intelligent friend or group of friends to achieve his potential. Dethryl's They Shook Hands is a great example of this at play.

*** How was he a poor student, exactly? He got eight OWLs, and the only classes he truly didn't like were history (which everyone agrees that Binns is a bore), Potions (the teacher hates him), and Divination (the teacher is insane).

Also, I think you're severely overplaying Ron's "negative" influence. Harry had agency to spend his off time chilling out rather than studying. It's not like Ron forced this on him

Hermione is the one acting different from how average teenagers act.

**** Many of those OWLs came as extremely average grades. The fact is, any child in his position would have devoured books on learning the truth. One doesn't escape from hell, find themselves in paradise and then proceed to fuck around for seven years, especially if they feel that they can grow closer to the memory of their parents by learning more. Any child would be buoyed into making the best of their circumstances except in the following circumstance.

With Ron, don't underestimate the power of "true" friendship (I say this laughingly because Ron was a dreadful friend for the most part). Harry would have been desperate to hold onto that friendship, so he subconsciously began to feed off of Ron's worst traits in order to appease him. I work with children and know how they tend to feel and act as a general rule of thumb, especially when they are dealing with the aftereffects of severe emotional and physical abuse. And hell, the abuse continued even after he discovered the truth. Harry saw how Ron reacted to Hermione's intelligence and confidence negatively and ensured he would not push Ron away by flaunting intelligence himself.

Hermione's behaviour is unique as well. None of the three act like normal teenagers in total. There are moments when Rowling treats them like five year olds and others when she treats them like adults. It's pretty cringeworthy to read when it happens.

At the end of the day, the books were written for children. Many of the characters are two-dimensional because of that target audience.

** I think it also has to do with the child abuse he's suffered from the Dursleys his entire life... the second chapter of the first book is full of Petunia & Vernon yelling at him to not ask questions. I can totally see how that might translate to a tendency to not be overly curious.

** I just thought that he knew that Hermione values being the top in the class, and knew that Ron had jealousy issues. He valued his freindships over his grades.

Or maybe Ron rubbed off on him.

Or maybe since he had always had to hide how clever he was when he was with the Dursleys, it became a habit and stayed with him at Hogwarts, and Ron didn't help as he was not very study interested. And Hermione, she had totally different methods of study than Harry. Harry probably thought he HATED study when really he just HATED being coerced into studying like Hermione. These alll are just theories, don't take them seriously.
