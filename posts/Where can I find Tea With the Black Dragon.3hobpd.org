So, by a wonderful twist of fate I've ended up sharing an apartment with two people who love Snape as much as I do. I've been dying to share one of my favorite fics with them, but I can't find it anywhere.

The title is Tea with the Black Dragon. The main characters are Snape and an OC named Grave Draven. At the time, the author was writing under the name white raven. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/305517/white-raven][Here's]] a link to her FFN page. I read the story on digital quill about 4 years ago, but now it seems the site is essentially gone and I don't know where else to find it. Help?


** There was a story of the same title/same author on [[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=8342][adult fanfiction]], is it what you are looking for?

*** Yes! Except, that seems to have only the first chapter.
