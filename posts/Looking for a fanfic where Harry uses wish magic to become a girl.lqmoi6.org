I've been looking for this fanfic for a bit now, from what I remember I think it starts in the summer before 3rd or 4th year I think. Harry is being beaten by Vernon and I think he wishes for someone who will protect him or to become a girl (I can't remember) and either uses apparition to go to Snape's house or to bring Snape to him. Snape blood adopts him and renames him Ariana Snape and claims to Dumbledore that he just found out he had a child and that Harry (Ariana) lived with an abusive mother and stepfather until Snape had found out and rescued her (something like this. Harry is de-aged to 10 or 11 and he will start his first year that September and I think there was a part where Snape combs her hair in front of the Great hall, I think but that's all I remember.

Does anyone know the name of it? (I might be mixing up two fanfics here but I'm not sure)

  Arianna Katherine Snape: daughter of Severus Snape, formerly known as Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, that Freak of a Boy. But no longer.Harry Potter has always been abused at home and hated by various people for various reasons at Hogwarts - even by the Gryffindors. So when his Uncle rapes him, it's the final straw. Harry wishes to be somebody different. He wishes for someone who can - and will - love him. The Wish Magicks answer.The Wish Magicks gave him a girl's body and Severus Snape.
