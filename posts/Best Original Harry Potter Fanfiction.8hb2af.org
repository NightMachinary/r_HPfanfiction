So by original I mean best fanfic with a original character as a protagonist. Best male protagonist and best female protagonist ( list one from each category. ) It can't be a genderbendt version of canon character. Or a sibling/relative of a canon character. I also prefer if its not a OC that just ended up with Harry's backstory they have their own unique story.

Its fine if they are the only original character and the rest are canon. Or if the entire cast is just full of ocs minus a few canon characters and it doesn't matter what time period.

I prefer more plot based than ship based story But if there is a ship im fine with m/m, m/f and f/f. I don't care if the oc is shipped with a canon character, another oc or no one. Just as long as the story doesn't revolve around the ship(s) ( if there are ships).


** Inverarity is my favourite fanfiction author, so forgive me if I just list both of his creations:

Male Protagonist:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided]])

This story follows the first generation to enter Hogwarts that was born after Voldemort's death, and the ever increasing tension between the different houses. The protagonist is Teddy Lupin, so technically not an OC, though he may as well be. However, the vast majority of the cast, including the three other co-protaginsts are OC's.

Female protagonist:

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle]])

A series of fanfictions of which 4 are currently complete that follow a cast entirely of OC's, including the protagonist, set in wizarding America during the same time period as /Houses Divided/. Like the Harry Potter series, each book follows one year of the protagonist Alexandra's education at Charmbridge Academy. The first book very loosely follows the outline of /Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone/, but after that the series diverges pretty quickly.

** I would have to say linkao3(11284494). Male protagonist, and one of my favourite novel length fics/series. Its set mostly modern with one major and 2 (so far) minor parts set in founders era hogwarts, with very well written characters all around. I've never enjoyed an OC protagonist so much. Does have a distinct, important ship, but the pairing fits in around the story, not the other way around. First 3 or 4 chapters are a different POV, but that slides quickly and naturally to Nizar once the set-up is complete. There are a sprinkling of different POV parts throughout, but its all done very naturally and doesn't feel jarring like some fics/books.

It doesn't fit the letter of your request as the main character is a canon character that was sent back in time and lived with the founders until he was put into a portrait to revive in the modern era. However, except for part 3 (set in founders era) there is very little of the canon character left after 1000 odd years and growing to adulthood in the 900's and its such a well written fic, I thought it should be included.

I rec it to everyone, its fantastic :)

I did say it's what I first thought of, but don't really recommend, as the only thing it has in common with a Harry Potter fic is the name. I really mean it could change the name and get published as original fiction.

Technically, you could say Lily is a genderswapped version of Harry Potter, but when does it end? The morality, mind, personality, upbringing, even looks, when every single thing about the character is different, till when do you call it a gender swap?
