** Get word on your phone (it's free I think). You can write faster on a phone if your good at it, word spell checks for you and you can write anywhere. More of a technical tip than anything else but spelling can make or break a story.

I'll read what you've done and see if I can add anything else. Edit: you've chosen an interesting tense but from a reader's perspective I prefer past tense instead of present. Past tense just makes the story sound more professional in my opinion.

Just look:

"Thank you." Harry says. "Thank you." Harry said.

For me at least there's a difference.

*** Thank you! I agree about past tense sounding more professional. That's a pretty easy fix. Hopefully that will help the dialogue.

** So I am going to put my thoughts done as I read the chapter. First thing first, the beginning block of text makes me want to click off immediately. Now in professional writing, this would be fine because you can space it out so it's not this thick block of text. But on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] it is hard to read as the wall of text it makes is ugly and uninviting.

The next thought is about dialogue. Whenever a new character begins to speak you need to start a completely new paragraph. For example, I would create a new paragraph when the announcer and Troy speak. This needs to happen throughout the story in multiple places and it will help with the large block of texts.

After that I think it would boil down practicing writing more. Everything else seems pretty decent. I feel there was a bit of expositional dump in the beginning but that could just be me.

Yeah, I think the only thing I can really note needing work are the large block of texts. It's just really hard to read and get into the story with them.
