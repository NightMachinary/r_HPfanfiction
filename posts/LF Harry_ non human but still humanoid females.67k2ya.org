Creatures like elves, mermaids, fairies, etc. Non human females that are still attractive, so nothing like trolls and hags. I got this idea while reading a HP LOTR crossover where there was potential for a Harry/elf lady relationship.


** Well I'm pretty sure [[http://ficwad.com/story/76962][Harry Potter and the Midnight Sun]] had what you're looking for, except if I remember correctly it quickly becomes a harem fic with Harry collecting non-human females. I think most of it was just smut (and not very well written if I remember correctly). Read at your own risk. I don't know why I ever read all those years ago and I don't think I made it in very far.

We really need more GOOD stories in the fandom like you are requesting.

**** Oh god, maybe. I can't even remember anymore. I find it scary that I think I've even read a story matching what you describe. Descdending into the murky deaths of fanfiction can be a dangerous thing.

**** Even with LotR crossovers it's rare to find a good one. Most seem be slash with a Harry/Legolas pairing which is unfortunate. Not that I have a problem with slash but it would be nice to have just as many fics with het pairings.

***** The sad thing is that the only stories that exist for fringe subjects (like LOTR romance crossovers) are almost always slash. I tried to find some good Albus Potter romance stories a while ago and I could only find one decent hetero story, meanwhile there was tens of slash stories.

****** WHY WILL NO ONE WRITE HARRY/GALADRIEL???

I want to read about Harry arriving at M.E and not giving much of a shit about its problems. And when he finds himself at Lothlorien he seduces the Lady, steals her away from Celeborn and her throne and they gallivate around M.E. And all the elves are like "OMG get back the queen!!!11". And Harry accidentally kills some ringwraiths, he thought they were bandits. Then they steal a ship from Cirdan, gather a group of misfits and sail across the coast fighting pirates and stealing loot.

Any takers???

****** Exactly!! For some reason a lot of crossovers seem to only have slash pairings. Well not just crossovers... Even in just regular HP fics there is abundance of slash.

******* Lol it's just that subject we never talk about because people get so triggered if you say anything against slash. Even if it's just saying there's too much compared to het.

******** Yep. Just like I said earlier. I try not to say anything against it because it triggers people (and I legitimately have no problem with people writing & enjoying slash) but it's jist not for me and I th wish there was as much het pairing stories out there when I look for fics.
