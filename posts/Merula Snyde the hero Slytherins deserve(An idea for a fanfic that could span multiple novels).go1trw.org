I find Merula Snyde's story incredibly fascinating.

She is a child of death eaters who get caught and are sent to Azkaban. She is then left alone at the house with her Aunt checking in only briefly and then running away back to her house in the fear that she would be at the receiving end of outrage that Snydes receive.

She is usually all alone in the house and sometimes has people trying to vandalism her house. She unfairly receives the outrage for her parents's choices. So we see her coming to Hogwarts all bitter and hateful of others. Especially anyone who is not a Slytherin.

Then we see her gradually going towards the light side and ultimately joining them basically doing the exact opposite of what her parents did.

It would have been incredibly interesting to see how she lives through all this. All while facing the outrage of society, and still manages to develop morality and stand firm against the dark side, like a true Slytherin. This arc would have been incredibly complex but awesome.

Then she would ultimately face the moral crisis when her parents escape for Azkaban about killing her parents or join the dark side?

Making this ultimate sacrifice could ultimately make her the remarkable modern Slytherin figure that the other slytherins needed to rely and inspire upon rather than having someone like Voldy killing generations of wizard. She would have been real threat to Voldemort by standing up and showing others that even Slytherin can be just as brave as others. She would pose serious threat to whole heir of Slytherin attraction point of Voldemort when she would show that she could be infinitely better version that Salazar Slytherin would have been proud of. Basically she would been the perfect character to break the Slytherin bad stereotype

tldr: her whole story could be broken down to a couple of novels which I would love to read. Her arc from being bitter to everyone because of the outrage to choosing the right side to making the ultimate sacrifice to being an ideological threat to Voldemort as far as Slytherins are concerned is incredibly appealing to me. I can easily see this story extensive enough to span multiple books.

What are your thoughts about something like this?

Usually we get hero like lores for fiction. But it would be good if once we could get a fiction lore about someone who goes from being a villian to hero.


** Write it. I'd love to see more Hogwarts Mystery-inspired content. There's not nearly enough.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*
