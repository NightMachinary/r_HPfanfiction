** linkffn(Albus Potter and the global revelation; Albus Potter and the dungeons of Merlin's mist; Gray: Scorpius Malfoy and the blood runes) are probably the best ones. A lot of the others are just fluffy romance.

** I don't normally read next-gens, but [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory2.php?psid=240987][Delicate]] by padfoot4ever is really good, as is the sequel.
