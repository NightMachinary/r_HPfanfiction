One thing that I've been curious about, and that I have seen in plenty of fics I have read, is werewolves apparently having some sort of natural resistence to mind magic. Is this just fanon that's been accepted by many fanfictions, or was anything like this ever mentioned in Harry Potter canon?


** You can probably assume that everything you read about occlumency is fanon. In canon, we know that it is used to guard against legilimency and that it involves clearing your mind, and that's about it.

** I think it's just fanon. I've read enough that "explains" how it's the wolf protecting the mind, or that the wolf subconsciously prowls the mind.

** It's exclusively fanon. There's no canon information regarding werewolves and mental magic.

** Is there anything in Canon about occlumency other then Snape mind-raping Harry?
