Harry tells Dumbledore everything (?) and Albus gathers a troop of people to go down and deal with he Chamber. Mad-Eye and Arthur are part of this basilisk-killing gang. Albus tells everyone that Harry knows there's a basilisk down there bc he did some research. Harry jokes to Arthur, "the basilisk has to be a girl bc i didn't see any parts lol." Arthur is like, "owo when did you see the basilisk irl, i thought you did some research." Harry says, "hAHA TopIC CHANGE."

This is the only scene I remember.

Edit: Disclaimer: the dialogue that I wrote here is not word for word what they said, I tried to capture the gist of the scene because I don't remember exact details


** Is the; "hAHA TopIC CHANGE." verbatim ? Cuz if so, I'd steer clear from a this fic by a 1000km pole.

*** No of course not, I was trying to capture the gist of the scene. Harry deflected the conversation is all i'm trying to say.
