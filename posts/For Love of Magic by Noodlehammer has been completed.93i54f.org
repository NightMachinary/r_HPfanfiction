** I feel like, having been following the fic since about chapter 10 or so, that I've witnessed a mental breakdown in real-time.

*** The first few chapters had so much potential, but then the plot got dragged down by endless powerwank and needless sex and harem building that went no where fast. I haven't even followed it since Harry started in on his professors.

** I do wonder if the author intended to end it now or if it was connected to the remarks he made last month. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8vzvyk/for_love_of_magic_has_updated_and_harry_now_hates/]]

*** I'm going to guess here and say it was probably two things.

One, he may have been getting tired of the setting, and wanted to write powerwank and sex scenes in a different setting. I gather from the author notes he's going to move his version of harry to westeros for a game of thrones crossover.

Two, he was probably getting flamed a lot and was getting tired of explaining his position. Even the last chapter has a bit about how islam is bad.

** Island building was pretty solid, I'm a sucker for that sort of thing. As to the sex scenes? I came in expecting them, didn't bother me. As to Harry's character? Not my favorite but bearable. The writing? Better than the usual Harry Crow fic, but nothing remarkable. All in all a readable fic with unique elements. It was 'average' nothing more nothing less. All in all a decent read but something I probably won't ever go back and reread or mention unless it is specifically asked for in a thread.

I'm just glad that HP fanfic is still being completed, after being in the fandom so long it is just nice to have an author complete a work.

** I have a feeling the author rushed the ending, it felt a little... forced. I get that an endless fic (some fics are 200+ chapters long, end it already!) is also bad, but that's the beauty of fanfiction, you're not forced to stick to an arbitrary word limit.

I dunno, I felt the story had a lot more to offer.

** The last couple of chapters seem to contradict the underlying themes of the work, which I believe are rather utopian. All throughout the book, Harry has forced himself to improve, to find a solution.

The notion that he fails in the end, I think, speaks more about the author's current mindset about the world then what the story was actually building to.

It's pretty clear that he's just done with the whole thing and instead of taking a break and coming back to it when he felt reinvigorated, we are left with a rushed, anticlimactic ending that doesn't suit the 800,000 words that preceded it.

** Personally I had a lot of fun,

While I accept that the writing was not worth a Nobel, it was solid which can only be said about less than 1% of fanfiction.

Also it has the, in my opinion, most believable portrayal of a multi partner relationship.

I liked the exploration of the mechanics of magic that were sorely lacking in the source material AND I liked that is not another canon rehash.

Also I really don't get why so many people critique the sex, I don't really think it takes anything away from the fic, in fact Noodlehammer is one of the authors I feel integrate sex into his fics without it feeling awkward or out of place

** Holy crap, 800k words?! That explains why I eventually gave up on this story about half-way though; it felt like it was going nowhere, and got too off track I felt.

** I gave up on the story after Harry grew the +cool+ weird ponytail, but it sounds like that was probably for the best based on what I saw when scanning some of the more recent chapters.

Powerwank is not my cup of tea.

** I enjoyed the world building and the characters quite a bit. Could have done without the constant porn, but hey, that's just me, and it certainly didn't ruin the story for me. Overall a 9/10 in my opinion, however due to the length I likely won't reread it for a while, as it would suck up an entire day.
