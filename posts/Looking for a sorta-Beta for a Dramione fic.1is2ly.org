I would like someone to talk with about future plot ideas I have for a story that I've begun writing. I already have a normal Beta to criticize what I'm currently writing and check for grammar/spelling/characterization (I don't want to go to her with this because she's very busy and I don't want to dominate her time). I just want some feedback on what I have planned for later in the story.

It's a Draco-centric AU where Draco & Narcissa approach Dumbledore (instead of Snape) for help at the beginning of HBP. What I have already written is [[http://dramione.org/viewstory.php?sid=2115][hosted]] at Hawthorne & Vine, which requires you to be a member to read. If you are interested in being my sorta-Beta and would like to read what I've already written, I can send you it so you don't have to sign up.

I would like someone to occasionally contact for feedback. This person ideally would be honest if they think an idea is cliched/lame, but constructive when they tell me so.

Let me know if you'd be interested!


** Just read the first three chapters and they're great! I'd be willing to help out.
