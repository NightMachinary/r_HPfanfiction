  Voldemort avoided death as a spirit for 13 years. Strangely, he couldn't avoid a bus. One Shot.

** Oh man, I read one just recently, can't remember name though sorry. But it was a Ginny life bond fic, and Hermione found charms that dealt with him as soon as he died and became a spirit again, and Ginny did the one that caged him, and Harry did the one that turned the spirit into stone. Then he just vanished it.

It was quite soul-bond cliche'd, I think it had a different prophecy that said Harry would have a Right Hand, and Dumbledore decided that it'd be best if he were, so he kept trying to Obliviate Ginny. I think, or maybe I'm just blurring fics together at this point.

**** Turns out the spat of soul bond fics I read recently have blurred together; I found the Right Hand prophecy one, but it wasn't the Riddle vanishing one.

Still can't find it, it's getting annoying.

** Edit: sorry, I realized that this doesn't really answer the question. But The Snake Within mentions ideas 1, 2, and 3 linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7888771/20/The-Snake-Within]])

Oh man, there are so many ways to do this

1) Cruciate him until he is insensate. Tit for tat, and justice for what happened to the Longbottoms besides.

2) Permanent Obliviation of all memories above age 3 (same effect as 1)

3) the Dementor's Kiss

4) removing all his limbs with Dark spells so they can't grow back

5) Veil of Death

6) magical contract shenanigans to strip him of his magic

7) Portkey without a destination (inspired by Stephen King's horror story, The Jaunt)

**** But for 4, he could surely 'die' and get himself a new body. I mean, as far as I can tell, nothing stopped him from dying of natural causes, all the Horcrux did was tether his soul to this plane of existence. If that's the right phrase.

Hell, nothing stops him from getting dementia. I like to think Peeves is actually Herpo, he's just so old he's gone harmlessly bonkers.

I also like to think dementors refuse to eat Voldesoul because it's all chewed up. For them it's like rotten food, completely unappetizing.

** I've used several different ways for Harry to defeat him without taking out Horcruxes. "Resouling ritual" in a crossover with BTVS, Sympathetic Magic using one Horcrux as the link, and a mental attack through the link in Harry's head.

** I can't find either one. But I've read one where he made his horcruxes random coins that got destroyed when re-minted. Harry/Hermione either helped feed him the idea and/or magically upgraded the smelter. It's starting to feel like that one was a dream. Another one ends with an Unspeakable tossing a horcrux through the Veil and it calling all its parts in with it.

*** Yup! The "fence post security" bit got me thinking about this a lot.

If Voldemort has some indeterminate horcruxes above 6 and u still would have to beat him in a duel, I feel there are better strategies than just killing them all.

What if Voldemort had one extra Hircryx? What if he hid the diary in a better place then lucius malfoy's house? No nobody would actively seek out some random diary.

Anyway a fic im writing will probably have Dumbledore defeat him in a way that doesnt involve horcruxes. So i wanted to see what others had thought of as inspiration.

**** You could also have Voldemort not using horcruxes at all. He wouldn't be as much marked, physically, and he would be saner. It changes all the dynamics if done well (if you actually ask yourself how a Voldemort without horcruxes would differ from the one we know).

And I'm off-topic again...
