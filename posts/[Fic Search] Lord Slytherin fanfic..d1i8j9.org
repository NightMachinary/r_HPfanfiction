:END:
I'm probably just bad at using the fanfiction.net search bar, but typing the name of the fanfic 'Lord Slytherin' doesn't show up. Since there isn't a thread to do so, I thought I might try using the bot of this to see if it can find it. And if not, then it was a story about Harry going into a dimension where Tom Riddle becomes Lord Slytherin, and is as powerful as Dumbledore more or less. Thought I followed it, but apparently not. Author was a bit insecure and instead of working towards producing more chapters, focused on revising and expanding older chapters, so I'm hoping it didn't get deleted, cause I can't find my reviews for the story either.

** So I have read a lot, and your description helps, but any other info to help narrow it down?

*** It was a Harry x Bellatrix pairing. Last chapter that I read because that was it, involved Harry recovering after getting ambushed at his makeshift house by wannabe Voldemort. He shows her and Tom his memories of them in his dimension, signs a contract to work with them and etc.

  Harry sacrificed everything to kill the Dark Lord. He sacrificed more to kill the next one. And the next. And the next. By the end, he had nothing left to give, and nothing left to win. Burdened by failure, he's thrown into a new world with familiar faces and unfamiliar personalities, and must fight to survive. AU, Dimension Travel, Graphic Violence.

*** Yeah, that's it. Looks like there still hasn't been an update. Interesting I remember the title being Lord Slytherin.

  He was abandoned. He was abused. Hailed as a hero but lived as a freak. Through a turn of events he discovers his inheritance, makes a decision that alters his life. No longer will he suffer, no longer will he be a pawn. His friends rejoice, his enemies beware Harry Potter has just returned!
