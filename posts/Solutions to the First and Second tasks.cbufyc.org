Has anyone seen any inventive takes on solutions to the first (dragon) and Second (lake) tasks in the triwizard tournament employed by our various harrys of the fan fiction multiverse?

Just for reference:

First task canon solution: summons firebolt and avoids the dragon by flying, eventually riling it up enough to slip past it's defences and grab the golden egg.

Second task canon solution: is supplied with gilliweed, which turns him into a sorta fish hybrid for an hour, he stays near the hostages for most of it to make sure they're all rescued.

I think Harry using parseltongue to talk with the dragon is a fairly well known alternative.

  When he learns that flying anywhere near a Dragon is a recipe for suicide, Harry tries a last minute change of tactics, one designed to use the power of the Bureaucracy forcing him to compete against itself. Little does he know that his solution is its own kind of trap.

** I'm doubt that Harry or any school level participant) is advanced enough to pull it off (at least with Canon magic), but I always like the idea to use Transfiguration in both case.

First Task: Harry tearing part of his robe and using the string to go around the Dragon, before transfiguring it into heavy shacles, ultimately chaining the dragon and just walking to the eggs and taking the golden one.

Second Task: Freezing the lake in front of him so he can just walk toward the village and only going into the water when above it. Once his hostage rescued, freezing some water to make a mini iceberg than can bring them to the surface, and just walking toward the shore.
