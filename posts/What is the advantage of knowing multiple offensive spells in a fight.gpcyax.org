In many stories, most of the low-medium level fights consist of people throwing colorful lights at each other. In a duel it's usually stupify and expelliarmus, while in a serious fight it's some fatal curse: blood-boiling, bone breaking, entrail-expelling or any other straight-forward offensive spell. Authors often add many other spells to that list, but getting hit by one of these curses usually ends the confrontation, regardless of which spell that was.

So I've been wondering, what's the point of knowing many offensive spells? It looks like throwing one curse over and over would yield the same result as using different spell with each attack.

What's your take on that problem? Do you have some head-canon that explains it or maybe there is some story, where knowing a lot of offensive spells gives an advantage in combat?


** Imagine the swordsman who only slashes down from the right. That's pretty easy to figure out after the first or second time. You need to be able to end the fight in one blow if thats all you know. When you are fighting someone equal or greater than you the element of surprise is super important.

*** The problem is that every single spell is either blocked by a shield charm or has to be dodged.

You react differently to a sword from a different direction so predicting which way an attack comes from matters.\\
But with spells you really can just throw up a shield for almost everything.

Every wizard needs just two spells, one that goes through a shield charm and one that doesn't.

***** I've always liked that, and it seems very logical. Because magic evolves and people make new spells, there must be an entire series of attack spells that are geared towards a Protego. In breaking the Shield, they lose some power and/or some effects become unviable, so spells that are still blockable by a Protego stick around instead of being superseded by shieldbreaker versions.

****** Yeah, there are lots of interesting ways you can spin this. Another way is to consider the amount of effort expended, since magic is portrayed as physically taxing. Maybe you /can/ block (almost) everything with an overpowered Protego, but you'll run out of juice much faster than if you were using more precise defenses. The same principle can justify why you might prefer to deflect a spell rather than block it outright; it leverages precision to conserve energy.

**** The way I view it, if you know the spells the opponent use, you either have the spell to defend against that spell, know when to dodge when the opponent cast the spell, or prep some other forms of defense against the spell. Knowing the opponents reportiare of spells will let you be able to make a counter attack or form one. Someone with a limited knowledge of offensive spells or a simple ones will be a lot easier to defend and counter than someone who knows a lot more and probably more powerful spells. That's my theory at least.

** The simple answer is when you have become predictable you have already lost.

Whether it is a duel or a fight, if your opponent can figure out your strategy or skills then its only a matter of time they figure out a way to counter. You can't simply steamroll everyone with the same move every time, you may get away with it once or twice but the minute you face someone who can pick you apart they will pick you apart. That is why knowing a good few offensive spells is good. Like, okay the person is shielding your stunners, blow the ground up to off-balance them.

Does knowing an overwhelming amount of spells fix this predictability? No, not at all. What good is knowing a lot of spells if you are slow at casting them or they a slow to cast? Or as some lovely fanfics suggest spell chaining. The idea has merit and I think it makes a lot of sense for a dueling situation where the area is limited. But speed is important so knowing a few good spells by heart would be very important. And I mean knowing the spells so well that you don't fancy wand-waving or incantations to cast them.

Personally I always prefer the idea of the caster using more basic spells to control area which controls the fight. Such as creating water and freezing it to capture or slip the opponent or summoning birds to cause a distraction for a longer casting spell. A lot of the simple spells are point and cast, or at least they are simple to learn as point and cast. Assuming some sort of logic can be applied to magic, a person could cast more smaller spells then offensive spells which are supposed to be more magically taxing (not sure if that is canon anywhere or not, but it would make sense to me). So being creative and being able to win by using less magic would be the better option.

TLDR: Being predictable and knowing only a few offensive spells will get you beaten. Knowing how to use a few spells by heart and being creative will mean you more likely to win. That is my take.

**** Sure, but if an Olympic-level fencer did that to another Olympic-level fencer then they'd likely get their ass kicked themselves. I think we're assuming that all of the combatants are at least decent fighters, with varying levels of skill. So while Voldemort could likely do that and get away with it when going up against some members of the DA, he couldn't with Dumbledore. And the DA seem to be able to hold their own against Death Eaters in terms of skill, if not knowledge. Sure, they get their asses kicked then get saved by the Order, but they held their own for a while before that happened. If they had a greater level of knowledge, more comparable to the Death Eaters, then it would have been a more even fight, which is falls in line with what's being said about having more knowledge and variety to help you win a fight.

** Versatility. A spell might have great stopping power (a stunner) but might be easily stopped by a protego whereas a transfiguration might not have as much stopping power but can't be as easily stopped with a shield. Stopping power also tends to be something authors neglect a lot. Stunners tend to be scoffed at by authors but they work well. They instantly stop their target. Sure, they can be reawoken easily but it's a hell of a lot easier to tag an opponent with a killing curse if they can't use their wand because they'e stunned.

** I think it's more a matter of having enough tools that you can solve a wider variety of problems. Canon doesn't have much with that, but if you can expand the magic system a bit you can get interesting things depending on the result you want.

For example, maybe certain shield spells are better or worse against other kinds of spells, so knowing say, Protego is bad against a blood boiling curse could be advantageous especially if you can cast it silently and your opponent can't recognize it.

Maybe you want to just incapacitate the guy, so you use Stupefy, or just disarm them, Experlliarmus, or maybe you want to kill them, An Avada Kedavra or to keep it legal, a well placed Diffindo, maybe you want them to die slowly so use a withering curse that's difficult to heal, or Sectum Sempra.

If a duellist is good a dodging and blocking they can be a success with only expelliarmus and/or stupefy, those along with basic charms like filipendo or the levitation one would be enough if you have the basics well.

BUT you may need to learn other spells if you are fighting non-humans, like giant spiders, trolls, giants, dragons, beings that are resistant to magic or need specific or stronger spells to defeat them, for example, a troll may be resistant to direct damage like stunning or cutting but maybe the bone-breaker works better.

Of course, you can expand this further, needing different shields for certain types of spells, or needing to learn specific counter curses for specific curses, making said curses more useful if their counters are not well known.

If you look at canon, it's more a question of doing something well than doing lots of things, Dumbledore, arguably the most powerful dueller we see in canon, fights Voldemort and Bellatrix more with advanced transfiguration and clever tactics than launching a whole color spectrum of spells at them.

In FB 1 and 2, where we could finally see adult wizards fighting more, they don't even tell us what spells they are using, just that they mostly seem to be the same blue one(maybe a blasting or cutting hex?) the most advanced we saw was the Protego Diabolica and that overpowered Finite Incantatem Nicolas Flamel used to stop it. I REALLY want them to make Dumbledore vs Grindelwald a REALLY, REALLY cool duel and not just Jude Law and Johnny Deep throwing lights and screaming at each other.

** Leaving aside situations in which you decided that you'd rather boil someones blood than expell their entrails, I suppose the answer depends on how you imagine duelling (and, more generally, magic) works. For instance, if you posit that to counter a spell you need to know what it does, or at least, that it is /easier/ to block when you do, then a large repertoire immediately makes sense, because you increase the chance that your opponent won't know what you're casting. And if you're casting silently, then even if he does, he's still having to best guess, and couldn't use the same response once he figured out the spell.

I agree there's not much use knowing different spells of the same very general effect (e.g., causing bodily harm) if all you need is /Protego/ to hide behind, but then I don't think that's how duelling works, either.

Somewhat separate from the whole discussion is the Killing Curse. For direct attacks (that is, not using charms or transfiguations to attack by proxy) there is nothing better. But you don't always want to kill someone, and we don't know how hard it is to cast.

** Some spells have specific counters, both as a shield and to counter the effects of that spell. So a stupify is reversed by a reawakening spell. While a bloodboiling spell would require more to counter. As for a bone breaking spell, it'd require a bone regrowing potion. And on and on it goes.

As for the combat aspect of it, what is more useful for that situation. If you are alone and about to be spotted by a group of enemies, wouldn't an explosion in the middle of their group be to your advantage instead of just a measly stupify?

What about if you are fighting with friends you wouldn't necessarily want to throw around explosions then when people move around as much. While if someone is running down a hallway, you'd mostly just want something that is relatively unblockable and faster than their running speed

** I think it has to do with the way you can shield from each spell. There was a fic which explore the idea that the general shield charm wasn't effective for every spells and that counter spells were a necessity while defending for a lot of combat spells.

Predictability is also a great weakness in fight and doing all kind of spells which has various effets on the opponent or his environment can be useful.

Also, it can hinder recovery. Casting obscure spells can make it difficult to know how to cancel it during or after the fight (like what did Dolohov against Hermione during the DOM fight, iirc).

** Depends on the spell.

When it comes to your jet of light with nasty effects then you really just need two, one a shield works against and one it doesn't (though depending on the writer that second category might only be the killing curse and therefore unavailable to many people).

Now for fancy stuff like animating statues, conjuring objects, moving the ground to swallow your opponent, basically the Voldemort Vs Dumbledore fight stuff, then it could be useful, that's the stuff that noone can dodge, that could probably take out multiple people and that only someone who knows a similar spell to counter with can react to and is a very effective addition to your arsenal.\\
It's still worth mixing in the normal spells.

By far the best combat we ever see is Voldemort fighting Dumbledore, he really does stick to these rules, he's mostly doing the big stuff hat few could actually stop, but with killing curses thrown in whenever he sees a chance.

To be a great duelist you should: practice one reliable offensive spell until you can cast it silently, quickly and practically without thinking (what it is doesn't truly matter as long as a hit will take someone out of the fight, I'd go stupefy as it's adequate against a real threat while still being safe to use in any situation), learn a second spell that can get through shields to the same degree (this is probably the killing curse, and that's one reason to have the other spell at all, the second is to hope they shield when they should dodge because they're used to spell 1), practice your shield spell to the same degree, then you learn as much of the big difficult stuff as you can.

** I like to think you would want to know a lot of spells so you can combine the wand movements into each other. So for example you cast a spell that ends with a diagonal slash down to the right into a spell where your starting wand position is the bottom right that way you can have as seamless spell transitions as possible

I then like to think that spells have different speeds so like a pitcher wouldn't always throw his fast ball, would need a change up to disrupt the defenders timing

** For spell combat, while shielding is a catch all, specific spells have specific counters as well, and not every spell has the same power level requirements, and not every spell can be blocked with shielding charm. One probably would want to know a variety of spells, particularly low-level spells, to quickly cast and keep an opponent on the defensive, without tiring quickly, then use more devastating/powerful spells in an opportune moment when you have better odds of hitting your opponent.

I remember in the 4th book, Moody was addressing the class on the Unforgivables, and mused even with proper instruction, the 4th year class he was addressing wouldn't have the necessary power to cast the killing curse. So, bearing that in mind, I would imagine that even Voldemort couldn't toss killing curses around like candy.

** Well, assuming the magic system isn't so simple as to allow the shield spell to block everything (At least a few spells can go through shields) different spells may have different counters and uses. In battle what would be important is the spell's speed, effect and ease of countering.

Realistically speaking, a quicker spell is more difficult to dodge but maybe they are generally easier to shield against. Perhaps a spell designed to break a shield would be useful if you can cast a second spell right afterwards. Perhaps sometimes you want to attack indirectly, blow up the ground to their right to get some rubble to fly everywhere, make some smoke around you to make you difficult to target, attack them by seemingly missing and have something attack from behind, etc.

** If I write a duel, a deadly and powerful one like ministry duel between Dumbles and Voldy, I'll go with creativity over power, transfiguring? Clever spell chains? Yes! It's always more interesting than some "STUPEFY!" "EXPELLIARMUS" trading with some protegos thrown in the middle

Now, if one knows more spells they can be more versatile and creative, obscure spells need obscure shields in my head, so the more spells you know, the more you can surprise your enemy, and if you surprise your enemy they have less time to think of a counter to that, you saw the countering in the ministry duel, transfiguring everything into a harder to undo attack, I'm fairly sure if someone had launched a stupefy at either one they'd have just taken a step back or to the side..

Sorry for that, that must have been hard to read..

Anyway, I hope you get my point, the more spells you know, the more creative you can be, and if one is creative enough it will surprise the enemy, and surprise attacks are always better than expected ones

** Fast spells, blast spells, space spells, transfiguration, summoning, animal magic to control the area and increase opponents, countercurses to make the opponent defend against their own curses. A long list of reasons why more spells help you control battle field thus increasing your win.

Shields are not strong enough against elementals and fast attacks like lightning. Fast at thinking and knowledge and practice of such spells come a long way. A simple metal rod can absorb all the powerful lightning opponent sends out. A jet of flames converted to conscious snake can divide the opponents attention. Many more examples and creative ideas to think.

** Well if you are thinking in response to dueling.

Different spells attack differently and require different defenses. So knowing more allow one to control damage, injury, and versatility.

For example:

Let's assume this is a duel of equal strength.

Defender: only on the defense with a strong sheild charm. Let's also say it's defending their entire front like a swat shield. For one final addition it is unable to be broken.

Attacker:

You are just dueling for fun. You don't want any damage to your friend but you still want to win. You cast the petrification charm. Their sheild blocks it. You see the a stone wall behind them, you fire off a jelly leg jinx (let's say this spell can bounce off walls). It hits them from behind making them drop their sheild. You then petrify them and win.

You are fighting for your life. It's all or none. You fire off a burn spell. Sheild blocks it. You have nothing else to utilize to get behind them. You fire bombard at their feet, rocks are throw up causing damage. Not enough. You fire bombard a maxima at their feet, the kick back sends them flying into the air. You take your opening and cast incarserus tying them up and winning. (Or whatever end it spell you want.)

Basically unless you have absolutely noone in your life that you would ever need to kill. Or noone in your life you'd ever not kill then you need varying damage spells. Then depending where you are you need different functions on your spells for creativity.

Now do you need confringo, bombarda, bombarda maxima, and reducto? Probably not. They do a lot of the same sort of things. However if the difference between a pressure knock back, vs one that produces fire, vs one that breaks down to rubble you may want to know all of them

Same thing for non damage spells. These all imobilize in some way but all work differently.

Incarcerous- wraps them in rope

Petrificus Totalus- makes them stiff as a board

Leg locking jinx- makes their knees shoot together and they typically fall down. Their arms are free.

Jelly leg jinx- makes their legs give out underneath them insuring they fall but their arms still work

Stupify- basically just KOs a person

So it really depends what you would want to do. Would PT be best always? No. What if you need to move them to avoid detection. It's more difficult that way and they can't talk to you during questioning.

Is the jelly leg jinx better than the leg lock because it guarantees the fall? No, because their legs can flail out allowing them to transition into a roll.

** I've read a fic where different styles of duelling where explained, who uses them and what spells are ideal for the style. I think it was Moody where doing the explaining.

** Authors make more spells to make it interesting and to better show power of wizards. Spells can be faster or slower, different colour, effect(obviously) and different "weakness". You can have spell like AK that can't be blocked or. Can only be blocked by specific shield. Then there are spell chains, I saw some authors use them to show development and power. If he can use different spells in quick succession then he must be good right? I never wrote HP fanfiction but I don't think it would be easy to write with limited repertoire of spells or interesting to reader to see only stupefy, expeliarmus and avada kedavra in big battle. Knowledge is power is used a lot in those fic if I had to guess :) on mobile sorry for format

** My HC is that some spells are better in certain situations. The KC, for example, can pierce any shielding spell and kills instantly, but can be stoped with physical objects, can only kill one person per use and seem to have to be incanted since even characters who frequently use their spells silently still incant when using the KC (don't remember the name but I once read a fanfic whose whole premise is that James realizes that saying Crucio takes less time than Avada Kedavra when Voldemort came), so it can't reasonably be used to capture a target, will only kill one enemy at a time and takes time to use, leaving the user vulnerable to enemy action in the time they take to use the spell and gives a second enemy the chance of casting his own spell while the user is focusing on the target.

Cursed Fire on the other side has the potential of burning down a large city (Grindewald almost burned Paris using it), but it is hard to control and stop even for the user to say nothing of the target, will kill anyone on its effect-zone even allies and will destroy the things objects around you, so can't be used if the user wants to take anything from the area with them or has allies fighting around and will require focus on the users part, plus the possibility of the user losing control and being killed by their own spell.

Blasting curses can't be used safely underwater or close to the user, can be blocked by shields, destroys the object it hits and is an area effect spell, so will affect allies if in range, but will also render physical shields a liability (the projects blasted at high velocity by explosion will arguably be more dangerous than the curse itself), will affect any enemies in range and possibly cause injuries that will affect the rest of the fight, like burns, broken bones, or projected bird of rock embedded in the target's body, plus the possibility of using it in the area, like making a piece of the calling fall down on the target. As it isn't immediately lethal it could be used both for capture or killing, or even for flighting in blocking the path of the pursuers and blasting obstacles in the path of the user.

Cutting curse can be blocked by charms, but will hit the target in a long line instead of a single point and cause from a small cut up to the complete and permanent amputation of a member and can be used for both killing and capture.

Then there are the curses that causes particularly gruesome deaths, such as organ expelling that can be used to cause shock and fear in people that are not used to seeing such gore, possibly causing reluctance in fighting the killer and their group or even making would be attackers freeze, being useful for crowd control, particularly if fighting against a larger group disorganized and untrained but armed.

And biding curses like incarcerus, petrificus, stupefy and locomotor mortis are useful for capture a target or getting them out of the fight for a little time.

Really, would depend on the specific spell and what it does, also there is the possibility of some spells taking more concentration or time to prepare or some spells having motions that end in the first of another spell, thus taking away the time to cast the second.

** I agree, I don't see why DEs even bother with curses that are not AK, why should let their opponent a chance to block the curse?

And they are wasting time trying to "impress" people with their skill and knowledge, I ghost don't see the point in difrent attack spells, they just want win the fight, and finish the other parson off.
