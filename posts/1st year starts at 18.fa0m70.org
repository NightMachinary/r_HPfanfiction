Hi all, apologies if this has been asked before but looking for fics where school starts closer to 17/18 and not looking for pure smut but I would prefer mature rating. For potential finer points I'm pictures similar to the books at least to start, and I prefer Harry as the main character usually shipped with hermione, or fleur or daphne. Really open but if there happens to be a multitude that's been hiding from me figures I'd mention that.


** [[/r/brakebills][r/brakebills]] the TV show would definitely suit your needs

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.

** Grey Space by noaact

"In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents.

When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have."

This is well written but is unfinished. It ends when Dumbledore shows up to try to talk a very bitter Harry Potter into attending Hogwarts.

  What if Hogwarts had to wait to start till student's were 18 when their magical cores matured? With magicals going to the Saint Schools for primary/secondary, they have a big lead on the Muggleborn in everything but magic. Follow Harry as he leaves Stonewall behind to enter into Magic where the rules seems stacked against the Muggleborn/raised. AU with alternative sortings. Harry/?
