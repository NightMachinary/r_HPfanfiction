Awile back i read family bonds. Since then i have been searching for fics like that but have found not much. So my request to you is do you have a fic that is similair to family bonds like harry learning alchemy or harry traveling the world while learning magic from those places or harry buying/building a castle. Please let me know i already look forward to it.

Please would like it if atleast 100k words or minimum 70k words.


** Never read family bonds. Give me an overview and I might be able to point to similar fics, but I can't promise anything

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
