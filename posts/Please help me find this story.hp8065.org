:END:
Some time ago I'd read this fantastic Voldemort/Harry Potter story and unfortunately I didn't bookmark it (fml). I think it was on A03 but it mightve been fanfiction.net bc i was reading from both sites at the time.

I can only remember the end

So Harry had been chained up and was taken to the wizengamot for a trial. Snape and Dumbledore were there. Voldemort showed up to take Harry back and duked it out with Dumbledore. Meanwhile Snape proceeds to bash Harry's head into the floor 3 times ( Voldemort and Harry were in a relationship at this point btw) subsequently, Harry dies. Afterwards, some time has passed, Snape being on the run, goes to the Potter house, to Harry's nursery and mourns for a bit before Voldemort appears and abducts him. He takes Snape somewhere ( cant remember) and out pops Harry because he made a horcux and Voldemort brought him back!! After Harry kills Snape, Voldemort and Harry go to their idealic cottage by the sea that they'd wanted to escape to and it ends with Voldemort swinging Harry around while they laugh.

I legit can't remember anything else about it, I just know if was so heart warming and the plot twist with snape abused my feels.

Please help me find this fanfic, I wanna read it over again. Have Mercy.
