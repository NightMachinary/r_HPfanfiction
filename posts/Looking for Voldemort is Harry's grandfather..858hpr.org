They do not discover this early. For instance something went awry during V. resurrection at the end of 4th year due to their kinship (blood of the enemy bla-bla). Or in the 5th year Dumbledore reveals that it's stated in the prophecy that V. will be vanquished by his descendant and it is in fact H.

One of them sits on this info for some time, a year or more, then the second learns it somehow also. And then story goes with some Shakespearean tones.

Nothing cheesy like H. learns the truth and forgetting everything runs to V. to reunite the family.

--------------

Better even grand-grandfather; so they have greater distance in relation. Since Voldemort is 54 years older than Harry, it is possible that he's his grand-grandfather.

V. might've had an affair during summer at the orphanage, or maybe he raped somebody at that time. It produced a squib or squib->squib that led to Lily's birth.

Lily even might have had ability to speak with snakes, but hid it after learning that it's frowned upon.


** I remember a story that had Grindelwald as Harry's grandfather but I think that was abandoned.

I also seem to recall an old story (written preHBP) that had Lily as Voldemort's long lost daughter but it was also unfinished. I recall reading up to the part where Lucius Malfoy and Snape were courting her. Sadly, there's no mention of Harry here.

**** Grindelwald is Harry's grandfather in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2680093/1/Circular-Reasoning][this one]] though it's more complicated than that with time travel and a bit of a crossover with Dresden Files. It's also not quite canon compliant with little bits like Grindelwald being a nom de guerre and Dumbledore as Grindelwald's godfather etc.
