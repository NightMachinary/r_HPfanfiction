I remember that Harry decides to say screw it and tell everybody who he has had sexual/explicit thoughts about before Snape can, making for some akward scenes for Harry. There was a scene in the ROR where harry got slapped I think? I don't think it was a lemon fic, it was just about the subject of sexual thoughts about others and how everyone reacted. Thanks for any help and sorry if I got the flair wrong, first time on reddit.


** Hi I'm new to reddit too! I've read the fanfic you're thinking about and I think this is it:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4707140/1/The-Python-Defense]]

I think that's the one you're talking about, where Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape go wrong and he has to confess to a bunch of girls.

#+begin_quote
  Harry formulates an innovative taunting-based Occlumency barrier inspired by Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Snape retaliates by threatening to reveal Harry's perviest memories and fantasies, including those involving a certain bushy-haired best friend.
