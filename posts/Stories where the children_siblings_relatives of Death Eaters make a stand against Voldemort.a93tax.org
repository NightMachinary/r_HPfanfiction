Are there any fics where, for example, Delphi Riddle is thrown back in time and join Harry's side? Where Hestia Carrow works against the older Carrow twins? Where Draco decides early on (before calling Hermione a mudblood) that his father is not to be followed?

No m/m please.


** Hmm...I remember a tumbler chain musing on this sort of thing. The basic concept was that Cassius Warrington, rather than Cedric Diggory, is chosen as the Hogwarts champion in Goblet of Fire. When he's killed on Voldemort's orders, and his parents (death eaters) don't appear to mourn him, it causes uncertainty in Slytherin house which ends up steering them away from Voldemort.

Also, I haven't read it in full, but I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12392763/1/The-Other-Champion][The Other Champion implements said idea]], though it only goes through book 4 and not the subsequent war against Voldemort.

*** The Other Champion and its sequel were very baffling to read. The author somehow has made Daphne as Harry's rock, but they've only spoken to each other a handful of times.

I don't think the author has gotten around to describing any uncertainity in Slytherin house just yet. He last updated this fic about five months ago, and the last chapter had it sometime in August before Harry's fifth year.

*** I particularly liked how draco reneges, not because V is evil or anything, but mostly because hes a bad teacher.

I also liked the part about how "the key was within you all along."

  As far as Heidi Zabini's concerned, Draco Malfoy is everything wrong with the Pureblooded elite that her surname pushed her into. But the summer has been about as kind to Malfoy as he's been to her, and the school year seems no better. Little by little, Heidi can't help but try to keep him afloat. However, there's that minor matter of reversing 16 years of damage between them...
