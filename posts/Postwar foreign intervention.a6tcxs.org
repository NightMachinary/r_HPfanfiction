Are there any stories where, after watching the reign of Voldemort and the lacklustre canon cleanup of Death Eaters and the Ministry, the other European nations decided to invade and restructure the government similar to what happened in Germany after 1945?

Please no m/m, no Ron/Hermione and preferably no Big Weasley family. And obviously no Death Eater apologism.


** I've read a number of post-canon stories and haven't seen one with this premise. The war didn't hit these other countries after all, unlike WW2. Even Hitler was doing a lot of crap (pre-war) without anyone stepping in.

Besides, are we supposed to believe the rest of Europe is so much better than Britain? We know the Lestranges are shady and horrible in France, Durmstrang does not even allow muggleborns to attend, and Grindelwald got a lot of followers from outside Britain. Since the pro-pureblood stuff doesn't end with him (see Durmstrang), they likely didn't make changes after his defeat. Austria has a good prison, at least, but it was built by Grindelwald. I get the impression that the European wizarding world as a whole needs reforms. If anything, the referenced post-canon changes (removing the dementors from Azkaban, getting rid of pro-pureblood laws, equal rights for magical creatures) would put Britain ahead of the foreign governments. Malfoy (both of them) escaped punishment, but they're stripped of the political protection and public support they used to have.

The Nürnberg laws, violating a treaty no one expected to last and the annexation of Czechoslovakia. Compared to the general population, the death toll during that time was not high and most of the cleansings were focused on political opposition.

We know too little and none of Rowling's worldbuilding makes sense outside of the Isles, Iberia and maybe France (although there would be issues over magical Alsace and Lorraine as well as the 18th-century French ambitions in the Low Countires and Italy). She has one school for all of Asia IIRC.

Based on the statute of secrecy, there still should be a magical Prussia and an elective monarchy in "Germany". An argument can be made in either direction, although I'd like to think that Britain was a lot better before Voldemort's first reign of terror and the overall level in Europe is higher.

**** You are ignoring alot of political stuff when it comes to intervening in ww2

France wanted to step in right away,but Britain didnt and both were still suffering from the after effects of ww1 and the depression. When Hitler did what he did he kept thinking they would step in, and when they didnt he would push forward with more. It wasn't until he invaded Poland that the allies declared on him and that was only because he could not make excuses for Poland. He invaded Austria and the other former "German" lands and those claims held some merrit. But Poland and the land it held was mostly Polish and he couldn't bullshit an excuse as to why he invaded it. Also the global community didnt know about the holocaust until later in the war.

***** The Allies knew by 43 due to Polish resistance fighters infiltrating the camps. They however did not believe the reports.

Also, France and the UK simply lacked the capabilities to intervene. The French could gamble on a rematch of 1914 and the Royal Navy could easily trash the German surface fleet and blockade the North Sea again, but a naval invasion was doomed as long as Germany had not thrown millions into the meat grinder called Eastern Front (The invasion of France would have gone very differently if the Allies had faced more than a dozen divisions or lacked the thousands of planes they had later on). At that point, the Soviet Union was quite friendly towards the Germans and would have happily provided equipment and supplies should the Allies start a war in the west (in exchange for money and concessions similar to the Molotov Ribbentrop Treaty). Without the Soviet Union, the Western Front would turn into a rematch of 1914, with more movement and yet still the same stalemate (at least pre 1940 or in a no Eastern Front scenario).

And Danzig had a German majority, which was the reason for the Danzig or War demand.

******* And an utterly incompetent leadership (eg their Field Marshall refused to use the radio and had everything reported to him via messengers), no communications equipment in the vehicles and no ability for an deep advance into Germany since the border region had difficult terrain and an overall lack of modern doctrines.

Numbers alone do not win the war unless you can drown the enemy in bodies like the Soviets did, a tactic unfeasible for France because they had the smaller population base. The first world war had plenty of examples of smaller numbers holding against a superior force because they had fortified themselves.

Their tanks were nearly impenetrable to the German ones, but they were still vulnerable to Stukas, artillery and AA ground fire. Or could be simply bypassed due to bad mobility.

**** Eh, Beauxbatons also has a half-human head mistress and veela students. Grindelwald went into all of Europe and the Lestranges are bad, but that doesn't necessarily mean France itself is a magical bigoted nation.

If anything, France seems far more liberal than England. But there really isn't much information out there---Norway, where Durmstrang is, and the United States seem quite bigoted towards people who don't have magical blood.

***** Isn't the half-human headmistress ashamed of her bloodline and denies it when asked? That's why she gets so upset with Hagrid for pointing it out. The implication is that people probably know, but it's something shameful to mention. However she became headmistress, she still wouldn't have that reaction if France was so comfortable with half-humans.

I don't think Veelas are a good measure because they are built to be desirable. That's a bit different than other half-humans/non-human.

Though it is true that we don't have a lot of information.

****** The lack of information is the issue. But considering Remus seems to be unable to hold a steady job because people simply "guess" that he may be a werewolf, and is completely blackballed after Snape outs him as a werewolf, indicates that France, however racist it might be, is still more tolerant in that they hire someone who is clearly not entirely human to run their most famous/biggest school. Headmistress is a far more powerful position than head of house, like Flitwick.

Also, we really don't see any non-humans in any position of power outside of Flitwick in the wizarding world.

*** Because the British Ministry just turned Azkaban into a concentration camp, carried out a genocide with an enormous death toll (relative to population) while Death Squads roamed the country and the only school of the nation became a Battlefield. At least a third of the Ministry had to be involved in that and there is no way the Order could push for serious reforms after their losses during the Battle of Hogwarts. At that point, Shacklebolt and the adult Weasleys are the only known survivors and while Harry might be fearsome in a duel after the fight with Voldemort, he has absolutely no political power and could be sidelined with ease.

You need someone else for the clean-up and what the Ministry did was basically a mini-holocaust where they first copied the Nürnberg laws on racial hygiene and then rounded up all undesirable elements and interned them in a prison which violates any and all human rights. And afterwards, they went back to their paperwork and justice was not served (eg Malfoy was not imprisoned despite his countless (war) crimes). It would be a "never again" moment for the other magical communities.

******* Depends on you. But given that most people here hate the actual movies and do not consider them canon because they disliked the Ron interpretation, I would say around here no. Like Pottermore, they are extended canon (at best).

Basically, the pecking order is:

- The 7 books

- Word of God(Rowling)/the Movies

- The other of "Word of God(Rowling)/the Movies", depending on your previous preference.

- Pottermore

I'm sorry, there's not a state in the world which would allow a foreign power to waltz in, and interfere in what is essentially a subsidiary state.

Also, the wizarding government after the war is made up of those who fought Voldemort. By forsaking them, muggle Britain would essentially be giving a big fuck you to those who had fought and bled for their muggle/muggleborn rights. Future Dark Lords would have a much easier time if they were to do so.

***** The government is made up out of the people who worked in the Ministry, quite a substantial part of which collaborated with Voldemort. And unlike in France 1944/45, those were not punished in canon. "Those who fought" were Kingsley and Arthur, everyone else is presumably dead. That's two men, maybe three if Hestia Jones survived. Against hundreds? I don't see how they could push for serious changes, not without some muscle backing them up.

Also, the Muggles are powerless to stop any magical intervention. There is absolutely nothing they could do against an invasion of the French, Dutch or Germans. And I was not talking about an annexation or subjugation, but rather something like West Germany where a new system is set up and then released into its own while keeping observers in place to prevent regressions.

Most people, when faced with the possibility that their familes could be slaughtered at the whims of a megalomaniac, usually tend to keep their heads down and follow the regime, even if they may personally believe something else. People generally don't become suicidal when faced with the chance that their belligerence could mean the death or torture of their families, and therefore won't decide to become heroes. Just because a person is cowed/coerced into accepting the change of regime does not make that person a willful collaborator, like you're suggesting.

Going by this logic that regime had an overwhelming support, there's no reason for the Death Eaters to surrender when Voldemort died. Voldemort was a figurehead for the Death Eaters to rally around, but although he was powerful, a faction does not need a powerful figurehead once it has taken power, especially with superior numbers and support.

But since we know that the civil war ended when Voldemort died, like a fairy tale, it is safe to say that they didn't have numerical superiority.

They could just have their diplomats to muggle France, Germany and the Netherlands inform those respective muggle governments that there's been a declaration of war on the UK by their respective Ministries of Magic. That ought to be enough bring those wiz states to heel.

A few imperius curses and memory modifications and the Muggles are dealt with. And that is assuming that the German government was responsible for the magical world at all. For all we know, there is no unified Germany and you still have magical nations like Prussia and the PLC minding their own business.
