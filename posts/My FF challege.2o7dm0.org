Rules/Boundaries for FF Challenge

Laws of Magic are as follows: Students at Hogwarts are taught from an early age that 3 things are required to perform magic, once you have a wand: the proper wand movement, the proper incantation, and the desire to make the spell happen. But what if this is all a lie? With practice, magic is possible without wand movements or incantations. The students are taught that wand movements and incantations are required (initially), but this is a placebo to make the students learn faster. They are taught what the spell will do before they use it, so that they know what to expect and what the spell should do when it is cast by them. Because of this, they believe that all magic is pre-defined spells. But that's nonsense that doesn't make any sense. The movements, the incantations, they are all tricks that allow witches and wizards to channel their magic into the desired effects. That means that magic isn't limited to pre-defined spells, that you can control magic in any way that you want, and that it is incredibly easy to make your own “spells”. There are no spells; there is only magic. CLARIFICATION: The placebo of magic is not taught intentionally; the teachers, and everyone else, believe in the same laws of magic as are taught.

Starts in first year, but can go on for as long as you like

From the very beginning, the “Golden Trio” is a quartet (4 members) Note: If you don't want to use the phrase “Golden Trio,” in the story, then don't. I won't miss it.

The new member is an OC

The OC cannot be a self-insert

The OC is the pairing for Hermione [Hermione/OC]

There is a fair bit of conflict between the OC and Harry/Ron, but they are still extremely good friends, to the point that the OC is part of the group

The conflict is mainly about Hermione

Somebody makes the realization about the true nature of magic (and once the realization is made, it should become a fairly major plot point, if not the main plot)

The person to make the discovery/realization cannot be Dumbledore or Voldemort

Draco and Snape are still shitstacks like they were in cannon

Snape, however, is still ultimately on the side of good, like in cannon

Harry/Voldemort plotline needs to deviate from cannon, and does not have to be the main plotline if so desired

No Super!Harry

No Weasley Bashing (feel free to make Ron a little more hotheaded, stubborn, whatever you want to call it)

No Dumbledore bashing, or Evil!Dumbledore


** I think the hard part about this would be writing a "Magic is Magic, not just spells" fic /without/ a Super!Harry. At least in the fics I've read, that type of realization is almost immediately followed by a Super!Harry.

*** That's because everyone thinks that once you get that down then the sky is the limit for what you can do. There are several limitations to why these shouldn't be super!Harry stories.

The first: the size/strength of your magical core. This has pretty much become head-canon for a lot of people. You can look at it in different ways. Some wizards/witches are obviously stronger than others, ergo their magical cores must be bigger/stronger. This can be accomplished in different ways, rituals, the practice of difficult magics, ect. Many like to akin it to a muscle, so that the only limit you have is how hard you try. Unfortunately they tend to make it EASY to practice a lot and get stronger. Anyone that does competitive sports knows that the stronger you become, the more ardous it is to get even a fraction stronger. That's why I think the very powerful in HP are much older than everyone else. Or you can just come at it that everyone has a set limit at birth to their core and there's no changing that (boring).

Another is that people assume minor changes in Harry's character would make him instantly OP. Like all wizards are lazy or never do research. If all it took was for Harry to be smarter than Hermione would ALWAYS be the most powerful. People tend to make minor character changes as allowances for huge boosts in power. That's just illogical.

** Okay. Fanfic tactics time.

As someone else mentioned, this escalates into SuperHarry /instantly/ without further limits. Especially if everything else is canon.

However, people hate magical cores, the mechanically easiest way to do this.

So I would use another limitation, one in line with the other requirements. A limitation to magic of physically-based will power. Basically, have all magical work limited by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion][ego depletion]]. You cast too much, you get sloppy and stop wanting to cast spells entirely. You'll even make excuses for why you don't want to use magic. It takes self-control and willpower to cast spells, and without that /limited/ resource, you simply can't do it.

This is a real world, physical, brain chemistry thing. Let me repeat: ego depletion actually exists in the real world, and results in a loss of emotional and mental self-control in human beings. Your will power drains away with every decision you make during the day, more with emotionally tough or complicated decisions. You'll be less able to resist that delicious cookie, and /even the resisting itself/ depletes your self-control in a physical way.

In the story, magical tools and training techniques would help mitigate this, but do not entirely remove it. When you try to cast a spell, you have to concentrate on making it work. The bigger the spell effect on the world, the more self-control and effort it takes to cast it. You have to decide very, very hard to cast any spell and this exhausts one mentally, faster if the spell is poorly known or the emotional state of the caster is unbalanced. This makes casual wandless, wordless casting much harder, because you'll be uncertain (at first) and the tools and tricks help mentally sustain your decision to cast.

It also means no SuperHarry just because he's learning this skill. It is never /easier/ than with tools, and is at least initially very mentally taxing and requires /more/ effort.

It could also be that [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue][decision fatigue]] sets in for many spell casters (as a /fansplanation/ of stupid canon spell use and tactics in combat). Wizards and witches literally start making worse decisions after being in magical combat for a while, which is how people like Bellatrix could be taken down after hours of combat by an unpracticed housewife fresh on the field and full of fury. Only one of them was still running on all cylinders magically, but it had nothing to do with some complicated magical core power and everything to do with being mentally tired and unfocused.

--------------

Still not sure how OC vs Harry/Ron works, conflict wise as related to this magical fanon. Harry being able to use magic after being disarmed works wonders-

*Nope, got it.*

The magnitude of effects someone could produce without a wand should be no greater than what they can produce with a wand. They're just more flexible as to what those effects are and harder to disarm. So it's not necessarily going to end up with SuperHarry.

Plus Harry isn't shown to be the best learner. Those somatic placebos might be pretty important to him, leaving him well behind in wandless magic and inclined to use the same effects constantly as if he were stuck to a limited set of spells.

**** I don't disagree with this entirely, but there are issues with unfettered "free" magic usage that aren't Harry casting overpowered instant kill spells on a room or creating his own Philosopher's Stone.

Hell, there are issues with canon magic use not being limited by itself. Casting simple spells repeatedly, like conjurations, or simply casting things like stunners without rest would break the world. Spraying down a room with spells just makes combat sense. If you filled a room with transfigurated tea cosies, it's hard to AK you. Why Death Eaters don't cast AKs constantly in combat doesn't make sense either. What's the point of a blockable bone breaking or nose rotting curse or whatever when you can instantly kill through any magical defense? Don't give me "they're crazy", as much of the time it isn't Bellatrix but just some mooks. Even the stretched out movie "gunfight" style doesn't make sense if you can just keep casting over and over again. Why carefully aim your shots when you can just spam? It isn't explained as a mechanical limitation, just a dramatic one.

Harry isn't exactly shown to be /bad/ at intuitive and original uses of magic, either. Not having to memorize spells only works to his strong suits. We see Harry in /canon/ use wandless and wordless magic, though not both at the same time, suggesting that he's actually quite naturally inclined to it (despite his troubles with Snape).

Once you add the ability to do arbitrary things with magic, and without a wand, things get...fuzzy. Since there is a spell to summon significant quantities of water (H2O), like to fill a glass or put out a small fire, why would summoning, say, explosive methane (CH4) be any harder? If you have a spell to light a fire, how about a free magic effect of simply snuffing out oxygen in an equivalent area as long as you hold it? Instead of teleporting yourself and everything you hold up to the weight of another adult human hundreds of miles (without great effort), how about teleporting just a vat full of acid weighing less than you do to that location (10 feet up in the air, without the bottom) and leaving yourself behind? How about just applying the equivalent energy to /creating and destroying matter/, just to a building (from far, far away). E=MC^{2} , witches.

Even if the magnitude of power displayed doesn't go up, the lack of functional limitation inherent in spells only doing certain things gets situations weird fast. /Especially/ if Harry can repeatedly cast these magical effects without tiring or limitation. Transfiguration alone would break the world. Why would you want to turn pincushions into hedgehogs at all, let alone repeatedly? But if you could use the same effort (none in canon, strictly speaking) to turn branches into spears, or rocks into swords, combat gets very interesting very fast.

In canon, magical effort is clearly limited by something. If magic, even non-permanent enchantments, are actually unlimited and free energy, the magical world would look a lot different. People would wander around with cheering charms and magically enchanted, waterproof clothes. Children would be followed around by dancing toys and adults by stone guardians in the form of fearsome beasts. Everyone constantly summoning things and everyone being surrounded by conjured and transfigured items would only be the start.

If you want to be logical about this challenge, either you have to assume Harry could do arbitrary things on the same level as existing spells, but for different effort (at least initially), or that Harry could do /anything/ as powerful as his /most powerful/ demonstrated spell in canon. And without further limit, he could do that all day. And canon has no built-in limitations.

I choose to add in a limitation to contain the madness, because it seems more in line with the canon world than the usual, poorly considered "magic is just, like, free man".

Much harder, at least in my headcanon. To cross-post myself from a different forum, Potterverse magic doesn't seem to me the sort that lets (general) you just input a chemical formula and have your wand produce the chemical in question. If nothing else, the whole thing is more Aristotelian than Newtonian, Einsteinian, or quantum. ("An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force? Preposterous! Only a handful of spells, like Gubraithian Fire, outlast their caster's will, and it takes a very powerful wizard to cast any of them!")

So, conjuring water or smoke? Sure. Those are real, tangible things. You have seen water, poured water, tasted water, washed yourself in it; you can distinguish it from oil or blood or sap or wine or other common liquids. When you cast /Aguamenti/, you know exactly what you are asking for in very concrete, rather than abstract sense. Similarly, you have seen smoke, know the smell of smoke, the feeling of breathing it or it getting in your eyes. You might even be able to distinguish different kinds of smoke.

A chair? You've sat in chairs of different kinds. Snakes? You've seen them, heard them, feared them, perhaps even touched them.

On, the other hand, methane? It's colourless, tasteless, and odourless, so, as far as magic is concerned, it might as well not exist. In fact, the smell you associate with methane isn't actually methane: it's usually a sulfur compound added to natural gas to help people sense gas leaks. How would magic even know which gas is it that you want? (You might have more luck with chlorine or mustard gas, but you might have to expose yourself to significant amounts of them first.)

*** This will be my [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758572/1/A-Snake-Before-the-Gathering-Storm][SlytherinHarry story]] main plot. I still have some work to do on Year One of my other [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][HP fanfic]], so this is back-burnered for now. Still, here are the details I just whipped up.

I'll do a four-way social slap fight in year two. Then they'll learn the wandless trick from Tom Riddle's diary. In year /four/, they'll find the chamber of secrets and even more about the true nature of magic, just in time to face a bloody tournament.

They'll initially all think the other people are the Heir (or at least a danger) and the Quad will be one of each House. Hermione (G), Harry (S), Luna (R), and the OC (H). Ron learning hard and novel magical skills is about the least realistic thing I can think of. I'd have to make him OOC to the point of another OC. So no Ron in the Quad, though he is still Hermione's (lazy) Gryffindor friend. If a DA forms, he'll likely still be a part of it, but he's not doing extra work for no reason. Just like in canon.

Each member of the future Quad will think one person from another House is the Heir, and for good reason.

- Hermione will think it's the OC because of a coincidence and a misunderstanding involving the second attack.

- Harry will think it's Hermione, because of the first year's events.

- Luna will think it's Ron, because like her father she's usually almost right, and that Hermione is his mind-controlled slave (because Luna).

- And the OC 'Puff (and Ron) will think it's Harry, because he's a creepy Snake. But Ron and OC don't get along. Lazy vs. hard working, loyal vs. practical, etc. Lots of flavor there, but no outright hate.

--------------

*Year one* is already written but does not /directly/ address this challenge. See that link to the SlytherinHarry story at the top for the first chapter.

--------------

*Year two* is just to introduce the characters and will be short, no more than a couple of 3k chapters.

Harry gets a hold of the diary when Ginny tries to ditch it, and then doesn't let it get stolen, because he's Slytherin. The Quad forms around figuring out the diary after Hermione ropes in the OC and they (plus Ron) confront Harry with an original polyjuice plot. Harry learns about wandless magic from Tom Riddle's own seductive hints and almost falls to the diary, but his head starts hurting whenever he writes in it, so he stops.

Hermione figures out Tom Riddle is likely one of the original Death Eaters because of the timing of Voldemort's rise to power. Luna concludes that Tom Riddle was secretly a Dark Lord, but died in a battle against Voldemort that left him trapped in the book (good try, Luna).

All this time, Ginny is secretly trying to get the diary back, hurting from the compulsions it placed on her and eager to avoid anyone finding out what she suspects she might have done. Pureblood OC (who knows not to trust things when you can't see where they keep their brain) finally decides to tell the 'Puff Head of House about the book, because fucking really? They're school children, not bumbling morons. OC isn't some abused orphan, shunned nerd, or lazy glory seeker, and chooses the correct way to deal with a magical threat. Ron and Harry aren't happy with that, for different reasons.

Harry's Head of House learns of this, recognizes the name, freaks, sets a trap for the original owner and catches Ginny. Snape dissects her brain (mentally speaking) and finds out about everything she knows (which isn't much). The diary is taken for study by Dumbledore.

After overhearing about the basilisk, the well-coiffed but cowardly DADA teacher runs for the hills (like in canon, different reason). The school is closed early for de-snaking and Ginny is sent off on vacation with her family (for the same reason).

Dumbledore is never sent away, Hagrid is never arrested, the Chamber is still never found, and Malfoy keeps his seat on the school board and his house elf.

That summer, everyone in the Quad is able to practice wandless and wordless magic away from school, so long as they don't use their wands and do it away from Muggles -- the two things the Underage Magic department and DMLE Statute Services diviners actually look out for. There are ongoing questions about the use of magic learned from someone who was obviously not a nice person.

Hermione disagrees with the 'Puff, who is practical and says they should learn everything they can about the new power. Being able to use magic over the summer wins everyone over eventually.

--------------

Then *year three* is also short, maybe three 3k chapters.

Sirius still escapes because things haven't changed that much, but the Quad is ready for him with their new understanding of the true form of magic. Ron has wandered off because Ron, and everyone else is dealing with working with people from different Houses. Hermione is focused like a laser on defense and combat magic, and doesn't even think to attempt taking an impossible and crippling class load.

When Sirius tries to break into Gryffindor, the public is confused. A more confident Hermione figures out the rat animagus thing fast after the sloppy "crime scene" set up leads to her setting a trap. But Scabbers gets away from the trap and runs (like in canon) but isn't found again, because he doesn't think the school is safe at all anymore. Hermione is scary that way.

Hermione's cat doesn't give Sirius the password and he never comes back. Hermione tells her suspicions to McGonagall (of course) and then Dumbledore tells Remus about a miscarriage of justice. Remus doesn't offer to teach Harry the Patronus (and SlytherinHarry doesn't ask). But Harry does work out that both his scar and his cloak have some...odd effects on Dementors.

A feud between Slytherins lead by Draco against Harry and Co results in an ill-conceived trap involving Dementors. The Quad (and Draco) only survive because of their new "freeform" magic. Remus saves them (like a teacher should), but angers Draco's father because of the huge embarrassment and political damage caused by the DMLE dragging his son in for what was clearly premeditated assault. Draco goes free immediately, of course.

Fudge is freaked out that Harry was almost killed by Dementors and removes them immediately. L. Malfoy gives the other school board members information gleaned from Snape to out Remus as a werewolf in revenge against the Headmaster. Remus is fired.

The Quad starts working on a wandless way of summoning a Patronus over the summer after their traumatic encounter and reading about its communication uses.

--------------

*Year four* is the big one. Call it 30k, at least ten chapters.

Babymort looks out on the world and is not pleased. His plan is to run a year long campaign of terror and destruction, using an agent in Hogwarts to sabotage the Triwizard Tournament. He can't be seen constantly talking to his agent, so Babymort plans to just gives him simple instructions: stay hidden, cause death and destruction at the Tournament, and get Harry to Voldemort on the day of the final task.

Unfortunately for Babymort, his first choice for this task is batshit crazy. Good thing he noticed that before sending him off on the task. When he started ranting about Harry Potter defiling the name of Slytherin House...yeah. Who knows what nonsense might have happened. The rat is useless for this, his cover probably blown by now given the new anti-animagus protections Dumbledore put up at Hogwarts. He calls on Barty Crouch Jr. to take a message to one of his Death Eaters: serve faithfully or watch his entire family die in front of him. Jr. kidnapps Mrs. Malfoy who Voldemort holds as insurance.

Instead of the recently missing Barty Crouch Sr., L. Malfoy takes a position on the judging board for the Triwizard, to work for his master on making the Tournament a complete disaster. When the true depths of the Ministry's bumbling are revealed as the last competitor dies, Harry Potter will disappear right out from under the Headmaster's nose.

L. Malfoy, being a pureblood bigot of the highest order, can't stand the attention one of the students involved in showing up his heir is getting. She topped her classes last year and still had time to make a pureblood look bad, and she's friends with that disgrace to Slytherin, Harry Potter. That's why Hermione Granger's name will come out of the Goblet, and why she'll be targeted as the first to die in what will be known as the deadliest Triwizard ever. If Voldemort has his way, every contest will be a bloodbath of champions and audience members alike. Dragons and a dive into a lake? Malfoly has /much/ better ideas.

Just before the Goblet drawing, Luna and Hermione find the chamber. Inside, they find Slytherin's secret offices and the true story of the most maligned of the four founders.

After Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet, her friends immediately rally around her.

- Harry thinks it is just her bigoted pureblood classmates trying to embarrass her.

- Hermione (who is more like the [real] Mad Eye than in canon) thinks it is agents of Voldemort.

- Luna thinks Hermione is running a secret fourth school, for whom she is the best candidate.

- /Lilias Broc/, fourth member of the Quad, is furious about Ron's (canon) reaction and is also mad that Harry isn't taking things more seriously. She's not letting her girlfriend die in some pointless contest, not after finally working up the courage to disregard her Pureblood background and come out of the closet to Hermione. If hard work and the judicious application of borderline dark magics to every lazy, obstinate Ministry official and horrible teasing classmate will protect Hermione Granger, then so be it. After all, who would expect the next budding Dark /Lady/ to be Harry Potter's (justifiably) angry lesbian friend from Hufflepuff?

Blood and death and Dark magic. Voldemort returns.

***** As I note at the bottom of that one-shot, it is a plot stub from a sort of self-challenge.

This here is part of my planning for a possible new long-form fanfic, of which that fic will be the first chapter.

I'm trying to show how you shouldn't spend the early, boring years in great detail when you want to do something exciting and new later. A mistake I've made to various degrees before myself.

The way I look at it, the challenge says start in year one, but that doesn't mean I need 50k words on it, like a lot of fic do to their detriment. With this plan, I'll be at about 50k words in (a little less than half way) by the time the really good AU plot stuff hits. Not optimal, but sometimes people want a familiar lead-in. I think it will still work if it moves along at a fast pace. And I write the entire story ahead of time and maintain a good update schedule.

Hell, I might just mash all my recent good ideas together. That means [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10784029/1/Two-Tales-The-Seventh-Son-and-The-Wolfmother][a slightly different Ginny and a very different Remus]]. That'll help introduce the first and second year. Leave the first year as a sort of extended prologue, just noting those changes, then start second year after x-mas when things really get crackin' with the diary. Hmm...I like it.

Sorry. Sort of wandered off topic there. In /direct/ answer to your question:

No.

Not yet. Just in my head, and here in brainstorming format.

**** I see some trouble with kids working out free-form magic all by themselves. They'll want to keep it a secret if, for no other reason, than it might mean they can't practice it over the summer. Also, it might mean losing their advantage over Voldemort and his minions. Likely, most adults simply can't be broken of the crutch of wands and words anyway.

Voldemort will know this, but is unwilling to share a power he thinks is his and his alone. He also hasn't delved as deeply into it, as he has a huge store of Dark spells to call upon. And also, Voldemort isn't very inventive, a key component to free-form magic. Tom Riddle (in the diary) made a critical mistake trying to tempt Harry this way, but he was young and foolish, and underestimated Harry and his friends. He'd just discovered the Chamber of Secrets when he made the diary, and didn't truly understand how far the wandless trick would go in the hands of much younger and much more pressured students.

Here is what I see them doing with free form magic:

- Harry's will be defensive and protective. I'll let his canon skill with the Patronus guide this. He'll work on providing other people with home defenses like Dumbledore did with Harry's mother's sacrifice (which will actually be explained). Love is his power Voldemort knows not, but not the way Dumbledore thinks. Occlumency won't come any easier to him, but he'll find himself able to read the emotions and motivations of others. Just like Voldemort is said to be able to.

- Luna's will be predictive and personal ritual in nature. Think druids but without the cultural baggage. It isn't clear if her claim is true that "sky clad" is required, though... Her magic will be wild and capricious. Chaos barely chained. Summoning strange creatures (at least where everyone can see them) will be her main "thing" in combat. Think Alice in Wonderland meets Labyrinth, as told by H. P. Lovecraft. There's something wrong with the girl. Or the world itself.

- Hermione's will be constructive and artifact-based. She'll figure out how to free-enchant, and will work on building useful items and integrating Muggle technology or effects. Once she gets cracking, she'll be surrounded by a swarm of floating guns controlled by murder thoughts. She's not a happy camper, and against Death Eaters will take the "no such thing as overkill, just open fire and time to reload" stance.

- Lilias (the OC) will be Dark. Just straight-up Dark. Not evil, per se, but unwilling to risk her friends with non-damaging spells when there is a clear and present danger. Binding people with magically enforced promises and crippling or killing those who threaten her and hers will be her MO. Her status as a (sane, well-socialized) pureblood will give her insights into magic that the others lack, though most now consider her a blood traitor.

** I don't mean to advertise but this is surprisingly similar to my story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9824728/1/Harry-Potter-Jedi][Harry Potter Jedi]], except the placebo effect is intentional and Harry is simply different rather than having an OC. I figure since teachers can learn to cast without a wand and are proficient in nonverbal magic, they would understand that it's simply easier to learn with incantations and wand movements.

The only problem with this is that in cannon Harry casts several spells in HBP without knowing what they do. So either there is some little magic with incantations or we have to ignore that part of the books.

**** I think so, though to me it seems like the most logical conclusion given the magic in the books.

Children can obviously produce wandless and nonverbal magic, although it's extremely hard to control unless you practice for a long time like Dumbledore or be gifted like Tom Riddle when he was young. Wands seem to allow finer control and more complicated spells, yet many times students create nonverbal or unintentional magic through them as all, such as Ron making it snow by accident. Most spells are based on imagination, feelings, and desires more than how the incantation is pronounced or a wand is waved. Which is demonstrated many times by Harry and others having difficulty or differences in casting spells even after training, such as a patronus, transfigurations, the cruciatus curse, and accio charm.

As mentioned before, the only significant example that this wasn't the case was Harry attacking Draco with an unknown spell, but that seemed more to do with a needed plot point rather than the usual use of magic. Though this could possibly be attributed to magic following natural or unconscious patterns with what incantations sound like or make you think of... but that's reaching for canon.

Sorry for rambling and taking so long to respond, it's just fun organizing my thoughts on the subject.

*** Thanks for reminding me about that - I put it on my reading list (open tab on my phone) and then promptly broke my phone and lost the reading list.

Yay, new story to read! :D

*** I commented on this a while back, but your story is quite good. I too recommend it for people looking for something at least a little more like this challenge than the usual straight canon retelling.

** This seems like a good basis for my very-much-only-an-idea of The Worst Witch/Harry Potter cross over that I've wanted to do for a while.

Apart from the OC bit. They would be Mildred Hubble.
