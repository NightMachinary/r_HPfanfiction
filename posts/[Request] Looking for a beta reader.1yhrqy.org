Hey guys, I know this is not the usual channel for such thing but I'm willing to try my luck. I have a story that I've been working on and writing for a while (none of which has been been put up anywhere). I previously found a beta reader after searching through the muck over at fanfiction.net. While she was a tremendous, she became too busy to help me out anymore. So right now I'm looking for someone to take her place. I need someone who is strong with sentence structure and proper grammar (my weakest areas) but who is also willing to let me bounce ideas for story progression off of them. The later of these two needs has been preventing me from continuing to write at the moment as I need someone to look at the logistics of the story with a critical eye. To me, there is no point writing a story if the plot is faulty.

As far as the premise goes, it is a based on the idea that Sirius does not manage to evade capture during his Hogwarts break-in and is sent back to Azkaban until being freed by Voldemort who tries to subjugate him to his will. It is not a dark!Sirius story and it also focuses on Harry's and Remus' lives as well.

Please let me know if you or anyone you know is remotely interested in trying to help me out.

*** Hey, TeenoAeron, I've been pretty slowed down with my writing and it really is kinda low on my list of priorities so I'm not worried about response time at all. In addition, I tend to spend a lot of time writing and revising each chapter as I am absolutely horrid, in my opinion, when it come to putting words on paper, I am forced to review it several times become sending it off to a beta. Though having said that, I tend to learn quick if you can't point out command errors that I make. In fact, this entire fan-fiction project is an attempt to improve my English skills which have been lacking throughout my life. I am completely able and will to work around your schedule as you are doing me a service. All I ask is that if you are unwilling to continue that you let me know.

I sent this to you earlier, I apologize for the double up, but paranoia got the better of me and I felt compelled to make sure you saw my reply. I hope to hear from you soon
