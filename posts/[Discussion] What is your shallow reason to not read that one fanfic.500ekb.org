*** What if it's used as a joke? Some clarification, I'm writing a fic, one that I won't link, and in it Harry makes fun of random things which are popular tropes. Mpreg, evil dumbledore, cores, etc. are all the things that my little Harry makes regular jabs at. In one scene, Harry sits in Dumbledore's office and jabs at the fact that the lemon drops are coated in Veritaserum and that all the Slytherins know that.

The only reason I'm asking is because my Harry called Granger 'Mione to annoy her, even more so after she just stated that she dislikes any shortening of her name. I know that a lot of people dislike this and I dunno whether I should make that clearer. It's not a crackfic, its just Harry being Harry and a little asshat.

And typos in the synopsis or chapter names (when not deliberate for the sake of making a pun) are enough for some people to stop reading as soon as they start, as spellchecking those few words isn't really hard if they'd entertained the thoughts of spellchecking that thing at all (and if they hadn't, well ...).

We do know some characters are taller (Bellatrix, twins, Ron, Draco), some have the same height (James) and some are shorter (Hermione, Mundungus) than Harry. Ultimately we do not know Harry's actual height, so slapping a number to Harry's height and calling it canon is wrong unless JKR stated the 6 feet figure.

As for athletic, our disagreement here might be caused by different interpretation, but to me when is someone described as athletic I imagine someone with a well developed muscular body and Harry doesn't have of that.

After having said all of that I have to correct my previous post a bit. I should have said "both of those are headcanon" rather than fanon, I don't think there is a fanon accepted height of Harry.

******* Well, the average height in the UK is 5'10 - So Harry would, /at the very least/ , have to be 5'11.

And Harry definitely is athletic, there is so much proof of this. But I don't mean to say that he is muscular and buff, rather I suspect he has a Soccer player's body.

It is canon that Harry is tall. And it is canon that he is an athletic freak.

**** I really enjoyed linkffn(The never-ending Road). It's a Snape rescues Harry (or in this case Harriet) from the Dursleys story. I never read fem!harry before and never thought I would like any fics like that but I thought this story provided a very interesting perspective if Harry was a girl. I really liked how the author portrayed the character, you can definitely still recognize Harry's personality and yet the character is changed in a realistic way to account for the fact that she is a girl.

*** I once read an (otherwise good) fic where the author stated it was based on the movies and therefore Harry had blue eyes. And not to comment telling her it was wrong.

I was compelled to download it and do a search-replace on blue/sapphire/cerulean/etc (though I think she stuck to simply blue), and put green. The read-through was much more enjoyable after that.

***** Completely agree, it's the most dissapointing thing about HP fanfic in my opinion. You have this great universe and setting that isn't so fleshed out with rules and history that it's stifling for any creativity, yet there's also enough interesting elements there that can be played with. Yet most stories boil down to the same elements.

I'm actually reading a Harry centric fic atm because it took an interesting concept for me "what if Harry knew about the Horcrux inside of him" and the author was doing well in giving some character development based on this that you wouldn't usually see in a fic. However then the usual tropes started creeping in, Harry learning more was handled well rather than just "I need to read and become powerful!", there was a smart reason for it. Then out of nowhere his eyesights fixed and he's promising Hermione he'd study more and learn an art or musical instrument and that's made me put the breaks on because it now sounds like it's heading down the path 80% of Harry fics usually go. It's so frustrating.

**** Hmm ... basically, omake are extras added so that the author would not have to keep to a rigid page count with every chapter regardless of how well it fits the story, as those Japanese comics that are not self-published are first released in newspaper-esque comic collections in which every author whose comic gets in has a number of pages given and not one page more or less than that.

That's why they are so ubiquitous in Japanese comics, in any case. And the word does mean “extra”. As they generally tend to take on the form of “outtakes”, some people do enjoy adding those even when it is not necessary and likewise some people do enjoy reading them.

But I hate self-insert Mary-Sue's that an author created solely to pair themselves with their favourite character like some strange diary entry.

Especially if they're wizards, especially if they're raised in the wizarding world.

Creative names add authenticity to the story and to the HP-verse. I get peeved when there's not a drop of creativity in names-creating in a story, which is something I try to get rid of, because I'm sure I've reject a great deal of good stories out of a bizarre pet peeve >-<
