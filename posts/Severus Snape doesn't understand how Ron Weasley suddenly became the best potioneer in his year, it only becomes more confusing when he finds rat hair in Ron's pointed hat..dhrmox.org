** Severus Snape suspected the boy of cheating. No, he /knew/ the dunderhead was cheating, he just didn't know how. It was the only explanation for this newest batch of Weasley vermin and his sudden skill at the practical art of brewing, but his (barely legible) essays were still dreadful, and he barely hid the fact that his potions knowledge bordered on non-existent, which should be evidence enough to the point. The redhead had gone from mucking up the Forgetfulness Potion at the beginning of the year to brewing a perfect Shrinking Solution in so many months. Whatever the boy's secret was, it did not seem to translate to the rest of his housemates.

"Potter!" The small boy yelped, nearly stabbing himself with the silver knife. "If I didn't know any better, I'd say you were /intentionally/ trying to befuddle the entire classroom with that drought. The sneezewort must be rendered inert before mixing, or else your concoction will endanger us all. Five points from Gryffindor for your recklessness!"

The instructions did not specifically say /how/ to render the sneezewort inert, but that much should have been obvious to anyone with a lick of sense. Severus made his rounds, inspecting the results.

"Granger, your potion did not steep long enough before you stirred: it should be thicker. I find it... Acceptable. Barely." The bushy-haired teen scowled at him. She had, of course, protested that the Confusing Concoction was far too advanced for the class, as Severus had committed to enforcing increasingly advanced brews in order to oust the cheating Gryffindor. His Slytherins had not done any better, but Severus would never publicly say so. Longbottom and Thomas' result might have called for a quarantine, if it weren't for the quick actions of Weasley to freeze the purple foam that had spewed from their cauldrons, earning them Trolls for scores, which brought him to Weasley.

Weasley. Severus shook his head. He'd been watching the boy carefully: after a bit of pause, the boy had perfectly muddled his lovage, adjusted the temperatures on his cauldron, filtered the sneezewort through the dissolved scurvy grass (after crushing the seeds with the flat of a silver blade so as to make the expanding properties inert under heat), and made carefully concise stirs at the correct times, even accounting for the lost seconds when he pulled a wand to freeze the erupting disaster behind him.

"Weasley. I cannot find a single fault in your brewing, though you failed to let your housemates learn from their mistakes... you earn an 'E'." Granger looked like she was about to protest, while the boy adopted a dopey grin of satisfaction on his face. A quick glare cowed the teen witch from making a scene.

Severus would get to the bottom of this, even if he had to use Legilimency on a student.

--------------

"A rat!" Severus declared, levitating the offending creature onto Dumbledore's desk. Albus, of course, did not look as putt-off as Severus felt, and was, as is typical of the headmaster, taking the situation far too lightly. "A student was cheating, Albus! Surely, that is grounds for expulsion."

Dumbledore frowned perceptively, but immediately returned to his grinning, 'wise mentor' facade, while inspecting the rat with his wand.

"How, pray tell, was the rat a source for mister Weasley's potion skills?"

"Hidden under his hat, and, apparently, controlling the boy's nervous system through his hair." The ancient wizard raised a questioning eyebrow. Severus sighed. Before Dumbledore could ask /how/ he had discovered this, Severus explained: "I suspected that the boy's odd insistence on wearing headgear was the source, and while I initially thought the hats charmed with wit-enhancing spells, I found only sticking charms present on the apparel." Dumbledore sat back, looking even more curious.

"A series of charms that complex would be akin to Ravenclaw's Lost Diadem."

"Of course, and would be impossible for a student to accomplish such an enchantment, even if the first year had help." Albus snorted, apparently disagreeing. Severus made a face.

"Apologies, Severus. Please continue."

"Anyway. It was obvious the boy did not want his hats removed by accident or errant summoning. I banned headgear from the potions lab as it posed a risk to safety. The boy continued to wear all sorts of ridiculous things, from opaque veils to wraps, citing religious reasons -- no doubt Granger's idea -- to, and I quote: 'I wouldn't want the birds to get distracted by my luscious locks, might be a safety issue, you know.'"

Dumbledore burst at that. "Oh, I'm sure his brothers had a say in that excuse." Severus leered. "So you dispelled the sticking charms and discovered the rat... pulling the boy's hair to control him?"

"Naturally." Dumbledore didn't press any further.

"Should we be so quick to punish that we fail to recognize an opportunity when it presents itself, Severus?" The head of Slytherin nearly choked in response.

"Explain." Severus was seething. Dumbledore's grin grew wider, no doubt at the opportunity for the old meddler to lecture him like one his dunderheaded students.

"You have here, by your own account, a skilled potioner. This potioner, however, lacks the proper body to exercise his ability, or even to communicate effectively, except via a single student. You have yourself complained, Severus, that you lack the necessary resources to fulfill your duties as professor, head of house, and your other... clandestine roles." Albus spread his open hands over the magical rat, as if presenting a gift. "Ronald has, in my humble opinion, given us a resource that we might use to alleviate your role here at Hogwarts, without endangering your other duties." Albus finished his argument with a trademark twinkle in his eyes. Severus could barely believe the man's chagrin.

"What are you proposing, that we hire the rat? /Reward/ Weasley for cheating? The board would never hear of it." The rodent had apparently recovered from his stunned state, tried to flee, but ran into an invisible barrier, no doubt erected at some point by Albus during his speech. The creature looked back and forth between Snape and Dumbledore, seemingly following the argument.

"Not insomuch, I think. Ronald Weasley deserves detention, at least. We can not condone cheating." /But we can't properly punish Potter's best friend/, Dumbledore didn't say. "However, many of the muggle-born students, and their parents, have noticed the lack of time Hogwarts professors have to fulfill their duties and have suggested using the more advanced students as teaching assistants, and I highly doubt mister Weasley would find serving hours in the potions lab, brewing examples for your students, as a 'reward,' as you put it." Albus returned his attention to the terrified rodent. "In such a case, there is no need to alert the board, you will not have to spend so much time preparing lessons, and Weasley will be sufficiently punished, if I do say so.

"Yes, I do believe we are looking at an /opportunity/ here, Severus."

The rat cowered in his invisible cage.

I might consider posting a series of semi-comical one shots about the misadventures of Peter Pettigrew. He never meant to become a Death Eater and his passions are cooking and potion brewing. He has subtly improved Mrs. Weasley's kitchen skills over the years and now helps Ron with his potions. Percy benefited, too, but not as directly.

**** Still, potions looks difficult and dangerous, besides, we're talking PETTIGREW here, yeah he does some difficult magic, but to quote Snape, “ There will be no silly wand-waving in this class” There is little to no magic in potions, most of the magic is contained in the ingredients.

Besides, does anyone believe that Pettigrew made it to the advanced class?

I mean fanfiction is fanfiction, anyone can do what they want, it just doesn't sound very consistent to me.
