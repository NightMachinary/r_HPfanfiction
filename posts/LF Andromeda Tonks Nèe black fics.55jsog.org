I've recently finished a story called "Saying Yes" linkffn(9336215) and I was hoping others could point me towards some good Andromeda fics!

Any kind is great, short, long, canon complaint or AU

Thanks!

  When everything comes to a head, sometimes it's hard to tell what's inconsequential. I haven't a single idea what this is, but I think it's kind of cool. Andromeda/Rodolphus, but probably not the way you think. Andromeda/Bellatrix if you really, really squint.

  Post-DH. The line between politics and family is razor-thin, especially when you're a daughter of the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black. Following the Battle of Hogwarts, Andromeda Tonks receives a condolence note from a surprising source.

  Ted Tonks has never been anything to Andromeda Black but a worthless Muggleborn; but a chance meeting and a certain cheerful persistence could change all that in just a year. Andromeda doesn't want a new friend; so why does she constantly find him on her mind, against her will? Why does she look for his smile for comfort when everything else in her world is dark?
