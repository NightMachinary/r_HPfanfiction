Any fics where Hagrid is like the magical version of Steve Irwin? or maybe he can actually communicate with animals. Like he can actually talk to a dragon and have it understand him, and him understand them. I think that would be awesome. Maybe some form of Beast Speak ive seen in some Fanfics.

** I feel like Newt Scamander is already kind of the magical Steve Irwin... mostly because he's written books instead of a show and they both have their own zoo, even though Newt's is in his suitcase. Also upon seeing creators that could kill them they would react the same: "he's beautiful and could kill me... I'm gonna go touch it".

***** I have to disagree, David Attenborough is someone who likes animals and is very knowledgeable about them but doesn't usually want to walk up to the most deadly animals and pick them up or handle them, Newt Scamander and Steve Irwin on the other hand do, they want to pick them up, take them home and raise them as their own.

Hagrid doesn't understand the danger in having these creachers around (he thought the acromantula was harmless and didn't think anything was wrong with having a dragon in his tiny wooden house) Newt Scamander and Steve Irwin understand the dangers of theses animals and they accept that they will get hurt and they still love them and treasure them and have dedicated their life to educating other people about them too.

  "Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's yet?" ...Snape kicks Harry out of 'Remedial Potions', but as we know from The Philosopher's Stone, there is another Occlumens in the school good enough to keep out the Dark Lord. Stupid oneshot.

*** Steve Irwin was an Australian conservationist, zoologist, and TV personality known as "The Crocodile Hunter." Despite the name, he didn't hunt crocodiles at all-- just filmed them, and many other animals on a long-running TV show (also called The Crocodile Hunter).

He unfortunately passed away a few years ago from a direct stingray hit to the heart, but he was known for being a generally lovely man who ADORED animals of all kinds. I'm on mobile so it's hard to do links, but if you look him up on YouTube I bet you will find all sorts of clips from his show that show him talking about and interacting with wild animals. There's a fairly recent video of his son appearing on The Jimmy Fallon Show as well. I mention it because it's one of my go-to videos for cheering myself up when I'm down.

Many people find Steve Irwin entertaining because he would talk about dangerous or poisonous animals with adjectives like "beautiful" or "gorgeous," totally ignoring the fact that said animals could kill you. So he is really a lot like Hagrid, in that sense.

** I can think of two fics that might fit what you are looking for.

Hagrid in Prince of the Dark Kingdom linkffn(Prince of the the Dark Kingdom) works in a magical research center/preserve studying creatures. He is sort of treated with disdain by the more "educated" researchers, but he is much better at working with animals than they are and understands them on a much more personal level. Additionally, there is a part where a dragon ends up being killed and Hagrid acts a lot like I remember Steve Irwin acting when poachers or the like killed an animal in the wild (I may be mixing things up Jeff Corwin though).

In Patron linkffn(Patron), there is an OC character named Jenny from Australia (like Irwin) who is something like a monster magizoologist. She goes looking for and studying dangerous creatures, and hangs out with Lockhart a fair bit (who is a little OOC himself but so is most of everybody in the fic), and for the last half of the story she hangs out with Hagrid figuring out how to use/breed magical creatures to use as weapons against the Death Eaters. At one point Hagrid is helping her to breed a crocodile crossed with a spitting King Cobra, I think.

Not exactly what you are looking for, but its somewhat hard to find anything closer than that.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** So taking this analogy to its logical conclusion, does Hagrid end up getting one-shotted by a runespoor or eaten by a lethifold?

If you don't get the joke, look up Steve Irwin.

Edit: In retrospect, I realize this was a lot meaner than I originally intended. Shouldn't have been writing instead of sleeping but that's no excuse. So I respectfully apologize to the people here and to those affected.
