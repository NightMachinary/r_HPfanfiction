** A question: does a video game of Japanese origins count as fulfilling the requirements of this request or is the requirement more about Japanese works in general?

I'm asking since I don't want to post something you'd rather not get.

*** The main reason why I asked for no anime is because I never got into it when I was younger and now have no clue about who is who in the shows.

As long as I can understand the fic without needing to play the game first I'd be OK with it.

**** Hmm ... I guess you should be fine then, considering that the plot of the game is fairly simplistic and even if you don't happen to know it it takes like 10 minutes to read a summary and be fine to go.

The story in question is “Something Wicked This Way Comes” (linkffn(5501817)), a crossover with Disgaea, though for most of the story it boils down to one character from the other series having been thrown into the Harry Potter universe; as the story (bar the epilogue) takes place before the game's plot actually does, it really shouldn't require more than the most rudimentary of knowledge about the series. In fact, if you want a quick summation of it without having to go off on your own to look on it you can just reply to this comment and I'll whip something up.

That said, since I do have a few other crossovers of this kind and I am finally posting whatever I have, I will leave the other ones too.

The first one is “A Study in Magic” (linkffn(6947125)), a crossover with Sherlock Holmes, though do note that there are two stories with the same name that are both such crossovers and this seems to be “the other one” (as in, whenever I see someone posting a link to a story with such a name, it's not this one).

Then there is “Browncoat, Green Eyes” (linkffn(2857962)), a fairly popular story of nonjon's so I wager a guess you likely know it already, but it is a crossover with Firefly. For bonus points, in case you haven't read it already, you really don't need to know the other series to understand what is going on and enjoy it; this story is what pulled me into actually watching it, which I think is proof enough of that.

** linkffn(1529689): The Family Name series has Artemis Fowl at Hogwarts in Slytherin house. The quality of writing is... okay. Doesn't involve too many elements from the AF series beside a retelling of the Arctic Incident. Has 5 completed books, but the sixth is incomplete.

linkffn(11255223): The Wizard of Harrenhal. Harry journeys to Westeros and tries to restore the magic in that world. Doesn't follow the events of ASoIaF canon.

linkffn(11027086): The Power He Knows Not is quite a good crossover with LotR. Steelbadger is one of the best writers of Tolkien lore and his next story, the Shadow of Angmar is very promising.

linkffn(9681294): Like a Phoenix is a Sherlock crossover. The author writes Sherlock's personality quite well but the deductions are lacklustre.

linkffn(5393773): Tales of a Wanderer is well written, but often feels like a scene-for-scene retelling of the LotR books with minimal changes.

It's a HP/Supernatural crossover. It's the first book in the series. And it has slash - Harry/Dean.

HP/Avengers crossover is rather popular too but none comes to mind right now.

*** I can't get into that one.

It's... so very bland. The author also can't write anything coherently, and seemingly needs to give summaries every few chapters just to reveal what was supposed to be happening.
