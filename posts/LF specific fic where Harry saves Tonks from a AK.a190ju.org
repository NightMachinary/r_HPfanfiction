I don't remember much except that the Order was going to raid a house and Harry was with them. A killing curse was shot and heading for Tonks (don't remember if stray curse or specifically for her) and Harry got in the way to save her. He obviously doesn't die or at least only temporarily.

I don't remember much else sorry.


** I believe this is from the first chapter of /Harry Potter and the Time of Change/ linkffn(7127460).

**** I honestly don't remember. I think it annoyed me after a handful of chapters and I didn't go back, but I can't recall what annoyed me. For all I know, I was just cranky that day and it's a perfectly good fic. Sorry I can't be more helpful.

**** It's decent. Probably one of the better honks fics, but it does come with it's fair share of tropes. Writing gets better as the story goes.
