I had asked about this; here: [[https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ak2vac/lf_people_see_how_unfair_snape_is_to_people_like/]]

And while there were some suggestions, not as many as I was hoping for, and not to the extent that I wanted.

If anyone is up for the task of writing said fic, let me know!

What I don't want:

No Weasley bashing.

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Harry is Lord/Heir to x amount of x amount of things here.

No Harem Harry.

I'd rather not have Dumbledore be dark; he's made many mistakes, but I don't think him as a bad guy, more as morally grey. And that's the way I'd prefer him to be written. Maybe McGonagall with more of a back bone, with her stopping Draco from bullying kids, her stopping her own Gryffindors from doing things, et cetra.

Either have Snape get redeemed and see that Harry isn't his father and Neville isn't helpless or stupid or get him fired, I don't care which. (Sending him to Azkaban is a bit extreme, and would rather not have that).
