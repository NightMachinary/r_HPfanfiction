I've seen plenty of Harry goes back in time to Marauder's Era/Voldemort's time or to the start of his schooling, but what I really want to see is a fic where Draco gets sent back into time.

I don't care about relationships, slash and femslash are fine and I would prefer no "Lord Potter" or bashing. I still wouldn't mind that type of story if it was well written.


** The 'Draco does it all again' series has Draco being sent back to before he starts Hogwarts.

  Draco gets sent back in time by the centaurs to before he started at Hogwarts to "fix everything". How he's going to achieve that, he's not sure. First step: befriend Potter.

  Draco's off back to Hogwarts for his second second year. Now he's secured Harry's friendship, he needs to keep it. Plus he needs to figure out, who actually is the Heir of Slytherin?

  This whole do-over seems to be going well. Draco's made friends with Harry, and this year should be chill right? (There shouldn't be an escaped prisoner causing trouble this time round, after all). Wrong.

  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor.  Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.

  Narcissa wakes with the certain feeling that something is terribly wrong. Draco is acting differently, Narcissa is worried, Lucius is confused, and a meeting inside Madam Malkin's goes very differently from the way it happened the first time around.

  There wasn't any sort of fanfare for Ron Weasley about to board the Hogwarts Express for the first time. Ron Weasley's family is acting weirdly, some very unexpected people are making friends with him, and altogether a ride on the Hogwarts Express goes very differently to the way it happened the first time around. A sequel/continuation that also works as a stand-alone fic.

  Draco Malfoy had been in Azkaban for almost six long and grueling years. After realizing that the food is laced with a potion that drains your magic, he stops eating and starts to build up his magic to cast a spell to get himself out. Finally, he was able to do it. After casting the spell, everything went black for Draco. Out of nowhere he wakes up back in his bed at the manor. He looks into a mirror, only to find out he's eleven again?!(Haha, first fanfic. Also summaries are not my forte)

  This is it. This is the end of it all.Draco Lucius Malfoy has survived the Second Wizarding War and has been miraculously kept from going to Azkaban. The Aurors have his wand while he's on parole, but at least he's a free man. Free to do whatever he wants, including go to Diagon Alley where people shun him at best and throw curses and slurs at worst.Draco made the wrong decisions. He doesn't belong in this world anymore, this world he helped to create. When he finds a way to go back to when it all began, he realizes this isn't the end.This is just the beginning.UPDATE : Vietnamese translation now available!! Thank you, ChunyuPink!!!
