What did y'all think of *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4798208][An Interview with Justin Finch-Fletchley]]*? Let me know in the comment section down below.

The next fic is *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5445767][Whatever Happened to Bromance?]]* by /vlad the inhaler/. It's a comedic, awkward smut fic, which emphasizes Harry as a teenager, which most fanfics don't. It's also quite short, so you'll see another thread shortly.

** I really liked the newblood moniker. It's my headcanon now for stories where the wizarding world actually did the work of improving itself. It's great how the author was able to find a term that not only goes syntactically with pure blood and half blood but also communicates the positive idea that muggleborns are new blood to freshen up the somewhat inbred wizarding lines of descent.

The 'cops see the world in three categories' digression wrt Harry I also thought was pretty insightful.

** I usually read fairly long fics, this was an excursion into a shorter read where you can take one good idea and just let it play. Well written, an interesting idea, I enjoyed the whole thing, dialogue, flashbacks and all.

** I'm going to reread it, but I just want to say that it was refreshing to see the perspective from a more "average" wizard citizen while inside a world building setting (radio show, Lee Jordan's future self, etc).

  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

** This fic was fine, I guess. Decent writing, believable dialogue.

I'm not really a fan of canon compliant stuff, and felt bored after the first chapter. I don't really get that 'what happens next?' page turner feel. I was not exactly expecting a wild ride, but I dropped it partway through chapter two. Their conversation didn't really hold my interest.

** There are two main things I disliked from the story. I disliked the way the format looked on FFN, which isn't really something that can be controlled. I also disliked the concept of Snape keeping a diary/journal. Snape was a master Occulemens who spied for both sides, at various times in his life. There is no way in hell a spy kept a book of everything he ever saw, especially since Voldemort breaking into his mind was a threat at any moment. I could see him putting the memories of his encounters into the Penensive within the Headmaster's office of Hogwarts while he was head for a year. That actually seems more probable than him writing it down. Voldemort seeing that can be brushed off as, "Master I wished to rewatch some of our exploits with the filth" and some other ego stroking garbage.

**** Read that. And I dont want to spend an hour reconfiguring a fic when the author should have done so themselves. As I said, it isn't a dealbreaker, nor is it a real issue. I got used to it by chapter 3, and it was fine. It was just a jarring thing that should be noted.

** I thought it was a really fun piece of writing with well done cannon-compliant world building, and just the right length to say what it has to say. I love the back and forth between Justin and Lee, and the whole 'Dean Thomas, Sex God' bit. The only quibble I have is with Snape's diary--it doesn't really seem believable to me that he would keep that sort of written record around.

** This is one I'd read a few years back. It's still decent writing, although I really dislike the format the second time around. Voices floating in the middle of nothing was a bit agonizing. Maybe a newspaper or magazine-style interview would've been a better choice since it could've allowed for some description.

The best part is that it involves characters that usually don't get a lot of spotlight time in fic.
