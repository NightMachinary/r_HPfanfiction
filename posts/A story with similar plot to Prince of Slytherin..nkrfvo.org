:END:
It was a wrong boy who lived story, which I saw once. Harry was thought to be below average. The story start with battle at ministry on fifth year. James, Lily and their second son was found to be not dead along with Neville's parents and brother. I don't remember much more.

The author was accused of using the plot from Prince of Slytherin.

Does anyone know the name of this story?


** This sounds like linkffn(Who Dares Wins). I haven't read it for a while though, so I might be remembering wrong.

*** I agree that the described story sounds like Who Dares Wins, but it's not at all like PoS.

One that is similar to PoS and I could see such claims being made(though I don't remember that) is linkffn(13507192)

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

**** PoS and WDW definitely don't share the same storyline, but maybe the claims of plagiarism come from the tense relationship between Harry and James while maintaining an ok relationship between Harry and his brother. There is definitely a lot of similarity between PoS James Potter and WDW James Potter in behavior; but it's what I expect of the WBWL trope at this point.

**** It was Who dares wins. I seems to remember a comment/review from\\
The sinister man about its ok to take inspiration from other fanfics (I think it was on this story, but not 100% sure). That's why I thought someone accused the author.

**** PoS has been in my reading list for ages and I still haven't even started, so I was going wholly of the description. Maybe it is the one you mentioned.

  A Harry Potter who grew up studying military tactics and strategy uses the attack on the Ministry as an opportunity to lay an ambush of his own - only to learn that his parents are still alive, as well as a twin brother whom Dumbledore calls the true boy-who-lived. And then, things get complicated. Military!Harry. A subversion of DZ2's Prodigal Son Challenge.

** If it's specifically claims of plagiarism from POS, then it's prolly Sarcasm and Slytherin.

Though that plot isn't what you just described. The part about Nevilles parents and brother is the unique point here. Usually in the â€˜Potters were alive all along' fics, it's just the Potters(and occasionallyDumbles If it's set after year 6).
