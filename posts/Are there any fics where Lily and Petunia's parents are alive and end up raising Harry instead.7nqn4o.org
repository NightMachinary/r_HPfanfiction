Basically as the title says. I don't think I've ever seen one like that.

***** Interesting, yes, but I'm not sure what impact it would have on the plot (unless you meant Harry being a Satanist, that could have a very large impact on the plot)

****** Assuming the Evans' were good people, I think Harry would come out significantly more well-adjusted, aware of who his parents were and be more trusting of adults. Those things could influence the plot quite a bit.

******* Well, book 1 Harry goes to Mcgonagall and she brushes him off, book 2 Harry goes to the world renowned Lockhart, and he's a fraud(Although they suspected him of being a fraud so that is kind of confusing why they would go to him lmao), book 3 tbh Ron was just kidnapped by a giant dog, whats he going to do, spend 10 minutes running to the castle while ron is presumably being killed by the dog? Book 4, he trusts Moody... Book 5 idk honestly. This is probably the biggest offender, as far as not talking to adults, but he /did/ tell snape about Sirius,and he didn't help, and he actually tried contacting Grimmauld Place, he just forgot about the mirror. Book 6 theres obviously Dumbledore, Book 7 there weren't really many adults to trust, lol. Seems like he tries to get adults to help plenty, its just that [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless][adults are useless.]]

As far as being better adjusted, the biggest change would probably be him not willing to sacrifice himself so much, which yeah could have a pretty big impact on the plot.

IDK what knowing about his parents would do though. I suppose he'd know Snape was his mother's friend... maybe he wouldn't be so tempted to look at Snape's Worst Memory? edit: actually unless knowing that Snape was his mother's friend made him not hate Snape as much he would probably still look at it lol. Although if it makes Snape hate Harry less he may teach Occlumency is some less brutal way...

******** Put it that way, I'd never considered how much Rowling used the "Adults are useless" trope, even the well-meaning ones like Lupin, McGonagall and Sirius. I will say that in Book 5, Snape did contact the Order immediately after Harry informed him, but he obviously wasn't able to say it in front of Umbridge. Though that whole situation could have been avoided if Snape had just taught Harry Occlumency properly.

Also, the reason why Harry loves Hogwarts so much is because he considers it is his first real home. He never had one with the Dursleys, but if he already had a home with his mother's family, I wonder if he would be as attached to Hogwarts and the magical world. As you say, a well-adjusted Harry would value himself more so would he even be interested in finding out what the Philosopher's stone is and thwarting Quirrell? Or would be just think it's not his problem and focus on school and friends, because that's how most children would look at it.

The Evans telling him about Snape would be interesting. Maybe Dudley would also grow up differently with his grandparents in the picture.

********* To be fair the plot (As far as resurrecting Voldemort. The plot of the theoretical story would obviously be something else for year 1) wouldn't really change if he doesn't go after Quirrel because he wouldn't be able to get the stone out of the mirror. Albus would just show up and beat Quirrel. Although he might not die, so Quirrel may be able to stay as a teacher, thus removing Lockhart... Hmm. More likely he just retires tbh

******* Fics like those exists in "James and Lily are alive and raises Harry" fics. Also some with WBWL, though in those for some reason it's alot more common that James and Lily are abusive/neglectful parents, which I don't like.

There's also Accidental Animagus wherein Harry was raised by the Grangers as Hermione's brother.

  Even if Lily's parents had survived the war, Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to them for the very same reason that the Evanses had been proud to have a witch in the family.
