The idea for this prompt is that the information "Person X exists" is a valid fidelius secret. It can be used to hide one's very life. It can either be used to make the wizarding world bigger and better protected or as a bit of horror as it may be used by kidnappers.


** Honestly, Harry! linkffn(9901496)

Harry and Hermione use and abuse the fidelius charm. Like, using it to hide the incantation for the killing curse. Chapter 2 is Fun with Portkeys.

I've also seen a Stargate crossover where Harry uses the fidelius on a stolen Al'kesh as a cloaking shield.

** Premise: The Fidelius Charm can conceal a secret inside the soul of a living person, preventing anyone else from being able to learn or utilize the information unless it is shared by the Secret Keeper. Whilst the Fidelius functions, the secret cannot be discovered via independent investigation; any physical evidence of the secret becomes impossible to observe.\\
 \\
Derivative: Via magic, ideas and concepts can be corporealised, converting them from intangible, infinitely-replicable information to (at minimum) a discrete intangible/spiritual object located in a measurable point in space.\\
Proposition: 'Replicating' a concept, allowing it to exist simultaneously in both a discrete and an information form, is potentially possible.\\
Premise: Ghosts, poltergeists, dementors, and the like, are all manifested spiritual creatures; though intangible, they can nevertheless manipulate the world in various ways, via ectoplasm, telekinesis, memory-snatching, etc.\\
 \\
Premise: Numerous mythologies all around the world feature anthropomorphic personifications, representing various concepts and natural occurrences.\\
 \\
Proposition: It's not so far-fetched for the three Peverell brothers to have encountered Death.

** I've seen a couple where Harry uses it on himself to hide or escape his fate but I don't think I've seen a fic where the fidelius is used to better the wizarding world. Interesting idea.

** This is how the fidelius can be abused:

Step 1: Make a small house

Step 2: Put someone inside it, take his/her wand

Step 3: Make that person (or yourself) the secret keeper

Step 4: Close the door (and all possible entrances) with a permanent sticking charm, put anti-apparition jinxes, etc

Step 5: ???

Step 6: Torture

  What could've happened if the Dursleys avoided one traffic light, and Harry arrived at Kings Cross Station just a few minutes early? A chance for Ginny to do something she'd wanted to do all her life.
