If you were to re imagine the housing system for Hogwarts what would you change? Specifically as far as how they are defined and how kids are sorted. Not like how the culture of the houses or anything like that. Not that you can't talk about that too. I mean feel free too. But I mean how very specifically you would change the house and sorting system for the question.

You do still need house system but the houses don't have to be Griffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

There doesn't need to 4 houses there can be more or less ( but least 2)

It doesn't have to divided by the same personality traits as in canon. It doesn't have to be based on personality at all.

The sorting doesn't have to be first year it doesn't have to be only once and it doesn't necessarily have to be with a hat. The sorting can be anything you like.

The changes you make don't necessarily have to be an improvement to the old house system. It could just be a fun deviation.

So what would you make the new house system?


** I don't think I would change much. I would try and make the house is your family a bit more real. JKR's early books were sleek and slim, it wasn't until GoF they started to bloat, one of things that I feel got cut was the downtime with your house. McGonagall's role as head of the house, what it meant to be a wizard at Hogwarts. It worked for the books as it both kept the books on track and allowed more ignorance which facilitated later plots.

I am shocked for example there isn't a huge list of past Gryffindors and their accomplishments on display somewhere. Harry could have looked up his parents, he could have looked up Dumbledore, McGonagall and dozens of others. I've visited Millfield, an expensive boarding school famous for its athletes, Lando Norris went there, and so did dozens of Olympic athletes. As you sit down to eat you're surrounded by lists of former students sporting honours. I know Hermione found James Potter on the Quidditch trophy but that's just a tiny fraction.

I can't help but think that Sprout would spend a lot more time with her Hufflepuffs, making sure they're settling in well, not too homesick, that they're doing alright in classes etc. Perhaps Gryffindor has a sink or swim culture but I do feel the role of the houses on your school life was underplayed. We never really get the feeling Harry knows anyone despite living with them.

**** Houses /are/ effectively your family, even in canon. The problem is that Harry has massive trust and abandonment issues thanks to a decade of Dursley abuse and how staff plus people of all houses, including sometimes even someone as close as Ron Weasley, treated him the whole time he is at Hogwarts - beginning with the entire "Boy-who-lived" fame crowd (sorry Ginny) and at the latest when the trio lost 150 points after Malfoy ratted them out at Hagrid's, continuing with the whole Parselmouth fiasco in CoS, the "Potter stinks" campaign in GoF, and ending with "you must not tell lies" in OotP.

The only persons who never abandoned or mistreated Harry are Hermione and Luna - not even Neville.

**** I really don't think it's anyone problem but Harry. I mean we see in all the books and movies that he never really takes the effort to interact with a lot of people which I feel like is at least a part of the reason people didn't believe him in OotP people didn't know him enough to recognize what his true personality. They just saw the famous orphan Gryff who got in trouble all the time and never really bothered to talk to other people. Not saying that's his fault obviously ya lot of it come from trust issues that stemmed from living with the Dursleys.

** In the real world, when schools even have houses (many don't; not even all boarding schools do) students are generally assigned either to the house a parent was in or at random. And houses are often named after their first housemaster, benefactors of the school, or especially noteworthy former pupils.

** This is an idea for my planned AU fic. I'm still working on it, but here's what I came up with:

- Students are not Sorted immediately after starting Hogwarts. Instead, for the first two years of study they are considered to be the students of Hogwarts as a whole, as opposed to belonging to any particular House.
- The first- and second-year students are assigned dorms randomly; furthermore, the dorms are reshuffled each semester. Any points the students earn are awarded to them personally, not to a House.
- The Sorting itself takes place between the Second and the Third years. It isn't as simple as putting the Sorting Hat on one's head - think more chuunin exams (except with no bloodshed - in theory, that is).
- The decision to allow a student to join a particular House rests solely with that House's Head. The House Heads also decide on the requirements of joining their respective Houses, as well as whether to disclose the requirements to the students.
- The above means that there is a variety of criteria that may be considered for admission - not only a student's performance during the Sorting itself, but also his or her prior performance, points earned, conduct, etc.
- That said, the Headmaster and the Board of Governors can veto certain requirements - e.g. the Head of Slytherin can't just refuse to take in anyone who isn't a Pureblood.
- As for the Sorting Hat, I'm still undecided. The original idea was "how would Hogwarts Sort students if the Hat wasn't there?" However, it's possible that the Hat may serve as the final challenge, or the final arbiter of sorts (provided the student agrees to the mental intrusion).
- Naturally, a student can get more than one offer to join a House - in that case, the final decision is the student's. Conversely, it's possible to fail to be admitted to any House. In my AU, that means expulsion (since Hogwarts isn't the only magical school in Britain, merely the oldest, most prestigious and selective); alternatively, the student might have to spend another semester in the common dorms before being allowed another go.

Of course, the system makes more sense in the AU, where even young wizards are supposed to be stronger and more mature due to the state of the world they live in, but I still think it's not that bad. At least, it helps to avoid sorting children too early, makes them meet people who would later end up in every House (as opposed to being mostly limited to one's own House), and just gives them some time to understand who they are, instead of forcing them to make a life-changing decision at their first day at Hogwarts.

**** Oh, I see. Thanks for the correction.

What I had in mind was reshuffling the dorms at the beginning of the school year in September, and then after Christmas holidays. But each trimester could work too, I suppose.

Btw, any other thoughts or suggestions would be welcome as well - it's all still very much a work in progress.

***** Another thing: the points. In canon, the points(theoretically) apply some social pressure to earn points, since they are earning and losing as a collective. If points, even if only for two years, became individual, a lot more apathy towards the point system would occur. People wouldn't care for points, and those that do are the minority.

My suggestion: have a student's total points be added or subtracted from a House's total, but keep the points private, no one(but the student) knows any student's point count until it's time to add it all up. Maybe add some fancy magic to prevent them from spilling their point count.

****** Your suggestion is interesting, but it would introduce a certain dynamic in admissions that I'm not sure should be there. I mean, if each student's admission meant adding two years' worth of points to his/her House's score, House Heads would be incentivized to admit the best-scoring students and turn down those with low to negative scores. And yes, no one is supposed to know the exact point counts, but between e.g. Hermione and Goyle it would be pretty easy to tell which one would bring more points.

My idea is that a personal score is just one of many criteria, and whether it is important or not would depend on the House a student is trying to get into. It certainly helps to be a good student, but that's not the be-all and end-all.

Besides, I was actually thinking about going in the opposite direction, and scrapping the idea of House points altogether (or at least, having them be a sum of the students' individual scores). Maybe they could be replaced with rankings - I remember reading a fic that had something like that, but I can't recall which one it was at the moment.

******* Maybe the individual points could be used to buy/opt out of some of the exams. Most kids would rather /not/ take a test if given the choice, so it would incentivize every kid equally (except maybe for weirdos like Hermione) to earn points, and even the more academically minded could have subject weaknesses they'd want to skip. Or hell, if some of the exams were non-academic in nature like a test/demonstration of athletic prowess, maybe even someone like Hermione would be looking to buy their way out of that one.

They could be completely separate from the house points system, too. Once you're sorted, any left over individual points you had are gone as they're no longer relevant.

** I quite like the sorting in the books. The only thing I think I would change is the age when the sorting happens. I think the third year would be better, which means that the first and second years would be housed together, and before the third year, there would be a sorting ceremony.

Maybe the sorting should be private? Like, McGonagall calls the student to the room next to the Great Hall, and the Hat would sort without the audience to eliminate a chance of someone asking for the house based on their friends sorting.

Like I've said, I quite like the sorting as it happens in the books. I think Hogwarts as a school overall needs more changes :D

** I think sorting should be at the beginning of 3rd year. It would give 1st and 2nd year students a chance to figure themselves out a little bit before being forced into a stereotyped group (and a chance for muggleborns to get acclimated to the wizarding world). Over time this would hypothetically lessen friction between houses because students would get to know each other before being branded as a snake, lion, etc. Being sorted in 3rd year would also align with the beginning of elective classes where there is a greater cross-section of houses represented in the electives.

1st and 2nd years could also live in the same section of the castle together, essentially functioning as a distinct house. The 2nd years could mentor the 1st years.

There was another school, in the same “personal setting,” with Families instead of Houses, and you were literally adopted by your Head of House-equivalent.

** For starters, I wouldn't sort students in their first year. I would do it in their second year.

There would be a table that would run along the front of the great hall, across all the tables for the first years. They would get points like a regular house and they would not wear any house colors. Each week, they would get 2 prefects from rotating houses to teach them about the school, its values, and the values of each house. The prefects would tutor all the first years and help them acclimate to the school.

They would have the whole summer after their first year and when they come back for their second year, that is when they will get sorted into a house.

______

Next, I would have an orientation week, one week starting each year for all the students to adjust to the boarding school environment. This time would also be used for Quidditch tryouts and organization of clubs. Instead of being thrust back into the competitive environment of the school, they would have more interaction between students first.

______

I also would add one more house. In my headcanon, I've been calling it The Monkey House.

I'm not sure where in the school it would be, however, the entrance and common room would be without a password, it would have some test of physical strength to enter. That test would be different depending on the age of the person trying to enter. It would also scale up throughout the year.

The entrance to the common room would be open to all, even those of other houses, however, they would also be subject to the rules of the house, including being challenged to duels.

The dorms would be restricted to house members only.

The common room would be somewhere that had access to the outdoors, even if it was high up in the castle. Dorms would have hammocks, climbing areas, areas for spell and potion experimentation, and different types of dueling areas, both for wizard and muggle duels.

Intra-house conflicts would be settled through duels, whether they were physical or otherwise. Students caught settling a conflict through other means would be heavily punished or sanctioned.

Every student would need to start the year without any frills in their dorm room, nor would they be allowed to bring extra items in. They would receive a hammock or cot based on their preference as well as a dresser, wardrobe, bedside tables, and other minor essentials. Through the year, they would need to use magic and craftsmanship to make their personal area their own. They would be allowed to keep various things they created year to year, but for the most part, start over completely at the beginning of each year.

*Their leading value would be:*

- Fun-loving people

*Sub-virtues would be:*

- Fast learners
- Curious
- Creative, imaginative
- Loyal
- Value strong leaders both magically and physically
- In touch with nature
- Generous and compassionate

*Negative-virtues might be:*

- Apprehensive to try new things

** - the biggest change would be, not sorting them at all. first and second years would be hufflepuffs, third and fourth gryffindor, fifth and sixth ravenclaw and seventh would be slytherin. this would be optimal while doing timetables and including not mandatory subjects and all that. Hermione needed a time turner to go to all the classes, and that was only five instead of three voluntary subjects that Harry had. they would still be in two groups if the class is too big. but tbh, in canon there were like ten people in classroom.

- hufflepuff's animal would be a bumblebee. that way, animal types would vary for all. so a snake, a bird, a mammal, and an insect. I would also make the slytherin snake some specific snake instead of all species, that is just dumb. (badgers are lame, I know JK wanted to use a bear instead, that would be also awesome)

- a different approach would be sorting after the first year. so first years won't have a house, and each house specifies (has more classes) in different subject. so a student that shows talents in charms would be under Flitwick and so on. a student could be also resorted later if they show a talent in a different one. there could be a fifth house that would specify in DADA, but tbh, with the position cursed, who would be the head of that one.
