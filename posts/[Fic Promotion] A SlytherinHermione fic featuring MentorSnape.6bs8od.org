** I probably could phrase this nicer, but let's not beat around the bush - this fic is awful.

Going into this I expected poor man's Applied Cultural Anthropology, but what I got was completely different and not really describable as "a Slytherin!Hermione fic featuring Mentor!Snape". Because it's not really Hermione fic, she is mostly a plot device, it's the story of Snape (who doesn't really do much mentoring).

Now, Snape is a very interesting character, but this actually isn't Snape. His characterisation fails from the start, with him thinking like a hormonal teenager in love when he notices slightest similarities between Hermione and himself. And it continues from there. Snape is nice, caring, and at the mental level of fourteen years old. Also, he did nothing wrong during his school years, it was all those Marauders fault.

It's not like he got a taste of his medicine when being embarrassed by his own spell - Levicorpus. It's not like he ran around throwing insults at muggleborns, and doing nothing when his terrorist-sympathising friends bullied them. It's not like he became terrorist himself and only felt regret when it turned out that family he sentenced to death included his unrequited, obsessive love. Oh, poor, poor Snape.

You actually can make Snape nice and good guy, but for this, you need to establish an AU with big enough divergences like Wit of the Raven did. Here there is nothing for us to treat it differently than complete OOC-ness, and even if it was this rendition doesn't make for interesting character due to his complete one dimensionalness. Also, he lost his competence, as shown by his method of dealing with the troll. Really, levitation?

But you know who is bad and evil and all that? Dumbledore. He is also stupid, incompetent and cares only for the Greater Good. Yes, it's the classic Dumbledore bashing galore. Which is even more annoying when it comes a chapter after recommending Prince of the Slytherin, which aside from the unfortunate prologue has decently written Dumbledore.

This OOC-ness and general lack of any depth to characterisation is a continuing trend. Harry is meek, Draco is nice, etc.

That brings us back to the Hermione. She also is barely Hermione at all, with her family situation being transformed to Harry's one, but with biological parents. Boring and unoriginal? Boring and unoriginal.

As you could guess from what I mentioned, the story is full of angst, and basically, lacks anything else in term of content. Angst is hard to write well and require a certain level of skill in handling characters' emotions. Skill that Flye clearly lacks.

It's driven home by the very badly written inner thoughts (well, the dialogue too). Initially, I wanted to recommend her The Changeling and On the Way to Greatness, but then I noticed that she already has the first one in favourites. Which means that I should recommend reread (just after rereading of books). Reread and thinking about "what makes this fic good?", "what makes those characters interesting?", "what makes those thoughts not annoying to read?". Because this:

#+begin_quote
  Thank goodness I asked Professor Snape about Houses - Hogwarts, A History had been terribly biased against Slytherin. Imagine if I'd gone in thinking all Slytherins were dark evil bastards in the making - that would have been quite embarrassing.
#+end_quote

This is embarrassing to read.

At least I can appreciate an attempt on the "stream of consciousness" mode that Hermione goes in when she breaks. But it fails too, something like that, when used in pure text, needs a certain cadence to not be just a collection of randomly thrown together sentences.

Despite there barely being a plot, and the short length of the fic, there are two obvious plotholes. The first is Dumbledore hiding the troll's existence from Aurors. It's a school where almost all magical kids from Britain learn, of course, it would leak. The second is the Snape's shock on Moody discovering that Hermione is muggleborn, despite Snape himself telling him her blood status.

Lastly is something that I usually start my rants with - magic system. But considering the small role magic played here I left it for the end. Consistently with the rest of fic, it's bad. It's all about wand movements and incantations. Surely, that's why there are many books about spells as required lectures and why both Charms and Transfiguration last seven years. And why there are so big differences between different power levels of magical practitioners. Why the Protego with super-simple downward slash wand-movement and easy incantation took Harry so long to learn. Yeah.

There are good stories about bullying, but this isn't one of them. 2/10, go read Onani Master Kurosawa if you didn't do this yet and want something on the topic.

*** While I certainly appreciate the time you spend to type out all of this vitriol, I would like to note something I said at the top of my post. I am looking for /constructive criticism/ , not a general tear-down of my fic. For example, look at dehue's comment where they explain what they didn't like, why they didn't like it, but in a respectful manner. Furthermore, they do explain that while they aren't in favor of my characterization of Snape, they do think my writing is mechanically sound.

You do have a fair point with the second plot-hole - I will concede that to you. However, many of your points, especially regarding the competence of Snape, seem ill-thought through. Firstly, about levitation - does it matter how you incapacitate something as long as it's permanently out of commission? No, it doesn't, and, as a matter of fact, when faced with a high stress situation, we humans tend to resort to reflexive skills -- hence the levitation charm. Secondly, in response to some of your other points -- you forget that Snape is an inherently biased narrator. He (obviously) is going to think that the Marauders were terrible evil gits and that Dumbledore is an awful person caring only for non-Slytherins. Some of your other "points" raise other questions in my mind...have you ever spoken to an eleven-year-old?

I'm not going to continue this tirade any further, and I do respect your opinion, but I (as well as the many people who have followed/favorited my fic) strongly disagree with you.

#+end_quote

The definition of constructive criticism is pretty fuzzy, but I consider the key element is showing specific issues, and explain where the problem lies. Which I've done. Not exactly in the nice way, but I didn't aim at being nice.

#+begin_quote
  they do think my writing is mechanically sound.
#+end_quote

Which only shows that they have even lower standards than I in this field. That doesn't make their criticism more valid, to the contrary, they are ignoring the biggest problem with the fic.

#+begin_quote
  Firstly, about levitation - does it matter how you incapacitate something as long as it's permanently out of commission?

Because hitting something in the head isn't surefire method?

#+begin_quote
  No, it doesn't, and, as a matter of fact, when faced with a high stress situation, we humans tend to resort to reflexive skills -- hence the levitation charm.
#+end_quote

This is ex-terrorist, double spy and one of the most skilled characters in the series in terms of combat.

#+begin_quote
  Secondly, in response to some of your other points -- you forget that Snape is an inherently biased narrator. He (obviously) is going to think that the Marauders were terrible evil gits and that Dumbledore is an awful person caring only for non-Slytherins.
#+end_quote

That explanation doesn't work when we see Dumbledore's words and actions. He himself goes "For the Greater Good!", he notes similarities between situations of Hermione and Snape, he barely punishes students who attacked their schoolmate and left her locked without the way out and way to contact anyone to help get her out. Unless everything will end with this being Snape's delusion or lie, it can't be explained by his unreliability.

#+begin_quote
  Some of your other "points" raise other questions in my mind...have you ever spoken to an eleven-year-old?
#+end_quote

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts to not speak to anyone below 15 years old, it sometimes still happens. Your point here?

***** Look, I'm not trying to start an internet feud with you. My main issues with your response to my post are: a) politeness

#+begin_quote
  I probably could phrase this nicer
#+end_quote

Not the best lead in to a critique -- while I appreciated your directness, your (at least how I read it - might not be what you intended) rude tone was really off-putting and honestly quite upsetting.

#+begin_quote
  As you could guess from what I mentioned, the story is full of angst, and basically, lacks anything else in term of content. Angst is hard to write well and require a certain level of skill in handling characters' emotions. Skill that Flye clearly lacks.It's driven home by the very badly written inner thoughts (well, the dialogue too).
#+end_quote

Yet, you don't specifically say what can be improved here -- you bash the writing yet offer no examples on how to fix it or state what's specifically wrong. I truly want to improve your writing, and this gives me nothing to work with. It's easy to point a proverbial finger at a fic and say "bad!" but I would really appreciate if you would tell me /what/ is wrong with the dialogue. Is it unnecessary? Have poor flow? Seem unnatural? etc. This is the first fan fic I've written, so I'm looking for ways to make my writing in the future. Part of what was hurtful about your post was you went one after another of the things you believed I did wrong, yet you didn't offer any positives or any solutions. I'm not trying to be rude to you here -- just trying to communicate that when you make a post like this, it's hurtful to others and it's something of which you should be aware.

b) not actually presenting constructive criticism

#+begin_quote
  Constructive criticism: "A recommended set of instructions that aims to collaboratively improve the overall quality of a product or service. Often containing helpful and specific suggestions for positive change, constructive criticism is highly focused on a particular issue or set of issues, as opposed to providing general feedback on the item or organization as a whole."
#+end_quote

While I don't deny that you presented a very through /critique/ of my fic, and a scathing one at that, I do not believe you presented constructive criticism. Now, if you had said something along the lines of: "Your writing and descriptions are good; however, you need to improve on your characterization. In my opinion, this is where you went wrong, and here is one way I would recommend fixing it." That kind of goes back to my first point about being polite. We're on the internet. I don't know who you are, and you don't know who I am. Regardless, it's nice to show at least a bit of kindness and encouragement to others.

****** Okay then.

Let's try nicer.

Your description is misleading. It's not Hermione's story, she is more of a plot device here. We see most of the events from Snape's perspective. Additionally, Snape is not a mentor here, or rather he is only for a brief moment, later plot progress quickly lead to lack of concrete contact between him and Hermione.

Your characterisation, in general, is off. I recommend rereading books.

Let's take Snape here. In canon, he is an asshole with a superiority complex. Which is partially warranted by his skill. He is not in the league of Dumbledore, Voldemort, and Grindelwald, but he still is one of the most powerful wizards we see in the series. It's very visible in his fight with McGonagall. Your fic fails by making him nice, barely having him showing his superiority to others and by diminishing his skill. Also his role as a double spy with a terrorist organization makes him unlikely to quickly involve himself emotionally.

Another good example is Draco. He specifically mentions in PS that he dislikes muggleborns because they are outsiders, not raised in their culture. He wouldn't take to "maybe half-blood" Hermione.

Also, characters lack depth, they are very one dimensional, with their personality existing only in to a degree that story requires to progress. Surprisingly, Ron comes here the best. He is almost two dimensional, with his actual interests shown as separate factors for his actions.

The other problem is the plot. It centers about Snape quickly taking interest in Hermione because she reminds him of himself. But at the beginning, there is not enough information for him to reach that impression. Yet he acts like a teenager in love almost immediately upon seeing her. It's badly established and rushed and it doesn't work with Snape.

Hermione's home situation is too similar to Harry's to be engaging. Blah, blah you should be thankful that we are raising you, blah, blah. Also cupboard.

The story relies heavily on Dumbledore being a complete idiot. Of course, characters acting like idiots for a sake of the plot was also a problem in canon, but this isn't the part you are supposed to copy.

In the end, the story isn't engaging because it relies heavily on characters which are very weak, and writing which also is weak upon which I will touch in a moment.

Magic in HP fics is something I care greatly about, and here is a combination of usual bad magic tropes. With mana spending and spellcasting success being based solely upon incantation pronunciation and wand movements. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo/edit][Just read that for now]].

Well, I think it's time to come back to writing. I'm not a good writer, so I can't help much there. But, there is way too much of repetitive and uninteresting inner thoughts. We don't need to read Snape going hundred times "Our situations are so similar, oh" or "Dumbledore is a dick".

The stream of consciousness moments lacks anything that would connect them, there is no cadence so they are a mess. That may reflect Hermione's state of mind well but doesn't look good in text.

There is a clear lack of descriptions, both of the characters and the places. For example, we are never told where the hell are professors betting and how they look. Secondhand bookstore, a new location is never described etc.

Characters should be given certain personal flair to dialogue. As it stands, there is no real consistency to how one character speaks, and at the same time, various characters speak in the same way.

You might've noticed that I referred a lot to canon. Of course, fanfiction can, and often should change things from canon. But the result of those changes should be more complex and more interesting than canon is. They also need to be followed to their logical conclusion. Changes have consequences and those should be observed. Here we lack this.

In the end, making this nicer don't change a verdict. Basically every aspect of the story is faulty - 2/10.

*** Yeah, I can't say that I entirely agree with you on all points, but you've put into words a lot of my problems with this fic.

Slytherin!Hermione fics -- how I love and hate them. I love the idea of them. Who wouldn't? A clever Muggle-born sorted into the house of ambition is a ready-made conflict.

But I hate the execution of most of them. Why? Because they tend to fall into certain traps: nice!Draco or Snape; overly friendly Slytherins; OOC Hermione; super-duper-smart Hermione; characters written as sounding and/or thinking too old for their ages; the Dark Arts aren't evil, just misunderstood; Voldemort Did Nothing Wrong; etc ...

This fic, sadly, falls into some of those traps. /Some/, not all -- though I can't be sure of that as I only read to chapter 12 and could go no further.

The writing is technically decent, which puts it above most fics right off the bat, but it's the characterization -- hers, Snape's, Slytherin house in general, Dumbledore's -- that is my biggest issue with this story. It's too OOC for me.

*** I have to agree with the author here.

Sir, your comment is completely and utterly out of line. It takes balls to post your fic on the internet, then more to post on reddit to promote it. I've looked through your posts, and you're the guy (or girl) that shits on everyone's fics. From this, sir, I can conclude you are not a writer, but consumer of fan fics. Most writers, I've found, are happy to give /constructive criticism/ rather than a rude tirade.

I've read this fic, and while the author might not be the next Rowling, the writing is pretty solid, it's free of grammar and spelling errors, the relationship between Snape and Hermione is rather cute, and all in all, it's a fairly good fic that looks like it's heading towards a happy ending. It's the author's first fic. Who am I to judge them?

I looked at the anime you recommended, and it seems pretty fucked up. I don't know your story. It's not my place to judge you, but based on your rudeness not only towards the OP but towards many of the authors on this site, I find myself doing so.

Please, do yourself and all of us a favor: clean the shit out of your mouth and get the stick out of your arse. I'd like to see you try to write something as good as any of the fics you routinely degrade.

#+begin_quote
  Sir, your comment is completely and utterly out of line.
#+end_quote

Actually, [[/u/Satanniel]] gave a pretty decent crit in my opinion. It wasn't sugar and light, and yes, it was a negative review, but it was nowhere near a flame. He (or she) gave his opinion and then proceeded to explain said opinion thoroughly.

Negative reviews ≠ crappy reviews.

(Also, that quoted comment is pretty rich considering the personal stuff about him you've written.)

*** I took a look at the first few chapters. This may be my personal preference regarding his character so not sure how much this really matters but I find Snape to be very out of character in your fic. He just seems so nice, polite, helpful and I just don't believe that reflects his character at all. In both books and movies, he comes off as strict, insulting, intimidating, critical, sarcastic, cynical, often not saying anything at all or giving one word answers. Asking "Are you alright", "your welcome", helping out new students seems out of character. It would work better if instead of helping her, he observed her and you went through the process of him deciding what it is about her that made him notice her as a slytherin.

Why does he think Hermione would be in slytherin? Muggle born in slytherin would need to be ruthless, manipulative, cunning, she seemed kind of bookwormy and awkward. Not sure that seeing wandless magic would convince him to have a good opinion of someone. Also, don't think that seeing that Harry was taking notes would reverse his opinion of him, his hatred of him is unreasonable, he would just focus it on something else.

His main criticism of Hermione is that she thinks all answers can be found in books and tells everyone random facts instead of relying on her brain and coming up with her own unique conclusions and knowing when to say things at the right time. Giving answers word for word from the book would do the exact opposite of impressing him.

Anyways, him behaving this way does seem to be extremely common in fics with him as a main character so I guess a lot of people like him acting this way, but just keep in mind that this may turn off some people from reading your story. The writing itself was good though, did not see any problems there.
