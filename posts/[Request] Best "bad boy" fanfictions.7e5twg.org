More like, so terrible, it's awesome!

I just loved the fact that, at the start of the story, Harry vows to stand against Dumbledore and three chapters later they're pretty much bros.

Maybe the MJ influence at work.

** Lol Draco Malfoy isn't a 'bad boy', he is a spoiled rich kid that runs to his father every time something doesn't go his way. In canon Draco always did what was expected of him, yes he broke the rules some times but so did Harry/Ron/Hermione yet I would hardly call them 'bad boys/girls'.

Anyway here are some fics:

**** No, if he was asking for that he wouldn't have added "or even a rebellious harry". He would have said "Characters like Sirius Black, Tom Riddle, Draco Malloy or Harry". Adding the word 'rebellious' to Harry implies that Draco was rebellious and had a 'devil may care' attitude, which he didn't.
