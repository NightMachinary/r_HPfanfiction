I'm looking for a Independent!Harry fic, but I can't for the life of me recall the name.

I think he runs away from the Dursleys and a freed Sirus and Remus and also Dumbledore find him in a club years later, he's bi, has an apartment, a tattoo on his back (I think), and he has a snake as a friend.
