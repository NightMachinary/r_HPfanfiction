** Not going to ask.

Nope not doing it.

...

Ok, I will bite. Is this a British thing? A particular archtype? Like "Jersey Girl" from the us?

  *Essex girl*, as a pejorative stereotype in the United Kingdom, applies to a female viewed as promiscuous and unintelligent, characteristics jocularly attributed to women from Essex. It is applied widely throughout the country and has gained popularity over time, dating from the 1980s and 1990s.
