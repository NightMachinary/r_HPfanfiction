SO after years of being a reader i decided to write my own HP fan fiction just to get it out of my system. It's been on my bucket list for ALMOST A DECADE but i couldn't seem to do it until now. I'm guessing it'll be shitty but at least i'll get it out of my system right? Anyway English isn't my first language since I'm asian. I hope people wouldn't be too harsh *fingers crossed*

Anyway do you guys have any tips?


** Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Edit. Don't just throw words down and then throw online.

Also have a plan for the story, don't just make it up as you go along. Readers can and will tell if you are just making it up.

*** Might wanna edit some of those 9 "edits" out. The point is quite clear by the third one.

** Before even putting pen to paper, read something on writing. "On Writing" by Stephen King is a good start.

Don't leap straight into writing a massive novel with complicated plots and numerous characters. Start small. Write, say, a drabble centered around one event in the lives of one or two characters. Then a mini-fic. Then, as you increase your skill, increase the length and complexity of your writing. Basically, don't try to run a marathon if the farthest you've walked so far is to the nearest McDonalds.

Get feedback on every possible occasion. If people say your fics are shit, don't get discouraged. Write more so that your fics become less shit.

*** Thank you so much! I am now checking out Brandon Sanderson! I hope i'll have the courage to finish my draft so you can check it out but i'm really nervous because English isn't my mother language. I am from Asia. :)

** Just write your scenes and come back later to edit with fresh eyes. It may seem like the shittiest piece in the world when you read it at first glance, but WRITE. Get your main ideas out. And then Ediiiitttttttttt your heart out.

Feel free to PM me if you'd like a beta editor when you've got your first draft down. :)

**** It really is perfectly fine. I was super young when I started reading + writing fanfic, and I look back on it now and my first pieces are 100% ehit but I've grown from there. Just taking the step to write was monumental and that in and of itself is an achievement, not just the finished product. Keep that in mind :)

** Mention to the readers that you're looking for feedback in order to improve.

Ignore "feedback" that essentially is just the reader telling you what to do with the plot in the future, unless it's a really cool idea in your eyes. I've had people give me really shitty "feedback" like this that demanded the story go a certain direction.
