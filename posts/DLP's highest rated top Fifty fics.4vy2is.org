** Some of these are quite outdated, and were even outdated when I first read them 7+ years ago, but many on this list are still the best in the fandom.

The DLP Library is readily available to non-members by virtue of a quick Google search. If you've posted this for simple compilation's sake, then you could always request a mod to make an addition on the sidebar, right?

Agreed, OP needs to step away from the keyboard for a bit.

That being said, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3092103/1/Queens-Of-Darkness-Ladies-Of-Light][Queens of Darkness, Ladies of Light]] was just too stereotypically Dark!wank /not/ to click on.

It's hilariously bad. I think I've found a new fic to recommend in the ever-present 'worst fic you've ever read' threads. At least some good can come of OP's grudge against you guys.

  HarryMultiSlaveDom.
#+end_quote

From the summary. This lets the reader know that the author couldn't possibly be a virgin tryhard. /s

The best bits are in the form of a metre-less, POV-switching stream-of-consciousness 'poem' the author inserted before the first chapter:

#+begin_quote
  Harry has lost so many he truly loved, but in their stead he pledge justice.

  [...]

  Could you kill the people you love most on this earth?

  [...]

  But in the end, will you be a heroic Light Wizard?

  Or another bloodthirsty Dark Lord?
#+end_quote

Seriously, all it's missing is some eyeliner and a few half-hearted self-harm scars. Bonus DLP brand Unwarranted Self-Importance:

#+begin_quote
  Thalarian T.M. Productions Presents:

  Harry Potter and the Queens of Darkness, Ladies of Light

  *Epic Prologue: Ass to the Wall*
#+end_quote

Wow.

I took [[/r/DarkLordPotter]] from [[/u/maybeheremaybenot]]. Think I should post this there? Everyone deserves a chance to relive old memories.

******* The most surprising thing is the fact that this is currently #10 on the list of most well-received stories at DLP.

In the ten *years* since this was written, you guys have only found 9 other stories that you like better than this one?

Edit: I started thinking that maybe I was being trolled, so I went searching for the story's thread on DLP. They [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=2950][love it]]!

******** You are being trolled. The OP has been doing this all week.

As for the list and fic in question: I can't speak for DLP (as I'm not a mod or seasoned member) but threads such as those are as good as fossils.

So yeah - there's your impression of the fic's reception at the time, but in the nine years since the last post in that thread, bookshelves worth of similar titles were stamped with 1-2 stars on sight. It's also worth noting that said thread is native to the infamous anti-slash period of DLP's timeline. I sincerely doubt that it is indicative of the forum's current collective tastes.

To think that I'm the one who posted that in For Review. My lasting legacy on DLP, aside from all the lulz.

** I see the author of this thread and can't help but think that this is supposed to be some kind of finger pointing/snorting-under-my-nose dig at DLP: "look guys, some of the fics on this is are outdated, lol".

Yeah, some are. As someone else said on DLP, standards change over time, ratings don't. Some of those fics that were very highly rated years ago would be rated differently today. On the other hand, there are many on that list that have held up well and some that are more recent additions and are good indicators of the quality DLP looks for in fics today.

**** The author of this thread has a history of writing inane stuff, be it anti-DLP posts (I don't particularly like their atmosphere, but this is getting tiresome) or threads about whether or not this-or-that story or author is the best thing ever since sliced bread (again, tiresome).

Once you see enough stuff by this person, you'll start asking “dude, why aren't you banned already?” every time you see something new, because it's just annoying useless ... nothing.
