Well, I want to see if there are any fanfics you can recommend where Harry meets the rest of his family, or relatives I had no idea existed. For example, Charlus Potter's son (who could be James' cousin, hidden somewhere), some distant relative in America or some unknown brother or sister of Lily.

  ( “Why're you studying with Padma---” “---It's Parvati, Ronald---” “---Parvati, sure. Why're you studying with her?”“He looked tired and there weren't any other open tables at the time,” Parvati spoke up, sounding rather absent from the conversation. “He's been good company, until recently.”Harry winced. She sounded unimpressed.“I just thought you were related,” Ron said blandly and Harry had to physically restrain himself from bringing his head down against the table. For fucks sake, Ron. Hermione's very obvious pre-rant intake of breath sounded like a fucking gunshot, what with how loud it was.“---Ronald! Just because they're both Indian doesn't mean---”“---We are. We're first cousins---”You could hear a pin drop. Harry's surprised gaze snapped over to Parvati, who saw his confusion and looked at him like she'd never quite seen him in person before.“Beg pardon?” )In which Harry realizes that not even he's exempt from how interconnected magical families are.
