I just read:"Harry thought he deserved an e because he would exceed snapes expectations by getting a single mark"

It's not the funniest, but it's very amusing

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

Harry must now explore those effects, and magic itself, all while battling killer teachers, giant monsters, and more in a school that really needs a safety board. Luckily for Harry, he doesn't have to do this all alone. Harry/multi. Contains AU, OC characters, and more.

** I've got two full spreads in my bullet journal dedicated to my favorite lines from fanfiction. Currently, almost all of them are from Of A Linear Circle (because I recently reread it), tho I have some quotes from other fics. Most of the ones I have are sad/meaningful, but here are some of the funny ones:

"The next time you decide to perform magic like this, please remember to inform me that you have both extensive tattoos, and that those magical tattoos /remove themselves from your person to dwell on the floor/ for the fucking duration."

"A request to Persephone to stay her husband's hand."/"Why?"/"Because if one is asking favors of Death, one does not ask Hades. One asks his wife."

And my last one liner, from the Pacify series by Chickenpets:

"They must have been horrified when they realized you'd turned. Severus Snape? A traitor? RUN."

  “A fucking disaster that took a major chess piece from the board, and I don't mean me.” Nizar flinches when Sutherland lets out a triumphant cackle that lets him work the dagger free. “I'm glad I can't feel most of that.”

  “Oh, you're a bleeder!” Sutherland says cheerfully as he removes the dagger.

  Nizar rolls his eyes. “The blade was coated in venom that acts as a blood thinner. It makes things more difficult to heal, and you don't need to sound so blasted happy about it.”

  “Oooh. A dagger wound and venom? It's Christmas come early,” Sutherland declares, placing the dagger into a sterile bronze tray before getting out his wand. “This will sting a lot.”

  “I hate you already.”

There was also a pseudo-time-travel incident where Harry realized that by doing something in the present, he could make what his future self could consider to be a change in the past, but that was more like a philosophical thought he had at the time. I actually thought that idea was pretty cool.

***** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

Why, there are different reasons, the big one for why its widely disliked is that it's also widely known and popular for some reason. Might be because it's quite old, has it's own website, and isn't all that badly written

It's basically a thinly veiled, ham-fisted piece of author's personal ideology IIRC. I've read it once, and it was definitely readable, but on the second attepmt i've failed a few chapters in. Look for some other people reviewing it because i honestly don't remember why i've grown to dislike it.

** Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions has several good lines, like these:

"Even if Draco /would/ have his potions homework done on time, and not get Professor Snape's Look 52, 'disapproval with a side of you should have been drowned at birth.' "

" 'Seriously, Harry,' Fred confided. 'She's a bit of a dragon. Be careful, yeah?'

'Hoards things,' confirmed George. 'When in doubt, throw something shiny and run.'

'Fred? George?' asked Ginny from just behind them."

I think most of the humour shines when reading it, though. Great situational comedy without getting too weird or inrealistic.

** There's crack lines aplenty in 'Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion', by DriftWood1965. A few of my favorites:

--------------

"Do you know who you're going to ask to be your replacement champion, Harry?" Madam Pomfrey asked.

"I am going to offer it to Ron," Harry replied.

"Ron Weasley?" Poppy asked and, when Harry nodded, she became ashen-faced as she said, "Well, I better go double check my medical supplies." And as she walked away, they heard her muttering, "Got to double my supply of burn ointment and better get a reverse drowning potion brewing..."

--------------

"Professor McGonagall actually wagered on us?" Hermione asked in disbelief. She turned and looked at the deputy Headmistress and could have sworn the stern professor almost smiled at her favorite student.

"Of course! And so did Professor Flitwick. Professor Trelawney wanted to bet that you would declare your love over Harry's grave," Fred explained. "But Angelina required her to give a specific date. Trelawney only stormed off muttering that the secrets of the future couldn't be wasted on a few galleons betting pool."

--------------

This little gem, during the Weighing of the Wands:

--------------

While Viktor was shuffling up to Mr. Ollivander, Ron whispered to Cedric, "Hey Cedric, next time you're polishing your wand, can I join you? Maybe we can polish our wands together."

Fleur turned to look at Ron and giggled.

'She likes someone who takes care of their wand,' Ron thought as he continued with Cedric, "If nothing else, can I at least watch you polish yours."

Cedric just looked at Ron incredulously and scooted his chair away from him.

'He's just jealous that the Veela girl giggled at me,' Ron thought.

--------------

...and this gem from the first task, as a thoroughly idiotic and unprepared Ron deals with the consequences of being such:

--------------

Dragon handlers rushed to subdue the Hungarian Horntail who was much more passive now that the five and a half foot yellow creature was gone. The stadium was silent as they took in the sight and through that silence came "POP!", "POP!", "POP!" as more flashbulbs exploded as cameras recorded the picture for all posterity.

Finally, a huffing and a puffing Molly Weasley caught up to her son who sat upon his egg with a glazed looked in his eyes as he stared at some speck of dirt in front of him, but not really seeing anything at all. Madam Pomfrey later discovered that not only had the fall from twenty-five feet broken a few bones, but the flesh of Ron's buttocks had been seared so badly that they had sealed around the golden egg when the two had made contact after that long of a fall. This is not to mention the additional discomfort he felt when a more sensitive area just in front of the buttocks also contacted the metal egg while the body was descending from that height.

Molly Weasley, in desperation to get her son to the medical tent, levitated her son to an upright position and it was at that moment when he, in his naked splendor with a golden egg stuck firmly to his arse, was in perfect view of every student, teacher and honored guest at Hogwarts, that any chance of Ron Weasley ever getting a date with any witch at the school died forever.

I won't even go into the end of Chapter One, with the start of the fart joke that puts all other fart jokes to shame, or all of the great lines about what happens to the traditional 'bad guys' in HP fanfic. This story is a grand mal crackfic extravaganza, and you will cry laughing through it.

- "Indeed." Silly him. Of course torture was always the answer.
- "They bes turning in their graves to be seeing the state of their house!" Dobby shot right back, hands on his hips as he told off the other elf.
- Was there just something about Dark Lords which made them predisposed to act like they were cackling Disney villains, or was there a special guidebook called 'How to be a pretentious drama queen while attempting to take over the world in ten easy steps' that they received in a welcome pack along with a stupid name, bigoted minions, and a big, black cloak.
- "I can't believe you sent me a threatening message in Victorian flower language." She said in disbelief, clearly still bewildered by that particularly inspired decision on his part. "What, were they all out of 'Sorry I saw your silly knickers, but aren't you taking this all a bit too far?' Hallmark cards or something?"
- "Seriously though, why have the fancy wheeled ladders if instead of using them you're just going to float on up there like a murderous balloon at the first sign of misbehaving literature?"

** Not quite one line but.......

"Have you thought about names?" Arthur asked, still struggling with the fire.

"A bit," Moony said. "But we haven't decided on anything..."

"Well," Fred said, "if you're looking for suggestions, Fred's good for a boy. And there's Georgia, or Georgina for a girl..." Moony chuckled.

"What about Arnold?" Ginny said. "I've always liked that." Harry snorted at the same time as Bill, Ron, and Percy did. Dora's eyes widened and Harry saw her hands spread protectively over her stomach, as if to shield the baby inside from Ginny's suggestion.

"It's better than Elvendork," Harry said, glancing at Moony. "Padfoot's suggestion," Harry explained, for the others' benefit. Hermione mouthed 'Elvendork' with a disbelieving look on her face. Ginny looked alarmingly thoughtful.

"It's unisex," Moony muttered, without much enthusiasm, and he and Dora shared a long suffering look.
