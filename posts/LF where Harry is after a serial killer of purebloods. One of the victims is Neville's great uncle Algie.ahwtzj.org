*** From past experience, fics with the word "gritty" in their description end up being the opposite. Is this any good?

**** You're exactly right, and this story is pretty bad. The grittiness is a bunch of tryhard, shallow nonsense. It feels like a story were the author is setting up the characters to fail, rather than the plot doing it, and it's a huge problem.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
