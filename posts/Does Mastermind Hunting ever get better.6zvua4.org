I'm a little over 9 chapters in and every scene with Hermione, Susan or any of this other oh lets give these defenseless students all my secrets crap physically hurts.

I wanna like the story, I really do. I love the potential for ridiculousness, especially the over the top evil Snape, but does the shit I mentioned stop at some point? I really don't think I can take reading it much longer if it does.

Edit: Just read the last chapter. That was the dumbest shit.


** No, not really. It gets worse. And then you get to the acid trip part of the fic. And then it goes back to being it gets worse.

*** As someone who enjoyed this fic I feel like I have to respond but... You are not wrong. The entire thing is entirely ridiculous, if you can't bring yourself to like it you really don't have to stick around because it is very consistent in the kind of tone and ridiculousness throughout the fic ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
