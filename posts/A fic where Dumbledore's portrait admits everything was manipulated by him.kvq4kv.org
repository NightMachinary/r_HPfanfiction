:END:
This fic was only a one shot and it took place in Dumbledore's office straight after Harry kills Voldemort. Dumbledore's portrait basically admits that everything that happened to Harry in all his time at Hogwarts was because of him and he's basically in full supervillain plan explaining mode and it was quite entertaining. Would much appreciate if anyone knows what this fic is called. Thank you!

  Starts at the end of the Battle of Hogwarts. As Harry stands over the dead body of Voldemort he realizes something. Bad Dumbledore. One shot.
