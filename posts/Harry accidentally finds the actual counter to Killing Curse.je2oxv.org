In the graveyard Harry fires his most powerful spell, Expecto Patronum, instead of Expelliarmus. The Patronus is like the life spell, created out of the best emotions of life, and it absorbs the AK. (Or maybe Dumbledore was right the whole time, and the AK counter was singing at the top of your lungs with all your emotions. -/"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes. "A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!"-"/)


** I think that if the Patronus really was a counter to the Killing Curse, someone would have figured it out by now. Your second idea, though...

***

/“Very good,” said Voldemort softly, and as he raised his wand the pressure bearing down upon Harry lifted too. “And now you face me, like a man...straight-backed and proud, the way your father died...”/

Harry looked around the graveyard. The Death Eaters stood back, watching -- he knew they wouldn't interrupt unless Voldemort told them so, and the Dark wizard wanted to kill him himself. Cedric's unconscious body laid where Wormtail stood a minute ago, and the Triwizard Cup -- the Portkey that brought him there -- laid on the ground just a little further away.

/“And now -- we duel.”/

Now, Harry wasn't stupid. He understood perfectly well that in a straight-up duel with the most powerful Dark wizard alive, he wouldn't stand a chance. Fortunately, he had one last ace up his sleeve -- powerful, ancient magic, the one that Dumbledore said was beyond anything Hogwarts could teach...

The power the Dark Lord knew not.

“I never wanted this, you know.” Harry said suddenly, preparing to invoke the defensive spell. “I just wanted to be a Seeker.”

“What?” Voldemort looked surprised, even lowering his wand a little.

“Yes! A Seeker! Flying through the air on my Firebolt! The thrill! The excitement! The wind blowing through my hair!”

“What about our bloody duel?” Voldemort asked, obviously irritated, but Harry paid him no mind.

“With my best mates by my side, we'd sing, sing, sing!”

And he began the spell, the lyrics coming to him as he yelled the song at the top of his lungs.

*I'm the Boy-Who-Lived, and I'm okay!*

*I sleep all night and I fly all day!*

He moved as he sang, running towards Cedric and ignoring Voldemort's indignant yell. Harry didn't really have a plan, but his instincts pointed him towards the Portkey lying on the ground -- though, of course, he wasn't going to abandon his fellow student to the Death Eaters.

*I go to class, I eat my lunch,*

*I fly at the Quidditch pitch.*

*Sometimes I serve detentions,*

*Because Malfoy is a snitch!*

Voldemort was furious, sending one Killing Curse after another, but they seemed to have no effect on the Gryffindor. Harry grabbed Cedric's unconscious body, and then he made a run for the Cup before Voldemort would realize what he was doing.

*I'm the Boy-Who-Lived, and I'm okay!*

*I sleep all night and I fly all day!*

***

Harry felt himself slam flat into the ground; he was back to the edge of the maze, the Cup in one hand and Cedric's body held by the other. A crowd of people ran towards him, led by Dumbledore and other Hogwarts Professors.

Harry took in his surroundings, realizing that he was safe at last. But exhausted and scared as he was, he still finished the song -- right as the alarmed Professors reached him.

*I go to class, I wear high heels,*

*Suspenders and a drape,*

*I wish I'd been a girlie,*

*Just like Professor Snape!*

*** I mean would they though? The patronus charm is a very difficult spell that many people are unable to cast; logic would dictate the only people that could cast it would have known exactly what it is and what it's used for - why would they have tried using it against the Avada Kedavra?

** For the life of me I can't remember what the story was about, but one fic I read had voldemort rediscovering the killing curse in some dusty tome prior to the first war, but the reason why it wasn't being used is that it was /super/ easy to counter. But since it hadn't been used for so long the counter fell out of collective memory making it an utterly terrifying unstoppable curse.

The counter? Lumos. For some reason it just straight up nullified the killing curse.

** It could make sense that the intent of the Patronus would defend against an AK. But also you'd have to consider how someone would find out. Why would you duel with a Patronus? The difficulty of the intent makes it very unfeasible as a dueling spell, even as a distraction. So you need to come up with a way for casting the spell to make sense. Maybe Harry senses dread that he incorrectly identifies as dementors?

But even if it kind of makes sense, I wouldn't do it. If Harry finds an AK counter, it should feel earned imo.

Imagine Voldemort and his supporters all around. AKs are going everywhere then suddenly Dementors show up (because you know there working for him for some ungodly reason) you have the people who can do full patronus' casting them to keep them away while those who cant continue to fight Voldemort suddenly an AK gose state for someone when a patronus runs right in its path trying to get to a dementor it strikes the patronus in the side "killing" the patronus instead of the person it would have hit.

**** It has to be a balance. If it's too easy an accident, people will question why it was never discovered before.

"Oh yeah, nobody would normally use a Patronus, and therefore it was never discovered."

Versus: "If all it took was AK flying around with Dementors, why wouldn't it have been discovered?"

If you chose the second option, versus having it come up in a dueling setting, then you will have a believability problem. The circumstances you are describing work against the concept of Patronus blocking an AK.

I think it would be easier to say, "This is the reason it never has been discovered, here are the circumstances surrounding how it was accidentally discovered by Harry." And then build the believability into the accident. Hence my comments. I understand exactly what you mean where it /would easily/ happen, I just don't know if that's a good choice.

******* It could have happened in the first war and just no one realize or saw it. Before Harry it was thought impossible to servive the killing curse. In the heat of battle peaple probably just assumed the spell missed. You have to focus for patronuses to stay active (we see this when umbrige barges into the DA and all the animals disappear) you probably cant focus of your strongest happy memory for long in the middle of battle.

*** What about like in HPMOR where only the true patronus can block the killing curse -it turns out that the form that produces an animal is a weak imitation of the true form which has been lost/is undiscovered until harry figures it out on his own

**** I don't know that story as well. I actually hated it and stopped reading, lol. Sounds like a good buildup, but what makes it true? What reason and means would Harry have to improve upon the spell? Is it just super Patronus? Am I going to think, "Everyone is just dumb, why didn't they discover the Dementor-killing AK blocking version of this spell?" Harry the genius 14 yo, making that sort of discovery would really have to be built to, right?

I'm just a weird guy in the minority probably, so grain of salt. I love super smart powerful Harry. I just don't like lifting Harry up at the expense of everyone else's intelligence.

Harry figures out that dementors are the personification if death (and he also realizes that at least godric figured this out as well) and that the ordinary lower level patronus works by making the caster distract themselves from their own mortality, he then casts it but with the thought that he rejects death as the natural order and one day people won't have to say goodbye anymore- nobody else figured it out yet because nobody else both realized what the dementors actually we're and also intended to defeat death itself

Also, had you stuck around you would have found a major theme to be harry really not being nearly as much smarter than everyone else as he thinks he is and that hubris often coming to bite him in the butt

******* The Harry-learns-Patronum scene is chapters 43 thru 45. You could read those and see what you think. It is one of the more intense scenes in the book, and the individual chapters are linked from the website (hpmor dot com). Edit: [[http://www.hpmor.com/chapter/43][here's the chapter link]].

You can also try chapter 14 of the hpmor sequel (different author, completely different style) "Significant Digits":

[[http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/07/significant-digits-chapter-fourteen.html]]

Scroll down about halfway to skip the leadup. Search for where it says "Not one more minute!". This scene is where Hermione gets her own Patronus. She is summoned by a phoenix to fly to Azkaban and destroy all the Dementors there. Again a very intense scene stretching maybe a dozen pages. No idea if either scene will do anything for you, but they are close to the center of what HPMOR & its related fics aim for, so maybe they'll help you decide whether to pursue the book further.
