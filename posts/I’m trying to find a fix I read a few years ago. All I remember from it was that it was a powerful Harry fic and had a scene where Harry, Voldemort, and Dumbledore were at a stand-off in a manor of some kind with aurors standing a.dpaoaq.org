#+TITLE: I’m trying to find a fix I read a few years ago. All I remember from it was that it was a powerful Harry fic and had a scene where Harry, Voldemort, and Dumbledore were at a stand-off in a manor of some kind with aurors standing around them. Each of them then said something profound before fighting.

:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:

** That sounds very similar to a scene that's been stuck in my head for a long time ago. All I remember is that there was a showdown, just like the one you're describing, except I think this one was just a memory of it in a pensieve, and it wasn't against Voldemort, but against Grindelwald. All I remember is that, like in your description, there were a bunch of aurors standing in a circle around the duelers, and at the beginning of the duel there was a power blast, and everyone standing in the vicinity was instantly vaporized. Only one person survived and it was because she/he was standing behind Dumbledore at the time. I've been trying to find out where I read it for years but, for the life of me, I haven't been able to remember.

**** Yeah, in yours you said that it takes place in a manor, but in mine I think it was in the open streets of a city. But for the rest, it sounded so similar that it triggered the memory of the scene into my mind again. That's the problem with reading dozens of very long fics. I can't re-read them all looking for that particular scene. Ain't nobody got time for that.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.
