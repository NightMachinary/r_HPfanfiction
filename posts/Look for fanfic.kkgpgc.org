#+begin_quote
  Henry James Potter has been betrayed by his family and Light, having been sent to Azkaban for defeating reborn Tom Riddle and his Basilisk. Two years later, with Voldemort once more living, he is given a chance to avenge himself and punish both the Light and the Dark. Enemies of the Dark Prince beware, for he knows no mercy. Older!Dark!PowerfulHarry. Bashing!Light and Potters.
