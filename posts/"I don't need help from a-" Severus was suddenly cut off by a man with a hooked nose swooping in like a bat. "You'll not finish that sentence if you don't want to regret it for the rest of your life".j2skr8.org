*** u/Flareix_:
#+begin_quote
  *NB: The werewolf incident happened before Snape's Worst Memory, even though many fans think it happened afterwards (due to Snape saying that Sirius was capable of 'murder' at age sixteen).
#+end_quote

Which is freaking /insane./ The Marauders nearly /killed/ Snape but even after that and not receiving any (to my knowledge) punishment, they went out of their way to attack him. That's probably why many stories changed the timeline of that because if you don't, it makes the Marauders look like a group of psychopaths lacking empathy.

**** Nobody tried to kill Snape. They didn't forcibly lock him inside a room with a werewolf. Remember that Lupin was always accompanied by Pomfrey so Snape had no reason to believe that the staff didn't know about him. He went there all on his lonesome probably because he wanted to kill Lupin and thus discredit Dumbledore and win himself points with his DE friends, and /James saved him./ And Snape never missed an opportunity to curse James even after that.

*** I feel like the really deal breakers are points 2, 3 and 5. If younger Snape changes those, he could still be friends with Lily, regardless of his position with the Marauders.

***** But James petty too at this age, and that didn't broke ties with James. It is possible that Snape had remained Lily's friend if he had done things differently and still kept his distance to the Marauders.

Eventually they would grow up and in the worst of cases Snape and James would avoid each other. But really 16 yr old Snape didn't have to get along with 16 yr old Snape to save his friendship with Lily

******* James also grew up as a person while snape retained that bitterness.

I imagine the final years of the hogwarts for them was very tense the war was getting more serious and they where more aware of it.

I imagine in the final year, everyone would travel in packs Because you wouldnt want to be caught alone with a jnr death eater

** That was just the last straw that broke the camel's back. The friendship was failing, that moment was just the last kick down the hill.

I'm just so annoyed with this narrative of it all being about that one word. It wasn't.

If not for this something else would have happened sooner or later or the friendship would have frizzled out

*** Someone already replied in great detail about that. Again, this is a prompt. The idea is to take the words as a springboard into something bigger. I don't expect a single moment to rewrite history, and suddenly make them best friends again.

I see this as someone being pulled back from the brink of a cliff before they fall, and point them in a direction that won't send them careening into the jagged rocks below.
