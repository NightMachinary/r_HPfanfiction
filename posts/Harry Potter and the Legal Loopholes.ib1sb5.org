Harry is raised by a Business and Trial law attorney, and has been around the best English Law Firm, as his father is one of the partners. All his life Harry has seen his father and other attorneys who represent big corporations on a daily basis, and are always exploiting legal loopholes to get their clients out of hot water.

Harry has been taught the motto "For every law, find ten loopholes, and think of a hundred ways to use them."

-***-

Albus Dumbledore massaged his head, tired after a hard day at work. He didn't need this shit. He had hoped Severus and Harry might try and get along, but alas, that turned to be nothing but a fantasy. Severus as usual had tried to frighten the first years by signaling out one and asking questions.

Unfortunately, Harry Potter was not one to be trifled easily. Instead, it turned out the young Potter had done considerable research, and thus was able to point out to Section 69:420 about unsatisfactory teacher's performance in the case when a teacher asks tough questions with the intent of humiliating a student.

How the Potter boy managed to get a total of 7 references to the use of the particular section of the Charter, Albus had no idea. He had to force Severus to reign his slight bias, and gently request (threaten with power) him to treat everyone equally, fairly and most of all improve his teaching standards.

All of that was just yesterday's work. And now he had to deal with an injury caused by the same boy.

"Mr. Potter, explain to me again how a gaping stab wound to the stomach is perfectly legal according to the Hogwarts Charter?" Albus asked kindly and gently.

"Yes sir. If you would check Section 58:008, you will find if a student challenges another to a duel specifying only the place and time, the challenged person dictates the rules of duel, which have to be vocalised just before the duel, and can be vocalised on a way that the challenger is unable to hear the terms. My terms for the duel was for it to be a knife fight. And, according to Section 17:77, a duel when issued and accepted, the duelists are immune from any and all form of formal charges of this school or the governing body for any injury sustained in accordance to the terms of duel," Harry supplied with the notes of Charter in front of him. "So, perfectly legal."

Albus sighed and closed his eyes again, trying to will the approaching headache away.

'Curse the day that attorney decided to raise Harry Potter' Albus thought to himself. It was going to be a long evening.

** I love this prompt so much, there's so much you could do with it. This idea burrowed into my brain from it - not so much focus on the loopholes aspect, but where I think this lifestyle might eventually lead:

​

"Good evening my friends, thank you all for once again gracing us and for all of the great risks that you all continue to take in service of this cause. Lord Voldemort is moving swiftly to rebuild the powerbase he once had, and the efforts of you all are vital in attempting to nullify this threat and protect our way of life."

Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts and secret vigilante leader extraordinaire was in his element. It was the latest in a string of meetings of the Order of the Phoenix, and he was holding court over the group of loyal fighters that he had assembled here in the basement of Grimmauld Place. Of course, the circumstances being the return of Voldemort and the start of a second war to destroy the wizarding world was less than ideal, but he really did revel in this role - politics and schooling be damned, this is what he was born to do!

Unfortunately, his good mood and pre-prepared speech were both shattered into small pieces by the sounds of a large crash coming from upstairs, and the sounds of loud shouting that followed did nothing to calm the sense of shock that had crashed over him at the interruption.

"We're under attack!" he cried, "Your wands, all of you, we must defend headquarters at all costs! Lord Voldemort cannot be allowed to breach these halls, and must not be allowed to retrieve Harry!"

"But Albus, how did they find us?!" cried Molly Weasley, "The house is under the Fidelius!"

"A traitor!" barked Alastor Moody as he strode to the head of the table. "You've been careless Albus! CONSTANT VIGILANCE! Someone has betrayed us all!"

Before the conversation could degenerate further, the yelling from upstairs grew louder still. The voices of children became audible, and with Molly Weasley's wails about her babies starting up in earnest Albus scampered as quickly as he could towards the stairs.

"Quickly, all of you!" he cried as he climbed them. "We must defend the..."

But before he could reach the door it was thrown open, and bright daylight flooded the dimly lit room. It took him a moment for his eyes to adjust, but when he did he goggled at what he saw. For it was not Death Eaters that confronted him, but two sharply dressed lawyers in suits, flanked by others who were clearly members of the muggle police force.

"Albus Dumbledore?" the police officer on the right asked as he stepped forward. "You're under arrest for kidnapping, child endangerment, and the formation and operation of an illegal terrorist group."

"Wha...what?! On whose authority?!" he spat out over the sounds of general chaos that this statement was causing amongst the members of the Order behind him.

"We're empowered by her majesty's government to uphold the law, sir. And once we received a tip from a Mr Harry Potter about the situation here we had to act immediately. I have to say sir, it was mighty foolish of you to allow your captives access to messenger birds."

"But...but no-one is a prisoner here!" he babbled, "these are all my friends and guests - including young Harry! I'm sure that should you speak to him you would find that..."

"I'm sorry sir." came Harry's voice, as he stepped out from behind the back of the lawyers. "But I'm afraid I was left with no choice. You were in clear breach of the Child Abduction Act of 1984 when you removed me from my guardians last night, and I've already been attacked twice by Doxies over the course of the day during Mrs Weasley's forced labour. It's clear that you're in breach of both Child Rights legislation, as well as your duty of care to your students. I really had no choice but to report you. Fortunately I still had the paper bearing the Fidelius secret that Mr Moody gave me last night, to guide the authorities."

"But...but what about Lord Voldemort, Harry?!" he sputtered. "Without us, who will be able to assist you in your fight against him?! You must kill him Harry - I was waiting to reveal it to you at the correct moment, but only you can rid us of him!"

"He wants to turn the kid into a murderer too?" Muttered the policeman on the left. "Good god we've got a lunatic here lads. We'll get a promotion for this one!"

"Don't worry sir, it's all taken care of." Harry confidently replied. "I filed a criminal suit against Mr Riddle several weeks ago for the murder of my parents. The date of the preliminary hearing should be set soon. I'll defeat him in a way that he can't possibly defend against - using a sound and well constructed argument that upholds the laws of the land. Once he's behind bars, we'll have no more need to worry."

Albus was speechless. He remained silent as he was read his rights, handcuffed, then placed into the back of a police van alongside the other Order members. The last thing he thought before he was driven away was "curse those damn attornies".

** Nice idea, but this sort of lawyering your way out is only fun when it's based on a real world system, or the laws are well established before being used (eg. using foreshadowing/precedents against the protagonists). For example, say Malfoy uses a law about lost property to steal Neville's Remembrall. Harry then uses his invisibility cloak to steal from Malfoy and then use that same law to claim ownership. Or better still, uses it to incriminate Lucius with ownership of the diary after second year.

Or if a law is used to try and nail the protagonist, but he uses a technicality to not only evade the charge but benefit from it. I saw this done in a fic where Harry is tried in a full courtroom after the Dementor attack in book 5. But flips it around and states that only adults are tried in a full courtroom therefore he is being charged as an adult for underage magic, which by definition is incongruous. Also, as he has been declared an adult by the Wizengamot through the legalities of the trial, he is effectively emancipated (i.e. no Trace), doesn't have to go back to the Dursleys, as well as cast magic whenever and wherever he likes as long as he isn't violating the SoS.

Simply introducing laws as required with obvious gaping loopholes (like in your short) that the protagonist then uses with impunity is not good writing.

Yeah, it's like locking the heroes in a room where the key is on the table in front of them. You'll struggle to get much mileage out of such low stakes.

It also breaks suspension of disbelief, for example any discussion about the Purge spends more time on how a rule like that would even work than the story you're telling

***** Yup. Lucius is a pretty slick political operator. He overreached a bit in the Chamber incident, but he still suffered very little lose for it, and he probably did a lot to undermine the Ministry and lay the groundwork for Voldemort's return (even if he didn't realize at first that Voldemort was still alive). At the start of the series Fudge is hanging on Dumbledore's every word like a little puppy, but as time goes on he listens more and more to Malfoy, and becomes more and more hostile to Dumbledore. Malfoy, his money and his connections, are arguably the most dangerous weapons at Voldemort's disposal in canon. Yeah, I can totally see him giving Lawyer Harry a run for his money in this arena.
