** /unedited/

Voldemort fell from Pettigrew's grasp as the traitorous rat collapsed into death's harsh embrace. Voldemort landed face first on the muddy ground which might have amused Harry if he hadn't just killed someone.

His wand hummed in his grasp, seemingly pleased about the dark spell it had cast. Never before had he sensed such dark energy coming from the Phoenix wand and Harry dropped the wand as if it had caught fire.

“Harry!” Cedric shouted, drawing his attention. The Hufflepuff was running toward him, there was fear in his eyes as he glanced toward Voldemort's cursing and raging form but Harry saw nothing but worry and determination when Cedric looked at him.

It was as if killing a man by Voldemort's order was an every day occurrence.

“Pick up our wand, Potter!” Voldemort hissed at Harry, using his arms to push himself up. His face was slick with mud and saliva dripped from his mouth. “We must flee!”

Our wand? Harry didn't have time to think of a response before Cedric was in front of Harry, blocking his view of the deformed dark lord.

“Harry,” Cedric said, “he's right, we have to get out of here. We have to leave before they come.”

“They?” Harry asked as his mind scrambled around trying to make sense of what was happening.

“The rest of the death eaters,” Cedric said, “they'll kill all of us if they catch us.”

“But Voldemort---“

“I'm not Voldemort, you fool!” The deformed not-Voldemort said.

Cedric moved to the side, once more looking at the tiny, muddied form with fear. If it wasn't Voldemort then why did he look so afraid? What about his visions? He had heard Pettigrew call him Lord Voldemort.

“I don't---I don't understand.” Harry took a few steps back from Cedric. He had killed Pettigrew and Cedric hadn't even blinked an eye, he had thought the boy to be Light but now it seemed like he was Dark.

“The night Voldemort killed you, he died forever. The countermeasures he took to stay alive didn't work as he did too many of them.” The being on the ground was crawling forward as he spoke, as small as a babe but as hideous as a demon. It was a scene from a nightmare.

“I fought you!” Harry interrupted. “I fought you for the stone! You can't trick me!” He had to get out of here, but the portkey was nowhere in sight and even then he wasn't sure if it would take him away. He didn't imagine summoning his broom would be useful either as he had no idea how far he was from Hogwarts.

“You fought a remnant of Voldemort,” it was Cedric who spoke, his eyes tracking the crawling form but doing nothing to assist. “There are seven out there but they cannot exist by themselves. They must be tethered to something. Quirrell, the diary, both were tethers and once they were destroyed the fragment was as well.”

The not-Voldemort stopped moving forward, heaving with exertion. He hadn't made it far, only three normal paces. “Before you ask, as you seem to be an idiot, I am not a fragment of Voldemort. I'm a fragment of you, Harry. The fragment that was torn off when Voldemort tried to kill you as a babe, and if you don't help me then we're going to die.”

****** I came up with this immediately after I read the prompt. I haven't given it much thought. Buuut, using my imagination now:

There are more sides to the war then people realize. It isn't just death eaters, ministry workers, and the order of the Phoenix. There's another side that's vast but thinly spread, a sanctuary to grey magic users. Their organization is global, but there's only pockets of them in each country which makes them unimpressionable. When Voldemort arose, the grey magic users observed the situation. Among them is the Diggory family.

After that fateful Halloween night, after Albus, Sirius, Hagrid, and Snape are long gone from Lily and James's home, the grey magic users go into the house to investigate. Using old grey magic, they are able to see the events that have taken place and are slowly able to put the pieces together. But, by the time they understand that there's a piece of Harry's soul out there, they're too late to track him.

They have to wait for Harry's soul piece to reveal himself and that opportunity only comes when Cedric and Amos go to the World Cup quidditch match and death eaters attack. With Pettigrew unknowingly leading the way, they're able to track down Harry's soul piece which is pretending to be Voldemort. Using grey magic they're able to secretly communicate with Harry's soul piece and come up with the plan to bring the two Harry's together: the triwizard tournament.

** Harry stared at the wrinkly remnant of the Dark Lord at his feet as it stared right back at him uncomprehendingly. This. This had plagued the world and murdered so many. He turned to stare at Pettigrew's glassy eyes in shock.

Well... He was already a murderer. However in hell /that/ happened.

And if somebody deserved to be thorougly wiped off of this world, it would be Voldemort. Second time's the charm? He could consult his conscience another day, perhaps when he wasn't facing mortal danger. The Boy-Who-Lived channelled all the hatred for the killer of his parents he could muster and shot off the killing curse at the Dark Lord's tiny shell of a body. It screeched.

A dark cloud rose from it. Harry quickly put up a shield charm, but Voldemort seemed to see the writing on the wall and floated away into the sky, his high-pitched screeched slowly fading away.

Harry Potter looked at the simmering cauldron a little ways away and sat on his arse. This was by far the quickest resolution of the annual end-of-the-school-year crisis to this date. He didn't even get his obligatory villain speech! How was he supposed to solve all the mysteries now? How did Voldemort put his name into the bloody Goblet anyway?

Cedric sat down next to him.

"So... what the hell?"

Harry blinked. "Yeah."

** The light faded and the remaining two individuals stared at Harry Potter in intrigue and confusion.

Cedric Diggory was dead.

Harry looked down at the body in utter confusion, the wand falling from his limp fingers as he looked up, stuttering to Peter, "I-I-I.... I didn't... I never." and stumbled away, his body moving away towards a gravestone to support him.

"How curious... Pick up your wand." the baby like creature ordered. Harry didn't hesitate, he /needed/ to pick up his wand. Though once it was in his hands he was horrified; he wanted nothing to do with that, that, that MURDER WEAPON. But when he went to drop it he felt... conflicted. He NEEDED to have his wand.

"Come here Potter." the baby-thing said in it's high pitched voice, "I have need of you still... Answer truthfully: Do you see me as your enemy?"

Harry didn't hesitate: "YES! You hunted me, killed my family, lead the Death Eaters, and continue to ruin every good thing I've ever had!"

Lord Voldemort smiled, "Wonderful! Stay there Potter, cast no spells, though you may physically resist dear Peter if he tries to hurt you." he ordered before turning his tiny head towards a confused Wormtail. "Complete the ritual Peter... Oh, and no interruptions until we are done."

It flew by in a matter of moments for Harry as Wormtail went about his work, throwing this and that in the cauldron. When the 'ritual' proper started Harry hoped that the small baby-thing would drown, but it was to no avail...

When he came with a knife Harry could do nothing but stare as Pettigrew sent a full body-bind to him, a mean grin on his face, "Blood of the Enemy, forcibly taken, you shall resurrect your foe." he said with a pained smile.

And then he was here, and Harry bit down on a scream as he felt Lord Voldemort return. He couldn't scream or interrupt...

The newly risen Lord stood and gloated and summoned his Death Eaters, telling Harry to be silent until spoken to.

When the time came Voldemort /congratulated/ Harry, telling the others how he had viciously killed Cedric Diggory with a Killing Curse, before turning to Harry and saying: "Join me Harry Potter, and you shall be the Prince to Dark Empire... /Join me!"/

And he felt the tears that would not come as his body responded, it /needed/ to respond. He was aware, he could feel his body work against him, his mouth move, his lungs exhale, his-

"Yes my Lord."
