For those wondering, prominent stories featuring Fem!Riddle would be:

-Departure From the Diary

-Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos

-Limpieza De Sangre

and others that have less following.


** I really enjoyed them especially simply because they added a depth to Voldemort that was missing. Not the romance which in and of itself makes the fics worth reading but the politics and background of the war that is introduced as well as Voldemort's reasoning beyond simply wanting to crush everything under his heel.

** In My mind, It sorta gives a reason to keep Emily Sane. I mean Canon Voldemort was basically nothing but a raging psychopath with very little cunning. Unless we look at Tom, it is hard to imagine Voldemort as ever being more than a brute. I like to think that thats due to him focusing on power more than anything else. Emily on the other hand would be needing her cunning to be anything in a male dominated world(Wizarding World/Not Magical). I mean at the time the muggle world was a place where women were seen not heard. And Canon wise. So was the Magical world. Aside from Umbridge and Bella. There were not many women to be of note. Narcissa was more or less a Damsel-in-Distress than a strong women. So I figure Purebloods thought women were meant to be supporting their husbands. Not themselves. So a Female Voldemort, Could not afford to sacrifice her cunning without losing her base. Unlike her male counterpart, who could and did rule through sheer brute force.

** Limpieza de Sangre is the OG. In the fics that AOC lists as inspiration the 3 iirc are Sarcasm and Slytherin, PoS, and limpieza. Interestingly, it hasn't borrowed much from limpieza aside from Emily Riddle as a name and that she fought grindelwald (if that's in LdS) but it's taken a lot from PoS.

*** Not much doubt about that.

Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos - published Feb 2020\\
Departure from the Diary - published May 2019\\
Limpieza de Sangre - published Jan 2016

LdS is undoubtedly one of the best stories in the fandom, and was where I eventually joined up as a regular beta for [[/u/TE7]]. There's so much non-obvious stuff that happens in the story that I find something new pretty much every time I read it.

** I'm in favor of anything that makes Voldemort a more interesting (and less cartoonish) villain and while making Voldemort female doesn't inherently do that from what I've read in Limpieza De Sangre and Ashes of Chaos, the Voldemort in those fics are more interesting than in canon.

I also like having a few more female characters who are plot important, canon doesn't have all that many.

*** If someone is going to R63 a character, they're obviously going to put more effort into giving them depth and complexity. That's why almost every fem!Voldemort fic makes her more nuanced.

** Never read one but is Emily Voldemort a cool anagram or just a random name for Fem!Voldemort?

*** Random name. In LdS, I explained it as Merope dying sooner and not having time to insist upon a name, or caring much as it wasn't a boy. So one of the matrons at the orphanage, who was reading Bronte at the time, named her Emily. Her middle name, Mary, comes from them assuming the dying woman was struggling to say that rather than 'Merope' but they figured out Riddle. So Emily Mary Riddle.

The explanation was cut from the actual story as is was 1500 words of clunky filler that didn't fit anywhere. If anything I'd add it as a prologue now but I still don't think it fits.

As for others using it, I guess it caught on from there. Emily had the same 'feel' as Tom to me, although name rating wise it's not quite as common of a name. But I wanted something that felt similar enough. She was almost a Mary, Jane, and a Chloe. But Emily ended up winning.

*** I never read a story of fem!Voldemort but I imagine her as either a manipulative femme fatale, as fairy tale evil witch or as visionary warrior who jump together in battle with her Death Eaters, kind of like Joan of Arc... none seem worse than Umbridge who is a politician through and through and everybody hates politicians.

*** I think it matters how that Voldemort would look. If she was good-looking (like in most fem!Voldemort fics), I think there would be much more sympathy and love towards her. If she was as disfigured as canon Voldemort, she would be much more hated than any other character.

**** canon Voldemort was also a handsome kid, who sacraficed his looks for power, would Fem Voldemort be able to afford to throw away her good looks in the same way or do she need to rely on them to present a political image.
