Just wondering how Harry's life at Hogwarts would have been without Dumbledore


** How AU do you want to go?

McGonagall knows where Harry is. Without Dumbledore, maybe she checked on him regularly. Maybe she forced a change in his home life.

If not, maybe whoever is Headmaster sends someone besides Hagrid to collect Harry from the Dursleys after he fails to respond to any of his letters. That itself can cause many new branches to form on the universe tree.

If not, Dumbledore isn't there to hatch the Philosopher's Stone scheme. Without that at Hogwarts, is Voldemort? Does anything of any significance happen at Hogwarts during that year? No Troll, no change in relationship between Hermione and Ron & Harry.

If not,...

*** Dumbledore was the only person who knew where Harry was growing up (That's how others viewed it anyway) and with his position in the ministry he presumably stopped the attempts of people wanting to locate the famous Potter child for either malicious or selfish reasons. With him gone I think the ministry would've located Harry and come to check on him at the very least. He is ridiculously famous and after Dumbledore died they would naturally worry that no one really knew where he was.

I definitely don't think Hermione joins the canon trio... That development hinged on Hermione being in danger because of Ron and Hermione being thankful afterwords. More than likely Harry would continue living in his own world and Hermione would become more reclusive of her housemates until she found friends.

Same with Voldemort. He didn't really seem to care about Harry in the first book aside from when it was convenient to take pot shots. His main goal was grabbing the stone and returning himself to life and without it I think he'd still be wandering the world looking for a way.

-

I think the only way a story like this feels natural is if you go as AU as possible. Dumbledore was at the center of pretty much everything and without him things would go off the rails.

  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.

******* The Flamels are nearly 700 years old. There have been far worse dark lords than Voldy in the last 6-7 centuries, and they have presumably kept the stone safe for at least 600 years (assuming they made it by around their 90s at the latest). I'm pretty sure they're still alive and Dumbledore didn't actually destroy the stone or even ever have it. It was clearly a trap-send the least discreet most loud mouthed person possible to pick up the “you-know-what in vault you-know-which (Hagrid says this quite loudly in the middle of Gringotts lobby).” This also coincidentally happens in Harry's first year. Dumbledore is not stupid-the only way Voldemort can get to Harry is when he finds him (Voldemort couldn't have found out where he was when most of the wizarding world didn't know) and he can most easily gain access to him at Hogwarts, in his first year, since he knows Harry's age and this why (I presume) Dumbledore set the trap. He knows Voldemort will come to hogwarts in some manner, so he's trying to simulataneously entrap him and keep him distracted from killing Harry.

It's also a good way to ascertain if he is truly still a threat. If he is,, he'll be heading to good old hoggy warty hogwarts, to kill Harry and whatnot, and if he's not, then great. All he did was waste a little time setting a trap.

I got a little off topic here, but clearly the Flamels did not give Dumbledore their stone, nor was it ever in danger of being lost.

******** You literally made most of this up. This is all headcanon.

There is nothing saying there were worst dark lords. There is nothing saying when the Flamels exactly made their stone. There is also nothing saying their super powerful dark lord fighting wizards. And nothing that ‘clearly' says they're alive and didn't give Dumbledore their stone.

You literally just spit and posted it as fact.

********* The first book has the Flamels being nearly 700. Wizards can live up into their 200s though it's rare. At the very least they would have had to have made it by then-I'm assuming it was earlier but yes, that is an assumption.

Voldemort terrorized only the UK Grindelwalds terrorism reaches from the America's through Eastern Europe. In terms of reach, worse. He killed (by Pottermores account ) a good few more than Voldemort. Voldemort is just terrifying to Wizarding Britain because they managed to remain much less affected by Grindelwald. The Flamels lived in France and would have lived through Grindelwald. Who, while he may not have been interested in eternal life, certainly could have used more funding for his war.

Herpo the Foul is another. Emeric the Evil wiped out a good portion of the UK in the Middle Ages (the latter part of which the Flamels were alive for). Sure my assumptions are not cannon, but they clearly follow from cannon. You're being quite unnecessarily combative. Perhaps you're very young or having a bad day?

And nowhere did it say Herpo and Grindelwald was worse than Voldemort. Numbers mean nothing in this context; Mao was responsible for more deaths and most would still argue Hitler was worse.

You literally just assumed Grindewald wanted their stone without any context. You made that up.

*********** Nowhere did I say he wanted it-I said he could have. Im saying that Voldemort is not that big of a deal outside of Britain. He had little to no effect elsewhere. The Flamels are in France, and Voldemort has horcruxes and other options for rebirth-the stone is not necessary, but it's the most readily available option at that point in time. He literally just got back from Albania (where he met Quirrel and talked him around) and his first stop is Hogwarts. Quirrel was already heading back. I don't know how he knows the philosophers stone has been moved to Gringotts-maybe Dumbledore was keeping it there prior to the protections being set up (we don't know because we read the series from Harry's POV)-but it's an easy assumption to make since the Cerberus is already up there on September 1st, Devils snare is grown etc (the certain death referenced at the sorting feast). If he's setting up protections prior to day 1, his professors (including Quirrel) were already informed. Voldemort is not yet on Quirrels head, that happens later (Quirrel allude to this in his speech in the Mirror room at the end) so he is simply trying to get the stone before it's moved to Hogwarts. He fails-maybe he/voldy didn't expect Dumbledore to send “that oaf” to pick t up, again unreliable kid narrator who wasn't there, so who knows.

The point is, he was heading back to Britain eventually; his followers are there etc. if his goal was the stone, and he's more afraid of Dumbledore than the Flamels it would have been simpler/easier to go after it in France (closer to Albania than Britain is). Instead, he wants back to Wizarding Britain.
