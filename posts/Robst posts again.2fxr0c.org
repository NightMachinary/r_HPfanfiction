*** Your definitely not that guy as I get this vibe from a lot of his work, especially Harry Crow, it just seems like Harry is able to outwit all his openers with his daring chilvarious chivalry and make sure that no one messes with Harry. Or we could be both be /that/ guy, but no matter, I stand by my previous statement.

**** Glad I'm not the only one at least. Sure, he's not the only one who does this by far, pretty much every fic that involves Scorpius and/or Draco usually ends up with /omg-such-chivlary-much-aristocracy/, which is a good thing, apparently (as opposed to the correct reaction, to find it utterly bloody disgusting). But in those stories it kinda makes some sense, given that the Malfoy family /are/ wizard aristocracy.

There's too much of this in general, in my opinion at least. The m'ladies vibe is nearly always present, and every female character is submissive and gets together with a semi-sociopathic version of the cast that just screams "wife beater" a mile away. The latter here is not so prevalent in Robst work, as far as I know, but it's too common in HPfics in general. And sure, you can have elements like that as long as they make sense, but the number of Lily/Scorp Rose/Scorp nextgen!fics I've read that starts out as "look at me with my strong will and independence, what a bright future I will have, surely" that turns into "OMG I love you Scorpius, please control my behavior and tell me what career choices are acceptable" as soon as the romance gets going are disturbingly many.

****** I was speaking more of certain aspects of chivalrous behavior as they are a part of aristocratic decorum, but true, it's more common that Harry goes around throwing about the "m'ladies" and hand-kisses. I think I actually read a genderbender one with fem!Draco that features such a Harry... but given that it devolves into [[/s][spoiler]] just a few chapters in, I'm not sure how "chivalrous" it actually is.

EDIT: Just remembered, it was this one: [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/791048/chapters/1494691]] Actually a very enjoyable read, as I recall, if you like the fluff.

And then there's ITWATN, in which Hermione gets raped twice by evil!Ron, but this serves only as an excuse for Harry (sorry, "Lord Potter") to take pre-emptive revenge when they're sent into the past. We never even get her reaction from her own POV, despite the rampant head-hopping. And let's not forget how Ron is described as a "shit wizard" (which is exactly how Harry Potter characters talk) and yet can somehow overpower Hermione no problem.

**** I don't even think it's that. His stories are just really accessible and simplistic, requiring less thought to read. The fact that he writes in such large amounts leads to a large consumption of his work. His prose isn't atrocious, and that leads to people thinking that his stories are worth reading.

***** I just did a quick skim out of morbid curiosity: it's a Harmony Azkaban fic with possible Luna-flakes (she and Hermione have had a make-out session). Harry's memories of Hermione are a convenient Patronus. Some weird astral projection thing is going on too, apparently, conferring some kind of soul-bond-like thingee.

Pretty bog-standard Robst.

*** Harry Crow is the most representative. If he had only spent time with the goblins, and left out Harry entirely, the story would have been very interesting, as his take on Goblin Society is was promising. However, he made it into a plot element designed to overcome all comers, rather than an actual society, which is why the story falls flat.

In technical terms: The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristeia][Aristea]] lasts too long.

Harry Crow is the only exception I know of, as It starts at the very beginning under very different circumstances that would definately cause Harry to act like that.

Also Ron is suddenly capable of rape and rather than change him in his formative years, our heroic duo psychologically tortures him.

*** First, fuck off.

Second, you have a point, perhaps accidentally. Robst does one thing well: the first 20% of the story. It is a sort of 80/20 thing with him. 80% of the good (if not always origional) ideas are blown in the first 20% of his stories. The rest is just slog. So just stop reading when the threats stop being real and the hat-tipping intensifies.
