Ok, Hermione's nickname is pretty normal but what kind of name is EraserHead and Present Mic?


** In this case, I have no idea who Harry and Ron should be.

On one hand, Harry / EraserHead and Ron/ Present Mic seem the pretty obvious choice. But I really want to see a way too hyper Harry would would always badger a Ron that is just done with the world.
