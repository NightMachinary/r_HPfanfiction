Does anyone know any fics during the scene where everyone thought Harry was dead in DH from different people's point of views? Like Ron? Ginny? McGonnagle? Basically their inner thoughts? Not sure if this exists but interested. Thanks!


** I started a great fic and lost the link, but it was the entire DH story from Ginny's perspective... I'll see if I can track it down...
