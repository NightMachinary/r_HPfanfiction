They came out victorious but damaged as well. The road to peace and getting on with life is a difficult one as Hogwarts is rebuilt stone by stone, So must survivors of the war Rebuild and recovery themselves and their future bit by bit.

Edit: PTSD's a bitch, Especially the magical variety. You can only blow up your bedroom so many times before You have to start Bombarda proofing the furniture and warding the carpet to not catch fire

Yes this is a Prompt. Edit2: Ron not Ryan


** Who is Ryan? Ron?

It has been suggested that the magical world treats PTSD by removing the memories

*** Even if you remove the memories, all the consequences stay. Somewhat like how you as a person are shaped by your experiences despite not remembering most of them

**** That'd be an interesting prompt, actually. Harry (or anyone else) experiencing bad PTSD attempts to self-medicate by way of memory charms - but now, he's still got the ingrained instincts and tendencies, still has the urge to deal with it in the same way as he did before, and sometimes the memories start to leak through... despite having only the clean, sanitized memories.

***** I don't see how the memories could "leak through" as you put it, since they no longer exist. But yes, it would make for an interesting story.

On a slightly different note, HPMOR has this kind of plots -- obliviated of the memory but feeling the effects of something, making characters act in a different way

**** One of Robst's (I think) fics deals with an idea like that. The reason why Malfoy is always an annoying ass is because whenever he ends up humilliated or in serious pain, the memories of said event are removed, so he never grows up.

**** do they really, though? Sure, suppressed memories still affect you, because they're still there, but obliviation completely erases them, magically. If obliviation was just a forcible memory suppressor, then the statute would've been breached centuries ago through guided meditation or therapy.

***** IIRC Crouch obliviated Bertha Jokins but Voldemort was able to retrieve the memory. This suggests that are suppresed not erased.

***** I'm not saying the memories remain. They are erased, yes. But the changes in your attitudes / views towards things can change.

Like let's say when you're five someone tells you that we're actually just a very small rock in space. They convince you. Ten years later, you have no recollection of that event, yet your belief remains.

Similarly to that, even if your memory of the trauma gets removed, you might remain paranoid, emotionally unstable or irrationally scared of something.

The only thing obliviation would solve would be the nightmares (which arise from the memory not being able to be processed during sleep and remaining "fresh", replaying daily) as there would be no memory of the event. But this would leave you with a lot of emotion that no longer have a source.

In the end, I'm not sure if obliviation really is the best approach to PTSD
