I've read several time-travel fics where Harry goes back in time, but it's usually to replace the younger Harry. I'm looking for something where Harry goes to Hogwarts at the same time as younger Harry and so on. Maybe he befriends his younger self. Is there anything like this out there in the universe of fanfiction?


** Amalgum - Lockhart's Folly

linkffn(11913447)

Harry goes back in time, as Gilderoy Lockhart. He guides Harry, and defeats Voldemort, but in a Gilderoyish way.

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

** linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute).

The best time travel story there is, period.

It captures the urgency of a character who is actually desperate enough to attempt something as incredibly dangerous as time travel to defeat the most dangerous Dark Lord till date (not for shits and giggles like several other TT fics) extremely well. There's no wasting time here, no befriending younger versions of his friends to make their lives easier or any of that nonsense. It even manages to describe the incredible difference between the soldier Harry has become to the average civilian of the past at the very end.

** I read a short fic years ago where the older Harry only showed up a couple of times to comfort younger Harry when he really needed it.

I don't recall the name but it was very touching - no adventure, just helping an abused kid make it through a time when he should have broken. (I only remember them sitting together in the rain when younger Harry was stuck and no one came for him.)
