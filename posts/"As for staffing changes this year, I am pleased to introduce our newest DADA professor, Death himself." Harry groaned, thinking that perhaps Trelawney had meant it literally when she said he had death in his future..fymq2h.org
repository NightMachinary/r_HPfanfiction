** "And on another hand, I am pleased to introduce this years Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, Professor Death!"

The usual scattered applause broke out in the Great Hall, none except a few muggleborns looking perplexed. Harry looked around wildly, about to dismiss it as a coincidence, but of course he dismissed the idea as Fate (maybe she would be their divitination teacher next) would never give him the luxury of a coincidence.

As Ron delved into the depths of his food, and Hermione pursued her latest book, Harry tried to sound as non committal as possible (for he would certainly not be making a fuss if no one else was- God forbid he be seen as delusional yet /again/)

"Hey, y'know when Dumbledore said Death, I really thought they were gonna be Professor Death Eater." Ron sniggered slightly, but Hermione winced.

"Harry! That really was not funny and if you had a smidgen of co- /wait/"

She gave Harry an (in his holy opinion) a very undeserved death glare.

"Did you not read up on this?" seeing Harry about to complain, Hermione continued, "No of course you didn't,"

"Harry. You /do/ know that /Professor/ Death is actually the deity, right? And that he will teach us all of our classes invisible? And that he will somehow manage to teach us depite the fact he has no mouth, and even if he did he certainly wouldn't speak English? You didn't know that? "

Harry blinked. " Of course I did Hermione, don't be silly. I only wondered when /Professor/ Death would be reporting to his master."

Aka: its 2am and I have 10% battery so this doesn't make any sense

** What type of Death would make a huge difference: Death of the Endless, Death of the Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse, Death of the Discworld, Lady Death from Marvel, etc. - they're all very different personalities and would provoke very different reactions.

** It was getting to be rather quiet and peaceful in Hogwarts, Harry noticed after a few weeks.\\
There weren't any fights in the halls, students practicing magic without supervision, pranks going off...the place had become the very definition of an orderly boarding school.

Perhaps that was, as Harry discovered one night upon attempting to sneak out under his invisibility cloak, the propensity of their new Defense teacher to appear where students were making mischief, with an open box of popcorn held in his skeletal hands. Everyone was quite certain that he was merely having a jest, a way to enforce discipline and amuse himself at the same time, but nobody was daring enough to /prove/ it.

***** I mean its an idea, but Harry would want to stick with the cloak cause of the whole, James owning before him. I don't really see that flying with canon!Harry much less fanon!Harry. Although if death phrased it as "his old cloak" it might work, but most likely not. And he would also have to take Dumbledore's Elder Wand Of Deathsticking™ and I don't see him getting hired if that's a possibility.

** Because Death won't get involved in the war, nobody can die for war related things. All Order members and Death Eaters members and Voldemort, cannot die in battle with each other.

(But they can die, for example, if Bellatrix and Narcissa and Andromeda fight each other for whom has the more beautiful hair, for example; or for illness, or have strange accidents)

**** Especially if him 'not getting involved' was entirely accidental, he just meant that he wouldn't fight for either of them and accidentally locked himself out of The War. It'd be a very, very Discworld Death thing to do. :D
