"He he he", Dumbledork thought while sitting in his office, the slave-bonded Phoenix Fawkes glaring at him as he always did, "Harry's magical core is now at 13.76% and it's dropping rapidly. Soon enough, I shall have a great weapon against Voldemort, who is secretly my lover."

"But Dumbles, why did you cripple Harry when you want him to succeed?" Said Hat, being useless as usual, and Dumblesnork as always threw an obliviation hex at the head garment.

"Silence, head garment, you do not know the true extent of my machination!" shouted Fumbledore at the top of his lungs, the windows of his office quivering in fear.

In the corner, one of the silver instruments directly beamed knowledge of what harry had for breakfast at this moment into his brain, and Crumbledore had to adjust one of his many plans to account.

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" thought Grumbledore victoriously, beholding the slip of a boy critically. Sure enough, he was just as crippled, malnourished and weak as needed for Mumbledore's plan to have him destroy the greatest wizard in the world in a duel.

The boy was only a few feet tall, and must have weighed less than a feather! With bones of glass and paper skin, and heart attacks that put him to sleep every night, he would be a perfect weapon.

"Harreh, M'boy, come with meh" Said Lumberdore imperiously, only just managing to hide his extraordinary evilness under a veil of grandfatherly affection.

He had to use some legilimency to grab the answer directly from the boy's head, as he had forbidden the elves from giving him any sort of food or drink, not that the boy was verbal anway, after being locked in a cellar for 10 years like he'd imperiused the Dursleys to.

"Are you friends with little Ron and Hermione yet?" he asked in interest.

Because children who are 11 years of age are very good at being ruthless contractors, Rumblegore had promised each of them one third of Harry's family vault to be his "friend".

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" shouted Fumblesnore in victory as he beheld the gauntlet constructed entirely out of Harry's savings and manipulated into existence through pure arrogance.

He had wanted to kill his best friend Nicholas of course, as all best friends want to, so he'd built a perfect trap which the Dark Lord was now trapped inside of, staring at Harry.

"You'll never get out alive, my love!" Shouted Comblemore, as he attemped to sparkle the evil wizard Voldeshorts to death with his eye lazers.

"No! Not the eye twinkle! It buuuurns!" shouted Goldymort, as he was scorched to death by the death ray emerging from Someblecore's eyeholes.

"Harreh my boy! Are you alive!" shouted Sumblesore as he beheld the +remains+ unconscious body of Harry, before shrugging and taking away another 2.6555% of his magic to stir into his tea later.

"Come with me!" and he tugged on the slave-bond he had around Hogwart's strangely attractive soul, which instantly teleported the two of them to his office.

"Here, Harreh, eat this" and he gave him a Lemon Dropâ„¢, which wasn't spiked with a deadly poison that automatically locked away the eater's metamorphmagus talent and tranferred 20 Galleons from their bank account to Sconebledore's, wink wink.

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" sang Crumblesnorkle as he beheld the +exhumed+ boy who was lying on the chamber of Secrets' floor.

He had of course killed and sold the Basilisk for massive profits, money which he used to steal magic from Britain and attempt to merge his two loves into a single person.

"Harreh my boy, come with me!" and he dragged the boy, which was still wrapped in a +tattered, dirty+ black robe, even as +it+ he +lost+ dragged one of his arms along the floor.

"Here, let me help you!" and he blocked the boy's parsleytongue ability, as well as 54.9877% of his ancient runes, 87.37765% of his charms, 33.33%, repeating of course, of his transfiguration and 98.998% of his BloodMagic and wandlessmagic.

"Harreh, eat this:" said Parceldork, and he handed Harry a pebble he'd picked up outside, which was enchanted to make the boy love Ginny Weasley, who would steal 50% of the boy's money when they divorced.

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" screeched Goldendoors, as he watched the Dementors swarm Harry.

"Here, m'boy come with me!" he shouted when the left, and he stole 50% of his magic to apparate them to Olive Gardenâ„¢.

"Harry, eat this! It's veritaserum" said Murdercork and he handed the dusty skeleton missing an arm a vial of glowing green liquid. It wasn't veritaserum, but high-grade plutonium.

Foldycore snapped off an imperious curse on the Olive Gardenâ„¢ staff, and had them bring the two of them some Margeritas. He of course poured some anti-love potion keyed to Daphne Greengrass, into Harry's glass.

"Harreh, m'boy, you need to defeat Voldecurt!"

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" whispered Bundles'more, as he looked around on the Graveyard.

Harry was of course lying on the floor as always, +getting bone meal over everything,+ but Crumblemore wasn't perturbed.

"Jesus Christ Dumbledore, what have you done" said lovely Voldysnort, as he looked at the scene in Horror, "Even I wasn't this evil."

Grumblyfarts only smirked knowingly, before summoning the boy +'s body+ and blowing his errant love a kiss.

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" laughed Smoldersnore at Amelia Bnoes, who had come to his office.

"Albus, you... what you've done, it's not right." She said in her idiotic way, him quite gracefully rocking back and forth, "all that blood... and the entrails..."

For according to his plans, he had made quick work of /Umbitch!/ She had come to HIS SCHOOL, had had the gall to MARK /HIS */PROPERTY*/!/ She deserved everything she got!

"Albus, I'm afraid I'm going to have to take you in." And she drew her wand.

"Hihihihi!" chuckled Stumblemore, drawing his wand and shooting off a spiralling yellow curse at her before roughly grabbing his phoenix around the neck and apparating away.

--------------

"Just as I predicted!" was a manic giggle that could be heard from the woods around Hogwarts often in the following months.

Voldyknork, his lost love, had had the NERVE to FUCKING /COME TO */HIS** SCHOOL!* AND FUCKING TELL /HIM/ OFF! He had the FUCKING /NERVE/ TO SAY /'I'm protecting the students'?/ TO *FUMBLECORE*, THE /LEADER/ OF THE /LIGHT?!/

Guess he'll have to be /pacified/, doesn't he Albus? *DOESN'T HE!*

--------------

Just as he'd predicted, here he was, his errant lover, alongside the other one, what was his name...? Crundewalk?

Why were they lifting their wands?

Cornerstone didn't know that incanta-

** You know, /Ron Was Fat and Ugly/ was amazing, but while this, too, is quality crack, I don't feel like it's up to the same standard. The percentages are funny, but I think it has too much random bloody murder towards the end, and the technically correct but terrible and nonsensical writing in the first one made it funnier ("quirking his eyebrows quirkily", "he expertly manipulated the demonic fire into the shape of a large spork").
