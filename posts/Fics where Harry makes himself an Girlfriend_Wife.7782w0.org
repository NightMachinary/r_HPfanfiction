  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

** There are two ways to interpret this request, and I require clarity on which one you mean.

Are you asking for fics where Harry magically fabricates/creates a girlfriend/wife?

Or are you asking for fics where Harry turns himself into a girlfriend/wife?

** there was a fic called Raptor written by Sakuradaemonalchemist at the FF.net. Didn't finish it but it seemed like Harry was going to shack up with his reverse-animagus pet raptors.
