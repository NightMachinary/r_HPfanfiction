*** Yes, please migrate!

There are so many great fics I just can't get through because ff.net sucks the joy out of everything it touches.

**** Their official app is much better than the website. Plus, I find it easier to download fics and have them automatically updated when I go online, rather than having to redownload a story when it's updated.

** Has someone written an article or done a summary/laundry list of everything that's wrong with ff.net? Like the puritanical censorship that also forces writers into self censorship, whole stories vanishing into thin air etc. I'm looking for writers who have personal experience with this. If anyone has done a decent article on this topic can you please post a link? Maybe there's been a good discussion about it here on reddit and I simply missed it.
