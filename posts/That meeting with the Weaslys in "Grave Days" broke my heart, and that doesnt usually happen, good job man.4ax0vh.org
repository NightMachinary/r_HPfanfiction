** God, I just finished Not From Others (I think the bot is still down hold on, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others]]), and holy shit watching things from Gnny perspective justmake things much more emotional.

*** will try reading after Grave Days, how do you compare this fiction to the other one that details Ginny in all 7 books I think?

**** If you're talking about "In the words of Ginevra Molly Weasley", I have to be completely honest and say I didn't really like that one. In fact, I'm pretty sure I ddn't finished it. SO any comparison I offer would be completely biased and not fair.

****** Love that one, that's one of my favourites. Hmm, "Not from others" definetely does a better job telling us about the seventh year, since it's entirely about that. AS far as the writing style goes, I prefer GW and Half Blood Prince though.

****** I especially like the part about Dumbledore and 'the motivation', it tied up nicely at the end.

*** I'm 90% sure that he means [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/Grave-Days][Grave Days by Northumbrian]]. It's a post-Battle of Hogwarts fic that starts the day after and covers the aftermath, such as funerals (which is where the title comes from) and getting Hermione's parents back [[/spoiler][though you don't actually see that, only Ron and Hermione go to Australia and it is a Harry POV fic]]. It ends with Hermione and Ginny getting back on the Hogwarts Express for the new school year.
