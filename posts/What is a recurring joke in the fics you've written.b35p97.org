** Well, I do have sort of a running gag going on where one of my characters is always going on to her friends about how she's super important and rich in her society, and nobody ever believes her and constantly dismisses her as lying to make herself seem cooler than she is...except the twist is that she's actually always been telling the truth about it, so when everyone finds out she's going to be like, "What did I tell you people?!"

She's like Jack Sparrow. "You actually were telling the truth?" "I do that quite a lot, yet people are always surprised!" Because see, she is always lying about EVERYTHING ELSE, so it's like the girl who cried wolf. :)

** "I heal quickly. It's a habit, born of repetition."

There's also the misconstrued statement thing:

#+begin_quote
  As he paced in the lift, Harry considered his next steps. "Damnitall. I wish I had my cloak!"

  Luna looked at him oddly and asked, "Are you feeling cold, Harry?"

  "No, I mean I own an Invisibility Cloak, but it's back in my trunk at school."

  "That certainly sounds like something useful. You should have brought that along."

  Harry grumped, "Yes, Luna. I realize that now."
#+end_quote

Or the part where a character finds herself appearing unclothed due to problems Vanishing through anti-disapparation jinxes.

#+begin_quote
  "Harry said you Disapparated from the courtroom but left your clothes behind, again." Ginny felt good teasing her a bit.

  Holly sat down next to her on Ron's bed, then half-turned to face her while still able to keep an eye on Harry. The bobbing blue flame wandered their way to hover overhead.

  "Yeah... I think my outfit got caught in some sort of security charm in a way that I wasn't. I popped up in the Atrium right below the statue. Heard a little girl say, 'Oooh, mummy! There's a nymph living in that fountain...'"

  Her impression of the little girl's voice prompted Ginny to laugh, though she tried to stifle it for Harry's sake.

  "I realised that I was deshabille and up to my knees in water," Holly continued, "so I popped again, this time landing outside the phone box entry in the alley aboveground. Well that wasn't going to stay private for long, so I popped a third time and arrived in my room at the Leaky Cauldron."

  Ginny held back her cackling to ask, "Why didn't you get clothes there?"

  "It wasn't mine anymore! It was occupied by a portly old wizard who took one look at me and said, 'I didn't order this, but I'm willing to accept delivery.'"

  Again, Ginny had to muffle her laugh.

  "I was getting tired, so rather than banter with the man, I popped then onto the rooftop and just rested there until I could sense that Harry had stopped moving. Now I'm finally back here in Sirius' house, wherever that might be. Think I might have caught a bit too much sun, but at least I won't have to worry on tan lines, right?"

  Harry takes a chance in hope of saving Sirius from the Veil, assisted by Luna and some stolen Time Turners. Working with Luna comes with its own complications, though.

** For my fic in which Tom Marvolo Riddle is raised by his muggle father and grandparents, (with help from Hermione) his grandmother calls him a different insufferably cutesy nickname every time she talks to him. The potential Dark Lord is a sweet little crumpet crumb, a bright little snidget, etc.

****** I can't claim to be any sort of expert. I have it all in a Google Docs document, which I edit on my phone. I have a lot of important dates at the beginning (birthdays, full moons, historical events, etc), and then the ideas for scenes in order, with random snippets of dialogue or whatever. I usually write the important conversations first, then I place them in settings later. There's stuff that has to happen before the market crash, and other stuff that has to happen after, etc, so I just put it all in order. I don't split it into chapters until each chapter is pretty close to done. That librarian-bribing scene took longer than I expected, so there wasn't room for other plot points I thought I could fit into that chapter.

I'm not glued to my outline. Chapter 11 was originally supposed to have an additional huge plot complication in it, but my beta reader insightfully said it was too much too soon, so I took it out and moved it to a later chapter.

The ending is decided, with only minor details to fill in. That's how I know what I'm working towards.

** Harry in a poncho.

He is a PI going undercover to Hogwarts as a Divination Professor, and Pansy, his partner, buys him a New Age-y poncho she calls Seer robes as a part of his new persona. Harry hates it at first, of course, but eventually comes to own it.

In another fic, people keep disbelieving Harry that he is a time traveller and think he is there in Hogwarts to spy on them instead. For whom exactly, is the subject of a heated debate. Although I'm not sure if this counts as a recurring joke because the fic itself is short.

** Well... I'm still working on my fic and haven't uploaded this chapter in particular and probably never will since I'm planning on rewriting the whole entire story. The SI sorta has a thing for dodging ghosts, because they constantly badger them about their SI status.

Now I'm thinking of making them popular with the Hogwarts ghosts. It would be interesting to see Peevees terrorize them outta spite and jealousy.
