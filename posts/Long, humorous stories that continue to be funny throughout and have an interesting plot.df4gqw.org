Ongoing stories are fine.

Ideally Harry-centric, AU is fine.

It's OK if one or two characters are changed, but it shouldn't be like everyone is OOC or everything from canon is changed.

If present, romance should not be a very major part of the story.

  Regulus Black survives his adventure in the cave and brings the locket to an unlikely ally: his estranged older brother. The ex-Death Eater strikes a bargain with Dumbledore, cooperation in exchange for his family's safety. Sirius Black is faced with his toughest mission yet: managing Walburga and Orion Black---who, to his surprise and dismay, decide they rather enjoy having both of their sons back, and very quickly scheme to make this temporary family reunion permanent.Or: the story of how one night completely changed the course of the war and Sirius's life.[AU of the First Wizarding War in which stealing part of Voldemort's soul brings a broken, dysfunctional family together - Winner of 2018 Shrieking Shack Society Silver Marauders Medal for Best Sirius Characterization]

#+end_quote

Absolutely!

#+begin_quote
  and have an interesting plot.
#+end_quote

It depends on what holds your interest, of course, but Harry's interactions with Professor Snape, and with Tom, are fantastic IMO.

#+begin_quote
  Ongoing stories are fine.
#+end_quote

It's actually complete, with a (short) sequel that's also complete.

#+begin_quote
  Ideally Harry-centric, AU is fine.
#+end_quote

Yep. It's a Harry who developed a love of potions - but not a particular talent for them. Professor Snape is not amused.

#+begin_quote
  It's OK if one or two characters are changed, but it shouldn't be like everyone is OOC or everything from canon is changed.
#+end_quote

Actually I think it's the most believable and well characterised Snape redemption arc I've seen. And my one complaint about the story is that sometimes the stations of canon are visited when I would expect them to be have been butterflied away.

#+begin_quote
  If present, romance should not be a very major part of the story.

Well, I can't remember any. Harry is single at the end.

  Harry crumpled up the note and started over.

  /I achieved an Outstanding on my Potions OWL, as instructed. I hope your summer is/

  Harry tore that one in half. Hedwig, sitting on her perch, hooted at him.

  “I'm working on a letter for Professor Snape, Hedwig. I'll have it for you in a minute.”

  /Dear Professor Snape,/

  /How are you? I am fine. I hope you are recovered. I was pleased to receive my OWL results and look forward to seeing you at Hogwarts/

  Harry studied that one, then crumpled it up too. Hedwig, bored, soared out the window.

  /Dear Evil Nose,/

  /I got an Outstanding on my potions OWL, so you're stuck with me. Everyone has been asking me how I am, and I look forward to returning to school so you can tell me I'm being an idiot. I've been trying to figure out what to put in a letter to you for an hour and this is sadly my best attempt, which I am now going to ritually burn./

  /My last myrtle potion demonstrated that if you're overenthusiastic about the tapping it explodes amusingly on the unwitting student./

  Harry crumpled it into a ball and threw it out the window, where Hedwig caught it and flew away.

** Ah this! It's long. It's hilarious. It's not complete yet, but what is available is a lot and glorious. It's not Harry centric, but he's in it quite prominently after a bit of intro. It does have some romance and lemons though, but I wouldn't say it's the main factor.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor)

Pretty long, quite humorous, and there isn't a /lot/ of romance. There are some sections that focus on it, and it's pretty smutty (but generally smutty humor rather than just smut), but romance isn't really at the forefront.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
