** I first dipped into HP fanfic between OotP and HBP.

The biggest change I've seen is Ron Weasely. Back when I started, he was usually depicted as brave, loyal, perceptive, and absolutely someone Harry wanted at his side. Now he's mostly an oaf, if not straight-up evil. Some of it's how badly he behaved in DH, but I suspect a lot is the movies' influence.

(One strong mark of this is his overuse of the phrase "bloody hell" -- a phrase which /does not appear/ in canon, but is all over the movies.)

Another big change is Noble Houses seen as legitimate. Along with a ton of recurring tropes (house rings!) as to how the houses function. Really seems to miss the moral.

*** Absolutely, the movies really did Ron dirty. It's a shame most people in the Fandom now get their cues from either the later movies, or more likely, other fanfics.

*** There was actually an interview between JKR and Steve Kloves, where they said that Ron was the character most people liked the most before the movies were produced. It's saddening to see how much impact misrepresentation of characters has. I think that's how a lot of characters grew in favour in people's eyes, like Hermione, Snape and Draco.

** I've noticed over the years that there's been less and less originality and innovation and more and more reliance on the same old repackaged tropes. The new HP material has had zero impact on the fandom, other than essentially allowing people to chance names of background characters to give a marginal semblance of a world building foundation.

  who the hell is Daphne Greengrass
#+end_quote

A blank slate Slytherin character for readers who don't like any of the canon girls, or look for something new.

I've seen her around in fics from 2009 onwards, so she is not that new anymore. Her "Ice Queen of Slytherin" persona has already been done to death.

In the Books, she was only mentioned once, in OOTP because her name comes right after Granger alphabetically.

--------------

There are some fics using FB materials, but fandom interest seems quite low. As for Grindelwald fics, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]] is a fun one.

*** She's a really useful character, as she is a blank slate but is also a pure blood, so can be used easily in Slytherin stories to explain how the world works. The only other Slytherin option is Tracey Davis, who as a half-blood is no use for the Noble Houses are legit! fics. If the fic isn't Slytherin based, Susan Bones is a useful pure blood, while Hannah Abbot is the half-blood - a bit marred however by her ending up with Neville.

I always wonder about this sort of phrasing. And not just with the Ice Queen Daphne trope.

Is wise Dumbledore done to death? Brave Harry? Evil Voldemort?

I can hardly think of any Ice Queen Daphne fics that I actually like, and I'm completely certain that that could change, so I'd say it's far from done to death.

** Lot more mixed in terms of writers, where before there was a heavy dominance of female writers and as such, different writing styles, because generally teenage and adult women writing in the 90s were coming from a much more specific cultural familiarity than the more diverse writers who are coming in as adults today. For a basic example, just in terms of the fandoms that would be written as crossovers - fandoms that were, back then, heavily marketed towards men and actively not women, would tend to not be represented when it came to crossover because the pool of writers weren't familiar with those worlds.

There's a lot more I could get into, but the wider Harry Potter world has changed and evolved a lot as it's moved away from the books and strict canon - or, it's incorporated and created for itself a wider church of 'Harry Potter fanon' which no longer has a strict basis in canon. Which has been fascinating to observe and take part in!

I guess the other thing I must note is that I would say an easy majority of the fandom &/ writers are now American, and that comes through in the themes, ideas, and even to an extent the morality that steers the broader fandom church and some individual stories. Whereas, when it was smaller as a fandom, and when people were coming in from British books rather than Hollywood movies, there was much more of a mix. This doesn't make fanfic in general better or worse, but it's something to be aware of. I really enjoy that in this community we can discuss such things and learn about each others' cultures and the ways in which they differ - things that each of us might miss when only consuming media that assumes similarity and doesn't go deeply into differences.

For an example of one change, the idea of wands = guns is almost intuitive to an American audience, but to those of us reading and thinking in the UK, where guns are illegal, the parallel never crossed many of our minds until it was raised by US fans. And then of course, all of the aspects that butterfly out from that starting point.

*** I want to continue expanding on the Wand=Weapon thing that you started.

I completely agree that it likely was an American point being introduced. I also think that the word "Terrorist" has been raised more in the never fanfics than they did so long ago. The fanatical almost religious side of things when it comes to Voldemort draws parallels to the "War on Terror" that we have dealt with for so long as a planet.

The themes have gone from more fairy tale to magical realism and a lot of social commentary is bleeding into the works. The political fanfics especially deal with this a lot more in the never stories.

**** Interesting, I probably don't read varied enough fics to have definitively picked up on that, but, yes...I do see that especially in a lot of fics set in the first war, there is a lot more recognition of what that might be like based on elements of life today.

*** Seeing Dumbledore go from a twinkly-eyed distant protector to an ice cold manipulator has been an interesting change to witness. I think you're right that bashing is much more common. The pseudo-Victorian trend is the most confusing to me, like where did that come from? Non British fans who are fascinated with British/Victorian history?

As for Harry turning dark, I recall ages ago that fans were skeptical about how well adjusted he seemed, despite all the traumatic experiences from run ins with Voldemort and getting attacked relentlessly. So it sort of makes sense that it would eventually turn into Evil!Harry. However it's almost cynical at times, the idea that after all he's seen Harry would naturally become an embittered, manipulative young adult. Imo those fics are an exploration of PTSD as much as they are a critical examination of Harry. Interesting stuff!

** Daphne Greengrass can be safely ignored in my opinion. There is one good story linkffn(13133746), which is worth reading, one good (very non-standard non-Haphne) series (the second part is unfortunately not finished) linkffn(3912184;4236594), and that's basically it. The rest is mostly Lord Potter/Heiress Greengrass drivel.
