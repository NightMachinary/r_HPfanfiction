Just an old observation, brought on by Intelligent! Harry, and so on. Am I the only one, who felt like JK made a knd of u turn, with Harry's personality, between books two and three?

I mean, to me, it seems like Harry went from being someone, who's extremely curious about the new world he had found, and quite interested in his schoolwork, to someone, who doesn't much care, and is pretty much like 'meh'.

It makes no sense to me. I can understand Ron's lack of interest, since he was born into the Wizarding world, and most of this is ordinary, but Harry? I mean, for all intents and purposes, Harry was a Muggle, when he arrived at Hogwarts. To learn magic! Study magical beings, creatures, etc.

I would think any Muggle/Muggleraised, would be completely fascinated with EVERYTHING Hogwarts had to offer...

Thoughts?


** I think it's important to consider what the third book is about thematically. It explores Harry's loneliness, isolation, and feeling trapped. Sirius Black being on the loose means he has to stay at Hogwarts while everyone else gets to go to Hogsmeade. The dementors being literal depression monsters means that people are going to be depressed, meaning a lack of care about school work.

Factor in puberty kicking into high gear, his best friends arguing with each other, people keeping secrets from him, constant death threats in a class he picked only because his best friend did as well, and the other new class he could have been excited for being ruined because of what happened in the first lesson, it all leads to an amalgamation of feelings that can be very demotivating.

You also have to factor in that the Harry Potter books are mainly mystery stories disguised as urban fantasy. PS/SS has the mysteries of first the letters and then the stone, CoS has the Chamber of Secrets be its main mystery. PoA subverts Harry and grew actively trying to solve a mystery early on when Arthur tells Harry not to go looking for Black. Harry is given a less proactive role and more reactive, and even then the reaction is basically an order to stay out of trouble.

Harry's main goal in the story is to find a way to get over his weakness to dementors, or in other words, deal with his depression. Which he manages to do by figuring out that 'he can do it because he already has.' It's a more internal story than the previous two books.

TL;DR - The reason is because PS/SS and CoS is about solving the mystery and fighting the bad guy, while PoA is about overcoming personal +dementors,+ demons. One's about curiosity, the other self-reflection.

*** Quite insightful, but unfortunately hits the Watson vs Doyle problem.

While it's quite understandable from the writer's point of view, when looking at a literary work - it's quite reasonable, yes.

Unfortunately, the other side, that of character continuity in-story, is quite another matter alltogether.

**** Here you could just put it down to things happening over summer that we don't see. We only really see the very end of Harry's summer with the dursleys in the first chapter of most of the books. we do heard about things, I think, when he speaks to his friends, but events over summer bearing him down before third year could explain it.

This is lazy, and I don't thinks it's the case, but it's possible. when I write I try to include anything that has enough of an impact the character to change them. Minor events like details of conversations, if not important, can just be footnotes.

** I feel like this is part and parcel with Rowling's overall indecisiveness regarding whether to have Harry be more the traditional sort of hero (the special, the exceptional, the one chosen by destiny, which we see hints of throughout the book series) or the everyman forced to become heroic by circumstance, which is more or less how canon ended.

One of the biggest differences between the first 4 books and the last 3. I had no expectation Harry was on his way to being Dumbledore-esque, but the change from him making an effort to help himself to looking solely at Hermione was very disappointing.

**** There were signs of Dumbledore-esque.

Saving Sirius for instance. Driving off a horde of Dementors at thirteen?

Issue is, Rowling changed her mind in books five and six especially and in book seven half-heartedly gave him a bit of strength. It's like she really did change things and Harry became a 'Hermione, may I?' person.

** I can't say anything for Harry specifically but I imagine Muggleborns would actually be disappointed more than those from wizarding families. I mean, magical theory and stuff is all grand, but when you actually have to study it? I'd get bored pretty quickly, especially if I was expecting to learn cool spells and potions right off the bat. Whereas kids in wizarding families would probably already know they start off slow, and not have as high of expectations.

That being said, I imagine more Muggleborns would be excited and a tad more motivated to go out of their way to learn things outside of their classes (such as how wizarding society works in general, and what sort of creatures are real) but for the classes themselves, first and second year at least to me seem rather dull. I imagine second and fourth year would be the worst actually, since first and third have the added excitement of beginning new classes

** its my personal opinion that in the latter books, both Harry and Ron get nerfed to give Hermione room to shine, Harry goes from being a sassy little brat, to a kid that relies too heavily imo on Hermione and other pepole.

Ron meanwhile goes from being the "ordinary" kid in a family full of prodigies, that wants recognition and too stand out amoung them, to becoming a person that constantly takes the easy route, eg Diviation.

Hermione went from being a student that studied to hard, to a genius that were capable of performing advanced magic eg contract in book 5 and the DA galleons.

** That's a part of being a teenager. 13-14 is usually the years when independence and rebelliousness kicks in big time, it makes sense that Harry would be less interested in schoolwork and exploring the wizarding world since he's reaching that age where he's instead looking more to himself and his relationships with others.

Not to say that JKR didn't alter characters as she went. The biggest shift in personality for me is book 5 and onwards where Harry becomes very passive in his own story and reliant on others. Same with how Ron becomes stupider and less active, Hermione's intelligence and amazingness gets amplified until she's like Wizard Einstein instead of just a bookworm who reads too much, and Dumbledore's eccentricity disappears almost entirely.

** I don't think that's true. Harry is only very excited about magic over the summer. At Hogwarts, he and Ron just complain about schoolwork like regular kids do and are pretty average students. If anything, him learning the Patronus Charm in PoA is probably the first time he learned magic outside of class that wasn't required.

He also loses his amazing sassiness and pretty much stops investigating the yearly mysteries. It actively diminishes my enjoyment of the later books.

** As someone else said... the novelty wore off eventually. Harry still remains curious but his curiosity shifts towards other things. In book 1 it's all exciting since it provides an escape for him and everything is new. In book 2 he learns about the British wizarding culture and how some of the old families look down upon those below them such as muggle-borns or house elves. In book 3 he learns about his parents' past. In book 4 he learns about other wizarding cultures. In book 5 he learns about about the magical government's inner workings, as well as how it's like to be under constant threat from a dark wizard. In book 6 he learns about his enemy's past and gets to discover some really dark magic (Horcruxes, Inferi, Sectumsempra). In book 7 he learns about wandlore, death and mythological artefacts that even wizards think are fairy tales. So I think Harry learns something new every book and he is genuinely curious but his curiosity shifts.

** I don't think Harry really ever showed any interest in schoolwork to begin with. Yeah, in the first book he reads his textbooks ahead of school, but that was only because he was just introduced to this new world and was curious - not because he wanted to get a head start and enjoyed homework and stuff like that. And also because he was kinda trapped in his room and had nothing better to do.

I do agree that JK did tone down Harry's curiosity as the books went on, but like many others have pointed out, that might just be because novelty wore off. But Harry never tried hard at school, apart from the ‘reading his textbooks before school started' thing there is no other hints to him enjoying schoolwork at all.

There was also this line - can't remember where - where Harry mentions, as a kid, he wasn't allowed to get better grades than Dudley. This could explain why he doesn't try to excel at school: because as a child he was taught not too.

No such line exists in canon, I'm afraid. In fact, Harry almost never talks about his experience at primary school apart from the few anecdotes at the beginning of PS where the narration talks about Harry accidentally apparating onto the roof and one later when he thinks about having to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue.

On one hand, I can definitely see Vernon having an anti-intellectual strain to him so it wouldn't matter if Dudley got bad marks because Real Men aren't namby pamby intellectuals. Harry getting better marks wouldn't matter to them (also, this is primary school, I don't remember my primary school reports having real grades to them).

On the other, I can also see Harry being conditioned to not bother trying to do well. I doubt Vernon and Petunia would help him do his homework at the kitchen table so he was probably doing it in a very rushed manner, Dudley would probably have enjoyed destroying or taking Harry's homework just to get Harry in trouble, Harry likely struggled on with eyes that needed glasses until a teacher put their foot down which means he may have copied things down wrong or been seen as a troublemaker. Added to that would be the incident with the wig and the incident with him on the roof, meaning teachers were unlikely to give him the benefit of the doubt.

All of that could easily add up to a kid who won't do well in school. Not because his guardians laid down some abusive edict that he could not do any better than Dudley but because he'd learnt that trying to do well was pointless.
