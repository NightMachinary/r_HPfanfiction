I'm looking for some next gen fics, preferably canon compliant. Just looking for some good ones that follow either Albus or James and where there's a decent plot


** linkao3(7737991) is good. It's Albus/Scorpius and compliant with Cursed Child.

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

**** Noted.

I guess one I had in mind would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4218556/1/Second-Chance][Second Chance]] by Lady Memory. The story actually follows Severus' portrait meeting with Albus S.

  COMPLETE. Severus meets Albus Severus. The past comes back in a very peculiar form. My answer to the end of Deathly Hallows.

** Linkffn(Questions and Answers by little0bird)

Anything by Northumbrian would likely fit this rec as well. I cannot vouch for the quality but it's gets recommended quite a bit.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.
