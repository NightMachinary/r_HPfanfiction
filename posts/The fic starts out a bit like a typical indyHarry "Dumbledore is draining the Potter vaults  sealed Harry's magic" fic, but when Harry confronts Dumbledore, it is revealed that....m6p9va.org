...Dumbledore, though perhaps still a bit manipulative, wasn't the one doing that. In fact, he was entirely unaware that it was occurring (along with whatever other "evil guardian" stuff you can think of).

​

So Harry and Dumbledore are forced to work together to figure out who was the mysterious third party impersonating Dumbledore to ruin Harry's life and/or pit the two "heroes of the Light" against each other is.

​

This could then eventually lead back to Voldemort, or it could lead to some other group made evil by the fic (like some group in the ministry or an OC dark lord).

​

If you want to go a bit more "large scale" with it, the events could culminate in a massive three-way Wizarding War between Voldemort, Harry + Dumbledore, and this third party.


** It was Hagrid. It's always been Hagrid. He's been there in the shadows, playing the oaf and pulling the strings.

Who "rescued" Harry from Godric's Hollow?

Who had Harry's vault key?

Who was dropping hints and nudging the golden trio into adventures?

It's been Rubeus all along!

*** Not exactly the same but I've had the strange idea of an crack-y Independent! Hagrid story.

During the summer of 1993, after his release from Azkaban, Rubeus Hagrid, the torrents of indiscriminate Rage coursing through his veins, wants Justice, nay he wants Vengeance. Vengeance against a world that has so cruelly treated him so. He realises, however, that a lowly Gamekeeper could never affect such change in the world.

He devotes himself again to the study of Magic and in so doing discovers the prophecy of /Umbrelllr/ and the Half-Gurg of the line of Bennandonner, who shall rise in time of great strife and return the Giants to their former glory.

Follow as Rubeus, embarks on the quest to become Rubeus Fridwulfson, Gurg of all Giants, and wielder of Umbrellr, and his friend Harry ‘Giant-kin' Potter, who is politely bemused by the whole situation, but hey to the mind of a 13 year old, anything is better than the Dursleys.

  Worldbuilding by a devious and cunning OC who is still subject to error and murphy's law. I've paid a lot of attention to character flaws, consistency, realism, and originality. Plenty of Fanon where Canon doesn't make sense, and original plotlines galore. Sort of a 'self insert', but not really.
