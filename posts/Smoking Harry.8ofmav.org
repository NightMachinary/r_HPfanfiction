Hello! This time of the year where I search the most random details in fanfiction has come up again, and this year, I'm looking for harry with a smoking habit. It can be cigarettes, it can be the pipe, it can be the cigar, anything! Only tobacco thought, since weed makes for a different image. Thanks guys!


** "Whatcha thinking about, Harry?" Ron asked as Harry sat down in the Great Hall.

"...Honestly?" Harry answered, "My trousers feel funny this morning."

At that pronouncement, Fred & George Weasley on the other side of the Gryffindor table shared a smile, before Fred leaned forward, "Say, Harry, are you planning to take Ginny out next Hogsmeade weekend? Our little sister?"

Harry blushed, "No! No." he denied, "...Not yet."

There was a loud BANG! and a flash of light from Harry; when it cleared, the boy's trousers were brightly smouldering, wispy trails of smoke trailing up past his head.

"Liar, liar, pants on fire~â™ª" Fred & George simultaneously sang.

OR:

Harry looked at the strange mask that had shown up amongst his Christmas presents that morning. It looked like...well, it didn't actually look like anything, just a blank wooden mask with an iron bar running down between the eyes.

/Perhaps it's enchanted?/ Harry thought, turning it around in his hand. It did seem to shimmer an odd green colour every few seconds.

Which raised the question, was it safe? Would it do something like turn him into a monster, or mind-control him, if he put it on? Or would it just change his appearance?

/Come to think of it, I did mention to Tonks that I wished I could change my looks so that people would stop staring at me./ Harry mused to himself, /This is probably from her./

Harry glanced around the dormitory; Ron and everyone else were still asleep...it /was/ a bit early in the morning even for Christmas. He considered going back to bed and waiting a few hours to see what the mask would do (and open the rest of his presents), but...

/I would like to see what it looks like.../ he thought to himself, before he crept out of the dormitory and into the bathroom, mask in hand.

Harry stood in front of the bathroom mirror, holding up the strange mask. He was certain of it now, it definitely was shimmering green.

Taking a deep breath, watching himself closely in the mirror, Harry raised the mask to his face...

And everything went /crazy/.

Ron startled awake. There was a loud banging and crashing and thundering noise coming from the bathroom, like a tornado had decided to take up residence in there. And Harry wasn't in his bed.

"Harry?! Is everything alright?!" he shouted over the noise, glancing at Dean and Seamus as they shot up in bed as well.

BANG!!

The bathroom door burst open; standing in the doorway...was someone /not/ Harry. It was a...someone, dressed in a fancy black tuxedo, with shiny black shoes...and a bright green head, who was ruining his dignified appearance by grinning maniacally.

"Sssmokin!"

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.
