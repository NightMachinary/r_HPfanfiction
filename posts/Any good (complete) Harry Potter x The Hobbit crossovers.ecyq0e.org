Looking for fics in which Harry somehow ends up in the Lotr Universe. (preferably during the happenings of "The Hobbit")

I'm not into fem!Harry, but Slashfics are welcome. Though will read anything if it's good in your opinion.


** This isn't a long fic or all that serious, but it is finished and it's very funny.

** I don't know if the party could handle another character with unusually high luck. Every time I try to insert Harry into Middle Earth I wonder where he would even need to be for him to be a hand of Eru.

*** As an inter dimensional traveller (of sorts) he doesn't need to be part of The Music. Nor been Fated to be there. In fact would be interesting to see him as causing a discord in The Plans of The Wise :D

It is up to the writers though. I would love to see a story where he'd cause as many problems as he solves (if not more!) and has his own arc & journey rather than rehash the canon with Harry stuck in.
