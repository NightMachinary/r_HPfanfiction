** The writing is technically sound, I'll say that for it. Beyond that, I've always disliked Zombie style, end-of-the-world shit, so I couldn't get past the first three chapters.

If it's your thing, you'll probably like it. If it's not, well you probably won't get past the first few chapters.

*** That was pretty much why I made sure to include 'zombie apocalypse' in the title. I knew that a lot, probably a majority, would skip right over it on that alone. Saves some time clicking through and/or reading the first chapter that way. I don't begrudge you abandoning it at all, as it's not for everyone.

I don't think I've read a single other post (or present) apocalypse style HPFF, and wouldn't actively seek one out either, so I have little to compare it to on that end. Still, I thought it was good enough that someone might be interested in it.

** I'll always remember this fic for Ron Weasley was if nothing else. An all-around excellent fic with some very memorable moments and a solid, original plot.

*** Oh yes I totally agree. I haven't read enough Ron fics to say this is my favorite Ron as well, but it is definitely in the top 5 at the very least.

Harry's memorial tree at the very end got me right in the feels.
