Looking for some really good Remus and Tonks fanfics to read. I don't mind if it's complete or on going.

But preferably looking for Au variations instead of completely canon.

Also if anyone knows of any stories where Teddy turns out to be a werewolf that'd be much appreciated.


** Shifts (and its sequel Shades) by Fernwithy are Remus/Tonks and some of my all time favourite fanfics. They are canon compliant rather than AU but explore things which aren't covered in the books. The basic premise is that in Harry's 5th year Remus is sent by Dumbledore to pose as a teacher at Smeltings and protect Dudley. Tonks is posing as his wife... but gradually the lines of what it pretence and what is reality become blurred, and all the while Sirius is getting more and more cooped up in Grimmauld Place. Writing is v high quality.
