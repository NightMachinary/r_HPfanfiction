The explanations we get about wandlore from books one and seven describe how the wand chooses the wizard it finds itself compatible with. A wand with a knack for transfiguration chooses a wizard with a knack or predilection for transfiguration for example. Wand compatibility also works according to pottermore, based on personality, intent, etc.

When Harry first went to Ollivanders, Ollivander mentioned Harry's parents coming in for their first wands. Which implies that first wands are a somewhat common thing. While breaking or losing a wand can explain this, I'd like to see a fic that goes in the other direction. People change as they grow up and a lot of fics address that with regards to Hogwarts Houses, but I'd like to see a fic where people end up wanting or needing new wands as they go through life and change.

Maybe their first wand still works decently enough, but they got out out of sync with it and another wand would be a better fit. Or they did something horrible or otherwise dramatically against the nature of their wand and it stops working with them entirely. Old wizards might have a collection of wands they have used over their life that they look back in fondly, like snapshots of their personality, goals, and desires throughout their lives.

Are there any fics like this out there? Its not really a major enough plot point to be a prompt but if someone wants to include it in their story I'd gladly read it.


** Stepping Back, linkffn(12317784)

Harry "outgrows" his wand when the horcrux is removed, but everybody believes him to have outgrown it. It is a mechanic. Usually only magically mature or powerful people do this.

â€‹

It's not central to the plot, but it happens, and it's referenced like three times.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

** I think this has to happen in canon, because Charlie got a new wand either straight out of school or during school. Ron's first year was right after Charlie's last year, and I refuse to believe it wasn't in good working condition despite the missing chunk.

** I totally read the title and thought of something very different from what you were actually talking about lol.

My initial thought from just the title was "What would happen if literally all the wands in the world stopped choosing wizards and witches. And probably all current wands stopped working too." I imagine kids would have a lot of power as those who haven't grown accustom to using a wand and thus are less likely to be dependent on using one.
