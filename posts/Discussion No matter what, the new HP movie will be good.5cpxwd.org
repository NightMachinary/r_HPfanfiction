Even if the movie itself sucks ass, I really think it will give a really needed breath of fresh air to the fandom, and that's good, great even for everyone concerned. I really can't wait.


** This is what I felt about Cursed Child. I have learned... definitely not getting my hopes up until the ending credits. :')

*** I feel you, but I also saw someone (on tumblr, I think) say that FB can be better than CC because FB focuses on characters we have no attachment to. Because we're all so familiar with the characters from the books, because we develop our own interpretations and headcanons and ideas about them, anything more JKR gives is highly likely to disappoint. We're too invested in them to take everything she says happily.

On the other hand, almost all of the FB folks are blank slates, people we haven't given such massive amounts of thought to. It's also set in a different country so things can be a little bit different and not bother us quite so much. JKR can go all out and do what she likes with them without it conflicting with or spoiling the version of the character we have in our heads.

**** True enough. We don't have any room for misconception, since we're not familiar with them to begin with. Also, new magical culture! Fanfic writers can expound upon and improve anything these movies screw up.

(I'm sorry, though, Johnny Depp is still not Grindelwald to me. Dumbledore didn't whack wands with Willy Wonka or Captain Jack Sparrow.)

** *This post is speculative but could still potentially spoil the movie for you. Only warning!*

I think I've figured out the ending of the movie, or at least part of it.

One: We know Johnny Depp has a short cameo as Grindelwald in this film.

Two: Colin Farrell's dialogue in the [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vso5o11LuGU][final trailer]] is essentially espousing Grindelwald's philosophy. Initially I thought this meant he was a Grindelwald follower. However...

Three: This review in [[http://nerdist.com/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-is-a-textbook-adventure-review/][Nerdist]] states that there's a twist at the end that is lame:

#+begin_quote
  But most vexing is a certain “reveal” in the climax that earned no gasps but only groans from my audience. You'll know it when you sneer it.
#+end_quote

Four: This review in the [[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-review-jk-rowlings-spect/][Telegraph]] states that Colin Farrell's character has been squandered by something at the end of the film:

#+begin_quote
  Colin Farrell is also huskily captivating as Percival Graves, the wizarding world's chief of secret police -- although having built him into something special, the film underestimates his worth and squanders the character at the last minute, a rare bum note that remains ringing in your ears for hours.
#+end_quote

So, taken together, there's a twist ending that ruins Colin Farrell's character, a character who spends the film promoting Grindelwald's philosophy, and Grindelwald himself has a short appearance.

Conclusion: Colin Farrell's character is Grindelwald in disguise and drops the disguise at the end.

If true, this is somewhat disappointing for me. I really liked the idea of an American senior Auror as working with Grindelwald, and I think Colin Farrell is the perfect choice to play such a character. It's a role that he's played before and he's got it down to a T - the antagonistic but idealistic lawman. Eliminating that character as merely a cover for Grindelwald feels like a waste of such a good character. Especially as I'm not a fan of the Johnny Depp casting.

*** I hope it's wrong, but it makes sense. It would have been so much better to make him a follower, it would have shown just how reaching Grindelwald's philosophy was.

I personally don't mind Johnny Depp. I just have this weird sense that I won't like his haircut... at all.

*** Holding out for a Batfleck scenario, as in Depp being a surprisingly great Grindelwald. I mean, it's Johnny Depp. If we're talking how wizards are supposed to be "off" and quirky, he's got the chops for it, but it's just not what I'm imagining Grindelwald to be. On the other hand, Depp has been agent Sands in Desperado II and was great there, so I'll hold back the lamentations for now.

** Don't Jinx it, OP.

Also, I'm still not sure, but since there's no book version (apart from Fantastic Beasts), then I suppose those 5 movies about the Grindelwald conflict will be canon, at least as far as plot goes, right?

Seriously, screw Cursed Child with a piece of rebar. My sister liked the scriptbook and I'm agonizing over the fact that she's not as into HP as I am and isn't receptive of my well-grounded arguments because "I'm taking it too seriously".

I think I know now what comic book people felt like when I asked if Stark gave Black Panther his armor after seeing Civil War.
