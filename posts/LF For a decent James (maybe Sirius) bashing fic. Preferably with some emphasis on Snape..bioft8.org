*** With the exception of WBWL, basically /any/ such setup would probably have a Snily endgame, unless the fic also has Lily-bashing. It's the natural, obvious, progression of James-bashing when not bashing Snape to me.

EDIT: The most likely alternative to me is Remily, if the fic takes place after their estrangement, and James does something stupid enough to estrange Remus (because he'd never try to do any advancements on Lily while remaining James' friend).

**** Well, the author is critical of all the characters, including Lily. This is why I like it so much lol. She only really bashes the Marauders, and even that is toned down in later chapters.

***** I like that fic, but I don't like the James-bashing in it. I don't think canon James would ever be underhanded enough to exploit the feelings of another innocent girl just to try to provoke Lily into jealousy. And he's /still/ trying to win her, even in current chapters, way beyond the point where he stood any chance. Also, being critical of people isn't the same as bashing. Portraying Snape as being an asshole Potions teacher means being critical to him, but that isn't Snape-bashing -- it's just how he is. Bashing would be to portray characters as worse than how they are in canon.

James is supposed to have grown up in 6th year (why else would he be selected as Head Boy?). Unless it was all an act to get together with Lily, which I doubt. That ploy sits very badly with me, because I once read a fic like this, and it utterly destroyed my feelings on Jily. They haven't recovered since, and since then I'm not able to read a fic with that pairing being the main focus.

linkffn(Veritas Omnia Vincit) for reference.

** Thank you! Your wording leaves out a lot, but it soooo lets me rec this fic to you. Forgive and ignore if you've seen this before.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15208766/chapters/35274458][Masterpiece - Severus]] Silent Severus is the ultimate shiny black box that Sirius and James cannot resist opening. He's too strange. He's too different. He's too powerful. When they plan the worst prank they can imagine, they pay a price for opening Pandora's Box. Snape has to fight his way through kidnapping, abuse, and attempted murder, in order to discover who he is and the purpose behind his powerful magic. Darkness and love battle outside of human understanding. Dumbledore and the staff must turn a blind eye to the hidden battle he is fighting against James Potter, or risk the loss of the wizarding world as they know it.
