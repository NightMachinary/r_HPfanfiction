There's a fic that I really liked. It stopped being updated in 2011. The author said that he has no plans to continue it, and has basically dropped off the face of the earth. How would it be looked upon if I were to rewrite bits of it, give all credit where it's due, and then finish the fic how I saw fit? Would this be crossing a line, or would it be fine? Basically I want to adopt the fic, without the permission of the author. I wouldn't be doing this right away. I've got my own original content to create, buttt, I really want to jump down this rabbithole.


** If you really tried every avenue to contact the author you know of, then I'd say go for it. Give credit where credit is due, link the original fic and be sure to check if the author wants you to take it down from time to time. Who knows.

I think its just common courtesy - the least amount of respect you ought to have for someone else's work. If they don't like you borrowing from it, you /can/ refuse to comply, but a modicum of respect would be enough for anyone to respect such a demand.

If it makes you feel better, as long as you make it clear what isn't your work then it isn't plagiarism. And that's what she got in trouble for.

Copyright is another issue, but since Harry Potter is itself copyrighted, I can't see anyone getting annoyed as long as you've cited what you didn't make up.

Crediting something does not mean it is not violating a copyright. Given that it's fanfiction no one is going to put the time and effort needed to actually like bring legal action against you. Copyright infringement and Plagiarism are two different things entirely.

The only way, technically speaking, to avoid copyright violation is to get permission for usage. However, given that fanfiction isn't copyrighted it's kind of a moot point in that regard. Just out in the real world, as it were, they're two distinctly different things.

As a whole 'adopting' things without permission is, in my opinion, in bad taste.

****** Because I find it inherently lazy. And lazy imitation does not strike me as flattery, it strikes me as trying to garner acclaim off of someone's work. It strikes me as doing the barest of minimums.

The writer in me finds it on part with people who ask me to write their ideas, or post here saying 'oh i have great ideas I just can't write!' You're not doing yourself any service by taking from someone else. So the purist in me reacts with 'write your own damn fic and try to make it better than mine, don't just go for the easy way out and try to finish something already partially done'.

Now, I'm kind of an arrogant prick. Fanfiction wise I've written five completed fics totaling just under a million words and have written millions more across other realms. Every person who has asked me if they can 'pick up' one of my works has had no published works on their own profiles. Often, the people who are asking for something like this have absolutely no idea what it takes to write a story. And starting at a halfway point is just a disservice to them.

As a writer I can't imagine even wanting to do this. I can't imagine not wanting something to be completely mine while throwing my name behind it. Do I think I could write a fantastic ending for Grow Young With Me? Yes, easily. Do I think I should? Hell no, it's not mine. So when someone comes to me enthusiastic about something like this it instantly raises a red flag to me that they probably aren't serious about it. And given that I'm a little bit insane when it comes to planning and plotting a story (I have over 200 hand written pages for Tenebrae Vincunt, which has 1 9000 word chapter and will never have more) knowing that it's extremely unlikely that anyone else will put that much effort into my baby. And then, knowing that my name is going to be somehow associated with their work makes me cringe.

And then there's the simple fact that it's fanfiction. And that there is no real reason for them to just not write a similar story to whatever was abandoned, say it was inspired by the work of whomever it was, and then continue it however they want. Not doing that, to me, simply shows they aren't interested in putting forth the effort needed to write a story.

Not to really harp on OP as I know nothing at all about him/her. But this entire topic is completely irrelevant if he simply does that rather than worrying about some circlejerk about maybe maybe not plagiarism. Again, he's opening up the door simply by just not wanting to put forth the effort to write his version of what someone else has done. Whereas I would say the better course of action is to just rewrite everything and make it your own.

But it isn't a meaningless gesture or just a circlejerk. As long as their concern about this is genuine (and I'd give them the benefit of the doubt that they are) it shows that they aren't interested in just trampling over someone else's creation.

I can't overstate enough how much it blows my mind that a fanfic author is saying stuff like this. You have 10 stories on ff.net and all of them are derivative of someone else's work. Why didn't you just rewrite everything and *made it your own*? What you're taking from Rowling is much more substantial than any fanfic could ever be and her work isn't even unfinished (which arguably makes it worse).

******** Don't ask for someone's opinion if you're only purpose is to formulate an argument about it. I've already said in many other threads that I have a complicated opinion on the etiquette of fanfiction. I've also never called my fanfiction an artistic achievement and am on record of disliking most of it. But you immediately went with the 'you can't be morally correct because you write fanfiction' when I'm not even talking about the moral aspect of it but rather the physical aspect of it.

But you ignore that I literally say that I don't care if he writes a fanfic of a fanfic but my qualm comes with using specific portions of text written by someone else. Because that is plagiarism and I find plagiarism to be morally wrong and plagiarism leaves a very bad taste in my mouth.

There's a reason why in my first post I say copyright infringement and plagiarism are two different things. One is illegal. The other is not.

So you ask for my opinion about an incredibly complicated issue and then simply insult it and say I lack self awareness yet you can't differentiate between a derivative work and plagiarism?

I do think you are taking my usage of 'own' a little too literally when I mean it on more of a meta level, I guess. I write because I love to write. Writing Letters quite literally saved my life. Ironically part of my hatred for it now is because it reminds me of the twenty year old who thought taking a knife to his wrists was a good idea. And that I can't think of that story without remembering how that felt. And that since that same idiot put it on the internet, even if I wanted to delete it it would still be out there, I'd still get messages about it, and I'd still be reminded almost daily about that lovely December day in Chicago seven and a half years ago. But that's a digression that needs to go no further.

My usage of 'making it your own' is less about ownership and more about accomplishment. At the end of the day my fanfictions are all mine in the sense that I thought of their plots, I planned them, I wrote them and I edited them. They each take about 800-1000 man hours of work and effort on my part and when they're done everything I like about them I like because I did it, and everything I hate about them I can only blame myself for. The advice I've given people in the same situation of the OP to 'make it their own' is intended to be more of a 'do the work yourself, you'll be more proud of it that way' notion than anything else.

But I have a pretty unique experience set in that I've done a great deal of professional ghost writing. And I know that I dislike things where I didn't do all of the work on it a lot more than things where I did. And I know that I'm considerably less proud of works where I've had to continue off things other people have done than things that I did. And that working on those has always left a sour taste in my mouth. So the thought of doing it, even in fanfiction, leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Only OP would know if he/she would feel the same way.

If that's still not self-aware enough, well, I guess I'm okay with that. But your logic to me comes down to more 'fanfiction is already derivative do whatever you want with anything anyone has ever done'. You immediately went the more moral direction with it. I may not have been clear enough in my reasoning but it's far less about the morality behind it than it is about doing the work yourself. I feel like at the end of the day whoever adopted a story would look back on the parts they didn't do and regret that they didn't do it. And in fanfiction you're allowed to be completely derivative of someone elses's work so why not do so so you can write the whole thing?

I can only relate back to myself, but I started writing fanfiction because I needed an excuse to write. I wanted to improve my writing and I would say it has probably been successful. I don't think anyone would read the first chapter of Letters and the last chapter of Limpieza De Sangre and say Letters was better written, technically speaking. So I make the incorrect assumption that all fanfiction writers want to better their writing. My advice then, is write the whole thing. And that means I think people shouldn't adopt stories, because I think that's less likely to help them improve their writing. To me, using someone's work like that is sort of like making them exercise or eat for you. You're not going to get the same level of nourishment if you don't do it yourself.

#+end_quote

Does that mean you regret your work in fanfiction? I still don't see the distinction. Lets take a concrete example: Your story "The Pureblood Princess" on ff.net builds entirely on the first five books written by Rowling. You didn't write any of that. You didn't do any of the work yourself. You didn't think of the plot-lines (poor little Wizard orphan Harry discovers magical world, has to fight an evil Dark Lord, etc. pp.), you didn't plan them out, you didn't write them and it took no effort on your part to simply take her ideas and build upon them. You're just taking the beginning of a story and continuing it how you see fit. And what's worse you have the gall to be upset about people who want to do the same to your stories. How is that not the height of hypocrisy?

#+begin_quote
  And I know that I'm considerably less proud of works where I've had to continue off things other people have done than things that I did.
#+end_quote

Again, this seems to apply to all of your work in fanfiction.

Also you're just projecting your own feelings. I doubt most FF authors feel the same or they would write exlusively original fiction instead of continuing off things other people have done. For some reason you only appear to express those feelings when someone else continues off your (or other FF authors) work, but not when you continue off of Rowling's work.

Please explain to me in simple terms: What is the distinction? Is it just the fact that you think of yourself as a good writer and those others are poor writers (because who would be so lazy and stupid to just take another person's story and continue from it)? I'm not trying to twist words, I just don't see how any of what you laid out here doesn't apply 1:1 to what you did to Rowling's writing. The only obvious difference being that Rowlings novels aren't fanfiction. Is it more reputable to take someone else's work if they are published? Maybe. Not sure how that relates to "learning how to write" and "putting in work". Both approaches (continuing off Rowling's work and continuing off another Fanfiction) seem to be equally applicable for those purposes. Is it a matter of scale? Do you think there's less substance to a adoption/continuation of a fanfiction? Does that mean you also consider short stories and one-shot fanfictions to be lazy?

It all sounds like a very weird kind of gatekeeping to me.

********** What confuses me about this bit of the thread is the obvious point you already made, Deathcrow: fanfiction is already definitionally derivative. I mean, that much is in the term itself.

We even have terms to indicate how similar or different a work is from canon ("AU", "canon rehash", etc.) and even tropes that develop into fanon, which ends up birthing even further derivative works based on that because people like the idea.

I've not personally wanted to continue a dead fic for someone, but there is no real difference in inherent artistic merit in being n-th level derivative and n+1. The best one could argue is that doing so let's you be "lazier" since you didn't build up the prior stuff yourself... ok.

Yeah I considered this, but IMHO this only applies if you do an entire rewrite of the HP novels (without using any of Rowling's plot ideas, which kinda defeats the purpose). If you continue an abandoned second year fanfiction there's less "prior stuff" (1 Book Rowling+FF-author) than when you do a post-Hogwarts story (7 Books Rowling). Does that mean the former is less lazy? Maybe? Maybe not?

Wouldn't it depend on how many original ideas are put into it? As you mentioned there are different categories, like canon rehashes, etc. But if both of those continuations put in the same amount of effort, the fanfiction continuation should be less lazy no, since it has less "given" to work off? The whole notion of this just sounds silly...

********** Perhaps I'm not being clear enough with my points. My opinion as expressed above has to do entirely with plagiarism and not derivative works. You are getting dangerously close to the 'all work is derivative of something else' argument which does have a great deal of truth to it. But that's not where I want to go.

The 'story adoption' that I've seen involves direct plagiarism. I've even had people ask me to send them copies of my work so they could 'adopt it' and post it under their name. So when I see 'adoption' direct plagiarism comes to mind. And it is my opinion that plagiarism is the absolute laziest form of writing. So yes, I do find plagiarists to be lazy and find copying to be the lowest form of writing.

The distinction to me is put simplest as 'derivative work = peachy, plagiarism = bad'. Taking the direct copy of someone's work, regardless of permission, is still plagiarism. I've said my advice to OP would be to just not directly use the other author's work. Your examples try to apply my opinion on a plagiarized work to a derivative work, which I consider to be something completely different.

If you published the first three chapters of Limpieza de Sangre and then branched off into your own story, I would find it distasteful. If you were tow rite a story about a female Voldemort introduced to Harry Potter in the graveyard after the fourth task, I wish you the best of luck. It comes down to I don't like the direct usage and application of someone's work by another person. Is it hypocritical? I don't think so, at least no more so than being rude and then retorting about another's rudeness when called on it. You have every right to disagree.

Ironically, I'm guilty of it as is. I used direct passages from Goblet of Fire in Chapter...seven? of Letters. Does it matter that it was done out of love because I didn't think I could possibly write that short scene better than Rowling? No. Not really. It was still one of the laziest things I've ever done in my writing. And if I were to do it over, I would not make the same decision. Hindsight being 20/20 and what not.

I'd probably even advise the OP if it was something he wanted to do to simply say in the summary 'this work is a continuation of X by Y, please read that to have a better understand of this' and just not use any of Y's writing in his own. I don't care about continuing off of another fanfiction. I dislike the notion of using direct chunks of another author's work.

As for do I regret my work in fanfiction? Every. Single. Day. But that's an entirely different conversation. I will say I do believe my fanfiction is approaching it's use by date. So there's that.

As for it belonging to Rowling. It does not. Fanfiction/fan art 'belongs' to the artist until it violates commercial copyright. At that point, if Rowling so chose, she could either appropriate or destroy it. If she wanted to appropriate it, I could still decide to destroy it myself. Given that there's a bijillion copies on the internet this isn't a feasible solution. But fanworks are the 'property' of the creator until they aren't. Ironically, given that parody is protected, the objectively worse or intentionally bad it is, the easier it would be to call it a parody and retain it as fair use. But this is a slippery complicated legal slope filled with all sorts of potholes. Like, technically, if fanwork is the property of the original creator, The creator just does not have the commercial rights to it and as such can't do anything with it.

But anyway, if you don't see a difference between a plagiarized work and a derivative work in the same manner that I do, then we'll never agree. My opinion here and in the above posts was intended to deal directly more with plagiarism as I felt the OPs post came off a bit as saying 'should I plagiarize a story because it's old, I don't want to be a plagiarism scandal oh and I didn't get permission'. So my points were based around that.

Regardless, thanks for your time and have a pleasant evening if you're in a similar time zone to myself or day if you are not.

That's a bit of an obfuscation. We are not talking about vague kind of "Rowling is standing on the shoulders of giants" kind of "derivative". There's a very clear a->b correlation when it comes to fanfiction and I don't see much of a difference between writing a fanfiction off a fanfiction or writing a fanfiction off Rowling's books.

  The 'story adoption' that I've seen involves direct plagiarism.
#+end_quote

How could they? All story adoptions I've seen always make the origins of their story very clear. That's not plagiarism. I have the sneaking suspicion that your definition of plagiarism is wrong.

Plagiarism = taking credit for someone else's work without attribution.

This whole argument seems like a shifting of the goalposts to me, but I made a mistake by not addressing the plagiarism stuff earlier. I just didn't understand what you were going on about. When I was comparing "adoption of fanfiction" to "fanfiction" I was obviously working under the impression that we hold it to the same standards and it is done in the same way as fanfiction: Giving credit where credit is due and starting from the branching off point without posting another's work as your own. Of course it is lazy and bad taste to present someone else's work as your own, but the same holds true for someone who lifts parts from the books in their ff.net without marking them as quotes (and even then it's... iffy). It's not usual to post the preceeding chapters of OotP, even if your story starts right in the middle of that book, so why would it be acceptable for an adoption? [in any case that would just be a copyright violation and probably not plagiarism, more on that further below]

#+begin_quote

Sneaking suspicion intensifies.

#+begin_quote

Which is what I'd expect anyone who wants to adopt a story to do. Of course plagiarism is bad. Were you really under the impression that I was defending plagiarism?

To make things clear. There should always be clear attribution to the original creator(s). In the best case the original work should be referenced through a link. If however the adopted story is no longer available online it is still not plagiarism to post the original chapters as a reference (if they are clearly marked as a verbatim quote/reference). In the humanities it is quite common to quote large portions of other's work as long verbatim quotes: Not plagiarism.

If at some point the Harry Potter books weren't commercially available anymore I wouldn't consider it wrong to make digital copies available hand in hand with a fanfiction and wouldn't consider that to be plagiarism either (obviously that's never going to happen, just a thought experiment).

#+begin_quote
  But anyway, if you don't see a difference between a plagiarized work and a derivative work in the same manner that I do, then we'll never agree
#+end_quote

Of course I see a difference, but you seem to conflate plagiarism with copyright. I recommend Wikipedia to clear up any confusion: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism]]

The difference lies between a purely moral and a legal+moral (ethics depending on what exact kind of copyright violation takes place, commercial vs non-commercial, etc) issue.

For example ff2ebook currently has a complete version of your story in their archive:

[[http://www.ff2ebook.com/archive.php?search=the+pureblood+princess]]

Clearly this isn't plagiarism. It might be a copyright issue, because you or FF.net (not sure who would be responsible here) hasn't given them the right to republish your work, but the attribution and source make it clear that they are not taking credit for the work.

Yes. Yes, it is. Why am I only allowed to write some kind of vague offshoot with a female Voldemort?

If I wanted to write my own version of the 4th chapter of your story I'd have as much or as little right to use your exact story with your exact female Voldemort and your exact plot-details as a branching off point as you have to use Harry, Hermione, Ron and their plot details. Asking you for permission would be more courtesy than you have offered JKR. If I for some reason decided to also republish your first three chapters it would be a scummy move (since they are still available at the original source) and potentially a copyright issue (you'd probably have a hard time suing me in court since you don't own Harry Potter and Rowling and her laywers would become quite upset with you). It still wouldn't be plagiarism as long as I didn't claim them to be my own creation.

I find it disturbing that you hold your own writing (as your "babies", which I can certainly understand) in such high regard and are so protective of them, but don't have a problem with perverting Rowling's babies in any way you want. I wonder how Rowling would feel about taking Voldemort and turning him into a girl?

Don't misunderstand: I'm playing devil's advocate here.

Now you're just splitting hairs. Obviously I wasn't expecting you to physically try to restrain/stop someone from doing so. But the fact that you dislike something, finding it to be lazy and distasteful, which you are doing yourself (without remorse) underlines your hypocrisy.

  You are getting dangerously close to the 'all work is derivative of something else' argument
#+end_quote

That's not it (if one goes to that point, the argument becomes trivial). What I'm saying is that fanfiction is literally, definitionally, necessarily derivative of something else. What is the subreddit for? Fanfiction /of/ the Harry Potter series. So to me, when you said this and other similar statements:

#+begin_quote
  You're not doing yourself any service by taking from someone else. So the purist in me reacts with 'write your own damn fic and try to make it better than mine, don't just go for the easy way out and try to finish something already partially done'.
#+end_quote

It just seems ridiculous because it can only be done if you rewrite the entire series. Which of course is done by many people. But even then, they often use concepts lifted whole cloth from canon. You direct your ire at people lifting portions of text from the adopted story which is all fine and dandy, but that just seems irrelevant since OP seemed concerned with writing an ending to it, not copying and pasting everything and slapping their name on it. (Unless I misunderstood).

That's what OP says. To me 'rewriting bits of it' means 'leaving most of it as is' which to me means leaving large chunks of text that is unoriginal to him in a story posted under his name. Which is where I get the aforementioned bad taste. I've never actually said 'don't do this' just said I find it distasteful and that I personally wouldn't because of my opinion on plagiarism.

** You could argue that technically continuing an abandoned fic doesn't violate FF.net's plagiarism TOS. But you'd be walking a fine line and I suspect that, should the original author report it for plagiarism, even if you gave full credit where credit is due, your story would still be taken down.

So with that in mind I'd advise against writing a continuation of whatever story you're thinking about and just take the idea of the story and create your own story.

** fanfanfic writers have the EXACT same obligations to fanfic as fanfic writers have to source work. that means you have to say what your deriving from, what you dont have to do is ask permission.

also like fanfic writers to source work if they say you cant make derivative work you ignore them and do it anyway, if JK told you to stop you wouldn't right? no reason to let some any other author stop you.

of course legally speaking they might be able to sue you but it would be morally wrong for them to do so (just as JK could sue us all but it would be wrong)

Judge: Mr. Doe, please explain to me in your own words why we are here today!

Judge: Huh, I was under the impression that Mrs. Rowling owns Harry Potter?

FF-author: *heavy breathing intensifies* Well, yeah, technically I guess, but I own my original plot ideas!

Judge: Okay then. Would you be so kind to elaborate on the details of your so called "original plot"?

FF-author: Sure, no problem. So, Harry Potter...

Judge: Sorry to intercede so early, but I think we already established Harry Potter isn't your original idea

FF-author: Yes, yes, please let me finish, sir. So, Harry Potter goes to this Magic school called Hogwarts, but he is in House Slytherin instead of House Gryffindor!

Judge: Ah, I see, so you came up with this school and the different Houses and all that?

FF-author: *nervous laugh* N...n..no, that's from the original books. But you see in my story it turns out that Snape, the Potions Professor at the school is evil and he cast an evil magical spell, the Imperius on one of the students.

Judge: I have the sneaking suspicion you didin't invent this Snape character or the so called Imperius spell either?

FF-author: Not really, but in the original story Snape isn't a bad guy.

** This is always a tricky topic and is brought up every few months on [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] .

I would say make a real, genuine effort to reach out to the original writer. From there, it just depends on your own personal beliefs/fanfiction etiquette.

Personally, I would never pick up another writer's work where they left off. I wouldn't want someone doing that to one of my WIPs, so I just don't even bother thinking about it. I may ask if I can do a one shot or something like that inspired by their work, which I usually get permission for- as long as I clearly credit and link back to them. If I don't get a response I just don't do it.

There's a really delicate balance amongst writers of fanfiction, since we technically are already writing something based on someone else's work (as you may have seen from some of the other posts). It just depends on what you personally feel is best in this situation.

If you do end up going ahead with it, be sure to credit the heck out of it, with lots of links back to the original. Just be very open, honest, and humble about it. And save any emails or take screenshots of messages sent to the original writer so you can show you did indeed attempt to reach out to them incase anyone asks. If you post to FFN, I would also recommend reading through the rules to make sure you don't get reported. I know they're a bit more strict than say AO3.
