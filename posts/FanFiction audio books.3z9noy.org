I have this idea to record myself reading select Harry Potter FanFiction, since I know I for one would enjoy this as a convenience.

What do you guys think?

The stories could be voted on or picked by me, but I'll only accept the highest quality- and definitely no slash or anything like that.

I know there are apps which perform the basic text-to-speech function (and I have tried them) but they feel completely synthetic and disrupt the story with mispronunciations and stilted, monotone voice.

Thoughts?

*Edit:* I can't believe I actually have to make this edit, but goes to show what I know.

Two things:

1) I do not expect money. There are better ways of making money. Anything I do will never be sold, or anything along those lines. However, I see nothing wrong with accepting donations. Donations are not payment for services, and are completely untouchable by the big bad lawyers everyone here seems to be deathly afraid of.

No, Warner Bros and Rowling isn't going to "ruin FanFiction" for everyone because some guy who made a FanFiction audio book for a couple dozen people accepted $5 in donations.

Reality, folks.

2) No slash. I don't have anything against people who enjoy this, and the material in question. I am sure there are great fics that incorporate this, and are still a good read. However, *this is not for me*. This is my preference, and I am sure you would not want to spend the free time you have for your hobby doing something that is unpleasant to you. Don't hold a double standard, please.


** If you want to do it, go for it. I'd recommend asking permission from the authors, obviously. Also don't expect compensation at all.

*** Of course, asking permission is a given- although I'm sure no on will mind.

As for compensation, I haven't really thought about that, but obviously I wouldn't be making much, if any money off of this. Doing something like this for money would not only be questionable legaly, but defeats the spirit of FanFiction.

That being said, if this does kick off and becomes a large enough endeavor- I don't think it would be would be wrong of me to create a patreon if anyone wants to donate. An audio book version of any story would sound loads better on an actual microphone, for example.

**** I object vehemently to any money making, patreon and donations included. Not only is the secondary market of dubious legality--even though JKR has given implicit permission, the other IP owners could take authors to court--but now you want to get paid for tertiary works? That's a good way to get the whole thing shut down permanently.

Not only would you be gaining revenue for use of JKR's primary work, something which is illegal according to Copyright Law, but you'd also be doing the same off the fanfiction author's work, which is also illegal. I highly doubt any authors are going to be willing to allow you to use their works for money, especially not those who have published original works, such as Jim Bernheimer and Joe Ducie.

Even if you're just covering investment in better equipment and not your time, it's still generating revenue off their works. That is against the law, the tacit agreements between JKR and fanfic authors, and every bit of common sense and decency. If you want to make audiobooks for money, go get a job doing that for original works.

edit: I really hope [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3z3h9w/make_money_off_of_fanficiton_writing/][this]] isn't you. Either way, I'm sick and tired of people trying their best to ruin this amazing thing we've had for the last 17 years.

***** Just: ditto. And to the OP - don't f*ck up the fandom for us pretty please and don't get yourself in trouble with the law. Many people do have audiobook versions of their fanfics - for free only though without any kind of voluntary payments involved whatsoever. The only way I could see you make money is making your own website, getting something like google adsense and distributing your audiofiles for free there - might be a grey area. But dont take my word for it - better not do anything stupid. Cheers!

***** I have to beg to differ there, then. If I was to set up something like a patreon, it would be on a donation-basis only. Not only do I doubt I would get any money at all, but anything I would get would go straight to resources to make it better for the fans, which is what they would donate for.

I get what you are saying, and it's ridiculous to see people on patreon who have it set up as "100 for every 3k chapter" or some such rubbish.

Perhaps I wasn't clear, but no content would be exclusive or made for the express purpose of profiting from. FanFiction is already niche enough, and this would be a niche of a niche.

This just isn't a feasible way to make money, regardless of how you look at it. If I wanted to make quick bucks, I wouldn't set up a system where I spend hours recording and writing for /maybe/ a couple bucks (literally) down the road. I work as a freelancer in several feilds- trust me, there are better things I could be doing for the money.

That being out of the way, I very much doubt that I am hurting anyone if I actually do manage to make someone's day enough for them to donate. Rowling is filthy rich, and companies like Warner are huge. I am not selling their work- nor would I be making a derivative of their work for money. I am not hurting anyone's profit margins by having an open donation policy for this very niche section.

I suppose we can agree to disagree.

edit- and yeah, that isn't me.

****** Their net worth means absolutely nothing. What matters is the law, and several copyright cases (and similar patent cases for that matter) have been decided by what essentially comes down to "defend it or lose it". If they don't defend their rights as copyright holders, then they could potentially lose that copyright.

Again, what we have now is an uneasy truce. With Harry Potter IP coming back into mainstream media with the new movie, there's a chance they could again go through looking for things they don't like and shutting them down. They have enough time and money to come up with a precedent setting lawsuit against patreon/donation funded works that edge or outright violate the law.

I'm not concerned with how much you might have to shell out for a lawyer, I'm concerned that they might take it so far as to revoke their permission to publish fanfiction, and that they might win in court over it.

And agree to disagree? No, you and that other guy and several others are coming into our hobby and doing your best to fuck it up for us. I've already lost a significant portion of my ability to play around with quadcopters this year due to ignorant assholes breaking very clear laws, I really don't want to lose another hobby.

******* There's no law against donations. Furthermore, nothing will happen to you or anyone else. You completely missed everything I wrote.

As for being in this community, wanting to 'come in and fuck this up for you', please. I've been part of this community for the better part of a decade. Get off of your high horse- you have no ground to stand on with your arguments, and you can't claim to speak for everyone here.

Honestly, it is like a child who discovered the existence of lawyers, and now sees lawsuits and violations everywhere.

The law, let me remind you, exists for our protection. That is the only purpose government and law serves. Please tell me who I am harming by accepting donations- NOT CONTINGENT ON CONTENT. Even if there was a law against donations.... Which there isn't, then this is well within the spirit of the law.

And regardless, it would be my problem of there were legal repercussions, which I greatly doubt. No one is going to spend thousands of dollars and hours of time filing and going through with a lawsuit against someone online accepting donations from the couple dozen people who read, listen, and enjoy. The most I would get is a cease and desist order.

In short, this is none of your business. As the English would say, you can bloody sod off.

Edit- and the idea that Rowling's and Warner's copyright would be in danger, or that they would feel threatened by my 100 person audience and the $5 I might get for hours of work is laughable. Do you even realize what you are saying?

** If you haven't run across it yet, let me point you toward [[http://www.audiofic.jinjurly.com/][The Audiofic Archive]], a project that originated on LiveJournal and has grown since then into an entire subculture of amateur podfic readers and listeners.

Based on the history of that community, I'd emphasize that you /always/ need to ask permission of the authors - and don't expect everyone to agree. Lots of fic writers cringe at the idea of their work being read aloud and recorded in a way that's outside their control, especially by people with no prior experience and often very little skill.

And under no circumstances should you go into this expecting payback. People do this for love, not for money. Don't even expect comments - podfics probably get the lowest rate of return of any fanworks out there, and many, many fans dislike them and plug their ears in secondhand embarrassment.

I don't want to discourage you, because it can actually be a blast to dip into the whole recording process and interpretation of a fic. Some people get very creative with music and sound effects and emotional inflection. But you're not the first to come up with this idea, and fandom hasn't been 100% welcoming to it.

I've recorded a couple of podfics myself, and it was incredibly time-consuming and very hard to produce something I'd consider a tribute to the original story, not an insult. Also, you might want to check your voice quality on playback, because sometimes speech patterns, vocal timbre, and other qualities make recorded voices unpleasant to listen to - too monotone or sing-songy or nasal or whatever.

In other words, do this for fun and for yourself, not because you hope for back pats from the community. Many people /do/ like listening to podfics, and (although opinions on this differ) it /is/ a creative outlet, the sort that fandom exists to inspire.

**** Um, I wasn't talking about the quality of the fic. The issues fandom has with recorded fic usually lie with the absence of any talent for acting or interpretation on the podficcer's part. You'll get rated on the quality of your performance, basically, wholly apart from the merits of the fic, which exists separately from any audio version of it.

So the fic may be "the highest quality" by your standards, but how you read it is the basis on which the podfic will be judged. If you're a crappy reader, it won't matter how good the story is.

** Well, getting monetary return on your time will be almost impossible. Youtube will be impossible for you, since most good authors will hate you for profiting from their work and put copyright infringement notes up for everything you upload. Most great authors reside in the DLP forum and if you have ever seen the hate for less wrong over there, then you can be absolutely sure that they will band together and do whatever they can to stop you from using their fics. If you want to make some pocket money, do other youtube stuff instead. I've heard prank videos are all the rave right now.

I only mentioned in response that I would accept donations if, for some reason, someone wanted to do such a thing for me.

It was actually quite amusing to see the guy that brought it up miss the point so beautifully, and it is this: if I wanted to make money, there are far, far better alternatives than this. Furthermore, some here don't know the difference between a donation, and payment for services. I have to admit I chuckled when it was said that me accepting donations would have lawyers hounding me, and FanFiction brought down.

Anyway, this isn't for money, and frankly after recording myself reading and listening I'm not sure I've got the voice for it. I'm not high pitched or anything, but it's definitely not the Morgan Freeman-esque voice that people would love to listen to.

I don't have a problem with your reading preferences, not that my opinion means anything because obviously I have no idea what your preferences are, and that's fine. Re: "superiority contests," I'm not talking about slash, I'm talking about "only the best," because I've never run across a podficcer who uses that criterion.

At this point, I can't quite figure out why you want to record fics, because you haven't said a single thing about how much you love various works or authors, or about showing your appreciation through the act of podficcing. Which is the motivation I'm used to seeing.

Who gets to decide what "the best" is, anyway? How do you judge that? If you want to get embroiled in that can of worms, go for it. It just seems weird for an amateur narrator who hasn't given any proof of skill in the recording arena to talk about only "the best" writing being worth your attention. You're a hobbyist in a community of hobbyists, talking to people with a whole spectrum of tastes. Why not just say, "There are a bunch of great fics I'm itching to record so people will have a chance to hear them." Even in a relatively homogeneous community such as this, assuming we all agree on the "best" fics is ludicrous.

If it's not for money, then stop talking about taking money. You're not going to get much anyway, and you already know that. But you're scoffing at the points about IP and copyright violations that other people are making, and that really does make you sound self-centered.

******** Yes, I scoff at their points, because idiocy deserves to be ridiculed. Something that Reddit as a whole overwhelmingly agrees with me.

Ironically, it's the slash/IP crowd that went on a downvote brigade. Whatever.

As for me wanting to only cover the best, of course it's my bloody opinion on what that is. I am sure you would want to devote your time to only those fics you thought were exceptionally good, e.g. the best. I don't see where you have a problem here. Nobody, including me, wants to hear someone read a 300 word shoddily-written love poem about Harry x Dobby.

As for talking about money, I didn't say a word about it. It was not me who brought this up. Do not tell me that if you were in my position and someone A) accused you of having ulterior financial motives (ludicrous, given the medium) and B) pretended like they talk for all of fanfictiom and are a legal authority.... Don't tell me you would ignore it. Because it is bullshit.

I don't see what your point is, and it seems to me you are simply jumping on the bandwagon here. In fact, half the comments have been derailed by your needlessly "concerned" crowd now, for the sake of being contrarian and under the guise of Fanfiction's greater interests, or gender equality, or some such rubbish.

Edit- as for my motivation, it certainly isn't fueled by a desire to get a couple bucks in donations. I have a job, you know, and I would be better served working overtime. One of the best fics I want to read, and what got me thinmjng about this was Emperor, by Marqis Black. I must have read it 4 times by now. That is the sort of story I consider to be the best.

The community does, contrary to your opinion, agree on what is best- or at the very least what makes up a great story. Vital elements such as good prose, a genuine dialogue, a rich plot, and adequate length are qualities admired by everyone.

Yeah, I doubt JKR or WB would even be aware of your existence (that's not an insult, btw), so you, personally, would be safe. And JKR is on record as tolerating fanfic. But the border between fair use and fanworks-for-profit is contentious and unclear and potentially bad news for fandom if creators get nervous about content trespass.

I don't think anyone here was pretending to talk for all of fandom or even for this subreddit. We all shoot off our mouths (or keyboards) on our own behalf.

Okay, now /this/ makes sense to me. If you'd just said this, I wouldn't have been so skeptical. Because all that "best" stuff just comes across as boasting. Seriously, nobody sits down and announces, "I think I'll spend a bunch of my time recording some truly awful fanfic" - unless it's for laughs, I guess. But saying "here's this fic I hope to make an audio version of because it's bloody fantastic" - well, that might have perked up a few ears and stirred up interest and support.

This community? Yeah, could be. Regarding certain fics, perhaps, although the favorites threads can be a mixed bag. All of fandom? Eh, I doubt it. Frankly, I couldn't get past 2K words of Emperor myself. I had no idea who this character was but it clearly wasn't Harry, the daughter's character didn't grab me, and so on and so forth. Not that it was bad, but it wasn't my cuppa, and it would never make a "best of" list for me.

But that has no bearing on /your/ pleasure in it or your opinion of it. The only reason I'd think twice about saying "Do it" is because the fic is really bloody huge. It took me two weeks to get a half-decent mp3 of an 8,000-word fic, and Emperor is over 600,000 words long. Good lord. That would be quite a tribute.

That's what I said. Read what you and others in that thread wrote, and the perfectly reasonable comments you downvoted. Gender equality was the best phrase I could think of when confronted with "why won't he do my slash?!" crap.

As for Emperor, the first chapter was a flash-forward, after all said and done. Of course it wouldn't be canon Harry Potter (not that it was to begin with). How could it be?

And while it may not be your cup of tea, it is undeniable that Emperor is a /good/ story, even a great story. I cetainly think so, regardless of the AU. Perhaos because of the AU. And, if you gave it a chance past the first chapter, you might agree with me.

The novelty is in seeing a Harry Potter that isn't cannon, and in fact is far removed from anything I've seen so far. The grandiose plans and humble begginings, the vivid combat scenes and life-like characters are what makes the story.

My point is, you might not be a fan, but one can't deny that this is indeed one of the best fics out there. Mind you, this isn't as high praise as you might think given the general gutter-trash nature of FanFiction in general.

Do I need to link you to a couple of examples of the god-awful writing inwas talking about? It won't be hard. Ff.net is packed with that garbage.

If it makes you feel any better, crappy Harr/Ginny or whatever goddamn pairing you pick can be awful as well. Yet you can't deny that there is an obscene amount of terrible slash which is terrible, moreso than any other category.

Way to pull out the homophobe card. Again.

Just when I thought we were having a civil discussion, you regressed to petty name calling.

I'm done here. Happy New years.

******* I don't actually think you're being homophobic, dude, you're being a bit melodramatic. It was just awkward phrasing, and like other posters I was just a bit confused about you going on about 'best quality'. I do think if you're not doing this for money you need to stop defending the concept though. If that's not the motivating factor, then surely it doesn't matter what others think either way.

Best of luck with your project, I hope you have fun with it.
