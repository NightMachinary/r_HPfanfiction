Preferably something with no romance, but if the story is good enough, I'm open to it.

Currently, the only good crossover I've found is "Whatever it Takes" by scribblindown on FFnet.


** I hadn't even thought of that. Consider me curious...

*** There's so much room for fun plots in this kind of crossover, so it's kind of shocking to me that there's not more than 31 of them.

**** Since crossovers are scarcer than regular stories, and with a fandom like MHA, where there are so many ideas but also so many characters to love and write about, it can discourage writers, same for Assassination Classroom I think. Just wish there were more stories that aren't shipfic in those fandoms.

Normally I would shamelessly self-plug here, haha, but since my story is still short compared to Whatever It Takes, and you've probably checked out all stories in that section and only found 1 good, meant that you've found my story not up to your standard. That's too bad. I hope we see more from this section in the future.

***** Go ahead and self-plug, anyway.

I'd be happy to read and give feedback.

****** Here you go then. I hope it's not too bad, and thanks in advance :D.

  The final raid against Lord Voldemort went haywire, and Harry woke up to find himself in an unfamiliar city, with the shadow of the prophecy still hanging over his head. To make it worse, the more he tried to dig for information, the more he was confused by the existence of Heroes, Villains, and Quirks. It just didn't make any sense.

******* I got about halfway through the first chapter and I'm already hooked. Don't sell yourself short, this is a fun fic.

******* I actually remember reading this, and the biggest appeal for me is the presence of Voldemort in this story in addition to Harry Potter. I had some issues with the pacing and logic used, but I did follow the story. I left a more in-depths review on the specific issues that I personally had.

Overall, though, this is definitely one of the better HP x MHA crossovers, so be proud and keep up the good work.

** I made a thread about this once while drunk.

"That's because I didn't put my wand into it that time"

I wonder if I realized the innuendo at the time?
