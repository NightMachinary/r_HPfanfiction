In defence of those stories, they usually write a more unstable Snape who is in the habit of using Legilimency on students regularly. If that is the case, and Snape has a /habit/ of reading students' minds in a story, then it makes sense that he'd resort to Legilimency as a first effort.

Its not great, but it kinda sorta fits.

** Bashers will bash. No rhyme or reason to it. Though you would think if you wanted to make Snape look bad you could use the many many canon examples instead of random attacks on the mind. Also, I am pretty sure all confirmed examples of mind reading have been very obvious.
