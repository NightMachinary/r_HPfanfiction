** Feeling obliged to mention the Dangerverse, wherein 2-year-old Harry is kidnapped by Remus Lupin and a female formerly-Muggle/powers-awakened-by-tragedy OC who is Hermione's wretchedly named older sister Gertrude "Danger" Granger, and is raised commune-style together as a sibling to Hermione, and later Draco and the OC daughter of a fugitive Sirius Black and his OC Hogwarts girlfriend. It is both better and worse than it sounds... Topping out at just shy of 1.9 million words across 5 stories, it is complete, and has a whole bunch of "extra moments" one-shots and an epilogue.

It's really a guilty pleasure read, and is probably a crapshoot as to whether you'll like it. There are a hella lot of cliches but I enjoyed it. I will say that the story itself got better as the author found her groove, so if the premise sounds promising to you, stick it out for awhile.

The story starts with Living with Danger linkffn(2109424).

** Hail Odysseus sounds like it's right up your alley. Harry is raised by Grindlewald after he hears about Harry being raised with muggles and takes it upon himself to prepare Harry for what he has to face. It's not a Dark!Harry, just an independent Harry who doesn't take any shit. It's told differently in that Harry's upbringing with Grindlewald is done via flashbacks that happen throughout the story. It is a paring between Harry and Ginny but as long as that doesn't bother you then this story should meet your liking. linkffn(10645463)
