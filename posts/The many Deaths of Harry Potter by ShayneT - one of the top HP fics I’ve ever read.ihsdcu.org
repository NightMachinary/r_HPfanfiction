This fic is very unique, a true “zero to hero” fic. Following a similar premise as Edge of Tomorrow, Harry goes back a random increment of time each time he is killed. Featuring a clever but paranoid Harry who navigates a wizarding world of death eaters who expect their lord to be resurrected, each twist and turn is as unexpected as the last. ShayneT really does an amazing job with a satisfying epilogue that left me CRAVING more. The slow burn and romance is very subtle but well established without taking focus from the main plot of the story. I cannot recommend it enough!

Pros: Very little bashing, Better (but not “good” dursleys- it's well explained), Helpful Dumbledore, Smarter Voldemort, Great character development, AMAZING action scenes - they are very well written and paint very vivid imagery with ease

Cons: Slight continuity errors, Rough start

Neutral: Time-skips, Blood and gore

Edits are for pros and cons lists

*** It was working for me on mobile, but I agree! I love the part you mentioned. So many tear jerkers hidden in this story but the sweet ending makes up for it

**** No problem, I'm reading it right now and I like it ! It feels a bit like a video game, with Harry coming back to random save points when he dies, and has to change strategy to succeed. Thanks for recommending it :)

** Lmaoooo a ShayneT fic. In case any of you have read worm, try out his worm/Harry Potter crossover called A Wand for Skitter. ShayneT mostly writes worm fanfics and he's known over there for having sociopathic main characters in virtually every one of his fics. It's fun stuff

*** I haven't actually, but I DID download the epubs when I saw a lot of his fics were crossovers with Worm- I want to know the original fandom before I read crossovers of it

**** Ok I literally cannot recommend worm enough to anybody. Worm is a superhero story that takes a lot of the tropes and flips them on their heads. Basically, imagine if marvel was /dark/. It's soo good I'ma just leave a link just in case

****** No as far as I'm aware The Boys has a comic that's much older than Worm, which began somewhere around 2011? And also the heroes in worm are actually you know, heroes. Mostly.

******* Noted. I've read nothing about worm or The Boys (outside of watching the show), so I had no idea, but it was the most recent dark “superhero” trope I thought of

******** I mean they both certainly have their fucked up moments, in The Boys, Hughie's girlfriend gets pulverized and in worm there's a group of super powered serial killers called the Slaughterhouse Nine.

** I'm not really impressed. I quit reading because it puts the wizarding culture in a very bad light in Harry's pov. I mean, why apply logic to a wizarding culture when laws of reality are under their thumb?

*** It gets better, he quickly depends on magic as an “equalizer” and the only way to save his own life. He gets used to the wizarding world as it takes a while before he learns that the entire wizarding world isn't out to get him, just half of it. Overall though as it is a mature tone book with a much darker take on the wizarding world

** Good rec. Fic is very much like Re:Zero so if you like that then this will be your jam.
