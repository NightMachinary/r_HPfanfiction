I'm doing a romance, it's going to start off slow, so I was thinking about doing some in-depth classes. Is this too boring? Do people even like reading that stuff? I don't mind it but I dont know about others.


** I personally love it when writers explore their interpretations of the world's magic, and classes are a great way to do so. It's one of the things that I enjoy most about fanfiction, new takes on magic and spells that the community invents.

** Very much... provided it doesn't sound like nonsense. There's broadly two preferable ways to handle classes:

-Do like canon did and imply there's real depth to the subject which is mostly hinted at. Mostly restrict to seeing the characters in the action-y bits. Reading, theory lectures and such mostly summarized and mentioned.

-Go in depth on the subject, but you actually need to make it sound reasonable and cohesive. This is difficult and requires real forethought in terms of how it meshes with the broader world you intend to write (e.g. is it a system that is easily abusable and therefore broken? If so, having no one exploit it is completely stupid) and in the class progressing like in a real curriculum (e.g. being age appropriate and broken up into sensible, related chunks).

** Ask yourself this before you include ANYTHING in a story: is this scene necessary?

Will having classes shown advance your plot, help to develop the world you are setting up? Or is it just padding to fill up space and time before you get to other things?

I don't know the answer, but you should ask yourself this question before you include anything in a fic. Does a romance fic really need intricate details of 3rd year transfiguration?

*** Well I plan on going somewhat in-depth in classes. However the classes are going to be more of different types of reliefs. Like Comedic relief, building towards certain alliances between people, showing how harry grows into knowledge. This isn't HBP compliant. This is Dumbledore going into strict war-mode. All classes fifth year and up will be based upon whats needed to make the students protected and able to both fight and defend themselves in the war and fight. The classes will be covering what is needed for survival, both defensively and offensively, and on a normal every day life basis as well. There's no nonsense of 'but they're just children, let them throw dances, and go to hogsmeade and have sweets'.

The fic is going to have dark points so I thought some comedic relief from some classes at points would be good as well. Like the first Care of Magical Creatures class Hagrid is teaching about Phoenixes. Borrows Fawkes. Fawkes ends up at the Hufflepuff dinner table surrounded by students dressing him in fancy vests and robes and costumes as he struts along.

It's a Romance/Adventure, though maybe more Romance/Action or Romance/Horror. I'm not sure which applies yet.

you've given me food for thought thanks!

** I really like when people use the classes as a way of expanding the magical world or changing it - but only if it's important to the story.

While it's sometimes interesting to read a detailed article about the effects of draught of the living dead, I don't enjoy seeing half of the chapter dedicated to doing so unless the information will play a part in the fic later on.

However, this is your fic, so you should do whatever you feels right.

** For me it depends on how many classes, and how indepth we're talking.

No, I definitely don't want a story to be primarily classes. That said, I'm not at all adverse to having a fic expand and clarify magic. It's really important that it be reasonable and consistent.

Anyways, I'm a sucker for romance fics of certain pairings. Care to link yours?

*** Its not up yet! I like to do a good outlining. I alreay have the main plot planned, and how it ends and begins, and the major things that need to happen and the most major scene in the fic written. Now I'm outlining the chapters one by one, and doing research into them.

But when it is up I'll gladly link you, not many people care for Snarry though.

As for classes this is Dumbledore in full on war-mode. All classes fifth year and Up are going to be teaching them the spells, potions, etc. needed to win the war. Both defensively and offensively. He's basically raising soldiers in a school. Not so he can use them as an army but merely because he wants to prepare them for what they most likely will face and doesn't want them to be ill-prepared and die. So it'll be quite serious but it's not going to be like uh let's say History-of-Magic in the canon world is haha. It's going to be a bit of an explanation, some discussion, demonstration and a practical. Depending on the subject etc. Potions is going to be more independent study after a few lessons.

Ah, in that case I definitely won't read it.

Slash in general isn't really my thing, but that pairing in particular is extra weird to me.

That said, feel free to link it to me anyways. Even if I don't read it, someone that stumbles across this thread might.

For the classes, though, that actually sounds interesting.

** I think that, as a large part of Harry Potter is a story about school life, that skipping writing about classes is a massive cop-out. That is a huge chunk of his school experience, and I don't agree with missing it out. I agree with the others who advise not to rehash canon. If you have specific ideas for magical theory, classes are the perfect place to introduce new ideas. They also can help to give the characters new tools, drop new information about people or places (Binns and the Chamber of Secrets, every Defence class ever, etc).

If you're more interested in social rather than magical aspects, notes can be passed in class, there are whispered conversations, romantic tension can be created when characters are unexpectedly working together, and more!

** If the concepts of the classes are explored more in depth then yes.

Like if all it says and on Tuesday we studied Futhark runes suwilho to fe. Then Friday hagall to kaun... NO.

Or if its just words that don't mean anything like The oscillating pinequills bequethe vehemency into stewed eye of newt, but only if counter clockwise serpentine strokes are iterrated every 18 seconds. Then no.

But if it goes into detail like Todays class we will grow our focus by transfiguring a pencil. YOu will start with just the lead then surround it by wood and finally top off the eraser. This allows you control and provided good opportunities to actually understand different materials. then sure.

** On the whole, yes. Is your fic canon-compliant? If so, bringing up lesson content that was not mentioned in the books would be great. Being in-depth is fine. Unless its as complex as the arithmancy principles in The Legacy. That left me wondering what the hell was going on.

If the fic is not compliant, introducing different classes e.g. spell-crafting in Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived would help in world-building.

** Discussions with the teachers about anything and everything (good for world-building IMHO - the nature of dark-magic is a great topic (if your fanfiction has such magic and not just well magic and the intent behind it, because frankly you can kill with first year spells just as easily as with the Avada Kedavra, the later is just a little faster and in fights it ignores shields!)) and other kinds of magic (Britain has the animagus transformation, but who is to say that native American shamans don't have something similar but for multiple animals etc.) that aren't normally shown in Britain (how would you inspire kids in a world of magic? Talk about magic they haven't seen before IMHO!)

** Yes, if the story manages to pull it of in a way that does not bore the reader to death.\\
The concepts of magic that are going to be displayed must fit into the universe the author is creating.

If not, then no. Dont bother. I dont wanna read about Binns droning about Goblin war 3991 in the year 918, when Rotball Gagtwist fell over a pebble and killed himself.

I absolutely do /NOT/ like reading the author's thoughts on magical theory.

*** I agree with you to a point. I think the problem is authors become too excited over the prospect of the endless possibilities of magical theory, and then over explain it and make it dull. The same thing happens to research. Magical theory should be in the background of the background. Only just noticeable to the reader.
