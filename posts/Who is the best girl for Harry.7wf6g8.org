  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** If you go by the Books, of course Ginny:

- Strong, almost never cried, and Harry couldn't deal with crying girls.
- Pretty, as Pansy Parkinson said in HBP. Harry seemed to only go after 'hot' girls (Cho previously).
- Quidditch fanatic
- Shared an evil sense of humor with Harry, whether it was about mocking Fleur or making fun of Ron.
- Shared the experience of having Voldemort in their heads
- Knew when and how to put Harry in his place (Christmas of Year 5)
- Fanatically loyal to him and devoted to his cause, braved terror and torture during Year 7 at Hogwarts, led students (with Neville) and drummed up enough manpower to win the Final Battle.

--------------

If we go into fanfictions and AUs, then it really depends on how they are characterized and how circumstances bring them together. For examples, I really like those pairings in following fics:

- Harry and Hermione in "Stages of Hope"
- Harry and Bellatrix in "Delenda Est"
- Harry and Luna in "The Accidental Animagus"
- Harry and Daphne in "Betrayal"
- Harry and Susan in "Final Protocol"
- Harry and Tonks in "Harry Potter and the Metamorph"

I'd like very much to read a good Harry/Fleur fic in which Fleur is not part of a harem and someone who is a power of her own.

Then I'd like to read a convincing Harry/Lily Evans time travel. I've had a long discussion with [[/u/autumnsouls]], but I don't know whether she's going to write it or not.

  set five years after the end of the war following a line where harry and ginny don't get married and instead harry and pansy build a relationship. told in alternating perspectives from pansy and hermione.

  Hermione can't... she can't work out their relationship. They seem comfortable with each other, their elbows are touching and Harry's hand is on Pansy's knee, and there's something when they look at each other. No, she doesn't get it at all. When Harry stands to get the next round Pansy touches his arm and asks him to "get her a Gillywater, darling" and Harry nods, his hand brushing across the top of her head, the term of supposed endearment going unnoticed, as though it's used regularly. Hermione wonders what he calls her in return.

  This is the story of a very unlikely pairing in a love, hate...more hate relationship. This is a cynical look back on how it all began and the maddening realization of why it hasn't ended. A Harry, Pansy pairing. Yes, I have undertaken the implausible.

** Are we assuming post-war? Because in that case, I'd say he would want someone with a little more life experience than himself who would put up with his inexperience and psychological issues. He is basically forced into a father role before he got his dick wet and while Andromeda is only 47 at most, she lost her daughter and her husband and could probably use someone who could help her with Teddy (and the Tonks grandparents would be around 70). We have very few people who could fill that spot, especially since the prime contender for that role, Tonks, is dead. I mean, she put up with Lupin, a shit-tier husband and walking pity party, so Harry would not be too far from the realm of the possible.

Fleur is married so the next option is Penelope Clearwater, someone we know very little about. What we know (Muggleborn, smart, not ugly, high tolerance for her boyfriend acting like a prat) paints a positive picture but we could use more information.

****** It is a mystery, which begins with the murder of Slughorn. Most of the reviewers think that this will be the central plot while it is only the first act of a much larger story. I mean, I put International intrigues into the description for a reason. Politics will not be "Harry smacks the Wizengamot with his +big cock+ inherited titles" but "Various groups from multiple countries are working towards their goals and clash as a result. Harry and Tonks get stuck in the middle of it while trying to figure out what the hell is going on."

The first few chapters are a little heavy on the fluffy romance since I need some time to pass for various events to happen with some temporal separation. International interactions are not done via WhatsApp, but through travelling diplomats and various meetings.

This article looks at Harry and Ginny and Harry and Hermione and looks at pretty much all the clues in the books that show why one works and the other doesn't. It came out before HBP, so it doesn't look at the romance between Harry and Ginny, but shows how Ginny is set up as a character who is a good match for Harry.

** Depends on the Harry. In cannon... I'd say Lily Moon. We got the barest mention of her- it wasn't anything bad- she wasn't a Slythern and it can be assumed that she wasn't interested in being in the spotlight since she vanishes after the first book.

A girl like that would presumably be less likely to use Harry's fame- even if it's for something relatively benign like getting onto a quidditch team or attending parties, she'd let the poor boy just be Harry.

And while people hate on the Ginny/Harry romance, myself included... Granger wouldn't be much better for him- he disliked being nagged- wasn't very motivated most of the time, and such... While he might be nagged into being minister or head auror with Granger at the helm, the question is, would he be happy with the attention and nagging? I think not. I almost feel bad for useless, I mean Ron.

Edit: My favorite pairing is Harry/Luna, but... I don't think that'd be the absolute best for canon Harry- or even any Harry that wants to be "just Harry"- she's a globtrotting reporter- that wouldn't help him be just Harry either. But, and this is a big but, out of all the canon characters that we actually know more about, her isolation was as closely severe to Harry's, and while an absentminded Father and a Mothers death does not equate completely to spending 11 years in a cupboard- they both experienced very long periods of trouble early on in life- and she's always cheering him up when he needs it(which makes me think her insanity may not be as real even in canon as we're led to believe), and often giving him a good laugh, so I'll put her as a second choice- helps that Harry may not be quite as well known in other countries

Tltr: Lily Moon Or Luna Lovegood.

Edit 2: Though I don't know if having his mother's name would be a dealbreaker, could be, I'd date a gal with my Mom's name, but it'd be a little odd.

**** Yes, in that she was sorted- though we didn't hear her full first name in the book- (and I don't know if it was in the movie at all) that part is post cannon- with J.K. telling us her full first name later on, not in the books but on pottermore.

And we know- somehow, that she wasn't in Ravenclaw- could be in any of the other houses though- something I didn't know- I thought for sure she was a Griffindor. I suppose because most fanfics that use her at all, as few as that is do place her there.

Also she may have been killed or switched schools- or it was a mistake on Rowlings part, or your right and the wiki doesn't have it, but she wasn't called when she should have been for her O.W.L.s
