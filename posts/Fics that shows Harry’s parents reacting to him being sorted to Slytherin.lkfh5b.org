Preferably a negative reaction, but they don't need to be straight up jerks, just show a little of their prejudice against the house. It could also be Sirius, but I rather it doesn't have too much bashing on him without a good explanation for his behavior

  In which James Potter isn't as dead as everyone thought and Harry has a strong mistrust of all adults.Reconnecting with his son isn't going to be easy, not just because Harry's in Slytherin.

** There was a fanfiction where Harry's parents sent him to live abroad with Sirius to protect him, and Neville was the BWL. Harry came back to england when he was 11 and was sorted to Slytherin. I wish I could remember the name of the fanfiction because I really want to read it again. But it does have what you're asking for. If someone knows it, maybe he or she can drop the link?

** Two series:

Sarcasm and Slytherin

The Prince of Slytherin

They're both WBWL series, because those tend to be the ones where his parents are alive

** This is a fun prompt idea. I don't think there's any way James and Sirius aren't assholes about it because of their prejudice against Slytherin and Lily's experience with Slytherins as a muggleborn would probably make her treat Harry differently without realizing it. I could see Harry connecting with Snape in this scenario

*** I don't think Lily would treat him differently, she was Snape's bestfriend for 5 years after all and always defended him against the marauders. Sirius would be an asshole but would get over quickly, after all his own brother and uncle were there and he cares about them. James, I don't know, he will be an asshole but I don't know if he would eventually get over it. I always viewed him as a very complex character.

**** I'm thinking Lily would be slightly upset because in her mind, Slytherin took her closest friend and turned him into a bad guy. Massive oversimplification cause there were other factors to why Snape fell in with the death eaters, Lily being one of those factors whether she can admit it or not. How much she pushed him is open to interpretation but constantly telling Snape how bad his housemates were and holding her own as better certainly didn't help. James is someone I have a very low opinion of and don't see him getting over his own prejudices towards Slytherin and accepting Harry's placement. Sirius I can totally see getting over it because of his own family

*** Lmao James makes one off the cuff comment about Slytherins and suddenly he's all "slimy snakes die". He was very ok with Sirius' entire family being in Slytherin and didn't start cursing Sirius right then and there or start frothing at the mouth.

James' reaction to Snape wanting to be in Slytherin is pretty in line with Manchester United fan reacting to a City fan. Or a USC legacy reacting to a UCLA student. 11 year old James didn't know if his new friend would be in Slytherin or Gryffindor and he was very accepting of him. Somehow 30 year old James will treat his son less because Harry's in Slytherin.

Meanwhile, Snape calls James and his dad brainless idiots for being in/wanting to be in Gryffindor. If anything Snape is the more prejudiced one here.

Also I find the idea of holding Lily in any way responsible for Snape actively wanting to be a death eater pretty misogynist. It's not up to the girl to "save" the evil boy. Lily didn't say all Slytherins are evil. She said Mulciber and Avery are. And she was correct. Snape was free to befriend other Slytherins but chose those two because they shared the same goal of wanting to serve Voldemort.

If your friend starts hanging out with murderous racists and you don't, you aren't allowed to call out that these people are murderous racists? It's your fault for showing disapproval of these murderous racists? Give me a break.
