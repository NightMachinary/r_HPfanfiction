Any hood fics where Harry is metarphomagus , animagus or something this way ? Please no slash


** "Metarphomagus"

I assume you meant Metamorphmagus, but just in case:

Harry stood before Professor Quirell in shock. "But I thought... Snape-"

"Ah yes, snape does seem more the type doesn't he? That's exactly what I was hoping for."

Harry blinked, so the stuttering was an act all along as well. Harry tried to ask another question, but he soon became distracted by the ropes that suddenly appeared around him. Quirell was turning back to the mirror. He didn't see Harry's body start to melt into black goo. He didn't see harry start to grow to a size that towered over him. But he did see the shadow cast by harry.

Quirell span around and demanded, "Wh-what are y-you?!"

"I'M THE METARPHOMAGUS!" harry shouted in a rage, tar dripping from his face onto Quirell's. Quirell screamed in pain.

"Kill him you fool!" Shouted a voice from Quirell's turban.

"Avad-da-da Ke-kedavra," Quirell stuttered out. Harry didn't know that spell, but it didn't seem to do anything for some reason. Harry smacked Quirell aside like a gnat, inflicting more burn wounds from the hot tar. Quirell was now stuck to the ground, and Harry raised his first and slammed it down on Quirell. He died in burning, suffocating agony.

A strange spirit, kind of like a ghost fled Quirell's body

Sorry, I had to.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10449375/1/The-Cupboard-Series-1-The-Cupboard-Under-the-Stairs]] it's pretty deep into the series like the 4th or 5th one i think

** linkffn(12713828) Victoria Potter: Fem!Harry who's a Metamorphmagus. She disguises herself as Hermione once and McGonagall another time to get herself out of trouble. It's one of the better stories in the fandom, in general - [[/u/Taure]] did a ton of work on background worldbuilding and avoids the stations-of-canon as much as possible, so it basically reads like an entirely different series.\\

The Accidental Animagus: linkao3(14078862) Harry becomes an Animagus at the ripe old age of 5. This is one of the few fics where his Animagus abilities actually come up all the time, as opposed to just him getting the power and then never doing anything with it. I will warn that this one has some /heavy/ 11-year-old-politician tropes, but outside of those the story's one of my favourites.\\

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027]] it takes some time but Harry is a Metamorphmagus and Jim (this is a WBWL story and Jim is the WBWL) is an animagus.
