** They seem pretty rare. Jeconais' White Knight, Grey Queen is nearly 12 years old at this point. Somewhere a long the way the slytherin girl love interest & independent Harry trope merged with the Daphne pairing. And really, aside from having to deal with the Draco syncophancy from Pansy, Daphne offers a blank slate.

  A ten part series of one shots. It started with a detention. It started with curiosity. It started with small talk. What happens when a detention throws two people together? Rival houses, Rival groups. Will she lay bare her heart or will he just see the bad in her? Could he change her? Will their secret stay safe? Harry/Pansy.

** Alright! So I just pulled these the first page of [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bcategory_ids%5D%5B%5D=22&work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=1803&work_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=83023&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=Pansy+Parkinson&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=Harry+Potter+-+J*d*+K*d*+Rowling][this source]] so you can keep looking if you want.

I haven't read: linkao3(Number my Sins by amaranthiun) linkao3(Nobility by olivieblake) - but I have read some of her other things and she is a FANTASTIC author. linkao3(Soulmates of Prophecy by gryffindortom)

I've started but am not fully caught up with linkao3(Touch by turbulenthandholding).

And I LOVE linkao3(Tangled Sheets by provocative_envy). If you like modern au's, envy is THE place to go for quality Hansy content, to be honest!

#+begin_quote
  A Hansy Advent Story. Not all of us handle the past the same way: some of us embrace it, reject it, grow with it, or relive it in recurring nightmares. Harry has saved the wizarding world before; now it's his turn to be saved. Rated M for substance abuse, PSTD, language and sexual situations in later chapters.

  After the events of the Battle of the Ministry, Harry Potter feels a hole in himself, one where he hasn't recognised who his Soulmate is. Hermione Granger finds her Soulmate in Neville Longbottom and feels happy. Pansy Parkinson is not happy with the betrothal contract that her father had made with a certain ferret and discovers her Soulmate. HP/PP, NL/HG

#+begin_quote
  When a tyrannical king takes the throne by the blood-stained tip of his sword, two women find themselves tangled in his search for power. Who is the pawn and who is the queen, and what will they sacrifice for love? Hansy/Tomione, eventual Dramione. Historical AU.

  Because Pansy Parkinson is standing in front of him, looking like every primly proper Pureblood nightmare Harry's ever had, and he can't quite reconcile her presence on his doorstep with the stagnant predictability of the world he usually inhabits. Cognitive dissonance.

  That's what it is.
