I was inspired by Fawkes catching fire and rising from the ashes as a chick.


** "Alright Potter, Now We Duel"

Suddenly Harry burst into flames. He burned for several minutes, until nothing was left but a pile of ash. It was all very dramatic

Voldemort was quite satisfied with himself. He had never talked someone to death before.

Noticing some movement in the ashes, Voldemort instructed Pettigrew to investigate.

"Sir", said Pettigrew, "It appears to be a baby".

Voldemort froze. No! Not again! It can't be happening again!

"Riddikulus!" Voldemort shouted, glaring hatefully at the baby. It had to be a boggart!

However, the spell did nothing. The second stretched into minutes, and then.

"EEEEEEEEEEEEEE" Screamed Voldemort, turning his tail and fleeing bravely.

Pettigrew was shocked stone solid. He kept switching between baby Harry (who was growing rapidly, and was now the size of a two year old) and his feeling master. Shrugging, he swapped to his rat form and followed his master.

** I love this. This'd be brilliant. I'm not sure if I'd prefer that he have a faster life/maturation cycle so that he'd grow from baby to adult in a day or two before combusting again or that he be a perfectly typical human with that 'immortality' but a need to grow two decades before he becomes able to take care of himself again.

** There is an older fic out there that does this. Starts with Harry on his death bed saying goodbye, then bursting into flame before becoming a baby. It was short and implied he was centuries old.

  The consequences of magical powers aren't always foreseen or understood. Harry Potter is about to encounter the downside to a power he acquired a long time ago.
