When Albus first saw Tom Ri-/Voldemort/ he had assumed that he just dabbled in extremely dark magic. In hindsight he should have probably investigated. When Voldemort died Albus knew he still lived because someone that obsessed with immortality had to have some backup plan(s).

Albus wouldn't find out about the horcruxes until 1992 with the diary and wouldn't be until even later he would realize just how many it was. So He never thought to check baby Harry's scar. He would regret that.

When he does find out he destroys all of them but by then it's far too late and there is already an uprising Dark Lord.

-------------

Harry and Tom Riddle could be brothers with how absolutely similar they are. The horcrux never awoke but it simply being there darkened Harry's soul a lot and Dumbledore is horrified.

Harry is a Dark Lord but realizes if he did the same thing Voldemort did then he would come off as a terrorist organization and that could either help or hinder him. In the end he goes the legal route and turns the ministry into and Empire.

He gets a following in Hogwarts both using his natural charm and very subtlety using his status as the Chosen One. Later in life his following gets bigger with the children hero worshipping him and those out of Hogwarts had a deep respect for him.

No one would realize how Vile he was until he was already the Emperor


** Your Harry gives me Palpatine vibes
