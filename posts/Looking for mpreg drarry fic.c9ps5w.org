Hi, hoping the hive mind can help! I'm looking for an mpreg drarry fic (post Hogwarts, EWE) where Draco is pregnant and needs skin to skin contact with Harry in order to support the pregnancy. However, he and Harry aren't a couple and Draco doesn't want to rely on Harry --- so he eventually becomes very weak because he doesn't contact Harry for a magical “boost”? Any help finding would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!!!!!!!!
