Anyone can be the main character/can be on any site/any length/old or new

Would rather it be completed or regularly updated but if not that's fine

Am fine with het/slash/femslash/threesomes/etc doesn't have to focus on pairings

No Weasley Bashing. No Weasley's using Harry for his fame/fortune, no Ginny giving Harry a love potion.


** That's the direction my fic /Cleaved/ is going in, but it's more business than strictly magical healing. Fem!Harry and her Muggle friend work to bring medical potions to the non-magical world. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13382072/1/Cleaved]]); linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/20553980/chapters/48790226]]).

My other favourites are /Harry Potter, Healing Hands/ (incomplete, but I messaged the author who's expressed interest in getting back to it) linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6585807/1/Harry-Potter-Healing-Hands]]), where at the end of 3rd year Harry decides to become a Healer, and /The Mapmakers/ linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14447502]]), a Marauders-era fic where Lily Evans is training to become a Healer in her 6th year with Vold War 1 happening in the background.

/Reparations/ linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599]]) is a Harry/Draco slash healing fic.

/After the End/ linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/282139/1/]]) has Ginny become a healer. It's a really old fic though (2001-2003).

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8920787/1/]]) : WBWL fic, Harry is a potions genius.

Other threads that cover this topic are listed below (pretty much every relevant thread I could find regarding healing, unsure about the bash-status though):

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won.

  Harry wakes up with a throbbing head, but he soon realizes that a headache is the last thing he has to worry about.

And what part does Draco play in it all?

  Nothing in Harry's life since the war has gone the way he expected. And now he's the mediwizard assigned to take care of Lucius Malfoy, of all people. But he's Harry; he grits his teeth and endures. He won't allow even Draco Malfoy's flirting, which he knows is just a joke, to disconcert him.

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
