  throw Harry into an abusive home and force him to stay there based on his personal interpretation of a vague prophecy
#+end_quote

He placed Harry at the Dursley's because that was the safest place for him. The alternative was presumably for him to get murdered by death eaters. Nothing to do with the prophecy, other than his certainty that Voldemort would eventually attempt to kill him again.

******* Yeeah, but then you forget that it wouldn't have to be known to the public that Harry is in the castle. (security through obscurity) it's a bit similar to the Dursleys, no one had a shred of an idea of where he was living other than rumours of living with muggles.. same could be said for Harry at Hogwarts, and he wouldn't have to go out always (we can ignore the map, the twins would keep it to themselves, mainly due to no one believing them)

******** There are lots of issues with this, though. Who is raising Harry, for one? There are students at Hogwarts most of the year; is he supposed to be confined to an unused part of the castle? That's a similar problem to hiding under the fidelius charm. He can't have any relationships with kids his own age or even many adults, because for every person that knows the risk of a leak grows.

********* There's also the possibility of him going to Andromeda.. he'd have a big sister figure there, they're also related..

No but in Hogwarts, he'd be safe, and besides, did Harry really have any good interaction between other kids his age? They all got bullied if they were friends with Harry, besides, Harry could go to a random school via apparition (some professor probably) and he'd have a much better time there than he did at Surrey..

Isn't Dumbledore his guardian? If not then Hagrid's basically kidnapping him from his rightful guardian? If so then still, whatever he did could be called child neglect. But whatever, assuming Dumbledore is his guardian, he could raise Harry in Hogwarts, have him go to school via apparition, and do other cool stuff.

They're very distantly related. Either way, this brings back the safety aspect, which is the whole point of his placement at the Dursley's.

There's still social interaction, even if he doesn't have friends. And I personally wouldn't equate “not having friends because Dudley's a bully” with “designing Harry's life so he can't have friends.”

No. And I don't think Dumbledore would have the time or inclination to raise a child.

*********** Okay okay okay, second cousins is "very distantly related"? I would think like 4th or 5th cousins to be very distantly related. I completely agree that it wouldn't be as safe as the Dursleys, though we don't know if there were any attacks/attempts to search for Harry by the death eaters, if there weren't, then the Dursleys only abused him, which in my opinion is not safe, if there were, then the blood wards probably saved his life. But sadly, we don't know..

I didn't say that anyone "designed his life so he can't have friends", Dudley was a bully who was completely un punished, he also did make it so that Harry didn't have friends, and also hurt Harry via "Harry hunting"

Harry could still go to school, that is social interaction, and maaybe if a professor was nice, they'd be able to take Harry to visit his friends' place.. though that is asking for a lot,

Then why the hell did they take Harry? Sirius should then be his guardian if he's the godfather, if not him then probably his godmother (does he have one?) there's no way he'd go to his aunt if his parents died (unless that aunt was a godmother as well, which I really doubt seeing as they didn't even go to Lily and James' wedding)

You misunderstand; I was saying that having no friends because Dudley is a bully is better than having no friends because his living arrangement requires him to live in secrecy.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Well, Petunia is the closest family he has. With Sirius in Azkaban, she's next of kin. There's no indication that he has a godmother. I'd say not.

************* No no no, why did Hagrid take Harry from Sirius, Sirius wasn't even going after Peter yet, he was trying to keep Harry safe, but then Hagrid came on "Dumbledores orders" to retrieve Harry, for fucks sake the man isn't immune to the law..

It wouldn't require him to live in secrecy though, he could still easily go to a muggle school and learn stuff that way, but he would have to live secret from the magical population, or atleast most of it.

Wasn't Harry's grandma a Black before Marrying? Or is that fanon, hmm, Euphemia Black doesn't sound like a black name though, (what was Euphemia's first surname before taking on Potter?) whatever, it's fanon that his grandma is Dorea Potter nee Black, which /would/ make him a second cousin, soooo.. yeah idk enough about the Black family tree to know this stuff

************** Well, firstly I'd say this: Hagrid didn't beat Sirius over the head and steal Harry. Sirius gave him up. He was probably not entirely emotionally stable at that point either, as his best friend had just been betrayed and murdered. I personally don't think that Sirius was in the best head space to take care of a small child just then, but that's my opinion.

Secondly, we know that the death eaters were still at large. It would have been key to get Harry to a safe location(see what happened to the Longbottom's).

Thirdly, presumably the ministry was infiltrated by death eaters, and untrustworthy. At the very least it was corrupt, and likely to take advantage of Harry.

All this adds up to Dumbledore taking the necessary precautions to keep Harry from coming to harm at the hands of wizards. It's easy to see why he did it if you don't automatically jump to him being an evil mastermind.

Yeah, I don't think we know Euphemia's maiden name, so all that's fanon.

*************** Yes sadly, it'd be a cool addition though if she'd been a black.

Didn't Sirius resist Hagrid in the beginning and only gave him up after Hagrid said something about getting Harry safe?

Sirius' house was safe, presumably, also, the Longbottom attack happened like a few days later, when the death eaters learned of their masters death though?

I know the ministry wasn't to be trusted, Sirius was to be though.

I do agree with what Dumbledore did, he didn't make the Dursleys throw him in a cupboard or starve and beat him, that was the Dursleys not him, but you gotta agree, he should have shown up every now and then to check up on him, though I don't think he saw a need as they were /family/, even if the Dursleys were dumb as hell.

** Chapter 20, The Tale of Three Brothers:

#+begin_quote
  “Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That is a children's tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death.”

  There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was low in the sky.

  “Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly.

  “When you say ‘master of Death' ---” said Ron.

  “Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.”
#+end_quote

Chapter 21, The Deathly Hallows:

#+begin_quote
  Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death ... Master ... Conqueror ... Vanquisher ... The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. ...

  And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match ... Neither can live while the other survives. ... Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe?
#+end_quote

...

Chapter 34, King's Cross:

#+begin_quote
  ... but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.'
#+end_quote

...

#+begin_quote
  You are the true master of death, because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.
#+end_quote

So, yes, it is mentioned, but it is never truly explained what does it mean, aside from the last quote.
