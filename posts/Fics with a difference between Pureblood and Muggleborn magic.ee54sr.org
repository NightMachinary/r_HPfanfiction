Just looking for fics where a difference is given, regardless of whether one is actually better than the other.


** I've seen two different schools of thought on it. Well, and subgroup of one.

- Purebloods are so inbred that their magical ability is being watered down and need newblood (muggleborns) to refresh the bloodline to keep it strong. Muggleborns were stronger magically and academically. Sometimes there's caveats that like muggleborns will lose their magic (squib out) after a few generations. It sounds more like horse breeding than anything. Can't remember the fic that did this.
- Family magic

1. Spells: Over the generations, the members of the family have invented, discovered spells/potions/rituals/etc and marked them as family magic. More along the lines of specialization.
2. Actual Magic: Things become a little more nebulous here. Actual magic acting like a guardian of the family. Ensuring members can't attack each other, follows the commands of the head of house. Etc.

A Marauder's Plan, linkffn(8045114) this fic goes heavily into family magics.

** I can see the view of pure-bloods being inbred and their magic becoming weaker over time but I have a different theory...

Pure-bloods have just magical blood within them which makes them stronger.

Muggleborns have a tiny magic gene passed down sometimes generations of muggles and watered down. They can still use magic fully like Hermione if it's a dominant gene

If it's a recessive gene their magic might not be as strong.

Because pure-blood genes are dominant its a hundred more times likely for pure-bloods to be powerful wizards.

And some like Neville who got the short end of the stick, a recessive gene despite being in a magical family, is a weak wizard despite being pure-blood. But that's less common.

A squib would just be a person who didn't get any magical genes from their magical family and that's about as common as muggle-borns.

*** I see Squibs as being people who's bloodlines were too inbred to continue.

​

"Muggleborns" can be two possibilities: The inbreeding finally being rectified and the magic comes back to the line. OR. Actual first generation magical users.

​

And was Neville really a weak wizard? He was using his dad's wand which hasn't accepted him. IIRC, after the DoM battle he got a new wand and he was better.

**** He was a late bloomer- his family thought he was a squib until his uncle threw him off a balcony and he used accidental magic to save himself.

He does come into his own post OoTP after DA training and getting his own wand. He wasn't a good fit for his dad's wand and needed to carve out his own path.

***** Eh, I would say emotional issues for that. Effectively orphaned. Everyone smothering him. His Grandmother trying to mold him into his father. His Uncle trying to scare magic out of him. It can't be very accidental if he knows they are trying to scare accidental magic out of him. It was most likely detrimental. And he finally had it when it seemed like there was nothing left. And it's not like Hogwarts doesn't have something that can tell if someone is magical or not.
