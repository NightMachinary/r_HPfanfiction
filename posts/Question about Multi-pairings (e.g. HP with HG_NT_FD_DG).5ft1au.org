Hey folks,

Just have a quick question that I'd like to ask the community.

When you have a multi-pairing on fanficition (e.g. HP with HG/FD/DG etc.) does that mean it's one character with all these people at once (harem) or several relationships over the course of the fic?

I've read a lot of fanfiction and I've avoided these purely because I don't really want to read about a 14 year old with 7 women hanging of his arm while he fights wandless-ly against an evil tyrant with Dumbledore in the background shaking his fist in anger as Mrs Weasley fumes with rage. However one thing I rather dislike is how fanfiction for the most part resolves around the idea of the main character meeting one person and being with them forever, it's not terrible but it it's just rather... boring? Hence the interest in a fic where the character has multiple relationships and has to deal with break ups and those kind of things (aka real life).

Let me know and if you have any recs with multi-pairings that are multiple separate relationships then please post them below, definitely one area of fanfiction I haven't looked into.


** No, that always refers to a harem fic.

The use of the forward slash or virgule (/) in pairings began in 1977, and we see it first in what we can probably call the first slash fiction as we would know it, which of course comes from /Kirk/Spock/. Now, in the early days of fanfiction published in zines, there came about something of an issue. How could one determine between those pieces that wrote a sexual/romantic relationship between the two main characters (such as Kirk and Spock) as opposed to the "general" one we see in the show?

This is where the separation began to come about. Fans began to use the forward slash to refer to a romantic/sexual pairing, and to specifically denote something "gen" or platonic, they would use an ampersand (&).

As a side note, the use of the forward slash is the reason we today refer to pairings as being "slash", as it refers to this punctuation note, and for some time in many communities "slash" referred to sexual pairings rather than specifically M/M ones.

Nowadays, the forward slash only ever refers to a PAIRING (whether that is romantic or sexual in nature). This includes multiships. The reason we see slashes used multiple times in a multiship is for the same reason we see the split between the forward slash and the ampersand - to clearly denote a meaning with limited characters. We might see, for example, /HP/Hr/, or we might see /HP/Hr/RW/. In the case of a threesome, we might see the "primary" partner in the centre (where if both Ron and Harry are mostly hetero in that example, they're both more interested in Hermione than each other), or they might be in just any order.

In the case of the harem, one will usually see the "primary" partner (in this case, usually Harry) at the beginning of the tag, and the following afterwards will refer to multiple partners in the same relationship. In the case of multiple, separate pairings, one would use a space or comma to separate them, and each time you would put in the HP initial again - such as /HP/Hr, HP/GW/. And in the case of a platonic relationship where we see focus on friendship but we wish to stress the lack of romance/sexual attraction, we use the ampersand: for example, /HP&Hr/.

Now, among some communities there have previously been notes about the order placement of relationship tags. I've seen arguments saying that characters should be listed in alphabetical order, or especially in the case of slash, that they should be ordered top/bottom (so /HP/DM/ would be different to /DM/HP/), but those rules haven't really been enforced anywhere successfully outside of like, two existing kink memes, so I wouldn't worry about them. Generally, people just go with whatever is most popular, and will often use stuff like portmanteaus for ships.

  */HP/multiple initials always refers to a harem. They do this to save space./*

  */The reason we do this is because of fandom-specific term and language evolution from the 70s./*

**** No problem! :)

If you are interested in fandom history as a whole, I totally recommend going through those resources offered by the Organisation for [[http://transformativeworks.org/][Transformative Works]], who run [[http://archiveofourown.org][Ao3]] - especially their [[http://opendoors.transformativeworks.org/faq/][Open Doors]] project and [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry_Potter][Fanlore]].

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

** Well, [[/u/LocalDictionary]] took most of the juicy stuff, so I'll just say that that "HG/FD/DG" or anything similar generally means it's with all those characters.
