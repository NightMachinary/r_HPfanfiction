Like Disobediencewriter's linkffn(House of Potter Rebuilt).


** Linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb) is a really superb fix that limits most years to one or two chapters and is a fantastic character study of Ginny.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]: The chapters jump between years, and doesn't cover all years, but mostly fits the request.

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?
#+end_quote

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4772789/1/Six-Years-Six-Applicants][Six Years, Six Applicants]]: Humour focused.

  Chronicling Dumbledore's never-ending and sometimes desperate attempts to fill the Defense Against the Dark Arts position with anyone but Snape and Snape's persistent attempts to land the job anyway.
