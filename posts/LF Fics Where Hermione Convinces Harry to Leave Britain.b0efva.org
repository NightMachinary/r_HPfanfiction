Love or hate Hermione, everyone knows she's very smart. I'm looking for fics where Hermione just knows that Harry isn't ready to face old Voldie and convinces him to leave Britain to either train or hide. Preferably HHR. I don't even know if something like this exists. I know there was one by Reptillia28 that had them leave and then come back as badasses, but that was still mostly Hermione dragging Harry along by his short and curlies while she did all the work. I'd really prefer fics where she gets him out of dodge and if they come back, he's at least done some work on his own.

  AU. A marriage law is instigated during Hermione's sixth year. Hermione considers her options and makes her choice, it just wasn't the one they were expecting. By saving herself Hermione's decisions cause ripples to run through the Order. The game has changed, those left behind need to adapt to survive. Canon up to the HBP, Dumbledore lives, Horcrux are still in play

** Oh, the most similar thing I've seen to what you're asking for is The Mountains of the Moon, by White Squirrel.

Sadly, it's only two chapters long, and it doesn't have them coming back to Hogwarts after a certain time, but it rather cuts the story after a legal battle in the Ministry Hearing to get Harry out of Hogwarts and into another school where they had just been accepted. Fudge refuses to believe Voldy is back and Hermione is not taking any more of that BS.

Still, it's a good read, as with everything from White Squirrel. Might be worth a shot.
