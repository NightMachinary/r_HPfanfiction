Just no slash or H/Hr.

EDIT: Just because all i've watched are the OT, doesn't mean I wouldn't read about the other parts of the fanon, I just meant to explain what I know of the franchise, which is pretty much nothing. I did play a bit of The Old Republic MMO though, if it helps.


** Don't think there are any that are both good, and not involved with prequel & Legends/EU territory, but there is:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12704369/1/Holocron]]

Which only has a bit of required reading on Holocrons (basically that Jedi have magic cubes that contain knowledge and instructions), and stretching what exactly they can do.

Most Star Wars crossovers (and fanfic generally) come off as cringy and low effort, mainly because of fundamentally juvenile understanding of what the dark side is in Star Wars canon, and I feel like most of the 'Dark!Harry" crowd would take that and turn it too eleven.

Anyway, I'm curious how it came to pass that you've only seen the originals, but are looking for fanfic. Did you see the recently? And if so, what did you think of them?

*** I watched them years ago, when my dad brought the VCR Box from when he went to the US, and then on and off whenever was on TV. I do know stuff about the prequels, not much, mostly through memes and snippets from my brother (who knows about it).

The reason I want a good introductory fanfic is because I'm ina massive drought of shit to read, considering I mostly (95%) read only HP, with a couple of x-overs.

Like I said on my Edit, it doesn't really have to be about the OT, it was just as a way for me to show what I do know about it.

** I have really high standards so I don't think there's really any good HP/SW fics with the original trilogy (or at all, really), but I found many elements of linkffn(11675231) to be passable.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
