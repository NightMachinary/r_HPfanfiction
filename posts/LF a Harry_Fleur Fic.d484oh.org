:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only things I remember are that it was set during GoF and at the start of the first task fleur was to nervous to eat on her own so Harry had to spoon feed her some soup. I haven't been able to get that out of my head and I've searched through all of my fics.


** Was it a short?

*** I don't think so, but I'm pretty sure the story was incomplete. I don't read many shorts because I prefer full stories.

*** That's alright, I was thinking of Harry/Fleur fics that I wanted to read again, and I thought of this scene but I can't seem to find it. It's been stuck in my head for a while.

  They always say love can be dangerous, but it's always worth it right? 17 year old Harry, Goblet of Fire saga moved up to Harry's 7th year with different scenarios before that. Story set in modern times with modern technology. Hp/F, A/U (Revamped and Reborn)
