I'm trying to find a fic that I think was on ao3. Severus and Lucius find out they had a son, Harry who was hidden from them by Lily and Dumbledore. They are able to rescue him from the Dursleys and make him part of the family. Harry is maybe like 3 at this point. There is an adjustment period and he refuses to sit at the table. So the whole family sits on the floor. Draco is adorable and makes an awesome big brother. There is a counselor who is helping Harry who is dating Narcissa. The boys get snakes for Christmas.

It's a very adorable family fic. There is also some sort of court case thing where Lucius almost ends up in Azkaban.
