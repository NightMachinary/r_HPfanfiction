I'd love to read anything you recommend. It would be great if it is more than 50 thousand words but even if it's less and it's really good I'd love to read it too. So please hit me with fluff, angst, slow burn, AU,time travel and anything in between. It would be good if it has abused characters like Harry or even Hermione.


** I don't have a Snarry or Snamione but I do have a Snily that's very long longfic, including slow burn, fluff, action and everything in between. Let me know if you're interested.

I have three more chapters to post before it's completely finished. :) It's also on AO3 under the same username if you prefer that platform.

** Oooooh I GOT YOU!! Snamione is my favorite fanfic ship! I personally enjoy downloading super long fics to my kindle app on my phone and I've got a couple! Let me know if you don't like certain things (like tropes or whatever!) bear with me, I'm on mobile and currently at work (hiding my phone from my bosses of course!)

--- First off, absolutely my favorite is: “And They Didn't Live Happily Ever After” - Betz

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4786826/chapters/10953149]]

“"I'm Just a Gigolo" challenge. Harry asks Hermione a favor, but it will lead her to question her own marriage to Ron. Can Hermione continue to find contentment in a mediocre marriage and a completely unfulfilling sex life? When Hermione begins to see a gigolo for conversation and companionship, the foundation of her life is shaken to the core from revelations concerning every aspect of her life.“

*/Just...it's long, slow burn, and beautiful. It is absolutely chock full of smutty goodness, BUT there is so much more to the story it's crazy! I just love the relationship between Ron and Hermione and the portrayal. It's literally how I imagine it would have been in canon. Severus Snape is written very well, and he and Draco are not just, suddenly forgiven from being death eaters, however, it's a redemption story and both Severus and Draco are portrayed rather positively, especially later on in the story./*

--- “Pet Project” -Caeria:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4772936/chapters/10916501]]

“Hermione overhears something she shouldn't concerning Professor Snape and decides that maybe the House-elves aren't the only ones in need of protection.”

*/Now this one does include a school aged Hermione, however, I believe she is of age when anything actually occurs between her and Severus. I haven't read this in a while, but it is a very slow burn. She basically figures out Severus' being a spy, kind of starts to realize no one actually cares for him and makes it her mission to let him know that she does. Honestly, it is of the purest intentions she really doesn't set out to “get with” her teacher. But eventually they do end up falling in love and it's wonderfully written./*

--- “Chasing the Sun” - Loten:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7413926/1/Chasing-The-Sun]]

“AU, from Order of the Phoenix onwards. Hermione only wanted to learn Healing; she discovers that Professor Snape is a human being after all, and his actions dramatically shape the course of the war as events unfold.”

*/Now I swear this one had an AO3 link, because I never read my fics anywhere but there if I can help it but either way, I download onto my kindle app anyways so it doesn't matter but OH MY GOODNESS THIS IS AN AMAZING FIC I was trying to remember literally anything I could for fics and this one popped into my head and I'm pretty sure this one might even beat “And They Didn't Live Happily Ever After”. Now this fic is also a slow burn (a trend, really I love slow burns!) it also takes place while in school, but Hermione is of age, as usual. It's set during the war and the characters are wrote beautifully. Hermione learns healing but finds out about Snape. She takes care of him and learns quite a bit about her professor and actually starts to care quite a bit for him. Gosh, this one is so good, I'm going to need to reread this very soon./*

--- Second Life - Lariope

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/311126/chapters/498237]]

“Hermione is forced to lead a double life when she agrees to Dumbledore's plan to protect Professor Snape. Follows a (mostly) canonical timeline through books 6 and 7. Warning for student/teacher relationship, though Hermione is of age.”

*/like I said, a lot of people don't like fics from where Hermione isn't out of school but, they're my personal favorite and I always read ones where she is of the age of consent before the relationship/sexual interactions occur. This one is more canon, it's pretty well written and close to canon. Dumbledore is kind of...interesting in this one. Very pushy of Severus I suppose. I don't think it is a full on Dumbledore bashing fic though. Dobby also plays a big part! Now this one isn't the best story ever and the plot is pretty similar to others but, I think it's a pretty good read and worth a look. It kept my interest and I do look back at it with fondness and would read it again for sure!/*

I definitely have more, but as I said, I'm at work but I will dig around and try to remember others I've read, especially some with adult Hermione and time travel as I know more of those as well!

*** OMG! Thank you so much!!!! I'm new to this ship but I always believed that they make a wonderful couple. And I already know that I love long fics with Severus Snape as my one and only prince.

**** Oh gosh they are my favorite! They fit together so well! I mean, it's an age difference which bothers some people but myself being in a relationship with a significant age difference, I really enjoy it!

He's amazing though, really. I will keep looking for some more though!
