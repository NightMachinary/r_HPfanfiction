People are started on Vanishing with slugs, then mice, and Hermione is at one point said to have moved on to Kittens.

Think about it, and think about the mistakes that Vanishing produces - in the books, it's described as half-vanishing something, or only vanishing things like bones or skin or muscles. So Hermione was just sitting in that room making the bones of little Kittens disappear.

Not to mention, if it's possible to Vanish kittens, then it's possible to vanish other mammals of that size.

Also like people have died in the Triwizard turnament before and while they took precautions that only adult wizards could partake - look how it worked out.

The everchanging teachers in Defence against the dark arts. I know the post is cursed but like couldn't they have given the teaching post to a teacher who wasn't gonna try to curse a student or trying to kill them? The only teacher in that subject who wasn't involved in anything of that matter was Snape and that is saying something.

Quirrel turned out to be Voldemort and he tried to kill Harry

Lockhart tried to Obliviate Harry and Ron and was willing to leave Ginny behind to die

Lupin well he was nice but he tried to attack Harry Ron and Hermione as a Werewolf

Moody wasn't Moody but Barty Crouch Jr and he actively tried to have Harry killed and he killed his father on schoolgrounds and used unforgiveables on students.

Umbridge sent Dementors to Privet drive to literally have Harry assassinated, the blood quill and she tried to use the Cruciatus on Harry

Severus Snape - no noteworthy incident apart from the fact that he was mean. He killed Dumbledore but Dumbledore asked him to so that doesn't count.

Amycus Carrow - actual Death Eater used dark curses on Students and forced students to use dark Curses on other students

*** Broom cupboards are never mentioned as romantic destinations in cannon - it all comes from fanfiction.

First mention is in CoS where Binns says: "There is not a shred of evidence that Slytherin ever built so much as a secret broom cupboard"

Then there are several mentions in GoF because Skeeter interviews Harry in one:\\
"“Let's see . . . ah, yes, this is nice and cozy.” It was a broom cupboard. Harry stared at her."\\
"...it cannot take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard."\\
"...things that he couldn't remember ever saying in his life, let alone in that broom cupboard."

Mentioned a few times in OotP:\\
"...where a door on the left stood ajar, revealing a broom cupboard, and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifacts. Mr. Weasley's dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard."\\
"We once hid from Filch in here, remember, George? But it was just a broom cupboard then. . . ."\\
"...peering around the hall as though hopeful [Dumbledore] might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard"

Hell, I remember a few injuries when we played football during breaks. If you got a wound, you washed it out with some water and played on unless you were bleeding all over the place. In that case, you hobbled to the "infirmary", where you got a bandage and were told to go back to class since the break was over.

Then after he calls Lily a Mudblood they flip him upside down again and James says "Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's pants?" In England "pants" is used to refer to boxers or underwear. Present Snape then wrenches Harry out of the memory.

They committed a bad enough (in my opinion) sexually charged attack by showing everyone his underwear then then were perfectly fine with exposing his genitals to everyone as well.

Read that scene but read it as though Snape were a woman instead. Then tell me how absolutely horrific that entire memory is.

  The Dursleys undoubtedly treated Harry very badly when he was a child, but did they have reason to fear or distrust magic? No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. One-shot. Complete.
