I've been posting on ff.net for like eight years, but I've started uploading a lot of my fics onto Archive of our own as well. I really like it, and I'm hoping that more authors will do the same.

In general, the tags are really helpful. And I particularly like being able to sort fics into "verses."

But I'm still learning how to navigate it.

The tag system is fantastic when you're looking for fics about a certain character, but if you're looking for a fic about, say, Petunia, fics with 30+ character tags will pop up, and you'll have to scroll through fics in which Petunia probably has one line.

I also see fics tagged with things like "Growing up" and I'm wondering if there's a way to see the most popular non-character/relationship tags within a fandom.

Speaking of fandoms, is there a way to filter out crossovers sometimes?

I also don't get the rating system. Is there a way to say, I want "Mature" and all fics below that? Or anything above "teen"?

Is there a way to filter by genre?

My other issue is that I have very boring tastes. I mostly read canon couples and minor character couples that could reasonably be canon (i.e., I'll read Neville/Luna but not Ginny/Luna or Luna/Draco). I don't read a lot of HP slash or femslash, with the exception of Remus/Sirius. I'm not sure if there's a way to filter for certain couples or to make sure that, say, Harry/Draco doesn't come up when I search for Scorpius fics.

I'm trying to get used to the search feature as a separate page rather than a sidebar. There is a sidebar, but it only appears some of the time.

Sorry for all of the questions, I'm just really used to ff.net, and it's strange being on a learning curve.

Any search tips/suggestions for a newbie?


** I use AO3 just about as much as I use fanfiction.net, and many of the problems you highlighted I completely agree with. The search feature is at once much more complex than ff.net and much more limited. It makes for a very different browsing experience. Unfortunately, they don't really have solutions that I know of.

When you are looking for a fic centered on one character, like your example with Petunia, and a lot come up with tons of character tags, what I generally do is look for ones (and by look I mean actually using your eyes and browsing, which is pretty inefficient) where the character I want is in a pairing, or look for ones that only have a few characters. She's much more likely to be an important or central figure in those. You'll also have to read the descriptions. Unfortunately, this is one instance when AO3 is inferior to fanfiction.net.

I don't know if there is any way to see a ranking of the most popular tags within a fandon, unfortunately. I also don't know of any way to avoid crossovers.

For the ratings -- to my knowledge, you can only search for one rating at a time. If you want to see teen and up, start with teen, browse through, and work your way up. This is how I do it, but there could be a vastly more efficient way that I am unaware of.

Again, I don't think you can filter by genre, but you can search for specific genres. One of the big limitations on AO3 that used to be a limitation on fanfiction.net as well until recently, is that you can't do negative searches. You can't say, I want to see all Harry and Hermione fics except those with Romance as a genre (which is the search I use on ff.net when I want good Harry Hermione fluff and friendship while avoiding HHr romance).

And finally, the biggest difference between AO3 and ff.net is that as you've noticed, slash is way more popular on AO3. I personally have very broad tastes and read almost equal amounts of het and slash, so I don't mind, but I can see where if slash isn't your cup of tea this would get annoying. There's not much to do about that, since AO3 was originally formed because of ff.net's restrictions to provide an archive where you could post pretty much whatever you wanted, and such is life. Again, to my knowledge there is no way to do negative searches or filter out certain content, so you'll just have to try. I made the mistake once of trying to find a Harry/Ginny fic on AO3. Plenty came up with that tag, but almost all of them were past Harry/Ginny and future or current Harry/Draco. Which I have certainly enjoyed reading before, but wasn't what I was looking for at that time. Now I just go to AO3 for slash, and when I want het I use ff.net or other sites.

I'm really sorry I can't be of more help!

*** A few quick questions, as you seem to know what's up:

The few times I've perused the site, it seemed to have been mostly slash, smut, or both, at least in the Harry Potter sections. Is that still the case?

As I primarily write non-smut fiction, I'm wondering whether I'll get many eyes looking at my stories if I join the site. Is the site expanding beyond that niche?

Also, what's a typical wait time for an invite nowadays? I remember trying for one several months ago (maybe a year?) but giving up.

Thanks!

*** You were fantastic, thank you!

I think the best solution to the tag thing is to do a negative search on characters that shouldn't be relevant to the kind of story I'm reading. (i.e., for Petunia, adding -Draco).

I haven't spent much time looking for specifically H/G fics, but I've actually been having good luck with gen fics.

** Except for Harry Potter fics I read all the rest of my fandoms on A03. I have no big problem finding fics although its different. I'm glad to see more authors like you using them as I love features like being able to download a mobi with one click.

It did take Ariel to get used to their searches and such, what's your user name on a03 so we can check out your stories.
