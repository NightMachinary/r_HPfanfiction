I've read Butterfly, To Have and to Want, and Parvati's diary.

  Slightly AU, post-GOF. A Harry/Parvati epic. Civil war is coming to wizarding Britain, and Harry's role will be a complicated one. Very manipulative Dumbledore, with some revisions to early canon. Harry will have a backbone in this one. Rated M. Enjoy!

**** Is where the author left off ok? I don't want to read the whole thing just to be left at a cliff hanger.

**** True, though at 187k words, there's still a good bit to read.
