Seriously, I just want stories that read well.

I don't care that much about ships, or OOC, or complete rewrites, or tropes, or whatever. I'm flexible about all of that. I just want fics that look like actual pieces of writing instead of the rough draft of an 8 year old's first school essay.

I also love long stories (Sacrifices Arc is top tier fanfic), but that's of lesser concern.


** This one is fairly long and reads very well:

** This is kind of an aside, but I don't agree with the implication that Sacrifices is well edited. I very much enjoyed it, and it probably remains one of my favourite fanfics, but my god, it needs seriously cutting back in places, especially towards the end (i.e. the last three or four books, each of which is over 500k words).

*** I find a few other problems with the Sacrifices series:

1. It also suffers from what a great many slash stories do: the "now everybody's gay" syndrome. A good rule of thumb is to be realistic with it and keep it at a one to six character ratio TOPS. Not half the main cast. As someone who doesn't find that particularly appealing on a sexual level, it removes some of the things I do like about slash: the fact that being gay is special and therefore involves a lot of dealing with societal norms, self discovery, and reaching a balance with the world in a way I am unfamiliar with.

2. Angst for the sake of angst. The story tries way too hard to be dark for it to actually be convincing. As opposed to (for instance) canon or The Snape Chronicles where the darkness creeps into the story in such a way that it doesn't seem standard, this story just feels that it loses it's edge. A tragedy doesn't stand out if everything is just a long list of tragedies, and angst doesn't stand out with a backdrop of more angst.

3. Slytherins aren't actually cunning. This is my main problems with Slytherin-centric stories. Snape is neither cunning nor ambitious, the Malfoys may be ambitious but aren't actually clever about it... and so on. While it's nice showing that Slytherins have their own sense of honor and traditions, basically saying a bunch of pureblood traditions is enough to make someone Slytherin is just missing the point.

4. Tends to repeat points over and over. Lily was obsessed with sacrifices, brainwashed, etc. James was self-centered and unapologetic. We get it, no reason to have 30 different scenes depicting it. It loses the emotional impact way too fast that way.

5. The protagonist and antagonist are so overly powerful as to render the supporting cast as useless as something other than glorified pets. We all know it'll come down to a showdown between Harry and Voldemort, and while Voldemort is exceptionally powerful, in this story it makes it ridiculous that the moment Dumbledore dies he doesn't just walk right into the ministry and take over England.

6. Harry is too selfless and one-dimensional, and it gets grating. Snape is not a smart person here, and lacks the self awareness of a teen (which is downright ridiculous for a spy). Those are two of the main characters, and while it makes up for it with a convincing Draco, Pansy, and a slew of others, this has to be noted.

Of course, there's the overly verbose and lengthy style of writing which is not particularly to my liking. That being said, the story avoids the major pitfall of super!Harry stories by making sure we have a super!Voldemort to face off against him. And the English is far more palatable than most.

**** I agree with a lot of these, and it's what I meant when I said the story needed an editing, which I felt would have helped significantly with 2, 4 and 6.

With 1, I didn't feel this. Perhaps it is because I am coming at this from a different angle than you (I'm bi), or perhaps it is because the social set up in the world is portrayed very differently to ours (there seems to be no social stigma around homosexuality, nor from what I can remember, anything approaching sexuality as an identity). It has been a while since I last read it though.

With 3, I don't think that each of the houses actually are braver/clever/harder working/more cunning etc than others, I always interpreted it as being about what you prioritise more, what you think is more worthwhile. Hermione is in Gryffindor not because she isn't smart enough to be in Ravenclaw, but because standing up for what you believe in is more important to her. Just because Slytherins like the idea of cunning, doesn't mean they are any good at it.

With 5, I do think it could be toned down a bit, though one of the things I liked about the series was the attempt to portray a world which did have these wide disparities in (raw) power. Though I did feel that the non-Lord characters could still get things done, and (with planning) could actually take down a Lord e.g. Dumbledore's "timeout".

***** As to point 1, I said that this is a problem for me personally (the average? straight male reader) - because once you remove the sexual aspect, I find these things to be my main draw in slash. Well, either that or some aesthetic in the sexualization like a D/s relationship which I can appreciate.

As to point 3, it's not so much that the characters start off that way - but what you learn in the house. The sorting hat told Harry he could /become/ great in Slytherin as the reason to send him there; it denotes that you learn to think through the lens of house values and they help you develop those traits. Neville didn't start brave, but he damn well ended up that way. Which is why it pained me so much to read Snape as a Hufflepuff - don't get me wrong, Hufflepuff is an awesome house, but his motivations were loyalty to Slytherin and then to Harry, and he worked hard towards those aims, but he wasn't cunning, subtle, or clever about these things (on the contrary, eleven year old Harry casually outmaneuvers him from the get-go).

As to point 5, the most extreme thing non-lords did was being distractions or sacrifices. They are so obvious cannon fodder that needs to be protected and cared for because they can't do that themselves that it really would be served better by removing Harry and Voldemort altogether to make their struggles feel important. If Voldemort can just enter the ministry and kill everyone with ease, then the ministry was never relevant to the struggle - it cheapens the fall, and makes the groundwork his army did a waste of time. While the concept is interesting, it puts too much weight on Harry and Voldemort and therefore the others /can't/ shine (they were never important enough to matter except in how they make Harry feel).

** It's well known but Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness is well written and well edited. Post Tenebras, Lux/Chasing the Sun are 'clean' and polished iirc. HPMOR is written stunningly well but is still being updated.

The Hogwarts Fanfiction Academy is a bit meta so it's not directly HP fanfic (more fanfic of fanfic) but it's funny if you like parody/tongue in cheek humour and it struck me as reading well. (Unfortunately the sequel doesn't - it's written well, I'm sure, but for some reason there are no speech marks until Chapter 14. I don't know why.)

Oh, and Holly Evans and the Spiral Path is very good.

There are some stories were by the style of speech alone you can determine who is speaking---Hermione, Dumbledore, Snape or Arthur Weasley.

And then there are stories like DE were everyone sounds the same and out of character to the point of making the story unreadable.

****** That's actually a question that nobody has answered sufficiently: just how meta does Delenda Est go? It can be read as blissfully unaware super!Harry, where it seems the only ones fighting the war 24/7 are Harry his girlfriend and Snape, but other than Harry nobody is really relevant, and Snape is shoved under the rug whenever not showing that he's a git. Harry takes on fifty death eaters at a time alone and with no backup? Easy. The Order? At home with their families because that's how Dumbledore rolls. Oh, and everyone in the Order is happily married with beautiful happy babies and is living happily ever after except for Snape, because he's a git.

But... like many stories like this, there's the meta-level, where the author is actually playing around with the cliches. A good part of this story can be viewed as very humorously meta, like that line.

Then there's the debate: should we expect each story to stand on it's own, therefore making the meta aspect irrelevant? And the counterpoint: we're already starting out from the Harry Potter universe, so we're meta anyways. And the counterargument to that is that we're already as meta as we need to be without losing touch with actual literature... and so on.

If you disregard the meta aspects of Delenda Est, it's rather childish and the characters lack distinction other than super, not-super, and stupid. If you assume that meta-writing is both legitimate and used abundantly, it's actually a refreshingly good story.

******* It just depends on if you trust the author or not. It's the same back-and-forth you get with discussions about /My Immortal/. Do you trust the author to understand what he/she is doing, or not?

I like your approach to it, but I don't buy the last counter-counter argument. It's a good point that our starting point is a work of fiction based on another work of fiction, so in a sense we are "meta already." I don't think it follows that it means you should automatically rein in any kind of references or allusions that are just there for the readers to pick up on and not the characters themselves. That kind of writing is its own accepted style, and without it we wouldn't have /The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,/ and that would make the world way worse.

I think if you insist on reading every HP fanfic as its own story without acknowledging the way it interacts with fanon/canon, you're going to miss out on some great stories.

******** Well, H2G2 is plenty strong on a stand-alone level, making the entire point moot. Something more controversial like Lolita would have been a better example, but still, it's a book that's so good it makes people empathize with a pedophile without understanding the huge amount of references as well.

The point is that a story that is built too heavily on the meta-aspects is aimed at people who are fluent in them, while many great stories manage to do that and be solid all around. My Immortal is purely meta on the level of enjoyment. I read a ton of Harry Potter fanfics, yet it feels like the author was too busy patting themselves on the back for being inconsistent and worse-than-terrible. Delenda Est has a huge advantage as it manages to balance both levels far better, but it still isn't anything special on the standard literature level.

The problem with Delenda Est is that the play is in a very small sandbox, compared to Stages of Hope, which manages to do the referential thing not only in a more developed way within the HP-verse (poking fun at AU and angst themes while still using them intelligently, HGSS stereotypes, character bashing, etc) and without (Monty Python and various other British humor references, plenty of literary plays on themes, etc), but manages to be more well rounded on the character level as well.

That being said, I'm talking about pretentious analysis as pertaining for what I find enjoyable. I do enjoy the interactions with canon/fanon (hence, Stages of Hope being one of my top five), but they are not enough to carry a story on their own for my tastes.
