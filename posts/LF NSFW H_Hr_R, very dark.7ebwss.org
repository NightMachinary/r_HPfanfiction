Okay, I have a fic, but I can't remember the name. Harry, Ron and Hermione are caught on the and Bellatrix repeatedly rapes Harry. Harry is messed up afterwards, and Ron and Hermione basically sexy threesome him back together while they recover in Grimmauld place. Then in the epilogue Harry has mostly normal hate-sex with Draco before moving on to Ginny. Obviously has a ton of dark themes including rape and suicide.

*** I'm very disappointed that he still ended up with Ginny in this fic.

**** Yeah, I was too. The fact that everything basically reverted to cannon at the end is was kind of a let down. I don't mind the H/G pairing - I know some people hate it - but it didn't really feel appropriate here. I guess it was basically the authors way of showing that Harry was 'healed'.

Eh, I doubt most people hate H/G specifically, it's more the lack of Ginny's characterization in canon - and (for me) Ginny presumably inheritting Molly's overbearing nature.

  On the hunt for the Horcruxes, the trio are captured and subjected to horrors at the hands of the Death Eaters. This is more than just a torture fic, it chronicles their lives, their struggles, and their relationships in the aftermath.
