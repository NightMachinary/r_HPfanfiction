There're two betrayals in the books made by teenagers: by Marrietta and by Ron.

​

Marrietta was threatened with her mother's job in the Ministry and under it told about an unauthorized club to the school administration. For that she got permanent scars on /her face/.

​

Ron turned his back to Harry in their 4th year. Then during the Hunt he run away because of pressure and his doubts in success, and as result it might lead to losing the whole war.

All three teenagers were under influence of the horcrux and therefore I don't see it as a big argument.

​

What is the difference in their actions? Why are Marrietta's scars justified, but Ron's actions were swept under the rug?

If you use her punishment as baseline, what did Ron deserve?


** I don't think that's a good comparison.

Ron made decisions for himself. You can say that makes him a bad friend or an idiot, but it's not betrayal in the way of Marietta. If Ron had left, found some Snatchers, and then pointed those Snatchers in Harry's direction, that would be Ron pulling a Marietta.

Marietta had the right to leave the group, decide they're all crazy and call Harry a gloryhound. She took it farther though. She decided to turn the group in, reveal their secrets, and possibly get them all expelled. She didn't just 'turn her back'. She stabbed them in the back. Sure, it's a school club, but it's a school club that was created to help them defend themselves from a bunch of murderers. It's a school club that brought people together when Voldemort took control and contributed fighters to the Battle of Hogwarts. It seems like defending Marietta often starts with dismissing the importance of the DA because it's a 'school club', but it was important. She deliberately sabotaged something important.

**** But Umbridge did not know that Marietta was a member. Marietta thought it would earn her some good girl points. Whatever her mother and Umbridge had going on, it was not related to the DA. That's why her betrayal was so severe.

She was not under pressure, she betrayed the DA in the hopes that it might help her mother keep her job in the Politburo, fully knowing what kind of people she was selling the DA to. I mean, Harry wasn't wearing gloves 24/7 and neither was Lee. Everyone could imagine what would happen should the DA be revealed to the woman who tortured her students over disagreeing with her and the +Party+ Ministry.

****** Marietta is preventing the only effective training the Hogwarts students can get. Which can easily lead to a lot of dead families if we look at the average Death Eater and their mediocre combat ability. And everyone at the DA knew that Voldemort was back.

And that still does not explain why Marietta sells them out. "I am not coming anymore, my Mum might lose her job" would already cut it. But no, she goes to Umbridge and sells the DA out to the woman who has been torturing students and enforced arbitrary rules with an iron fist.

Half-serious school course of defence, which isn't even on the level of NEWTs, against DEs?

This is a false argument. Only a fool (or a child) can think that a student can teach to fight full trained killers.

*********** If we remove “idiot ball” from the series, we won't have the series to talk about. In the canon Death Eaters were feared even with absence of Riddle. Harry didn't taught others to fight for their lives, he taught just some useful spells, nothing more. Any Auror would wipe the floor with him, he was advanced, but still a 5th year student.

It is unreasonable to suppose that he gave something critical to survival. For example, how does the Shield Charm protects from Avada or Crucio?

You know there's a possibility that Harry involuntarily guilty for students deaths during the Final Battle. If they didn't played fake heroes, escaped and left to (ex) aurors to deal with DEs after Riddle is gone, there were fewer deaths.

************ Except that most of the Ministry was collaborating and the DA was direly needed as manpower. Most people seemed to be alright with Voldemort's reign. There was no open rebellion outside of the Order.

Their biggest mistake was not properly defending the walls. I mean, Mandrakes are supposedly lethal to anyone who hears their cry. So all you'd need is a single one to wipe out the entire human opposition.

Next comes the utterly wasted advantageous position. Hogwarts is a fortified hilltop with hundreds of yards of open ground surrounding it, with bridges possibly even funneling the enemies. All the defenders had to do was throw area of effect spells in the general direction of the Death Eaters and their assault would be stopped. Blow the bridges while the Death Eaters are on them for even easier carnage. Honestly, at least some of the defenders ought to know that kind of basic tactics. Tonks and Kingsley were trained Aurors. McGonagall had fought in the first war, Flitwick was a duelling champion. But their leadership was utterly abysmal. The only one who had the right idea was Sprout, but even she failed to utilise her "easy mode" weapon. Yes, the other side has magic as well, but the Death Eaters did not go into Battle with hearing protection and by the time they would have noticed the danger it would already be too late. You don't even have to throw the mandrakes over the battlements. Wait till the Death Eaters reach the gates, make one cry and GG, you just wiped out most of Voldemort's forces.

***************** Agreed!

Them needing the DA shows how BADLY the war had gone for the "light" side! Their leaving the bad guys alive and firing stunners, instead of killing curses didn't pay off! Even more so if you take into account that the average Deatheater is also quite crappy if you compare them to say a Delta-Force Soldier (or the SAS/SBS)!

Normally, without the "Idiot Ball" the good guys (they had the Aurors, which are at least somewhat trained, not to mention the veterans from the first war) should have won!

Fact however is that they didn't!

In fact without the DA (despite them fighting without any tactics! Seriously, I was never a soldier but even I know about choke-points, crossfires, ambushes, high-ground, fortifications, kill-boxes (a place with very effective crossfire of multiple weapons), force-multipliers (like the mentioned mandrake or magical-explosives) etc. etc. - ok, I do have an interest in military arms and tactics and I play strategy-games, but it's not like I truly studied military-tactics! Learning about this takes less than an hour and it can be easily implemented even with wands instead of machine-guns!), they'd have LOST!

So yeah, Marieatta's betrayal could be taken as helping Voldemort (indirectly and without wanting to, she isn't on his side after all!), because with the DA out of the picture? They lose! Hell, I doubt that Harry can't take most of the fifth and sixth years in a fight! They might know some more spells, but then again: So does Hermione and Harry would still obliterate her in an open confrontation!

As for her disfigurement: I think it's her own magic reinforcing the curse (she believes she deserves her punishment deep down! That's why she can't be healed/cured!), otherwise I bet a cursebreaker could lift the curse (it's not like Hermione is at Voldemort's level (DADA-Curse!) - far from it in fact!)

****************** Funny things about the Battle of Hogwarts:

- The light side has 50 losses to mourn. Even adding the remaining order and the DA, you fail to reach that number. Which means they called forth more fighters who pretty much just came there to die and did nothing noteworthy it seems (other than dying).

- By the time of the final showdown, only Voldemort and Bellatrix were left. So somehow, after being soundly defeated and only spared by Voldemort's ceasefire, the light side won the day.

- Therefore, the most effective weapon seems to be arrows, followed by kitchen utensils. One cannot help but wonder what would have happened if the defenders had access to some real weapons like machine guns or mortars, nevermind some of the more cruel tools of war (gas shells for artillery, napalm, ToT artillery barrages). Hell, I'd pay good money to see the Winged Hussars charge down the Death Eaters.

If fact, in the 6th book he struggled with the DATA course. Yes, may be it's was because of Snape, but it also shows that he can't control his emotions in the serious fight and therefore not reliable in it.

** Because Ron did NOT "betray" Harry. Both of these were simple misunderstandings between best friends, the second one exacerbated by the Horcrux. That, and also the fact that Harry explicitly told Ron to leave at least twice. How is it that when Ron follows his orders, he's now an evul betrayer? Also, you forget that Ron wanted immediately to come back, but he wasn't able to because of the Snatchers, and by the time the danger had passed, Harry and Hermione had already left. This was more akin to Ron wanting to getting out of the house to get some fresh air after an argument, rather than intentionally deserting them for months.

And even with respect to /Goblet of Fire/, I'd say that it is /Harry/ who acted worse. As I've written here before, it is canon that the only one who cared about the "death toll" aspect of the Tournament, prior to the Goblet selecting the names, was Hermione. Both Ron and Harry explicitly expressed interest in entering before their fight. For example, Ron thinks that it would be "cool" to enter, and Harry agrees, with images of winning and Cho "showing admiration" in his mind.

Ron isn't aware of any plot targeting Harry (and Harry doesn't even bother to tell Ron of the potential plot brewing against him), he just has Harry's previous comments about the Tournament to go on. Harry expressly states how he would have done it and when Harry's name pops out of the Goblet, unfortunately Ron thinks Harry betrayed him. Harry doesn't even bother to say why he feels that someone would want to kill him, so Ron has nothing to go on.

Ron is clearly trying to be happy for Harry. But when Ron repeats Harry's own words back to him, Harry implies that Ron is stupid. It is only after Harry reacts less than positively that Ron gives up trying to actively support his friend. even when they are not talking, Ron is very concerned about Harry. When Harry breaks the conversation off with Sirius, it is Harry who overreacts: he decides he hates everything about Ron, throws a badge at his head and doesn't apologize for it, starts shouting at him, and storms upstairs to the dormitory. Ron just stands there and takes it.

And if we're to talk about "betrayal", that is actually Ron's main emotion during the fight (not jealousy, as Hermione asserts, which may actually have inadvertently prolonged the fight, given that after what Hermione said, Harry no longer wants to talk sense into Ron, but instead prefers to play the retrenchment card). Ron clearly wanted to "go-it-together" and to attempt with Harry to place both their names in. But that doesn't happen, and so Ron does not expect Harry's name to come out. Had they actually did it together, like Ron wanted, and Harry's name still came out, do you really think we would have seen the fight?

Ron obviously was wrong about what truly happened, but it definitely wasn't a betrayal.

** Let's try not to forget one thing. Ron did not leave Harry and Hermione to go and report them to the Death Eaters. He just left, arguably to get a little space, and found himself unable to return, fought off a band of snatchers and spent every waking our trying to go back. Marietta could have just quit the DA. Nobody would fault her. But there was nothing pressuring her to report them.

Ron abandoned them, and even then there are factors to consider like the horcrux's influence and his Intentions. But Marietta betrayed them.

  Why are Marrietta's scars justified, but Ron's actions were swept under the rug?
#+end_quote

Because Ron is a primary character whereas Marietta is a one appearance mook.

Nobody cares about Marietta (although the contract is very frequently used to bash Hermione when an author is out to get her), whereas a rift in the trio has big plot implications.

That said, the acne scars (were they really permanent? I don't remember that) are way too much punishment, and IMO Ron's punishment should have simply been being cut off from H&H's confidence for good (I wouldn't have taken him back, how do you trust him after that? Especially if you think it's the horcrux's fault, considering there were more to gather). It's not like he was duty bound to help them or anything, it was his choice of having confidence in his friends or not.

** Marietta probably has the scars because she believes she DESERVES THEM!

Magic in HP after all has an emotional component and if she even partially believes she deserves the pimples etc. then her magic will reinforce them and fight their removal! Frankly IMHO the scars/pimples etc. would only fully go away if she thinks herself redeemed!

As for the actions: Marietta could have simply lied (or not said anything at all and all would have been hunky-dory!), but she actively went to Umbridge!

Ron (as much as I despise this waste of perfectly good air and space!) was just an immature jealous asshole (and under the mental influence of the 'crux the second time he betrayed Harry), but he didn't go out of his way to snitch to professors and endanger dozens of students etc.

** I think many people think Ron got off far too easy. That's one of the reasons we have so many Weasly/Ron bashing fics or fics where Ron gets the shaft in some way. For me he did not deserve to end up with Hermione. Now I'm a diehard Harmony shipper, but at the very least I'd think that Ron turning his back in DH would lead to an irrevocable break in trust. In my mind someone like Hermione can never get in a relationship again with someone like that. Friendship maybe, but not romance and certainly not so easily as in canon.

But I also think that in fourth year Harry has faced mockery and disdain for a long time when Ron comes around, so having a friend back is a big relief for him. For a person with few friends he might be much quicker to forgive. In DH it's a pretty desolate and desperate situation before and after Ron leaves. Him returning might bring enough solace to overlook certain things a little easier.

#+begin_quote
  The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry's mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron's left side and his face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth.

  ............

  Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron's shirt. He had always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . . His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron's up- per arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. (Chapter 14)

Hermione couldn't fix the wounds completely by magical means either.

#+begin_quote

But you don't give a rat's fart, do you, it's only the Forbidden Forest, Harry /I've-Faced-Worse/ Potter doesn't care what happens to her in here --- well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff ---”

  “I was only saying --- she was with the others, they were with Hagrid ---”

  “Yeah, I get it, you don't care! And what about the rest of my family, ‘the Weasleys don't need another kid injured,' did you hear that?” (Chapter 15)

His family, his blood loss, the horcrux, and the fact that he is told to leave.

At this point, you can either sympathize with Ron's plight or not. I just think that him and Marietta should not be in the same sentence. Ron is as loyal as they come. He has *two* fights with Harry in seven years. He's personally offered to sacrifice and/or has sacrificed himself for Harry or Hermione in at LEAST *three* separate occasions. (Chessboard, Sirius, Malfoy Manor). It's really not comparable at all.

*** I personally always found the Ron/Hermione ship to be really dubious. Their personalities clash horribly, and the only thing that really ties them together at all is everything they (and Harry) did in their adventures. I can, at best, see them try a relationship, but in the end realize that they really don't work well romantically together.

However, I'm not part of the Ron bash bandwagon -- I think he got off too easy, but he's not a bad person.

I personally don't ship Harry/Hermione, because it's pretty clear from the books that Harry never feels anything for her. They do, however, match decently personality-wise, so add romantic tension and the ship isn't implausible.

****** Interesting, if somewhat opinionated essay. I think the author makes a lot of good points, although some of the statements are mere facts that the author is referencing as opinion to prove a point. It's also missing some much needed balance since it argues from one stance only, dismissing all counterpoints as being signs of friendship. It also of course only covers the first five books. I think there are definite cases to be made one way or the other and the author provides very solid reasoning.

Although many won't consider it as canon, very understably so, the movies play a big role in Harmony. I think Emma Watson embodies the Hermione we see in a lot of fics more than book Hermione. And the movies really play up a possible Harry/Hermione pairing. Taking movie Hermione into consideration the possibility for the pairing becomes a lot clearer in my eyes, certainly compared to Harry/Ginny and Hermione/Ron.

But this argument has been done to death many times over. Luckily we have FanFiction to explore all the different options for us.

This so much. Ron isn't some evil reincarnated with a pinch of Stalin's spirit. However, he does not handle pressure or his emotions very well and has rather questionable priorities. The Locket shows this very well. Instead of a "Dead Weasley Slideshow" like Molly's boggart, his biggest worry in the middle of a civil war is whether his best mate has shagged the girl he stormed away from. He should be begging for forgiveness, not worrying if Hermione sucked Harry's dick to put it bluntly.
