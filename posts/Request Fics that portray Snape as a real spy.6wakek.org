I just want fics that show Snape as an actual spy with two masters: Voldemort and Dumbledore, while balancing his whole life. I'd love if the fic actually showed his talent / power.


** Unfortunately there aren't many fics like that. It's a damn shame because Spinner's End showed Snape at his best.

linkao3(Swung by Serafim by flamethrower) has him try to balance his spy persona with his real personality.

linkffn(Darkness Visible by plutoplex) I hesitate to recommend this because it gets over the top and some characterizations are off, but the whole two masters thing is emphasized.

*** Darkness Visible is interesting, [[/spoiler][especially when Grindelwald comes into play,]] but some situations in the beginning felt very off to me.

** linkffn(7937889) "A Difference in the Family: a Snape Chronicles" is a fic about Snape from conception to burial and it is canon compliant in the loosest sense. But it definitely gets characterizations rights and Snape working as a double agent in the First and Second Wars is really emphasized and you can really feel the pressure he's under. Without going into too many details I think it does fulfill your "two masters" requirement and it displays how stuck he feels between them. It is my all time favorite and one of the best.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
