I was reading a fic where in one of the books a character was reading, Voldemort was only referred to as V___ and my mind instantly went to the mentioned movie and the long monologues full of V words that were made. I want a Voldemort that does that. Maybe he's super charming or actually a revolutionary like V was, or maybe it's a crossover fic - use your imagination.

This is the fic I was reading if anyone is interested:

  Harriet Potter has always been odd. Between having a shadow that moves on its own and chatting with snakes in the garden, learning she's a witch really isn't the strangest thing that's happened to the bespectacled girl with a lightning scar on her neck. [Fem!Harry, Slytherin!Harry, AU Retelling]
