Pretty self explanatory but Gryffindor!Harry with a pet/familiar snake! I'd love to read the reactions of the Gryffindors and Slytherins pretty please xx please no 1st POV, mpreg or time travel xx :)


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/][Seventh Horcrux]], 'Harry' kept a pet snake for some time, but other people were nonchalant about it

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12592097/1/][Harry Potter and the Lady Thief]], Harry has a pet snake he keeps at his home. But Crookshanks and Hedwig often conspire together and try to eat it

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100][Perfectly Normal]] has a Gryffindor Harry that eventually gets a magic, Australian snake as a pet. Takes some time to get to that, but there's a lot of interesting stuff going on. Multiple dark lords, issues with religious discrimination in year four (currently being written), etc.
