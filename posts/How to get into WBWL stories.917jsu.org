I've never read a wrong boy who lived story, because I'm seriously scared to just pick one at random, even if it's one with lots of favorites/reviews/kudos/whatever because that might not mean anything. But are there any good WBWL fics for me to start with?

Preferably that are /not/ subversions of the genre, since I wouldn't have a reference to understand what's being subverted in the first place?


** Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin): one of my favorite currently updating fics. Starts as straight trope, /then/ subverts everything about Harry Potter fanon.

*** Yes! Prince of slytherin is my favourite works out there, if OP has to choose one fic to read first I would definitely recommend this.

It's so well written and engaging, I can't praise it enough.

**** Its the smaller things too. For example, it's the first time I've seen an actual justification as to /why/ James acts so shitty. I dont agree with his actions, and he's definitely put through a humiliation conga over the course of the story, but there is an understanding of why he did what he did.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

I'm wary of going straight for the Best fic, but also intrigued that it plays things straight before subverting them. I've also seen this one recommended in other posts, and I think I'll go with it.

*** In DPSW it hasn't been explained why the Potters abandoned Harry explicity. It's alluded that its been sold to the Potters by Dumbles as some form of master plan. The explanation for why Dumbles acts this way towards Harry is not actually that unbelievable as I dont want to provide spoilers but it does explain some of his actions and his ideas. However its unlikely the potters have an explanation as you said that will truly make sense or whatever.

***** Ok fair points but I think there is still a reasonable explanation for why not to visit: the risk of compromising the greatest protection Harry has: anonymity we know there are ways to detect magic and magical people and the last thing James or Lily wanted to do was lead a death eater to Harry. For example after Harry's first year he gets magically attacked at his home likely because his coming and going was being tracked.

And as for why not to run both James and Lily are fighters (and Jim is a national icon) and they are not about to abandon their home to their enemies without a fight. Could they have run: yes. Would it be logical: yes. Would it be the Gryffindor thing to do: no. Furthermore, James has a familial legacy tied to Britain that he would not give up.

*** I'm new, but, wouldn't WBWL also imply a story in which there is no BWL because there was no Killing Curse directed at them to begin with?

EDIT: I just assumed What-Boy-Who-Lived and not Wrong-Boy-Who-Lived(EWE?), so my mistake, I guess. The genre needs a similaracronym to identify those types of stories, no?

Damn, I'm stupid, someone show me the light.

  The world first saw Harry Bailey in a photo kneeling on a road before the Endbringer the Simurgh. The Simurgh's psychic scream drove entire cities mad. In Harry, it woke something else entirely. He never told the heroes what happened. After all, how could a young boy explain memories he could not possibly have, of a powerful, ancient sorcerer from a universe that preceded his own?

**** 'Typical' had some negative connotations associated with the WBWL genre as a whole when this story was still being updated, which is why writers wanted to distance themselves from it as much as possible. It's a quality work.

That being said, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2900438/1/Unsung-Hero][Unsung Hero]] is probably as typical as it gets. Don't expect a masterpiece, but it's one of the fics that started popularizing the genre, iirc.
