:END:
Hello! I'm in search of a Harry/Draco fanfic I read several years ago on AO3 (I'm fairly sure) wherein Harry is an Auror who needs to make nice with the upper echelons of pureblood society to try to quell any neo-Death Eaters, but has to get etiquette and dress style lessons from Draco. So as the title says, gay My Fair Lady. Does anyone know what fic I'm talking about?? I'd love to reread it!


** Idk but flagging because this sounds great
