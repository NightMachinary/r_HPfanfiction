Writing a fic (aren't we all?!) and I have reason to give characters patronuses (patroni?) when I don't think it's been said in canon what form they take. I have my own ideas about what I think they'd be but I'm interested to hear what ideas you have. If we have been told in canon what forms they take and I've just forgotten, please let me know. Here is what I think, but I'm ready to have my mind changed.

Molly Weasley - Old english sheepdog. A dog, like Ron's. Fluffy and cuddly but loyal and protective of its flock.\\
Lavender Brown - Rabbit. But I'm not sure about this one, I think I just picked it because of poor old Binky...\\
Parvati Patil - Tiger, maybe. I'm thinking species native to India, but that might be a bit on the nose.\\
Fleur Delacourt - My first instinct is a swan, but that's the same as Cho's. Not a problem in itself as a few characters who are not related have the same patronus (McGonagall and Umbridge) but it's not very inventive. Another kind of bird maybe? A peacock?\\
Bill Weasley - Bear. Just a hunch, no real reason.\\
Percy Weasley - Stoat. Of the weasel family. I figure one of the Weasley offspring should inherit at least an aproximation of Arthur's patronus.\\
Charlie Weasley - We all know it would be a dragon, right?


** I like Fleur as a dove more than a peacock, Malfoy is often called a peacock if not a ferret.

** I've been of the idea that Patroni can't be magical, so I would say Charlie's is a Komodo dragon. Also, I've always seen Molly's patronus as a (momma) bear.

*** Dumbledore's patronus is a phoenix.... Soooo definitely magical.

**** Oh, is that canon? I always thought that was just a common headcanon.

***** It's canon. He used his patronus to summon Hagrid after Krum was stunned, granted they only said ghostly bird in that line. (JKR said she reference it as a bird since phoenix is the only bird Dumbledore was ever associated with) And I'm pretty sure Ron and Harry also mention it in the deathly hallows. But it's also on Pottermore.

******* No problemo! I get commonly accepted headcanon and actual canon mixed up fairly often too. A symptom of Harry Potter fanfic addiction.

** I think a parrot for Lavender, if she's portrayed as her usual fanon self. That is, likes makeup and clothes and gossip, stereotypical "girly girl".

*** The Lavender I'm trying to write is different. Sensitive and somewhat girly still, but savvy and sick of people underestimating her, kind of using people's perception of her to wrong foot them. I don't like when she's written as being really shallow. I'm trying to give her more depth!

** I'm personally against Lavender's being a rabbit because Luna's is. Technically Tonk's patronus was a hare as well before she fell in love with lupin and it changed. Not sure what would fit Lavender best though, maybe a butterfly, dolphin, or some kind of small wildcat? Depends on how you're portraying her

*** Luna's is a hare, not a rabbit, but I know what you mean. I still can't decide, but luckily I have a while in my story before I have to make a decision!
