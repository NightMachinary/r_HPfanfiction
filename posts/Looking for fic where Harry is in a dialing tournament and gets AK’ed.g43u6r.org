:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a Daphne/Harry fic and during one summer Harry and the green grasses go to a dueling tournament on the continent I believe and nobody knows Harry will be competing until he sneaks away and his duel starts at the end of the last duel his opponent hits him with an AK. That's all I remember if anyone knows what fic this is I'd love to give it a read again!

Edit: ok well as fun as a dialing tournament might sound I meant dueling. ;)


** I know it's a typo, but I really like a competition where they see who can dial a phone number on a rotary phone the fastest
