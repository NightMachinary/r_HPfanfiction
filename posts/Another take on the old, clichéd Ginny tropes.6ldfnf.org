We've all read fics where Ginny is an obsessed stalker or wanton slut (because you know, dating two guys before her future husband and for all we know, not going past kissing with either of them entails that smdh) but has anyone ever read a fic where Harry's just into that?

I think it would be a hilarious inversion of REALLY tired tropes if Harry, being a teenaged boy had no problem with being the object of an obsessed nymphomaniac's desires. Done as a crackfic of course.


** Its not Ginny but have you read linkffn(5445767) ?

** I can't say I've read such a fic, though my tastes don't gravitate towards that genre anyway.

I must say I really hate these tropes, the latter especially since it really has no basis in canon. Ginny was in a long-term relationship with two guys over nearly 2.5 years. Then, when Harry breaks it off, she (presumably) doesn't date or anything the entire year he is gone, then gets back together with him and winds up marrying him.

I've read a bunch of H/G fics where the author gives Ginny another boyfriend or has her casually date around at school and changes virtually nothing else canonically. It's as if the authors buy into Ginny being promiscuous but realize canon doesn't support it and thus feel the need to up her hook-up count.

** I just thought that, Though I've read a lot of fics, I never came across a yandere Ginny. Which is surprising. I would have thought someone would do it.

** I actually like Harry/Ginny so I don't usually like these tropes but now I want to read a story like this just for fun. I really want to see a Yandere Ginny and Harry is totally into it. Lol.

** Don't we already have like thousands and thousand of fics where an obsessive fangirl wins heart of HERO?

*** Not in a way where it's played for laugh, and the hero is /specifically/ attracted to how obsessive the fangirl is.
