** Dark Lord Potter definitely has an inheritance scene of some kind, but I don't remember if it's with the goblins.

But Heir of the Founders has the mother of all inheritance scenes, in the first chapter no less.

Have fun!

** If you don't mind slash, Astiar's “Gaining Freedom, Losing Innocence” story has this. It hasn't been updated in a long time, but it clocks in at 100k+ words so its a decent read nonetheless.

  Harry learns of a way to leave the Dursley's between second and third year. But being a legal adult is more complicated than he expected. And what's this about not being human, and having to marry a boy he's never even spoken too?

  After giving his life to stop Madara and Sasuke, Naruto is reincarnated into the world of Merlin. Seeking to fulfill his duties as Emrys, he works to bring the Old Religon back to Camelot and unite all of Albion. Whether it's under Arthur Pendragon or not is still up for debate.
