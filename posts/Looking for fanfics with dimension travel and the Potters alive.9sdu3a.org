Hi, so as the title says I am looking for fanfics where Harry travels/is dragged into alternate dimensions, one where his parents are alive, and (preferable but not necessary), he finds he has one or more siblings. Bonus points if the story has some focus on sibling dynamics. War against Voldemort preferable, but not necessary. The absolute best example that I can think of for the kind of fic that I want is this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]] by Lady Alinor. I really wish she had continued on with a sequel, but oh, well.

â€‹

I am also reading Strange Reflections by LeQuin, and have read Black Comedy, and Lily Potter and the Worst Holiday. Fic recommendations apart from these would be extremely welcome.


** Since you didn't mention Stages of Hope, linkffn(6892925) . It's got dimension travel, living Potters (with a twist), no siblings, and seems to be quite beloved by this subreddit,

Then there's Across the Universe linkffn(4180686) , one of my favorite one shots in this fandom.

Finally, A Stranger in an Unholy Land linkffn(1962685) . The Potters are alive and Harry has at least one sibling, and I've seen it recced enough that I figure I'll pass it on. I myself only read the first chapter and skimmed the beginning of the fifth, but I didn't find anything wrong with it and enjoyed what I did read, so there you go.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  Vague spoilers for PS-HBP. One-shot. James Potter observes as Harry arrives to an alternate dimension where his parents are alive and Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived. Trying to teach old cliches new tricks, here.
