:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I'm looking for fanfic S's that are period based. There are a few that I've read but don't remember the names:

1) HHr fanfic: The 4 houses are actually 4 kingdoms and Harry being the Scion of Gryffindor is poised to take the throne. Neville is his best mate and close friend. Harry is supposed to marry someone from the Ravenclaw line (i think) but instead falls for Hermione, whose a simple girl from the kingdom.

2) JPLE fanfic: Lily gets to go to Hogwarts, which is like a institution for the offsprings of nobility where they are taught how they can serve the king. The marauders are all there. There is a system where exemplary students are awarded with privileges and authority based on a medal/ranking system. No magic in this fic though.

Anyone have an idea which fics these are? Also are there any similar fics?


** I only know of a few similar regency AU fics: linkao3(16421798; 20446955; 6608051)

The HPHG one sounds /really/ familiar. Was Sirius his guardian?

#+begin_quote
  Alternate Universe, Regency: In the wake of the Final Battle, the Ministry has passed a law requiring all wizarding persons below the age of 50 to marry for the purpose of reproduction. The Order has opened Headquarters to house its youngest members during a summer of Ministry-sponsored social events. With Snape as a chaperone, and engaged to another woman, the advent of a busy Hermione, determined to see her friends in love-matches, can only be a recipe for disaster.
