** When I read the title I was immediately thinking of a different sort of spanking that is also very prevalent in fanfiction...

I think I read too much bad smut.

*** In just about all of the spanking fics I've made the mistake of looking at(HP or otherwise), I don't think the author can tell the difference between kinky spanking and cp spanking. They all pretty much read like the authors trying to get off on having someones ass beat.\\
And why do they all insist upon writing it all out? How many "SPANK SPANK SPANK SPANK SPANK SPANK!" do you need?

** Can I say, this was so not the direction I expected this thread to go? I've read a number of "spanking" stories set in the HP universe but they are all of a much more uh, adult nature. I don't think I've ever seen one where a child was spanked as punishment. I enjoy the former but wouldn't be able to stomach the latter. (American btw, NYer more specifically)

** I'm on the outside looking in here, but I can almost guarantee that 90% of the spanking stuff you're seeing is the authors getting their rocks off. That won't make it any less annoying to see in fan fiction, but it's not as sinister as some of you are making it out to be.

#+begin_quote
  They almost always come with pro-spanking propaganda
#+end_quote

[[/u/Occlp]], that's part of the "fantasy". They want the non-consensual punishment, but they also want the characters to not be monsters. The pro-spanking thinking is to alleviate that discrepancy, not to promote an agenda on how to raise children.

#+begin_quote
  there are ways to punish a child without inflicting physical pain on them.
#+end_quote

[[/u/girlikecupcake]], I agree. I don't even agree with your swatting a toddler example. But like I said above, depicting good child-rearing is not the authors' goal.

#+begin_quote
  The deep-seated puritanical roots in US culture.
#+end_quote

[[/u/Deathcrow]], This might be true, depending on to what extent our puritanical roots have caused or shaped spanking fetishism. Though, spanking fetishism is quite abundant in the UK too. And France.

Personally, I think it's shameful of them to shoe-horn their fetish into their work. There are plenty of places dedicated to spanking fiction. But other than the bad story-telling, it's harmless.

Edit: Apparently people are searching for it. [[http://i.imgur.com/SEecPPh.png][Autocomplete for "snape spa".]]

#+begin_quote
  corporeal punishment
#+end_quote

At least it's not incorporeal punishment. Can you imagine ghosts trying to spank someone?

"Why are you wrapped up in all those blankets?"

"I'm fucking freezing."

"It's like 30 degrees out why are you-"

"Don't ask."

** I completely agree. I'm fond of the occasional [insert adult] raises Harry, or gets guardianship over him, but just... quit with the corporal punishment. He's already been abused and neglected, there are ways to punish a child without inflicting physical pain on them. It's one thing to swat a toddler on the rear when they deliberately misbehave, another entirely to put a child over your knee, intending pain (and I've seen it done to people as old as fifteen in fics. Wtf?).

** The same reason why there's so many fics where the protagonists decide not to have sex before marriage: The deep-seated puritanical roots in US culture. At least that's my assumption for these things, considering most authors are from the US. There are a few other things like this that don't mesh very well with my understanding of growing up in the 90s in Europe, which are similarly jarring when they crop up.

** I have only seen it once, in a fic linked from the previous spanking-related rant. Granted, I don't read much "someone raises Harry" fic.

From a practical perspective, the way to make spanking not feel like untargeted abuse is to link it strongly to the bad behavior. But if you've done your job there, there's no point to adding spanking on top, so you've turned it into targeted, pointless abuse.

*** Because many people hate James Potter and wish he was spanked as a child so he won't "Bully" Snape in the Marauders Timeline. But that doesn't fit there world view of James being a spoiled brat with incapable parents so they pull a Snape and pin the perceived short comings of James on to Harry and so to prevent Harry from becoming James they have Snape spank Harry.

This also comes from the same school of though that allows so many evil characters to wear Leather Pants (The Trope not actual Leather Pants, although when dealing with said trope, the trope activator often wears leather pants.)

It's not about punishing Harry, it's the Writer Punishing James by Punishing Harry and thus preventing another James

** I guess it's a matter of personal values belonging to the author and individual interpretation of characters. A lot of people view Snape as someone who would be a strict disciplinarian and guardian who believes in "tough love". I personally don't mind when fics have corporal punishment in the form of a few mild smacks to the bum. What kid hasn't gotten a swat or two in their lifetime? I hardly think it's traumatizing. I start to get uncomfortable, however, when implements start getting involved and it's a common occurrence--that pushes the limits for me. However, there are plenty of fics that I've found that handle the topic maturely and with grace. Others, not so much.

**** It really depends on the context of the fic, I think. One could argue that if Snape adopts and/or becomes Harry's guardian then he IS inheriting the parental role and has become Harry's parent, thus giving him the right to impose his rules, and subsequent punishments, upon Harry. However, if Snape is merely filling the "mentor" role then Snape should only impose rules and punishments allowed to him as a Hogwarts professor (so probably not corporal punishment).

Snape not being involved in Harry's life prior to his time at Hogwarts is really no fault of Snape's but, in my opinion, Dumbledore's. Snape, like many in the wizarding world, believed that Harry was living, if not luxuriously, then happily with his muggle relatives. Snape had no real reason to believe otherwise. It was Dumbledore's responsibility to observe Harry and step in if necessary--which he didn't. But that's just my opinion.
