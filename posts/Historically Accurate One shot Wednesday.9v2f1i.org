Give me your one shot interpretation (or more) of the first meeting of magical Europeans and the magical natives Americans or a battle of magic pirates in the golden age of piracy. Heck what about magical shootout in the wild West or magic Spartans kicking ass in ancient greece. I legit just thought about that the harry potter universe has an entire magical history spanning thousand of years before the canon novels take place all across the world that I haven't seen anyone explore before so I would like to see if you lovely folks could give it a shot.


** The danger of writing within a historical context is that it is very easy to offend people. Take the magical Spartans as an example. By turning the Battle at the Hot Gates into a feat of magic, you basically imply that it was magic which held the Persians at bay, not bravery, skill at arms and clever usage of terrain. And the closer you get to the present, the worse it gets because people are still invested in these events.

If Grindelwald was Hitler's puppeteer, you are basically writing "The Nazis were not evil, it was all a wizard". If you write about magic in the Battle of Britain, you are taking away the achievements of the 303rd and 310th. If the Six Days war was a feat of Israeli/Jewish Wizards, oh boy be ready for the backlash of the "free Palestine /activists/". Perhaps the only safe conflict would be the Falklands War.

*** Actually thank you for this. I don't want to imply that every victory was a magical feat. I merely want some discussion about how the magical society of these ancient civilizations would have functioned and how they would have interacted with each other and their non magical counterparts. Don't tell me you don't want see a one shot about an epic magical sea ship battle set in the golden age of pirates. I was especially interested in whether or not the magical pilgrims would have viewed America's magical natives the same way their non magical counterparts did or would they have seen them as equals.

**** Magic gets "worse" the further you advance in technology. Fiendfyre in the Middle Ages? You summoned Satan. Fiendfyre in the 70s? Probably some Vietnam footage where they dropped too much napalm. Killing curse in 900 AD? You are a god? Killing curse in 2273? Looks like a Klingon Weapon.

Therefore I'd draw the line somewhere between 1500 and 1600, after that magic does not add so much bang and awe. You could make an unsinkable Bismarck or ship of the line, but it would be far less impressive than tearing down the Theodosian Walls with sentient fire. The one exception are large-scale field battles (think Waterloo) where magic could seriously fuck stuff up and kill thousands within seconds because the formations are packed so tightly.

****** That depends on the type of magic you want to give either side. Berserker Potions come to mind, elemental stuff (summon lightning strikes instead of throwing curses), weather magic, unleashing demons or giants, dragon riding...

The sky is the limit and it is up to the author to decide.

**** Nah, they made common cause against the Soviets, at least in my headcanon where Grindelwald has ties to the Baltic nobility and wants to restore his "birthright" when it is still part of Imperial Russia.

** One question that needs answering before writing a historical event in the HP universe is how the Statute of Secrecy affected the world's societies. Was the Statute merely a text bringing to law an already existing fact? In other words, were magical societies already separate from muggle society and the Statute only solidified this?

Or was the Statute a huge cover-up operation? If so, then were wizards and witches a part of society until then? And how much of human history did the Statute switch delete or change for the muggles?

Both hold some implication for how to write a historical HP fic. The first means only that wizards and witches have only ever worked from the shadows or as the "guy behind the king". But that doesn't really make for a great story about their deeds on the battlefields of men. The other scenario implies that they must have been an integral part of any consideration back then, which requires you to deliver some massive bits of worldbuilding as an author.

I personally am a fan of the second option, and when I write historical stuff, I think in those terms.

That brought me to a few interesting bits. For example, I took the story of Jean d'Arc burning on the stake for being a witch and turned it into a story of a witch who turned her back to the muggles after she got screwed over by the Church.

Or when we go back into the era of the Danelaw in England, where some of the most famous families in the HP universe found their beginning. There I delved into old magic, its requirements and effects. I separated magical traditions (including the explanation why its called "Hogwarts School of /Witchcraft/ *and* /Wizardry/"). And it brought me to another point that I find interesting for historical fics: I always assume that Magic is, similar to science and technology, being researched constantly. There have been setbacks by having some knowledge bases destroyed, but in general Magic progressed from complicated rituals around fires, with hours or even days required to cast even the simplest spell (in my example, raindances), to a well researched and founded Art that we see in the canon books. Or in other words: Wizards and Witches have never been as dangerous and powerful as they are in the present day.

Some examples:

Harry is in a hospital in Bagdad, carried there by the father of Alrun, who's body Harry took over.

#+begin_quote
  The next days, Harry spent drinking and digesting the most horrid potions he had ever tasted. If he had thought Madam Pomfrey had some gruesome tasting stuff in her cupboards, he had not tasted early medieval magical potions. Those things tasted like scooped up feces and were delivered in way larger quantities than modern potions for the same or even weaker effects.
#+end_quote

Later he is taught a spell by his new grandfather, Hagmund.

#+begin_quote
  “Point it at the hearth, at one of the unburnt logs and say ‘Skeutanan Haithjö od Logi'” Hagmund said.

  Harry looked for a good log on the side of the hearth and aimed his finger at it. He felt stupid without a wand, but if anything, six years at Hogwarts had taught him to just roll with it when it came to magic. “Skeutanan Haithjö od Logi” Harry said and he felt how something formed in his arms, deep within the bone and then, with one sudden shot, magic pressed out from the skin that was covered in the liquid and shot at the logs in the form of a small tongue of flame.

  ...

  Harry, frankly, wasn't impressed at all. The flame had barely heated the air around them and without any cinder it didn't even set the logs aflame. It was nothing like an Incendio spell and with an incantation that threatened to knot his tongue

*** If I have read around correctly the statue of secrecy was implied that it mainly came into existence after the rise of Christianity which taught that magic and those who wield it were automatically evil and harmful while in most pre-Christian civilizations shamans, priest/priestess, prophetess ect. were respected and revered figures in their society's which I think implies that the line that separated the magical and non-magical world was either very thin or non-existent several thousand years ago.

**** When the Statute came into effect, Christianity had already risen and was at its peak in all of Europe, and many other regions on earth. Around 1200, all regions of Europe had been majorily brought under the religious doctrine of Christianity.

The wiki states that in the 15th century, relation deteriorated, meaning that it wasn't Christianity per se, but the more fanatical side of it, embodied by the Inquisition that disenfranchised magic folk from muggle folk. You could say that once european Christianity no longer needed to be inclusive to pagan beliefs, but only had to deal with theological disputes among Christians, they could try and enforce a more strict dogma, including the belief that magic was of the devil (or rather, the magic they didn't like). It also states that magical people had to hide from muggle witch-hunters, which tells us that the Statute may have just been a legislative solidification of a matter of fact.

From all we see in HP, its safe to assume that there are wizards and witches that count themselves to the Christian faith. If so, you could probably separate them again by muggle-Christianity (catholics, protestants, anglicans coming from muggleborns) and wizard-Christianity which had a good chance of developing, especially after the split of the societies by the Statute.

I personally had religion as a defining trait in a political fic I wrote for a while. In it, Dumbledore's Party "The Phoenix" was a conservative christian party, while the "House of Black" was a religiously egalitarian party. You'd also have the "Students of Loki" who are a Norse pantheon conservative party, and the Naturalists who have a progressive view based on the celtic and norse pantheon.

*** I'll add another thing to this. We see the statute from purely western european perspective in both HP and the fantastic beast movies. How did sun saharan Africa, the Americas, east asia react to European wizards trying to enforce the Statute.

What happened during the war with Grindelwald. If the Euripean mages where tied up in that would those societies try to return to a pre statute existence? Was there a follow up magical war or suppression in the aftermath of Grindelwald? Did they ally with him/get support from him given we are told one of his goals was to overthrow the statute?
