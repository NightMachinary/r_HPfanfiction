  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** Did Pettigrew even regret what he did? I mean he was "friends" with them sure, but I got the impression that it was more sucking up to the top dogs to get ahead than caring about any of them, especially considering what he does to them later.

If he feels bad about anything, I'd think it was that his pathetic life was cut short, since nearly everything he does is motivated by self-preservation.

*** We don't really get much exploration of Pettigrew as a character. We know he basically acted as he did because he was afraid, and that fear seemed to be his main motivation throughout, but we don't get a lot of detail. So we don't really know one way or the other.

Was it just fear, or was it also some form of revenge for the condescending way everyone treated him? Did he ever regret what he had done? Was staying in rat form for over a decade purely out of fear, or did he view it as some form of penance?

Hard to say. There are a lot of blanks to fill in with Pettigrew... he's one of those characters that you can play more sympathetically, as a totured soul plagued by the fact that he wasn't strong enough to stick by his friends, or as a total scumbag who only cares about himself and would sell out anyone to ensure his own survival without so much as a twinge of regret -- and neither one will be too out of character.

*** What Dina-M said. Canon is ambiguous enough about Pettigrew's true motivations. Making him a selfish, evil boot-licker who was always a traitor at heart is just as close to canon as making him a kind but weak-minded coward who just didn't have the Gryffindorness to stand up to Voldemort after a few well-chosen threats, but never liked being a Death Eater and may have innerly hated himself for betraying the Potters.

The latter approach seems more interesting to me (we already have /plenty/ of unrepentant non-sympathetic Death Eaters with Bellatrix or Macnair, and we have two reformed turncoats with Regulus and Snape, but a /reluctant/ Death Eater would be more unique).

I'll argue with kind just because of the extremely fast killing curse in the graveyard.

Weak-minded and acting entirely out of fear and bullied into it, sure. He had his moment of redemption, when the hand strangled him. He lived with the Weasleys for ten years and never seems to have wanted to harm them. I see a lot of room for a sympathetic portrayal of a not-very-good person who is not very different from most of us. That his main 'evil' is that he's simply not hero material, or willing to be a martyr. That he's like most of us. That being an ordinary person is actually his main villainy.

Kind, though... I have trouble with that.

*** It can be both. Wormtail shows evidence of shame for his actions (refusing to look at Harry in the graveyard) as well a reluctance to kill (Harry in Malfoy Manor, sorta chastising Voldemort for killing Bertha Jorkins instead of obliviating her).

*** I think he at least was unhappy with the means that he was forced to employ as a servant of Voldemort. But hey, plenty of fics redeem Malfoy and Snape, or pretend they're mostly good to start. This wouldn't be much different.

*** I feel like if he was just an insignificant sidekick to the Marauders they would have noticed how distant and not like them he was. And yet James and Lily did make him a secret keeper, and that means a huge amount of trust, more than they had for Remus.

*** Pettigrew always had a weak personality and the existence of spells like confundo, legimency, dark art corruption, the pure charisma of Tom Riddle and blackmail makes it a moot point for if he ever did regret what he did.
