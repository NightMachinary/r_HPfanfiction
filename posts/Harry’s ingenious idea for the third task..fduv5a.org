Normally the loopholes people find are to burn the maze down but what if there was a spell to dig underground.

Edit:just realized he could also dig to the golden egg in the first task.


** Genius. *slow claps*

** I'm currently writing a story, and once I get to the Third Task, the simplest trick is used. You know, the maze is in the Quidditch pitch for over a month with anyone free to study it. So, obviously, a certain Triwizard Champion flies on a broomstick over the maze, takes some parchment and a quill, and draws the layout of the maze. Then he studies the drawing and memorizes the shortest way to the centre.

** Read one where Harry summons his broom and flys and accio's the cup. Don't remember the name though. Tunneling to the golden egg sounds good.
