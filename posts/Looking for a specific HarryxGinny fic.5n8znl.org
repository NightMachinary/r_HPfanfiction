Hi guys I am new around here but I have been searching for this fanfiction I read a while ago but cant remember the name. It pretty much starts with the Weasley brothers noticing how Harry might like Ginny and one night at The Burrow they take him outside and talk to him and pretty much forcing him to leave and not be with Ginny. So he leaves and later one he gets sick when he is doing a mission or task in a forest and he ends up at Ginny's appartment and she takes care of him and gets him better and he tells her about what happened with the Weasley boys and she gets pissed and such.


** That is one of hgfan1111's fics, Learning to Fly. Luckily, that one can still be found on [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/4292813/1][Fictionhunt]].
