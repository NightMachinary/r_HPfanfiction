Just the sheer lack of interest I imagine he would show in any of the politics or calling each other by titles.

Also he'd 100% leak every Slytherin Secret^{TM} within like a week and a half.


** It'd be fun to read an anti-politic Harry in fanon Slytherin. He was pretty sarcastic in the books. Sidenote, not sure how the fanon Slytherin came about bc in canon Malfoy and all are absolute shite at manners and seem to alienate students from other houses.

*** My guess? It came about due to:

Tom Felton = hot, Alan Rickman = hot, Daphne Greengrass (or random blonde Slytherin) actress = hot. Jason Isaacs = hot. Helen McCory = hot, etc.

Hot people = suave and savvy, supposedly.

Slytherin house = home of pure-bloods and the like who are all a bunch of haughty scoundrel --- ahem, 'misunderstood people'.

Put 'em all together, whitewash most of 'em, and add in some Lords and Ladies stuff, too, just to make everything seem 100% more suave and political --- and thus the best house in the school.

This would totally complement the idea of making Slytherin into this tragically misunderstood house that Dumbledore just hates, for whatever reason.

Insert 'Light', 'Dark', and 'Grey/Neutral' faction system to add even more political wank to the whole thing.

Right, what's next? Ah, let's add the occasional marriage contract or two to make things even more suave, sexy, and dramatic in the politically fuelled house.

It's like one idea linked up with the next, and so on so forth. Perhaps things like the Draco in Leather Pants trope also played their part in shaping fanon's perception of Slytherin as well.

Oh, and add a pinch of Edgelord-ness to the whole thing, too. So fanon Slytherin is the go-to house for angsty, authority-hating writers who want to make super-smart eleven-year-old political minions. Because a bit of 'Occlumency shields' trained from their families can totally trump the Manipulative Old Coot™, right?

Sorry if this post seems offensive to anyone.

****** I have to tell you, I'll be interest in a Slytherin written by you, or someone who have the same outlook than you.

I don't dislike slytherin in Canon. I'd be interested how the Slytherin traits (cunning, ambition, self-preservation) translate for teenagers, in an house full of them, in a world where they arguably can be the ones to fight against discrimination (because too many other people in hogwart are thinking Slytherin = Dark Wizard and that had to hurt, and be infuriating), while they are discriminating themselves.

I do like the idea of grey, in the context of achieving their goal, and where each character would put the line on how much they can bend a rule (of law, morality, etc) before it's too far.

But my idea of grey is "it's not good, but it doesn't hurt anyone/it will help more people than it will hurt". However, the idea of most auhor I read of grey is "It hurt people even kill them, but I don't care they were mean to me, once in 1st year".

So, in the end, Fanon Slytherin become Evil!House, at least to me. It feels like authors don't want to show us a different side of Slytherin, they just want to excuse and justify Evil!Slytherin.

Plus, I found it utterly ridiculous that teenagers would be that involved in politics. Not even Prince William (IRL) was that stuffy and exposed and involved when he was a teen (according to everything I read about English Royalty), and the guy is going to be the King of England.

****** As someone writing a fanfic with a muggleborn whose first year is starting maybe 2 years after Harry's victory over Voldemort, I totally agree with this interpretation!

Canon Slytherin isn't full of these Machiavellian masterminds, it's mostly kids who want to get a short-term payoff against people they're prejudiced against!

Having said that, it's ripe for a bit of rehabilitation (hence me sending my poor muggleborn OC there!)

I think the fanon needs to take the Sorting Hat's warning more seriously... let the houses of Hogwarts mend their differences!

******** Then again, you do not have to have a lot of O.C. and flesh-out a lot of characters.

If you follow a character in Slytherin, and telling their story, you get to show a lot about the house, without having to flesh-out all the character in said house.

Many of Griffindor's students aren't that flesh-out. Oliver Wood must have been more than Quidditch. And yet, that's the only thing he does or care about on-screen.

I think a lot of author mistake is to want to flesh-out all of her O.C.

Sometimes, you need a character to drive the plot, a point, or just to show that it's a general attitude in a group, and that's it. Give him/her 2 or 3 traits so they are recognizable a bit more than by name, two lines, and it's enough. Let the reader imagine what they want after that.

Or make the O.C a counter-example of what is the general attitude. If I'd imagine Slytherin mostly reserved in showing their emotion, create Johnny McDought, from the McDough family, and show him here and there overreacting to stuff, and that being frown upon by others, nameless background characters.

"Johnny started to jump up and down in excitement. But the glares of all the other students present made him stop immediatly".

****** Good to see I was not the only one to find it strange to have 11-year-olds being small politicians and playing power games in some version "Game of Thrones KIDS" before puberty.

I can see older students doing something like that, making connections and all, but eleven-year-olds? Get that shit outta here, most lack the emotional maturity to not throw a tantrum, what's to say of masking emotions, lol, and if they can do that, well, they are not regular children.

If I wanted to write something like that, I would probably skim through years 1-2 and start all that drama around the later part of 3 or the beginning of 4 where puberty kicks in and some can already show some adult maturity depending on how they were raised.

Before that, I would expect them to be like kids from aristocratic/rich backgrounds, overly polite, with above-average vocabulary, and more than likely emotionally stunted, that when left to their own devices may go overboard.

**** I think it doesn't help that all we know about Slytherin House in canon comes from very few sources.

The characters that appeared more than once where Draco, Crabbe, Goyle and Pansy.

And we know that with Slughorn some of the House returned and fought against the DE in the Battle of Hogwarts.

If we go a bit by the movies, we see them mingling with the other Houses like normal most of the time. And Rowling herself said a lot, after the books came out that Slytherin did automatically meant evil. I mean, /Merlin./

My opinion of the House? I think Slytherin has those that have the determination to achieve their goals almost over everything, they study because of a goal, not for knowledge's sake. They want to be the Wizarding equivalents of doctors, lawyers, judges, astronauts, politicians, etc..

I've met some people like that at school, and my impression of them is that they keep to themselves, only having a close-knit group of friends and not wanting to be involved in anything that would hamper their goals(like school fights or terrorist groups initiation).

So I think that in an environment like Hogwarts, with all the rivalry and stuff, they would just duck their heads and try to avoid all that, to not associate with any "side"

This would make the House be mostly divided between the vocal Supremacists(Draco and Co.) and the ambitious, generally self-serving people who see the school as a way to advance in life, not as somewhere to spout their beliefs(think Slughorn), the former seems to be more vocal than the latter.

Harry's perception of them seems to be colored a LOT by four members of that house(Draco, Tom, Lucius, and Snape), and he has little contact with anyone else.

Seeing Harry on canon Slytherin would probably make him an outcast or someone who would learn to keep his head down with a few friends.

Still, the actor was likable enough, and many times his portrayal entered more into being a sarcastic cynic rather than a man full of hatred.

Believe me, I was baffled when people started crying over Snape and how he was misunderstood. But the truth of the matter is he could've kept his cover without being an asshole and making children cry or hurt themselves all the time.

His character is complex, in the manner that his motivations were somewhat unclear until that last reveal, but more on the fact his behavior confuses a lot of people.

Also, dark edgy bullied guy with unrequited love is a common underdog trope, except for the fact Snape was in the equivalent of Hitler Youth of the time and called his "unrequited love interest" the equivalent of whatever disgusting name the Nazis had for the jews at the time, to her face.

I am in the position to have to guide and interact with the son of the guy that seriously told me to kill myself. (And the kid do look like his father, like a carbon-copy). Or the son to the girl that told me that my Dad must have died because he was ashamed of who he sired.

You know what I do with those kids ?Nothing differently than I treat every other kids. I'm more than old enough to understand that kids are not their parents and shouldn't be punished for what their parents did to me.

They clearly weren't.

Also, they weren't bullying Snape just to show how much stronger they were. They were bullying Snape for his views. At first, they completely ignored him (and Lily), until Snape came out as someone who wanted to be in Slytherin.

Not that it is good reason to bully. Of course not. But I'm tired of reading that they bullied him because he was quiet, and weaker, and for his appareance and so they could show how stronger they were. It wasn't it. It was the whole Slytherin thing, and then Dark Magic and "let's hang with future Death Eater" thing.

** What I hate about a lot of Fanon Slytherin is how unfair it is to other Houses. Slytherin students get private bedrooms, a ballroom, special ballroom dancing lessons, private potions labs and dueling rooms and a private library? REALLY?

Like, fanon Hufflepuff often have a sign-up sheet for tutors and student-mentors. I can believe that, and that somehow Gryffindor wouldn't take it if offered. (Maybe they're more free-wheeling). Or that Ravenclaw have a little mini-library that is just students sharing their books out voluntarily. But all this extra stuff for Slytherin is like they're living a different school life - and that the teachers allow it.

*** Ooh, see I disagree about /some/ of this. The houses will have slightly different school experiences, because of their history and because of the views of the founders.

So the private bedrooms for Slytherin (and, in my mind, Ravenclaw) I can 100% get behind, because I think the founders would consider that the optimal environment for learning. Whereas Godric and Helga would have considered the team-effort approach more valuable.

Private lessons though, no. That may have been the original school setup, of a four schools in one type, where each founder taught their own apprentices separately, but that wouldn't have lasted to the modern day.

  So the private bedrooms for Slytherin (and, in my mind, Ravenclaw) I can 100% get behind, because I think the founders would consider that the optimal environment for learning. Whereas Godric and Helga would have considered the team-effort approach more valuable.
#+end_quote

I don't agree, because Hogwarts is supposed to have been founded in the 10th century. Even the existence of separate rooms for sleeping came after the medieval era (unless you were the lord of the castle, I think). Beds weren't that common, and they were frequently communal. Hogwarts students having their own personal beds would already be luxurious by early medieval standards.

***** Well, some of the oldest monasteries (though admittedly these are 14th C) in the UK had individual cells for sleeping in, so this is what I have modelled my vision of Slytherin and Ravenclaw on.

A lot of what we see in Hogwarts is more modern than 10th C would suggest, so it doesn't seem terribly incongruous, and it lends each house its own character.

YMMV though, I'm not offended by people having different visions for the houses.

So ... in other words, it's exactly what you'd expect Slytherin to be?

Not that I agree with the premise, if Slytherin is the house of the elite (as the trope goes ...), then naturally that must be reflected in its structure, and that's not /unfair/, that's being resourceful in a very literal sense -- but if you already pull out the Hufflepuff values (/s), then you might as well play it straight.

And, of course, from a writer's perspective, the /unfairness/ is a great way to create the necessary tension in a plot.

Then again, getting rid of supposed advantages in the name of /fairness/ is precisely the way (Fanon!)Dumbledore works, so it makes actually for a great plot! Slytherin had all this, and then in comes Dumbledore and takes it away -- dang, that must create resentment. Now I actually wonder if I could use this. Thanks for the ideas :)

But no one, absolutely no one, talks like that. It makes the kids sound like they're actors from Georgian times doing a shit play about medieval knights.

Whether you like that is a matter of taste, but I would argue it's internally consistent. They are raised as heirs to 1,000 years of lineage, quasi-nobility in a mediaeval sense where 12 year old children must be "grown up", and the result is you get lots of children that are miles away from what you'd consider children today. And those people you then toss into one closed setting, and of course they're going try out what they were raised to be, imitating the adults they saw, leading to self-important bartering over Transfiguration essays in the first year, and alliances to last a lifetime in the last.

As far as I'm concerned, that's the appeal: If it /were/ just any normal students, it'd hardly be necessary to write such AUs, because there's plenty of that Canon.

Further, I was talking about growing up in a way where 12 or 14 was considered, in many important ways, the begin of adulthood. The theory of regarding children wholly as "little adults" in mediaeval times is nowadays controversial (cf. the Ariès-Orme debate), but the fact that duties could begin a lot earlier than today is not. I'm not an expert by any means, yet it strikes me as not an unreasonable outcome that such an upbringing could lead to behaviour as is typical in trope-y Slytherin; but at any case, you don't have to make an /historical/ argument, just one that can plausibly suspend disbelief, and IMO, that it does by any means.

I wouldn't limit it to the typical trope-y Slytherin, though. Canon!Harry is a bad fit for any kind of Slytherin. He's very much the epitome of Gryffindor; without giving him a major overhaul, you just can't get around that fact. /Percy/ was more of a Slytherin than Harry. The line by the Sorting Hat is just nonsense, it's contradicted by the entirety of PS.

** I read an ao3 fic like this once!

I don't remember much bc I didn't get more than a few chapters in but after getting resorted at the end of tCoS the Slytherins basically try and revere him as leader for his parsel abilities but Harry doesn't really give an f.

** Canon Harry at the time of being sorted is young enough that such a change would completely change the person that he becomes.

*** Possibly, but he's also used to being completely ignored and doesn't really seem to mind it.

As is also often pointed out, Harry is often a sarcastic little shit with 0 compunction about breaking rules for any kind of reason.

As we see with Lily and Snape, cross-house friendships are also possible during the Voldemort years, and Harry's obviously at school after most people have given up on Voldemort.

It's Chamber of Secrets where I can see things becoming a Big Deal unless Harry has alienated everyone in Slytherin totally.

*** Maybe, but in that way?

Harry had been brainwashed to think he is "just harry", worthless runt, burden to his Uncle and Aunt, that doesn't deserve more than his family would give him.

Canon Harry already has a hard time with Percy for being too sanctimonius and ceremonious, and he is really not comfortable with being famous, and others bowing to him.

Such a whisplash in fanon!Slytherin could go in very different ways. But we unfortunately see only one.

** Canon Harry as in Harry that has already been to the wizarding world and through school suddenly going back to fanon Slytherin house? Canon Harry that has only been to the wizarding world once with Hagrid, being sorted into Slytherin house? Logically I think these two would be vastly different. I can't immediately see why the Harry who has never been to the wizarding world would be uninterested in politics and titles if his peers told him he needed to know these things.

Because in every single one of these fics it is exclusively Slytherin that acts like this (occasionally with Neville too on random days). He'd still be in class with everyone else seeing they didn't get on like that.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing. No pairing YET. Book one. (The world belongs to Jo!)
