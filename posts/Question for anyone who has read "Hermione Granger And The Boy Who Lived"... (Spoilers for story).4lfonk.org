So I am reading [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger And The Boy Who Lived]] for the first time. I don't have a membership on that website, so unsure if I can leave a review to ask this. Maybe others know the answer.

Has the author (or the story itself) explained why characters can say "Deathstrike War" but are afraid to say "Lord Deathstrike"?


** I passed the question on to her, here's her answer:

#+begin_quote
  "The answer is pretty simple: the Big Bad uses ELINT and HUMINT both to spy on people in the community. He's trying to create an aura of fear to keep everyone under his control. So he's only concerned with community people who say the precise words 'Lord Deathstrike'. If he catches anyone doing that, either through moles or spies or bugging, then he has his minions go make an example of that person. People are therefore cautious, and use silly pseudonyms like You-Know-Who and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named-Because-He's-A-Bully.

  Meta-reason: I needed to introduce Hermione and the reader to the name and the war and the problem, so I needed to be able to say 'Deathstrike War'. But I wanted to stick to the canon fear of the name in the community."

Diane also asks you to come over and register and leave her a review so she can tell if this is a 'I like it but I have a question' or if it is a 'here is one of the things I hate about it'.

** The kids in this story were far more ruthless and smarter than in the Books. They had already compiled an impressive body count by chapter 104, which was the summer after year 5.

But Riddle's support in the Ministry and the Community also appeared to be greater than in the Books.
