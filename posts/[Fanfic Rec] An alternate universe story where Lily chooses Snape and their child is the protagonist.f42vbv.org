EDIT: Sorry, I meant "Request" in the title.

I'm not too deep in the Harry Potter fanfic community (save the badfics), but I feel like that could be an interesting concept for a story: Lily marries Snape, they have a child, and that child is the chosen-one protagonist, following Snape and Lily's demise (though you'd have to structure the plot very differently). What traits would the child inherit from their father, rather than James? Is James Potter still alive? Does he fill a similar role to Snape in having a complicated, bitter relationship with the child if they come in contact? If Snape still had involvement with the Death Eaters while he was still alive, how would that affect everything?

I'm sure this type of story already exists somewhere. I had a plotbunny for a story like this, but I doubt I'd follow through on it because I don't write for this fandom.

Another rec idea: any story where Snape becomes Harry's mentor. I've seen this before in a story where Harry was sorted into Slytherin and I liked the concept. Rather than being an ass to Harry, Snape channels his bitterness toward James into molding his son. Low-key revenge of "you got the girl, but your son looks up to me."
