I love Ron but I feel really bad for him because he tends to get overlooked in favor of characters like Harry, Hermione or even Draco instead.

Which is really unfortunate because yes he does have issues, but so does everyone. One thing I love about the series is that no one is perfect.

I want well written Ron Weasley stories, he can be the main character or a secondary character as long as he's written believably.

Bonus points if we can see his strategy side that he uses for chess for the actual war. (Something I wish that Rowling did). But that isn't mandatory.

Any rating is fine. Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Very little to absolutely no character bashing.


** I really like ([[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]). Ron is not the main character but he is more of a focus than Harry is and there is definite character development. Non magic AU. Basically Hogwarts is the training ground for British Intelligence.

Note: I'm not sure how to link non ffn stories sorry if it is messed up.

** My favorite Ron fic is [[http://martianhouse.livejournal.com/20224.html][Love, Marriage, Dating, Children, Dating (Again)]]. A wonderful internal voice, wonderful humor and a wonderful air of unpredictability around it. And all the anecdotes in the footnotes! Gives it a Bartimaeus trilogy sort of feel. Plus, it manages to tackle real life issues of marriage through all that hilarity and write a pretty decent romance. I think I was grinning all the way through. Ron's Self Help Manual is the greatest. Here's the non-LJ link, with some formatting errors - linkao3(201104)

** He's a main character and hero in most of my stories, even if he might not start out that way. If you like AUs, you could "The Dark Lord Never Died" a try, where he grew up in France and enters Wizarding Britain as a spy for Dumbledore.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1316097/Pinky-Brown][Pinky Brown]] has some good Ron-centric fanfic. You could try "Six Foot of Ginger Idiot," which is Ron's diary entries during HBP. linkffn(3637489)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/900634/Solstice-Muse][Solstice Muse]] also writes a lot of stories with Ron even as the main character or one of the main characters. Her writing isn't technically as good as Pinky Brown's, but she's great with characterisation and she hits some real emotional beats. My favourite fic of hers is "Eternal Sunshine of the Scourgified Mind." linkffn(2594688)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]] writes mainly Ron/Hermione stories. The highlight is "To Know You is To Love You," which starts with an adult Ron and Hermione going to an unorthodox couple's councelling, and then the main bulk of the fic is dedicated to them getting to see their lives and developing relationship from each other's point of view. linkffn(9094981)

I also have a soft spot for the "Son of the Archer" stories, which are a crossover with the MCU. In this story, Ron is abducted from his family at a very young age, and then ends up in America, adopted by Clint "Hawkeye" Barton. linkffn(11230962; 11884262)

Finally, if you don't mind an alternate take on Ron, I very much like the Weasley Girl series. The premise is simple: In this universe, Ron is a girl. Fem!Ron, with the imaginitive name "Veronica," is hotheaded and sarcastic like her male counterpart, but being the first-born daughter in the family means she has slightly different hang-ups and priorities than a sixth-born son would have. linkao3(6130632; 3721921; 3793561)

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  February 29, 1980. Leap Day. At the Burrow, Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George, and (sigh) Great Auntie Muriel are waiting for the newest Weasley brother to be born. But something unexpected is about to happen. One-shot, prelude to the "Weasley Girl" trilogy.

  Calm, rational discussions have never been their strong point. When a pre-wedding fight shows them that they need to get it together, Hermione suggests couples counseling with an innovative new method. Ron reluctantly agrees, and now the two of them are going to learn about each other in a way never before possible.
