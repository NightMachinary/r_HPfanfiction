First off, not simply pudding as in a dessert, but actual dairy based pudding like Jell-O pudding. I have Googled to see if it is somewhere in canon as well as searched for "Luna Pudding" on this sub and [[/r/harrypotter]] with no luck in results. Is it something I just happened to stumble onto a cluster of fics using it together, or am I missing something?


** The short answer is that a few of the popular early Luna fics featured pudding heavily and this has trickled through the fandom like any popular trope.

The long answer is that Luna is very difficult to get right. She is a very strange girl who often hides her true thoughts and emotions behind seeming gibberish, but is actually intelligent, insightful and witty if you read between the lines.

She constantly switches between subtly and bluntness, elegance and (actual) gibberish, shyness and boisterousness, and brilliance and credulity. Writing her is a constant balancing act between an odd, confused little girl and quirky, thoughtful young woman.

To make matters even more difficult, she actually doesn't have that many lines in canon. In fact, her name is only mentioned 356 times in the entire series [[http://harrypotter.answers.wikia.com/wiki/Top_200_most_named_harry_potter_characters_s][(27th behind Percy at 426)]].

This means that people who don't do sufficient research are trying to reproduce Luna's unique personality from just a few, scattered, poorly remembered lines within a 7 book series. Most of what is fresh in their memory are characterizations from fanfiction, most of which are similarly flawed.

Furthermore, it's unclear how Luna might (or might not) mature into adulthood. As the fandom ages, we see a lot of interpretations of Luna in her 20s or 30s, and its difficult to try to take her canon personality and extrapolate that out by 10 or 20 years.

In preparation of my Luna fic, I spent weeks reading every one of her scenes in canon, and exploring my favorite interpretations of her in fanfiction (both as a major and minor character). Then I figured out how I wanted her personality to grow and change in the next 5-7 years based on her circumstance.

I wrote the first chapter, scrapped most of her part, then rewrote, revised, asked for second and third opinions, and revised some more. It took me months to come up with something I was proud of that I thought represented her characterization well.

Some very few people seem to have a knack for writing Luna and can get into her head space easily. For the rest of us, writing Luna well is a long, arduous process.

It's a lot easier to just make her an insane, nymphomaniacal, seer that is obsessed with pudding and talks about crumple horned snorkacks constantly.

** It's likely because of the Ootp film. She mentions it when we first meet her, and then again as her last line. Subsequently, it probably went the same way as Dumbledore + lemon drops and Lupin + chocolate. (What is it with this fandom and food?

**** also, based on the latest /harrypotter survey results, the peak of the bell curve of the fandom is in the age range where you're really into food, because your body hasn't started falling apart yet, but you're old enough to have money and independance to buy the foods you desire.

*** Never heard of the chocolate/Lupin thing. Is it because he had a lot of chocolate the first time he was seen? If so, I would argue that is intelligent for a DADA teacher who knows the school is going to be surrounded by Dementors.

**** It crops up a lot in Marauder era fics. The POA scene is probably part of it, but personally I suspect [[http://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/][The Shoebox Project]] had a lot to play. Chocolate is his favourite food in that and it's one of the defining MWPP fics; it likely inspired later writers and then it just steamrolled from there.

Our pudding is similar to mousse, but not as fluffy. More like a custard that never sets up fully.
