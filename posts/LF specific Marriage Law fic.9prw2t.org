Hermione/Snape. Arthur Weasley is the Minister of Magic and decrees a law to encourage the wizarding community to breed themselves back into existence, following the aftermath of the Second Coming of Voldemort. Hermione picks Severus Snape. Written pre-DH, possibly pre-HBP, definitely not Epilogue compliant

Spoilers: Also Harry/Luna. WeasleyTwins/Patil Twins. Dumbledore/McGonagall (written pre-GayDumbledore reveal) Hermione works as a teacher at Hogwarts. Hermione has at least one miscarriage and Snape blames her, Snapes house elf protects her. They have at least two children that I can remember.

I have been trying for over a month to find this one.
