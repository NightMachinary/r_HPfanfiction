I'm not talking about characters that are comically evil like most of the Bash-fic Dumbledore. I'm looking for a character that you despised absolutely at the end of the Fic.


** The basilisk in Antithesis. I honestly hated her more than I could ever hate Umbridge. I've always seen the basilisk as this mindless creature controlled by a parselmouth but in this one she's a total cunt.

I didn't even like this fic, but during an internet outage with nothing to do, I had to make to make do with what was already downloaded.

And it's not so much "hate" a character, it's "I get overwhelmingly pissed off" whenever Dumbledore defends Snape.

​

#+begin_quote
  "Then do tell me why it has reached my ears that you are the worse potions teacher in recent history?" Voldemort drawled, his voice dared Snape to try and interrupt and make excuses but Snape was smart enough to realise that it would simply get him more punishments. "It sounds to me like you do not know the meaning of the word subtle, I would like to think that my death eater spy would have the sense to not act like a death eater spy. While I have no sympathy for mudbloods and blood traitors, it is your job to pretend as if they matter. Yet it is widely known that you do not act like they do.

  While I understand your dislike for them, it is your job to act as if you do like them, yet you do not. Barty." Voldemort called.

  "Yes my lord?" Barty Crouch junior looked up from his kneeling position.

  "Remove your mask." Voldemort said in a soft voice and Barty instantly obeyed, removing his mask to reveal his thin face and straw coloured hair. "Young Barty here was able to fool Dumbledore and an entire school for a whole year," Voldemort said to Snape. "he tolerated the mudbloods and blood traitors for me, he held back his emotions and desires for me. You, Severus have not, why is it someone so younger and less experienced than you is able to do this and not you?" Voldemort asked, waiting for an explanation.
#+end_quote

See, this glaringly points out that Snape is spying ON Dumbledore FOR Voldemort. But in canon he acts like he is spying ON Voldemort FOR Dumbledore. JKR mixed up who Snape was supposed to be ingratiating himself with. But I blame that on piling too many tropes on a character.

** A lot of fanfic written by her /fans/ make me hate Hermione. Which is sad, I adore her in the books themselves.

But so many play up her strengths till she comes off as this super-genius on par with comic book ones like Reed Richards and Tony Stark. She's very smart, but in the books she's not some super-genius.

I think it's a combination of loving the character too much and people playing up the movies, which ... really, really like Hermione.

It just gets annoying.

** While no fic has made me /hate/ a character, the final nail in the coffin for my willingness to read Jily as anything but a background pairing, after reading a series of fics where James was downright creepy, was linkffn(Veritas Omnia Vincit). It didn't feature blatant James-bashing in the typical way I see it done, but rather has him as emotionally manipulative and abusive. In fact, this is also the fic that made me shy away from fics portraying abusive relationships in general. For example, while I read linkffn(Puzzle) before this fic (good fic, but very dark and I don't recommend it if you dislike dark fics), if I hadn't, I wouldn't have read the fic at all since it portrays an abusive relationship. Ironically, had circumstances been slightly different, I could totally see these 2 fics as having had the exact opposite response in me, with Puzzle causing me to stay away from LESS rather than Veritas Omnia Vincit causing me to stay away from JPLE.

The fic only made me stay away from Jily though. I don't mind James (or Lily) at all otherwise, and prefer to read fics that portray James in a good light rather than fics that portray him as a bad person. As long as it doesn't try to excuse his earlier behaviour, which was very much not ok.
