With bigotry for muggles and all, at what point do magicals hears something a muggle invented is beyond them, internalize that muggles are stupid, deluded themselves into thinking that it was actually just some unknown wizard's invention because they didn't care to know how a telephone or a light bulb works and therefor thought it was just run by magic, shout for misuse of artifacts, confiscate every telephone/light bulb ever made, and erase said inventions from muggle history? Would muggles live in the medieval ages forever if that were to happen?


** The Ministry of Magic is limited to Britain (and perhaps the Empire). It could not intervene in mainland Europe without causing an international incident and each "nation" has its own definition of what is "alright" and what not. For example, flying carpets are illegal in Britain but fine elsewhere. So for example the British Ministry sees the steam engine and erases it. But then a few decades pass and someone in, for example, Prussia has the same idea but their local magical Ministry takes a look and concludes that everything is fine with the steam engine so now the Industrial revolution starts in Prussia and not the UK.

tl;dr: It would certainly slow technological advancement down and massively alter history (industrial Central Powers vs agricultural Entente would be a very different world war if these alliances ever formed), but in many cases, there was more than one guy with a certain idea so we would certainly be out of the middle ages by now.

*** You've got a point! I've only thought of the incident as isolated to the British Ministry... Say, if they /do/ ban all things muggle that they thought of as inconceivable (i.e. purebloods thinking whatever foreigners approve as 'muggle appropriate' is just weird things foreigners do and still ban it anyway), don't you think it'd make British muggles as backwater as what magicals always think of them...? Truly, it's something diabolical enough that I'd think Tom Riddle would've thought up of.

**** It stops working at the point where someone (Hitler/Napoleon) invades the isles with dreadnaughts/steam ships/artillery while the RN is still using galleys, takes over Britain and calls in his own Ministry because those bloody magical Brits keep harassing him (and that is assuming they don't simply shell/mine the MoM into oblivion and call it a day). Because as far as numbers are concerned, especially without an agricultural revolution and advanced medicine, the MoM is vastly outnumbered by foreign countries who have no issues with Muggles (therefore there are more muggle-borns -> more manpower) and take over magical Britain as well.

***** Brits /could/ set up a repelling ward for those banned items. It'd be a nationwide barrier though, so maybe I'm stretching it, but it's still a possibility. I can concede the fact that if it were double trouble (Hitler & Grindelwald) combining forces, the Brits can't do much of a thing against this advancement.

...although, I'm if the magical Brits still think muggles are primitive by nature, then it's funny how all the credit for dreadnaughts/steam ships/artillery will be shouldered to Grindelwald by being the magical default.

****** Those predate Grindelwald by a few decades at the very least. And the wards you describe do not exist (otherwise every place would have them set up against dark stuff). But even if you had magic capable of detecting other magic, how would it identify muggle stuff? For example, there are guns capable of shooting across the channel and the Paris gun could even shell the outskirts of London from Calais. And those projectiles would cross into Britain in the upper layers of the atmosphere (more than 40km above the ground), so you would need the wards to cover at least that high (V2s went even higher), detect a slab of metal and stop it...

That sounds not feasible at all.

******* If magicals made a muggle repelling charm, why not repel an item? I assume that they can't set up a similar ward against something *dark* because magicals don't really mass produce dark items in one specific shape or form. If it's something that's already known wouldn't it be easy to repel them?

As for the guns capable of shooting across the channel, if the Brits have anything at all against projectiles, I'd think they can alter whatever that spell is and defend themselves against those kinds of guns and missiles.

Still, I did say it was a stretch, so yeah, can't really argue much for feasibility.

*************** ...sorry for the word vomit. Haha.

Gigantic and immensely powerful, yeah, maybe, but the defenses on Hogwarts can be considered big enough if not gigantic. It could be possible to surround some of country.

As for power, I've got nothing thought up about that. Since the one at Hogwarts were dealt with in the matter of what feels like an hour or lower than that (the actual timeline I'm not really sure of), I can't use it as a comparison for power. Even if, theoretically, they were only so fickle because the defenses were dealt with very good curse breakers, because the only ones powering it were teachers, because they were sabotaged when death eaters stayed there, or because there was a lack of schoolyard wars since the founders' era and they just weren't improved upon after muggles stopped their witch hunts. There's just not enough information on the basis of power for me to theorize.

As for ships and submarines, what makes you think those are worse or I'm assuming you mean they're worse? I mean, ships and subs are run by people, as you said, and muggles can be dealt with by muggle repelling charms. When they're close to land or heck maybe farther off the coast, they'll just turn around and forget they ever saw anything. I can hear you thinking, "What about the muggle Brits who just want to go to the beach, you numbnut?!". If they can put a clause in the repelling charm to be 'if muggle, then go back and forget magic', then why can't they put a clause that says, 'if muggle who wants to fish, then go fish, go home and forget magic'? *tl;dr They just need to make a more comprehensive muggle repelling charm.*

Of course, they can use the missiles for the battleships and subs which takes us back to the projectile bombs again... well, underwater projectiles for the subs at least.

If you don't accept the muggle repelling for the subs (because underwater), then it's easy enough to replicate one and combat it from a magical stand point. Just make a better bubble head charm.

**************** I discounted Muggle-Repelling wards due to the fact that it took the Ministry months to ward a single stadium (roughly a year for a square mile then). It would take thousands of years to protect the British shore in a similar fashion.

There are the rules in transfiguration that

1.) You need to understand and visualise what you want to do. (For example, when turning a teakettle in a duck you need to think which part becomes what or you are stuck with a porcelain beak)

2.) The more complex something is, the harder it is to "magic" it. Turning a needle in a matchstick is first year stuff, turning a human in a peacock is NEWT stuff (or even beyond that).

Point Number 2 is also valid for charms. It is easier to lift something than to make it dance or turn it invisible.

So turning a shell around shouldn't be too difficult (assuming you can track and hit it with the appropriate spell). It's just a slab of metal. But a battleship? Even the first Dreadnaughts had a crew of over a thousand men and where highly complex machines. I doubt that the average wizard would know enough about a 3.5-inch naval gun (Tertiary gun battery) to transfigure or charm it properly, much less about the engine room or the entire ship.

***************** The warding didn't have definite time. When Arthur Weasley said that, he was mentioning setting up the Quidditch World Cup as a whole. Placing the anti-muggle wards could have been set up in shorter than a month and it could have been finding and choosing the location, planning transportation, or making all the portkeys that was taking months (as those are needed to be prearranged before hand and may mean that it needs more time to prepare or had a waiting list that cannot be skipped).

I wasn't actually thinking about misdirecting a whole battleship earlier. It's more the muggle repelling charm that will make the muggles steering the battleship/subs go around and turn back.

And well, a battleship, it's a ship... They wouldn't really need to know about a 3.5-inch naval gun, they just need to know it's a threat and that it's a ship over deep, deep waters. Why not just get a few wizards who knows the bubble head charm, learned a spell that can make a big, big boom, or potions they can stick to anything (like a ship) with a timed charm for igniting and can also make a big, big boom, go under the water before said threat hits land and just make it sink? Heck, that's even an easy clean up. Once all the muggles are in the rescue boats on the water, just Obliviate them via Obliviators on broomsticks and make them all think it was China who sank them. It'll point a target half way across the world.

Considering that they'd have written orders and the threat of Court Marital hanging over them, the ward would not be effective since they would quickly remember the original orders. And how does the ward knows who steers the ship and who is just the dentist abroad?

** You're hypothesis assumes more cognizance of the muggle world than I think is merited from canon. On the whole, magicals appear to be in absolute ignorance of the discrepancies in their societies. If anything such discrepancies (cars, lightbulbs, electronics, etc.) between the two societies would be seen as something they were proud of.

Wizards would on the whole be proud of these different aspects of their society, and the more pureblood ideology leaning would see these differences as a mark of their culture. They wouldn't want the muggles to be using quills and parchment; it would make muggles more like them. Or worse: it would make it easier to live outside of magical society. From a practical standpoint, the last thing the Ministry would want (or what any government wants really) is for large parts of their population to hightail it when problems crop up, leaving less people to recover from the situation at home.

The Misuse of Magical Artifacts is, at the end of the day, the cleanup crew to the Obliviation Squad. They wipe the memories clean, and the MoMA gets rid of the evidence. In other words, they're the guys who show up in the Men in Black series to get rid of the bodies while the agents neuralize the sheep. They are not world-changing cultural manipulators. The head of the department did not know how to use a match.

I mean, quills and parchment are one thing, but technologies later on that brought muggles to the moon, wouldn't that blow them away somehow to the point of actually doing something about it?

The head of the department also enchanted a muggle car. If someone were to point that out, that the head of the department who was supposed to clean up these enchanted items were enchanting muggle items themselves, wouldn't it be much easier to prove to everyone that they somehow turned a blind eye or been lackadaisical enough to let an unknown wizard enchant whatever they wanted?

Not knowing how muggle stuff works is not the problem, the problem was that it was too 'unbelievable' those muggle items were running 'without' magic that they'd believe it was a misused item.

Your list is, therefor, not all that useful if...

- Halfbloods and muggleborns don't have any influence in the ministry.
- Tom Marvolo Riddle cares for shits about muggles would actually support muggle inventions = misused items just to further advance himself.
- Kendra Dumbledore: I have no idea what her influence may even place in this and secondly, why would she care about muggles if it was their fault that her daughter was attacked.
- Aberforth Dumbledore: No idea what his influence in all this is either, but again, what happened to Ariana.
- Any pureblood that lived through WW2: Wouldn't whichever pureblood who was shouting misuse just use their war stories as an excuse to actually further their agenda by stating how these bombs and guns, that might've been produced by some unknown wizards, to be a danger to them?

So far, I only see Albus Dumbledore as the only person who has interest. Of course, that's only saying so if this shout of misuse is actually done after he defeated Grindelwald and not before.
