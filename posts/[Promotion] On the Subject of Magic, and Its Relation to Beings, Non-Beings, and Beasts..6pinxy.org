Excerpt from the journal of Gardenia Aspenbow Ollivander:

Just writing down my thoughts to better focus my mind on how magic works. I'm hoping that maybe it can help me look at wandcraft differently, maybe make my work better.

It is common knowledge amongst wizards and witches that magic is passed down from parent to child and on down through the generations. What is not common knowledge is why this is so. From reading as well as writing to various witches and wizards knowledgeable on the topic, I have become familiar (even if it only the most basic understanding) with the Muggle science known as Genetics. The most basic idea I have gleaned from this is that traits are passed down from generation to generation by a code of sorts that is within our bodies. This code, which they call DNA, determines traits and such as we grow. Those wizards and witches that have a deeper understanding of this than I do believe that it is through DNA that we get our ability to use magic. They also believe that it could explain why there are muggles, non magic beasts, etc.

According to my reading and those I have spoke with, each living being has a set amount of genetic material with which to work with, and what is passed down is a mix of the material of both parents. It's like having two sets of items, and those two sets must take copies of their items and make a new, single set. They cannot take it all with them, and thus the new set doesn't have all the variety that two sets have, but rather a mix. It is from this mix that eventually the thing that gives us access to magic is lost, or in some cases halved, which results in squibs. Later on that half might meet with another half, and then produce a whole, or a muggle-born.

Apparently the loss of material is exacerbated by inbreeding. That would mean that those who claim that they are pureblood are just hastening the birth of squibs, or worse. But don't try to tell them that.

Ok, so if the ability to use magic is passed down, that means that it isn't something that comes from ourselves, rather it's a trait that allows us to make use of a source that is available to beings, non-beings, and beasts alike (provided they have the trait as well.) This makes sense in light of a few things.

So ok, muggle terms again! Magic has control over 5 realms, or as muggles call it, dimensions:

Dimensions 1-3 encompass space, dimension 4 is time, and dimension 5 is the soul. I think that would make dimension 6 where magic comes from. There are a few things that overlap though, such as life and death and their power over the soul and body, yet magic has some control over the soul but no control over death. It's more like a complicated graph of interactions rather than dimensions, now that I think about it. Either way, magic exists outside of time and space.

So by the argument I just wrote, there must be a reason why some creatures are completely magical, while some are like humans, or not magical at all. The only thing I can think of is that completely magical creatures must straddle the line between magic and physical creation, being inhabitants of both sources, yet not firmly planted in either. So kind of like a living portal from the magical to the non magical, and vice versa.

That would mean that the reason why wand cores work like they do is because the item taken from a magical creature is like a focus between magic and non magic, and assists those with the ability to manifest magic by providing a second link to the source.

I need to think on this more...
