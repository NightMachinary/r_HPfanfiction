** I am an avid fan of Hermione and all her flaws. I don't like fics where she's a complete Mary Sue, I love all her edges. I personally love the "dark" side Hermione even if it comes off OOC. Or just generally dark fics. So here are my top 4 fics I always go back to.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11132624/1/Persephone][Persephone by dulce.de.leche.go]] - this is just bc it's so rich in darkness and a bit psychologically scarring. I loved Hermione's slow descent to madness and the world around Tom Riddle's era. The dynamics between Tom and Mione is frustratingly impeccable, I couldn't believe how amazingly OOC they are but there's this foundation you always knew a part of them that could be canon. I just love Tom Riddle tbh.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12991569/1/][Madame Umbridge Home for Wayward Girls by A Lovely Villain]] This is non-magical AU, I haven't read this for a while but I remember loving it. This is the first non-magical AU I've ever loved, and it's Tomione. There's just something satisfyingly dark in this fic that I couldn't get enough off.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4025300/1/Reverse][Reverse by Lady Moonglow]] Not gonna lie, I've always rolled around the idea of everything reversed in the HP series in my head and then poof! I found this magical fic that I never knew I needed in my life. Personally, the portrayal and the world building is absolutely phenomenal, the dynamics of everyone's relationship is oddly fitting--- like you think they wouldn't belong there but it just works, stupendously! And ofc this is OOC, everything's reversed duh. But be prepared, because this is a gut-wrenching fic, not for the faint-hearted.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12917045/1/Manacled][Manacled by SenLinYu]] I also haven't read this for a while because I was waiting for this to be finished, now it's complete! Another dark fic bc why not. I just remember loving the plot, so I'm actually going to read the whole thing again just bc I waited too long for this to be completed.

** Most of my favourites tend to fall in two categories; great humor or great plot, but I'm sure most of those are common enough to be widely known, like linkffn(Seventh Horcrux; Where in the World is Harry Potter; Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) so I'll share a few fics I think are absolutely amazing but have a low following.

linkffn(Fate by TheTrueSpartan) has become one of my absolute favourites in the past few months. It's a Ron-centric fic with a fairly unique plot, good characterisation and my favourite thing about it, an impressive ability to simultaneously have a lot of small and large plots going on. It keeps it from getting boring.

linkffn(I Know Not And I Cannot Know - Yet I Live and I Love) is short but brilliant. Definitely try it out if you haven't.

Someone on here recently recommended a Lavender-centric fic which is quite well-written and interesting; linkffn(My Life as A Teenage Gladiator).

If you'd like something sad, linkffn(Friends by glue and tar).

** Some of my favorites are:\\
[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4113087/1/A-Different-Fate][A Different Fate]]: what could have happened if Harry had been more affected by the killing curse.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]]: Harry takes Runes in the third year. I really like it when authors get creative with the Hogwarts' subjects.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4019373/1/Common-Sense][Common Sense]]: Almost everyone has one of these xD This is Disobedience Writer (in my opinion one of the best fanfic authors) collection of little plot bunnies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7558470/1/Conspiracy][Conspiracy]]: Not for Ginny lovers. This is Pureblood Culture Harry and I love it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3759227/1/The-TriSchool-Tournament][The TriSchool Tournament]]: A twist on the Goblet of Fire.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][The Valley of the Kings Massacre]]: Harry goes to Egypt in full Indiana Jones Mode. Howard Carter beware.

"[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6206646/1/Be-Careful-What-You-Wish-For][Be Careful What You Wish For]]" and "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]]" are fic one and two respectively. Harry leaves his mark in the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9822996/1/A-Small-Grey-Stone][A Small Grey Stone]]: I don't usually read Weasely Centered fics, but this one really caught my attention.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6034766/1/The-Serpent-and-the-Mirror][The Serpent and the Mirror]] is a most successful attempt at reimagining the "Harry is crazy" trope.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4356667/1/Wish-Carefully][Wish Carefully]] great fic about cause and consequence.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12175260/1/The-Sound-Of-Silence][The Sound of Silence]] a "Harry is abused by his relatives" trope but with a new hat. (jk is really good).

** My Top 5 Fics: a copypasta.

1. Meaning of One by Sovran [[http://www.siye.co.uk/series.php?seriesid=54]] is my favourite fic, period. It's a Hinny soul bond fic, which is rightfully a turn off for many people, but Sovran takes the idea and makes a gripping and emotional retelling of Hogwarts. Every character feels as if they have been ripped straight from canon while allowing for further intricacy and depth. The bond itself isn't prone to being trashy and tropey like similar stories, while Harry and Ginny do become fast friends, their developing relationship is tactful, believable and ultimately wholesome as hell. The bond's mechanics are developed early and have a complete set of pros and cons that don't derail the story into wish-fulfillment, it even addresses puberty in a way that is in-depth yet mature and reasonable. Seriously, I could and have gushed and gushed about this fic for hours, so I'll stop myself now.
2. Before I read, Meaning of One, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by Viridian [[https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry%5C_potter%5C_and%5C_the%5C_nightmares%5C_of%5C_futures%5C_past/index/][https://viridian.fanficauthors.net/harry\_potter\_and\_the\_nightmares\_of\_futures\_past/index/]] was my favourite fic. It's a Peggy Sue in which Harry won the war, but Britain and everyone in it died in the process. Essentially he cast the killing curse on himself in order to go back to 1991. It's an emotional story in which Harry questions his moral integrity for, in his eyes, manipulating the younger versions of his friends like Fanon!Dumbledore.
3. Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay by Saphroneth [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/harry-is-a-dragon-and-thats-okay-hp-au-crack.731548/reader/]] was my introduction to HP fanfics, since I was reading Saphroneth's other works before then. And it's a good introduction. It's a crack story where Harry is a dragon. Not a dragon animagus an actual dragon. The idea is taken to its logical and hilarious extremes that somehow still make perfect sense. Original plotlines are derailed constantly, only for a new slice-of-life comedy to take its place that adheres to and closely examines canon and side-content to come to new and innovative conclusions. Starring: a Black-Backed Bookwyrm, a club of "Oddly Shaped Students," Astronaut!Ron, Neville whacking things with an iron pipe, Velociraptor!Hermione, the best interpretation of Dumbledore ever, and a very confused Draco.
4. This goddamn cryfest by The Seeker. Saving Harry [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127417]] takes all the abuse that Harry went through in canon and analyses what a child in that situation may have ended up like. It is pure Hinny hurt/comfort injected into your veins, and absolutely heartbreaking. Luckily, the ending isn't tragic, so you're not endlessly wallowing in sadness.
5. I love the concept of Forced Maturity by pseudonym. [[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=127442]]] It's a post-Half-Blood Prince Harry Peggy Sue, but the twist is that Harry loses all his memories of the future. So he's got all of 16-year-old Harry's magical abilities, muscle memory, and emotional associations, with no explanation as to why he has any of them. There are a couple things I take issue with like the whole age line thing and the fact it's abandoned after the end of CoS. I mostly love it for the idea which has plenty more room for exploration, and the Hinny because I'm trash.

** [[http://keiramarcos.com/fan-fiction/darkly-loyal/]]

Darkly Loyal - The best Evil!Dumbledore, Evil!Weasleys fanfic I've ever read, mainly because of a certain twist towards the end of the fic. It's Harry/Draco/Hermione, and the romance is handled surprisingly well.

It can also be hilarious sometimes, which is a huge plus imo.

** If I had to pick one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]].

My ultimate Harry Potter fic. I could go on about this one forever and probably will if I don't stop myself very soon- Okay. I'll shut up. Just, dear god, please read it.
