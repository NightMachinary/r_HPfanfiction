I'm looking for good “character studies” of the following characters Fleur Delacour, Percy Weasley, Rita Skeeter, and Narcissa Malfoy.


** - linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities) (pandan to linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) focusing just on Percy & Audrey Weasley) --- this story made it into my a very firm headcanon that Audrey is a Muggle), both of these stories are AU from OoP, and I am not completely enamoured to it (also it is a Harmony story, which is minus for me), but particularly Percy & Audrey characters are lovely.
- linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC) ­--- this is mostly Bill & Fleur story, but Percy & eventually Audrey are prominent as well (OK, one minus for this story is that here Audrey is a witch). Slightly too much explicit sex for my taste, but the story is well done.

**** They didn't scared me off (and yes, I was skipping over them), but I think it is one of many stories where the overabundance of sex actually harmed the continuity of story. I don't like them but from the literary-technology point of view I can understand sex-oriented stories (if I don't call them pornography outright) and there are certainly its readers, but the stories which have actual plot and are otherwise well written are IMHO really not well served when whole chapter is dedicated to the detailed description of parts of anatomy in action. Only real masters of writing can do such interrupted or multi-layered stories (e.g., Herman Melville in the Moby-Dick with inclusion of the Handbook of Practical Whaling) and most fanfic authors are not these. Although I am certainly not an expert on such literature I don't think that such stories work well even as a pornography.

I was trying to find a good story even in linkao3(Becoming Harriet by Teao), but there I guess it is my fault: this is clearly meant more as a pornography (including all those stupid tropes of magic-leads-to-increased-libido, Hermione-lost-it-with-Krum-in-15, and everybody-is-sleeping-over-whole-castle, and this is even BDSM), so my efforts to find a story there were probably misguided and if anybody tried to made a cleaned-up version there is not much remaining there (but I still think I could like it).

** I second the rec above for /Order of Mercy/, I just finished it last week.

linkao3(7811107) has Draco time-travelling to prevent the war, it shares POV with Narcissa and there's bits about how she grew up, how it shaped her that I liked.

linkao3(6551137) the other Draco time travel fic by the same author is Narcissa POV about the first meeting at Madam Malkin's shop.

#+begin_quote
  A man appears at the gates of Malfoy Manor. Draco Malfoy isn't the average first choice for a hero sent back in time to save the world. Narcissa Malfoy, slightly surprised to see the grown man her eleven-year-old son could be, isn't the average first choice for his Horcrux-hunting partner either. Honestly, they're supposed to be on the other side in all this business. But it cannot be denied that they're very efficient, especially given their quest is relegated to Narcissa's free time and Draco is relegated to a guest wing bedroom so his father and younger self don't interfere. Nor can it be denied that if the Dark Lord isn't going to show them loyalty and victory, then... well... Family First, after all.
