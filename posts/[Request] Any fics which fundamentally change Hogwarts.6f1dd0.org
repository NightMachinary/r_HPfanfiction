Looking for larger changes, like the removal of houses or making it a day school without any boarders. Just interested if this idea has been touched on at all.

** Strictly speaking, the changes in this fic probably aren't large enough to qualify for what you're looking for. However, the fic is well-written and engaging, despite having several of the more tired Tropes.

It features a dimension-traveling Dumbledore swapping places with himself and issuing some changes into Hogwarts structure:

He expands stations for the Hogwarts Express, allowing for easier, more leisurely visits from family members, including Muggles.

He also restructures the classroom set-up.

Also, he insists on proper manners, so that even sworn enemies must be polite to one another

**** I definitely enjoyed it, and there's a certain catharsis to it--it simultaneously embraces and defies the Manipulative!Dumbledore trope.

(For the record, I finished it yesterday...after discovering it yesterday. So it reads well, and reads fast)

** The Firebird trilogy---linkffn(8629685) linkffn(9646669) linkffn(10373959)---changes how Hogwarts and magic itself work. The details of canon are sometimes kept, sometimes inverted, sometimes put in an alternate context.

  They had a plan, formulated from before they were even born. That plan died. From its ashes rises a Harry Potter no longer willing, or able, to let others fight his battles for him. Outgunned, outclassed, outmatched, nonetheless Harry will take up the sword to change not only Britain, but the world.

  Hard times lead to hard choices. What's more important? Freedom, or fate? Love, or death? Harry Potter stands on the edge of a precipice, and he is not sure if the right move is to turn and fight, or fall.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.

** Linkffn(reign of the serpent) Slytherin gets its own dorm, the rest of the houses bunk together in a huge dormitory. It's a caste based system and houses are used outside of Hogwarts too.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.
