The fic that brought this question on is a Legend Of Zelda fic if anyone was wondering. But there are also a few Harry Potter fics that I'm working on which I was also considering splitting, which is why I asked here as well as [[/r/FanFiction][r/FanFiction]] and [[/r/ZeldaFanFiction][r/ZeldaFanFiction]].


** My preference is for one single long fic, but if there are clean breaks in the plot they would justify a new fic because of a change in tone, change in the core characters, or something similar that you want your audience to be aware of it can make sense.

** In the vast majority of cases, splitting doesn't make sense at all and can actively hurt your story and your readership. It essentially makes it more effortful for the readers to first find out /about/ the existence of a sequel, then find the story /itself/, then finally gather enough effort to actually start it---since even though the difference is minimal, starting a sequel /feels/ like more effort than just reading an another chapter in the next big arc. It obscures your writing and introduces needless difficulty. Speaking more abstractly, it can also spoil this kind of synesthetic /feeling/ of the story in subtle ways; the new title might give a subtly different impression, influencing the readers thought process. If you're posting on fanfiction.net, changing that miniature image on the story might create the same effect. It might seem kinda esoteric and too small to make a real change, but trust me---even details like this can put some people off.

On the other hand, /if/ your story really needs to be split---by having, for instance, a completely different cast, genre/tone, and so on---then go for it. The same could be said here; adding something significantly different as just another arc can also spoil the readers' impression of the whole work. But it really needs to be clearly different than the previous story, even if it follows from it, because otherwise the negatives aren't worth the benefits.

*** I definitely agree that on FFN splitting a story up into separate fics makes it more difficult for readers to find out about sequels, but do you think that same objection applies to Ao3?

On Ao3, fics that are part of a series automatically have a link to the series in their discription, so even people randomly seeing a fic in search results would be able to easily find the other fics in the same series. Ao3 also gives readers the ability to "subscribe" to a series, thus making it much easier to know when an author posts new fics in the same series.

Another reason splitting fics up might be better on Ao3: The author can put different tags on each fic in the series to more accurately represent which portions of the story contain certain pairings, tropes, content that might merit a trigger warning, etc. In my experience this is especially relevant for stories that cover multiple years, since characters in that timespan would naturally change and have different interactions with their peers.

** I personally like splitting them up because I am more likely to keep reading if the number of chapters isn't crazy intimidating. I always love finishing a fic and discovering more parts to the same series, it's like when you finish a really good book and you don't want to leave, except you don't need to. It's a lovely surprise and always makes me so happy and excited at the opportunity to spend more time with these characters and world ( I feel like even though technically the baseline characters and world are based off the same thing, every time I read a fanfic the different writing styles make me see the them in a new light)

** Honestly does it even matter?

If it was one fic of 300k words or 6 lots of 50k, if its good I'm going to read it all.

The only plus of it being a fully written long fic would be so if someone likes long fics and searches for +150k or whatever it would be in the search parameters.

Personally, i've never said 'omg this fic is too long i'm not going to start reading it' because if it was 2 million words and the first 20k was shit I wouldn't bother, but it it was good I'd be ecstatic that it was a well written long fic.

Depending on my search, I might not find any of the 50k ones. Often I want to read a longer fic (especially when I started reading fanfic), and 60k+ (if not 100k+!) was very often included in my search.

And if I read a description and read "sequel", it's quite a bit of effort to click on the story, click on the author profile, and scroll until I find the first part. And generally, sequel descriptions aren't as interesting most of the time, unfortunately :(

** At the risk of sounding pessimistic while trying to be realistic, I will be blunt. Extra-long fics in my experience almost always have several flaws that compromise them, dooming them from the onset:

- More often than not, the author is initially ambitious and writes quickly (and often poorly). Eventually, they improve and begin to dislike their previous work, dropping the whole as it no longer feels worth the effort. This happens in either case of one or several fics, as the authors get burnt out.
- Long fics generally suffer from a lack of a cohesive plan in place when writing. There are a lot of ideas, but ideas are not the backbone of a story; its the plot and structure that truly makes a book what it is. And this often leads to authors going ahead with out coherent marking points (beginning, middle, end, etc.) that writes them into a corner.

There are other more specific issues, but those are what hold almost every long-fic back, and are why most of them end up being abandoned anyway. In my experience, shorter fics in almost every genre (60-150k range) generally have the best and most enjoyable stories overall, as they have a far more focused storylines with more unique plots. Long fics can be enjoyable, but they are almost always inferior due to the amount of unnecessary bloat.

Either way, write how or why you want - /it's your work, not ours/. I would just say temper your expectations and goals, and recognize that many others have gone down the same path as you. Try to learn from them.

*** In my plans, I'm separating it by story arcs rather than fics, so I'm not sure if the second point would be a problem. When I'm done planning all of the arcs is when I start writing and I only post if I've written the entire fic beforehand (too many times I've had to wait for months for a fic that I really liked to update, which made me lose interest in it, is why I do that), so I don't think the first point would be too much of a problem.

** I would split as long as you have a tidy ending to the story arc. You don't want to end a story on an unsatisfactory note. But I prefer shorter stories in a series than a long story. A lot of times I don't have the time to read a 300'000 word story so I won't even start it, but a 50,000 word one I will and if it's good and there are other stories in the series I will then move on to read them or bookmark them for later.

** Multiple if the fic length is over, say, 200 or 300K. If I'm looking for a fic and it's over 300K I'm more hesitant to read it because it'll probably be a lot of filler. Most fics that are 400K+ can usually have 100K words cut out without there being any change to the main plot.

** If there are significant story arcs (or say different years at Hogwarts) I prefer multiple fics. But, that's primarily in ao3 where you can easily link them as a series. It gets unwieldly in ff.net sometimes if the author has a number of fics to find the next in a series.

** It depends in part upon the site: On ffnet, it's a pet peeve of mine to start reading a fic that's marked "Complete" but turns out to be part 1 of a multi-part story that's been abandoned for years. A single fic makes it much clearer to a potential reader what the total length is that they're getting into and whether it's complete and/or actively updated.

On AO3, you can do it as a Series, so it's individual fics but linked together and marked right in the description.

As an alternative to splitting it up, you could put book-and-chapter in the chapter titles. For example, chapter 1 could be listed as 0-1: Prologue, 2 as 1-1: The Actual Start of the Story, and 3 as 1-2: The Second Chapter of Book 1.

** Depends on how long is long.

I personally read fics downloaded into ebooks (I visit the pages and review in batches).

As such, I prefer single long works as they are easier to keep track of.

However, once works get to 750K words or so (about 3/4 the length of the main series), there can be occasional annoying lag with ereaders. At that point, it probably makes sense to start splitting up the work (for example, the excellent ongoing series by Nimbus Llewelyn ends book one at what would probably be a book-ending point for a print book, at 824,628 words; book two is already at a similar length of 825,958 words).

** As long as it follows the standard story format, whatever you do is fine. The harry potter books as an example; all have there own plot and are connected by the overarching plot. But wouldn't make a good single story without some editing. Rowling writes every book as if we didn't read the previous book, but that wouldn't fly in a single book as it's expected that we read the previous chapter.

More importantly (at least in my opinion) is that the fanfic updates on a schedule. Example Embers AtlA fanfic updated every three weeks. Or Heroes Assemble! Which just finished, updated every other friday.

I would also avoid waffling about in your stories, answering questions in every new chapter run on sentences, and long unexplainable hiatusby the author.

Any way, good luck.

** I'm fine with splits as long as each fic can be a complete story. By which I mean each fic has a proper story structure, with a beginning, middle, end, conflict, etc etc. That's not to say you can't have an overarching plot between the fics, but each one needs to resolve some form of a plot. Like the books. /Pureblood Pretense/ and /Black Princess/Queen/ are good examples of fic series in this vein.

​

I've seen fic series where each story covered a different year, but some years where very much "yes, X year was a thing. Oh nothing happened, but the books divided it by year, so I will too." Don't do that.

​

Basically as long as it makes sense to split then go for it. But don't split it up just because some know-it-all on the internet said you should.

​

Hope that helps
