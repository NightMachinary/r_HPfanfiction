Basically as the title says; I have a serious love for Hermione/Pansy, but I /really/ dislike Drarry and every fic I've come across so far has that as either the main or background pairing. Other than that I'm not particularly picky as to the other pairings, I'm just looking for mainly Pansmione as they're my fave and it's a rare pair so I've read all of the AO3 fics
