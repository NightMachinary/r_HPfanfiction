I was going through a bunch of old bookmarks, and I came across this: [[http://jenniboo.50megs.com/harrypotter/super_harry.html]]

Its a decent list of old-but-good Harry Potter FanFiction, but I was dismayed to realise one of the fics I wanted to reread was on restrictedsection.org (which no longer exists), and after googling around I haven't been able to find any evidence it ever existed past from this list. Does anyone have a copy of it, or some way of getting ahold of one?

The specific fic in question was called Transforming Harry, and it was one of the most elaborate gender bender fics I've ever read in the potter fandom. An actual blurb is available in the link above, as well as a link to the now defunct page (which unfortunately requires a login, and so can't be retrieved with the Wayback Machine as far as I'm aware

** It's up on [[https://ficwad.com/story/269233][ficwad]]. Don't be alarmed by the number of chapters being different - there's an author's note that says it's been consolidated but nothing was removed other than some typos.
