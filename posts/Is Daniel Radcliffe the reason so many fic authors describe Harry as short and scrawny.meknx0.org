It's something I'm noticing more and more of as I dig through fics, but many authors describe Harry as rather short and scrawny. Many times he maxes out at 5'6 or 5'7. I know from the books that he has gotten much taller by the end of things, described as equal in height to James Potter's rather tall self. Am I on the right track, or am I completely off base?


** Harry is canonically small for his age at least in First Year. He grows a lot between 5th and 6th Year and is about the same height as James was (I imagine between 5'10 and 6'0). If authors describe Harry as short anytime before he's 16, that could very well be accurate. We're never really told how tall Harry is during that time. Considering that he's a teenage boy, he could very well be short one day and very tall a few months later ( I think we all knew people like that in high school).

** Most likely.

Personally, I imagine he was scrawny as a child but I see and write his teenage self as tall but a bit shorter than Ron with a lean build.

** Partially. He's also described as small for his age in the early books. Dursley's literally staving him definitely had some effect. He only had a sudden growth spurt in later books.

By the way, I like short and scrawny Harry.

*** I remember reading that Harry and James were around the same height when Harry made his way through Snape's memories. James definitely didn't get starved by the Dursleys, which sort of confuses me - I definitely agree that baring neglected by the Dursleys would have negative effects on his height.

** Honestly, I think it's more interesting if he is short and scrawny. It really adds to the whole 'David vs Goliath' vibe of him vs Voldemort. Whether it's canon or not, making him tall and muscled just weakens that imagery, I feel.

Tiny Little Harry vs Big Bad Voldemort has that real 'you can't win, but you try anyway' vibe that's just so much more pleasing to read than Heroic Handsome Harry striding up to face him, y'know?

** I think once in the Philosophers Stone it's said that he's small for his age, maybe, I may just be going insane from reading too many fanfics where he's described as small.

*** I remember something about him being described as "the perfect seeker build" and that being small and lean or something like that.. But I cant remember the exact words.

** Well, there's multiple reasons, but I actually think that the biggest one is how he's described in the first book, along with the fact that Seekers were said to generally be the small and light.

** Canonically, in the early books he's described as "small for his age" and in book 7 the Weasley Twins make a crack along the lines of "Imagine if something goes wrong and we end up as specky, /scrawny/ gits forever" in response to Harry trying to veto everyone Polyjuicing as him - though I doubt the latter are reliable sources of information.

** Maybe

Personally I write him as short because that's how I picture him

*** That's another reason. I think his height is a number of people's headcanon, which is perfectly alright for their writing styles and AU's.

** He must have started scrawny, considering how the Dursleys withheld food from him, and the books said very little about his physical appearance after that except for a very few hints, so it's easy to assume he stayed scrawny unless you search for those hints.

*** I agree with that. I also think many HP authors haven't read the books in a good long while, much like myself. There are a few hints here or there. He's described as being equal in height to James Potter, who even Voldemort describes as tall. Molly Weasley also says he's "just as bad as Ron" when she see's his growth. The hints are small, but they are there.
