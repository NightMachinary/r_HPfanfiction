I was thinking about writing a full on demon harry fic, but I'm not totally sure what the storyline will be like.

I'd prefer for it to begin around gof or ootp, as I feel like canon divergence over total au. As it goes on it would stray from canon, especially because I need to work the demon mechanics into this world as well as flesh it out.

Those that are familiar with wizarding Britain know how small it can be, and against demons it would seem pathetic. Harry would be powerful yes, but I want there to be stakes for him. It would be boring if he got whatever he wanted whenever.

So in order to counter the demon race, there will would be a group in the shadows waiting to fight them. They exist between churches, government bodies, and in every day life, their existence is to be heavens guard on earth. They are paladins, priests/priestesses, and light mages, they protect the earth in gods name. They are called the White Tide.

In my world, Demons are a chaotic evil race that reside in hell. They hate heaven and its inhabitants, and want nothing more than to wipe it from existence. The race came from the fallen, and have mutated from the angels. They inhabit the underworld, and have been trapped there as a species for millennia. The only access they have to the surface is through contracting, and minor influence from Satan (Lucifer).

There are different types of demons, minor ones like imps and pixies, a varing middle spectrum that includes a lot of dark creatures like vampires, beasts, and chimeras, and the archs that are seen as the stereotypical humaniod demons. However, while demons mainly are born, they can also be created; albeit very rarely. There are certain circumstances that must be met, such as a soul that is sufficiently powerful, angry/vengful, and tainted by death. While these seem like rather easy points to meet, nothing will happen unless the soul is fouled by a large amount of demonic energy. Even then the changes must be embraced or nothing will really happen, save for the body dying.

My story premise is after the events of the third task; Harry returns to Privet Drive, and his darker emotions are much more volatile. He's a darkened person from the events in his childhood, and the return of Voldemort is a tipping point. Harry is a child of prophesy, he is special. Someone touched by fate will have a stronger soul and magic, and is generally kept an eye on by higher powers.

So imagine Satan's surprise when a supposed child of the light uses a ritual to try and summon and contract a demon. Harry'd gone disguised to Knockturn ally and picked up a basic summoning guide, intent do use it and summon an evil helper. He was desperate act, even if it meant selling his soul. Voldemort needed to die.

Instead of letting a regular demon answer, Satan saw an opportunity. If he could have an arch demon on the surface, then the Opening could come much sooner. He blasts Harry through the ritual circle with demonic essence, and happily sees how dark and cracked Harry's soul was. With barely any coercion, he turns the boy into an arch demon with a single mission:

Open the Gates of Hell.

This story would feature full on demon Harry, bright red skin, black blood, fangs, pointy ears, retractable bat wings, a spaded devil tail, cloven hooves, and a nice set of horns.

(And no, idt I'll pair Harry with anyone)

He'll probably return to Hogwarts for a bit, but I don't have to much of a future lay out. Please tell me what you think! I want your ideas too!

This is called the Harbinger of Hell.


** Will Harry actually be bringing the residents of hell out or just be a more evil/demonic version of himself doing other things?

*** Actually opening the gates would come much later. Not every demon is in hell, and Harry was just turned into a rather powerful one. He'd probably start out doing his own stuff, then start looking toward opening them when things pick up.

**** Well, it could be a pretty cool idea. My only suggestions would be; be careful of any religious stuff you incoude, and other than that; people often enjoy struggle, so Harry becoming a demon and having to deal with all the problems that come with that at first would be fun.

****** Cool. One last thought, are you familiar with the Transcendence AU of Gravity Falls fan fiction? If not that's fine, but if so you might be able to incorporate some of the demoney things from that. Eg. Harry is a demon, an agent of chaos. He's not human anymore, but he's not necessarily /evil/. He's perfectly fine doing kinda evil demon things, but his link back to his original humanity makes him want to be a more... /human/ kind of demon.

******* Yeah I am, definitely went through the GF phase. His humanity would be a big part of his wish to go back to Hogwarts, he doesn't want to leave his life behind even if it means glamoring the heck out of his body. He'd be struggling with his morals all throughout, caught between sadistic apathy and the loving relationships he's built. Satan didn't give him much, so until his hand is forced Harry will try to be normal. Having the remnants of the summer to sort things out will definitely help him in the control department, but you can't ignore a demon at Hogwarts for long.

******** Would he be glamouring himself, or would he just be able to alter his physical appearance. First thing that comes to mind is that while his body is human he is blocked from his more powerful abilities. What would his abilities be specifically?

********* Sorry, didn't see ur notif! Harry's physical appearance can range from what I described, to human. There won't a any out of nowhere metamorphic abilities, and changing his body won't be fun. In order to appear human he has to shift and suppress parts of his body, its uncomfortable and like having an arm in a too tight sling. It's no so much he can't use all of his abilities, but if he does he will expose himself.

********** His abilities aren't all worked out, but demon magic will be different than human magic. It's much more chaotic and wild, so Harry won't have an easy time with more intricate spellwork. I'm comparing it to trying to carve something with a sledgehammer lol. Elemental magic will be big, and I'm thinking of having him use either fire, air, darkness, ice or lightning (which I'm leaning towards). He'll be a fantastic flyer, and have an easy time with darker arts. And since his magic is so uncontrollable, I'm thinking of giving him a set of bracelet foci for the more blasty magic. Maybe he /can/ learn all the Elemental magic, but he has a natural affinity for one? If you have any ideas I'd love to hear them!

*********** Well, I would base it on his personality. If he's super angry/violent/powerful then some black fire or lightning (or both) sound pretty demonic. But if he's a bit more thinking, more cold, then black ice and snow would be kinda cool. ;)

General stuff like flying is definitely a good idea, maybe some form of possession and mind reading? Small scale teleportation, telekinesis, fear aura, etc. Other than that I'm not sure.

(Hope this is helpful and not annoying)

************ You bring up good points. At this point in his life, harry is rather irritable so I'm thinking some cool lightning. Like someone ticks him off and then a big crash of thunder? OvO that sounds fun. As for the general stuff: yes,, very good ideas. I think Harry'd hold off on the more possessing and mind stuff, because he's probably a bit uncomfortable with the idea. He'll need to loosen up his morals a bit first lol. And >:O it's not annoying! Thanks so much for helping me figure this stuff out! It's very appreciated ♡

******** About inspiration I would recommend trying a eviler version of Crowley from Good Omens. He is a demon and does the occasional “evil” deed (which mostly boils down to inconveniences and annoyances), but he does enjoy the comforts and good things in life to the point of not being completely on-board with the whole “end the world” plan.

** Id recommend running cults on both sides, and all of them intending to manipulate Harry. Light side can try to make the portal into a trap etc. Maybe also with something Lily did. I've seen that before, where she was part of the Rose Court. Can't remember where it was though.

** I had a somewhat cracky idea to have one of those "summon another Harry who already defeated Voldemort fics" where instead of getting an alternate Harry the order accidentally summons a demon. Turns out getting summoning instructions from a book in Grimmauld Place wasn't the best idea.

Anyway your idea sounds like it could make a really fun fic, I hope you write it someday. My only suggestion that other people haven't already made is when Harry becomes a demon, I hope he doesn't still go by Harry. Kind of hard to take a demon named Harry seriously, lol.
