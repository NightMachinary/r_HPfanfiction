I read this fic a long while back, when I was binge reading any Veela fics I could find that were half decent. It followed the basic Veela!Draco premise where Harry is his mate, he'll die if Harry rejects him, yadda yadda.

Draco had wings that only Harry could touch, since anyone else messing with them sent Draco into convulsive fits from the agony it induced. There was some sort of subplot where he had a previous relationship with Blaise as well, if I recall correctly. Later in the fic, Voldemort has him kidnapped somehow, and forces Draco to carry his child? I think it was in some bid to aquire an heir to ensure his immortality or something. Draco gets rescued, and ends up falling down some stairs and losing the pregnancy, but Harry gets him pregnant not too long after.

At another point, Draco's mother is pregnant with a girl when Lucious ends up dying, so she ends up dying of a broken heart right after giving borth some months later. Draco wasn't allowed to raise his sister because of some weird politics going on involving his mental state and family ties.

There was also a really interesting Veela mating/wedding ceremony in the first few chapters, where veela and part-veela had symbols painted on their stomachs to signify if they were pregnant, mated, etc. I think it may have been Bill and Fleur's wedding?

If you know where I can find this fic, I'd love it if you could point me to it. I remember the writing being above par when I read it, but this was at least three years ago, so I'm unsure how well my memory of it holds up. Any other well-written Veela!Draco drarry fics are welcome as well if you don't know this specific one. I'm on a kick right now, and that's what got me trying to find this one again in the first place.

Thanks in advance to anyone who may help!

** I'm sorry that I didn't see this earlier, but the fic you're talking about is Mansion Built Upon Sand. Unfortunately the author (Jinko) removed it quite some time ago, but there are downloadable copies of it around the web, or if you can't find those, I can email it to you.

It was the first Drarry fic I read and I was in love with it! PM me if you'd like me to email it along.

*** I think I managed to find a copy now that you've given me the name and the author. Thank you for replying and letting me know!

I've been trying to find it for what seems to be ages, but trying to describe the plot of it usually turns into a ramble like it is in my post. It's a lot better written than my descriptions leads one to believe I think.

Thanks for the tip off on the name/author, and also for the offer! I'll pm you if i can't turn anything up for downloads. :)
