I'm looking for a Harry/Fleur fic with these two qualities

1. (The most important one) Where harry and fleur meet earlier and become acquainted much sooner (around 1st year or 2nd year)

2. Where harry is a bit older than he was in canon to make the age difference not that big


** I mean, the age difference is three years.

*** Yeah, it is already not that big. Three years is nothing.

** There is linkffn(What You Leave Behind by Newcomb) but it's abandoned and they haven't started dating in the story yet. They're friends and it's still a good story though. Harry's also a year older than in canon.

#+begin_quote
  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
