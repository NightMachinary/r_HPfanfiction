So . . . I'm writing a subplot in my story about Harry trying to dethrone Quidditch as the top magical sport of the Wizarding World by designing and then developing a new game of his own.

Has anything similar to this ever been done before? If so can you link the story?

*** Let's not leave out the fact that that sport may actually be the worst part out of that entire fic (though it is a tossup with the pointless Luna stuff, and the random milf nonsense).

  If you read just one fiction tonight make it this one. Go inside the mind of Harry Potter as he deals with betrayals, secrets and wild adventures. Not your usual fanfic.

** I have a modified quidditch game that eschews brooms for magically modified mountainboards and the pitch has a constantly shifting design so you can't just race across, you need to account for sudden hills, whoops, and so on. Broom racing is a fun thing to modify. I introduced Battlemages(Battleship variant) in Darkness Ascendant.

** I had this idea about an unofficial dogfights club (on brooms, obviously). Maybe for a crackfic cause it seems difficult to justify how the Hogwarts staff stays unaware of it.

Some kind of magical laser tag in the castle corridors could be funny too.
