If you mean a crossover wherein HP ends up in the world of some anime or video game, and is raised there... there are many. My collection has many of those crossing into Naruto or Pokemon, of various qualities.

  It has always been said that magic and technology did not mix; too bad no one ever mentioned that little fact to young Harry Potter. Add in one mad genius bent on destroying the lives of ten thousand people by trapping them inside of his online virtual reality game and you have the makings of a very dangerous brew. HP/HG

** sorry those are not what i'm talking about, maybe it was an alternate dimension he went to, but it seemed more like a game world to me, i know he had the ability to travel dimensions, and when he goes back to his world, he not a little kid any more but a young man, i dont think it was a crossover but i could be wrong
