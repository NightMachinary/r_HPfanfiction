I've not found any Fem!harry fics I actually want to read, which is a shame, because it's a premise that could cover important themes about gender and sexuality. If you know any, please, recommend them!

I don't particularly care if the Harry in the story is trans and identifies as a woman before the transformation, but if he doesn't he should be upset and freaked out. I see a lot of fics where Harry doesn't have any kind of gender dysphoria, and then becomes a girl by magic and is like "ok, guess I'm a woman now!" I'd love to see how people treat Harry differently. Does Ron decide to be an ass and try to ask Harry out "because you're hot now!"?


** Another Life, Another Love, Another---oh, whatever AverageFish Summary: On her first day in Forks, Izzy Swan walks into Carlisle's office asking him to be her shrink. On her second day at school, Edward realises she smells of lightning---and that she's crazy, because no, no he does not have an identical twin called Cedric. Watch events unfold for two people who have better things to do---but fall in love anyway.

A humorous odd love story that vaguely follows (parodies) canon, from the perspective of Carlisle Cullen. Mild swearing. Very little angst. Edward being creepy. Surprisingly healthy relationships. Teenagers. A gay/trans relationship.

Oh, and MOD!Harry, in a rebirth cycle, as a girl (Not Fem!Harry). While Izzy is a trans character it's not central to this fic. There's no angst, either.

It deals with gender dysphoria in a very nuanced way usually wouldn't read a story like this but I hope you give it a chance it's very well written and also fun!

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

*** I like it, but it is just fun, nothing serious. There are some rumours of that in “Becoming Harriet by Teao” linkao3(4876630), however whatever serious story there is drowned under the avalanche of smut. You have to skip a lot to get something more serious.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  When trying to stop his godfather from falling through the Veil of Death, Harry fell through with him. Death was none too pleased to see him this early in its realm, however, so he got another chance at life. Not as Harry though. His new life would be that of Rose Potter, Harry Potter's twin sister.
