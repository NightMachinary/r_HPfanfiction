You know, what happened during those 19 years, how did so and so get together? Etc. I prefer longer ones. And I've pretty much read everything from My Dear Professor McGonagall. [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2814689/My-Dear-Professor-McGonagall][Who if you haven't read her stuff yet, do.]]


** These aren't incredibly long, but here are two from one of my favorite FF authors, Moonprincess92. (She also does a lot of cute oneshots, and has two long Rose/Scorpius stories, if you're at all interested in that. And a post-battle, slightly AU story that focuses on the Weasley siblings and Harry & Hermione) Hope this helps!

*** All the Time In The World was perfect! It's very close to how I had always imagined the first day afterwards to be.

** This one isn't especially long, but it's nice and fluffy. Harry and Ginny immediately after James Sirius is born, along with a short dose of Ron and Hermione:

That author has about 20 stories about the Trio after the war. They are all canon-compliant, but with small errors (like the random info JKR releases every now and then...like Percy marrying a girl named Audrey not Penelope, for example). Harry and Ginny's relationship is very real and lovely. They love, fight, have moments where it looks like it will end, and then get back together. Enjoy.

*** Well, I wouldn't go so far as call it "fluffy" but I'm on chapter 14 right now and loving it! Thank you for the recommendation!

**** No problem! Some of the other stories that she writes are definitely "fluffy", but that's the intro story.
