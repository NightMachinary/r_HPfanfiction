** Chris-as-Sirius tried a joke to break the ice.

Harry was duly unimpressed.

"You're not particularly funny, are you?" remarked The-Boy-Who-Lived.

The man had never felt like his life had been such a waste. Maybe he /was/ better off in Azkabam.

Or as a dog. At least then he could lick his own balls.
