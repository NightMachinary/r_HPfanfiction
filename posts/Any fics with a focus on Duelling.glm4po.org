A duelling circuit, tournaments... Harry is quite good and puts his all in it. 75k+ words and preferably no Ron and Harry isn't a gryffindor.


** Well there is the story called Duel by fantasy1290. It includes dueling within the school as well as Harry competing in International dueling competitions.

Harry Potter and the Season of the Heart by Ice-Tea-1983 also contains a decent amount of dueling in it.

(Sorry focused on the dueling aspect and didn't look at the other part of your request).

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem

  My take on Harry's Sixth year, seventh year, and an epilogue skipping a few years in time. Not HBP or DH compliant.

*** Is Duel the one where he wins a duel by saying flipendo and Malfoy's wand flips and his spell hits himself?
