** Why not just write a straight Fallout crossover instead? It's not like that crossover is brimming with examples after all.

Or, if you don't fancy that, try a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. crossover instead. Harry Potter and the Cheeky Breekies would be quite a fun read... Even if a somewhat dark one all the time.
