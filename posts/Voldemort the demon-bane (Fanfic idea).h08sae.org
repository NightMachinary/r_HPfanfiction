Hey Guys

So... I just got an Idea for a potential Fanfic...

Just imagine Voldemort was a good guy all along.

The Scenario:

Voldemorts idea of Pureblood has nothing to do with magical ancestry but with the fact weather or not your family has through whatever reason demon blood in their veins.

The people he killed were all part of a sect of demon summoners that try to open a portal to the demon realm/hell/the outer realms/whatever you want to call it.

The reason why the demons cant enter earth (yet) is that either magic itself is sort of a screen they cant pierce or as an alternative the magical schools around the globe were erected as a kind of giant Wardstone to make sure no demon can get through.

Voldemort killed his uncle and made sure his grandfather would rot in Azkaban, because he found out that they were demon summoners that tried to restore the magic of their family that was dwindling because of all the inbreeding.

He didn't intentionally kill myrtle. It was an accident where she came upon him and the basilisk while they were trying to contain a rift opened on school ground. (good old Dumbles didn't know about this rift because only the headmaster has control oft he wards and Dippet, the headmaster at that time made sure no one would feel the foul magic by use of said ward)

Voldemort is not just a nice anagram for his name, but also a title that says he killed a demon of significant strength.

He doesn't like to be called riddle, cause tom riddle senior was an all around asshole and Voldemort feels and knows he earned his title.

Dumbledore isn't an evil person!!! The reason he organised the order to fight against Voldemort is a misunderstanding. The Minister of magic at the time of Voldemorts first â€žrise to powerâ€œ was another of the demon summoners and ran a smear campaign against Voldemort to stop him from killing other summoners and demons.

By the time Dumbles and Voldemort first met on the field, Dumbles was already certain that Voldemort tried to kill all muggles and Muggleborns.

The Blacks are an old family of demon slayers, although only arcturus (siriusâ€˜ grandfather) still remembers

The Profecy was corrupted by demons to talk about harry and voldemort instead of harry and the currend demon gighlord

The Horcruxes werenâ€˜t created to make voldemort immortal but as another means to ward the world from the demons. To create they have to be significant items tot he creator, demand part oft he creators soul as a sacrifice and the life of a summoner to ward against the way of summoning they are currently attempting

I know that is a pretty long post and not all the points are clear and fleshed out but it was a neat little idea that just flashed through my mind that i wanted to share with all of you

You are welcome to keep spelling and grammar mistakes to your self ðŸ˜‰


** This is both very specific, and very cool. It might be weird to read a story from Voldemort's perspective though, because even if we know he's the good guy, it would be too frustrating to see Dumbledore trying to stop him... Would still be rather interesting.

*** doesnt even have to be in voldies pov

could still start with harrys first year but the plot changes

and in best case you have voldi, dumbles and harry fight of the demons side by side at the end of the fic

and you could have dumbledore understand that voldemort just tries to save the world in the first few chapters of the fic if you want and change the plot to V,D,H vs Summoners and the Demon Highlord
