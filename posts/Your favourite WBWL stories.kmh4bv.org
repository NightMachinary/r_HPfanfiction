I've only started linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) so far and it's not really my cup of tea. I'm intrigued by the concept though, so anything without excessive bashing is more than welcome. Thank you!


** There aren't actually many notable fics where the WBWL trope is played straight. In terms of the premise, the most notable one historically is probably *Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived*, where Harry has a good relationship with his parents and brother but ends up at Durmstrang. This is a really wonderfully written fic that's unfortunately incomplete at around fourth year.

*Antithesis* and the *Sacrifices Arc* are notable long WBWL fics; I haven't read them, but they each have their fans and their detractors.

I like *Subversion* a lot, because in addition to being fantastically written and subverting a bunch of WBWL tropes, it has a really creative and well-thought-out mind magic system.

I'll mention *Sarcasm and Slytherin* and *Ashes of Chaos*, because they're popular here; I'm not terribly high on either of them but they're well written, good stories with some bashing involved, but nothing RobSt level.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** I also enjoy the concept and think there's a lot of potential but find this trope is often paired with a lot of bashing. That's why I like Genius Fratris. In this fic, Harry is traumatized by Voldemort killing his mom in front of him and doesn't speak. He still makes noise and can occasionally talk if he feels comfortable, but generally doesn't say anything. It's a rare WBWL in that James survived the attack and is not abusive.

*** Has anyone else noticed how many of Harry's brothers in these stories have names that start with J? So far I've met Jacob, John and two Jims. There seems to be a pattern!*

Also, if you don't mind me asking, is this a story in which Harry actually isn't the BWL, or is it one where it is later revealed that it really was Harry all along? Either way, thanks for suggesting it! I'll definitely give it a go.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** I haven't really got anything to add that hasn't already been mentioned. There are very few good WBWL fanfics. I'm pretty sure the majority of them where made so that the author could bash James, Lily, the Potter twin, Dumbledore, Ron, and Hermione.

*** Someone recommended it, saying that the prologue deliberately subverts your expectations by using a ton of cliché tropes but that it gets a lot better afterwards.

I'm like ~14 chapters in and imo it just isn't that good. I was actually quite interested when Harry first met James and wanted to see a lot of character interactions between him and his family, how they'd get along, exploring their complicated relationship after his upbringing with the Dursleys etc. Instead, it's made very clear from the beginning that James is nothing more than a dick who goes out of his way to send Harry drunken howlers and wants to disinherit him; his mum is indifferent and his brother is the bRAt wHo lIVeD. This aspect actually reminded me a lot of linkffn(Strange Reflections).

Also, the dialogue just feels unnatural. Everything that comes out of Harry's mouth (his parting words after his first meeting with James, his conversation with Snape, every single word between him and the other Slytherins) + the way Hermione called out Jim during Potions and then later again in front of the prefects is the opposite of authentic. Reading that made me cringe a little because in reality not many people would have reacted the way they did here.

I can definetely see why people would enjoy this fic, but in the end it just wasn't for me. Keep in mind though, that I've barely read a fraction of the story and could be very mistaken. For all I know, there could be a drastic change of all that one chapter later. But I think I'll take the risk;)

  In the aftermath of the Second Blood War its horrors still haunt the survivors, the country needs to be rebuilt and the last thing Harry Potter needed was a family of Potters from another dimension suddenly appearing.

**** IDK how much this matters to you but James and Jim do get genuinely better as the story progresses.

Also it's genuinely one of my favorite fics I've ever read, so I'd totally suggest that you read further unless you really don't want to (I totally understand that it isn't a fic for everyone).

To be honest, I don't remember that much about year one, but a certain thing in year two really kicked it up a notch for me.

Edit for clarification: I'm talking about The Prince of Slytherin. I'm not sure how clear that was.

**** Ah, I see. Considering where you are in the story those are definitely valid points. For what its worth, everyone who has read this story admits that Book 1 really isn't all that great.

I'm not going to sit here and tell you to continue reading, since this story is currently at 143 chapters, and over 1 million words. However, I will say that the Potter family get some major character development as the story progresses. I honestly think they, along with many other characters are portrayed very realistically.

I will also say that all your questions you more then likely have, including both why James acts like a dick to Harry, and even why Harry's dialogue in Book 1 seems unnatural (yes, there is a reason. Trust me, I was shocked too) get answered as the story progresses.

** I read once one where Harry was sent to live with the Dursleys, but unknown to everybody, Merlin saved him and the Founders raised him in their time. When he became 11 years old, he returned to his era and he was sorted into Slytherin. Sirius adopted him, the Potters disowned him and the Malfoys befriended him. He was actually Malfoy's best friend and Snape was his idol. He was also damn powerful and what you could call a “Mini” Dark Lord. He stole the Philosopher's stone in his first year, gave it to Voldemort, and he returned as Lord Marvolo Slytherin. The fic is pretty cool, but unfortunately, it's abandoned after more than 30 chapters and I don't remember how is it called 🙈😂

** Harry Potter and the Boy who Live by Santi is really the only decent one I know of (no bashing)...so many involve cartoonish, dumb bashing Lily and James, Dumbledore, etc.

** A school for outsiders -- Miratim » A nontypical wbwl story where harry goes to this school for mostly muggle-borns, werewolves and squibs. With some half-bloods. There is a bit of Dumbledore, James and Lily bashing. And Harry has a twin brother. Hermione will probably eventually go to this school as well. There is going to be a bit of a revolution and muggle technology and magic mix.

I might be promoting my own fic here, but you did ask for a wbwl fic
