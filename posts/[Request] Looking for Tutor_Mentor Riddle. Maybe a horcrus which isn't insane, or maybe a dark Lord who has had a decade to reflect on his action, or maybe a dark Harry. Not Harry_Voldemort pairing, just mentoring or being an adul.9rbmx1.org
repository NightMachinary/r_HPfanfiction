** Here we go:

Linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom): Voldemort takes Harry on as something between a Druidic apprentice and heir.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux): the Horcrux influences Harry and communicates with him, creating changes.

Linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin by zennith9): slight AU with Tom as the defense teacher who instructs Harry personally.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): Tom and Harry become pals after 5th year ends, and Tom helps instruct Harry to one day take down Voldemort.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.

**** Prince of a dark kingdom is ridiculously good. Only other fic I can think of that created such an immerssive AU is the one where Harry enters the wizarding world except its more of a witches world; they outnumber the men by a ratio of 5:1 (or something like that) and men are essentially forced into marriages with multiple women in order to limit their power. (Biologically men are stronger magically) While it sounds like a trashy harem anime setting it paints a very vivid dystopian world where the wizards are emasculated and treated as lesser than the withes. I can't remember the name of the series off the top of my head but it did feature a Voldemort who was somewhat understandable; however he did not have a memtor relationship with Harry.

  There is only one person Lord Voldemort trusts to guide Harry Potter through the Triwizard Tournament and into his Muggle father's graveyard at the opportune moment. It is not Barty Crouch Junior. “His name is Professor Riddle, and at least for now, no matter who you ask, nobody knows anything more. Professor Riddle, the new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher.”

** This one is a stretch, but it's *complete*, AND it is a *trilogy*, so you can have a nice long read: linkffn(9631998) "The Thorny Rose" by Brennus

In this one, after Chamber of Secrets, Ginny is left with all of Voldemort's memories up until he made the diary. This obviously affects her, and she then sets about influencing/guiding Harry.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.
