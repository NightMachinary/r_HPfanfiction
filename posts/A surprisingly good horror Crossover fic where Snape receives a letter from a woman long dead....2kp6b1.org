** If you're somebody that likes to listen to music while you read like I do, I'd like to mention that I +finally managed to find the [[http://downloads.khinsider.com/game-soundtracks/album/silent-hill-complete-soundtrack-ultimate-edition/2.04-silent-streets.mp3][SH1 overworld music]]. (click the link....)+ Curses! I didn't listen long enough and once again it's overtaken by "In Between" partway through... Ah well.

This isn't one of those dime a dozen "go into another world and kill things" crossovers. It's something you really ought to be able to expect from Silent Hill- there's lots of great character-building on Snape's part, and it's intelligently written as well. The author very much managed to incorporate the two worlds well.
