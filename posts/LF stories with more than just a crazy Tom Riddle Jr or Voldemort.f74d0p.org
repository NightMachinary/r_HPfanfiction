I liked the charming yet manipulative ways that Tom had, Voldemort seemed to lack that certain charm that Tom had possessed. Just looking for more interesting versions of either Tom or Voldemort or both.

More than just making Horcruxes or killing Muggleborns, Muggles, Squibs, et cetra. Not exactly looking for a good Tom or good Voldemort, though if one's written in a interesting way, I'll be fine with it.

Can be any kind of Tom or Voldemort, as long as it's not the canon one and is interesting.

Can be on Any site.

Anyone can be the main character.

Would rather it be completed or regularly update, but if not that's fine.

Horcruxes don't even have to be made. If they are or some are, that's fine too.

I don't want Dumbledore to be bashed, in the story. If Voldemort still hates him and wants him dead that's fine, but I like Dumbledore even with his flaws, and I don't like when authors go out of their way to bash on Dumbledore.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

No Harry/Hermione, Draco/Hermione or Harry/Tom (Harry/Voldemort)

No super powerful or super smart Harry, Harry slightly smarter or slightly more powerful than in canon is fine, but would rather want it believable.

NO Lord Potter or Harem Harry.


** Linkffn(Realignment) has Tom as the main character and shows what would happen if he were forced to spend time with Dumbledore during the critical period of his life where he turned into Lord Voldemort.

Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) features a Riddle who decided to go the political route rather than vigilante. It's implied he's still magically powerful, but his main impact on the story is elaborate plots that advance the Pureblood/Traditionalist agenda

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

There is nothing (to fear) is a 5 part series of shorts and one-shots about a Riddle who got sorted into Gryffindor. He decides to take up the mantle of the downtrodden of society. He's still ultimately Voldemort though.

** linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) has a very different Voldemort. It might be a bit more anti-Dumbledore than you want, but it's a good story.

linkffn(insurgiere by Silver Pard) has Tom Riddle as a Hufflepuff.

linkffn(Children of Set by What-Ansketil-Did-Next) is more a vignette than a story, and is set not that long after Riddle graduated, but may be interesting.

linkffn(Prophecy Averted by Achille Talon) has Voldemort deciding not to go after the Potters.

linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom) isn't to my taste, but has what's probably an SI keeping Voldemort from making mistakes noted in the Evil Overlord list.

linkffn(All Full of that Wizard Angst by CalamityJim) is a one-shot that has Voldemort giving Harry a lesson in magic in the forest.

Sane fem!Voldemort is an avid recruiter who loves to cultivate talent. She has no reason to want Harry dead anymore, and thinks Harry's talents would be better put to use on her side of the war. She is not a blood purist, but she works with them due to alignment of their goals. Further elaboration on her agenda will occur as the story progresses.

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
