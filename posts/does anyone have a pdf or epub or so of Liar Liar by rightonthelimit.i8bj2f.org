#+begin_quote
  Voldemort attacked the Potters on Samhain, but the Killing Curse didn't rebound---it was absorbed. Voldemort went on to crush his remaining resistance and has since dominated the magical world. Harry has been hiding in plain sight, but it seems that even his pseudonyms can't escape fame for long.--  Some might argue that memory is eternal, and it's only our ability to retrieve those memories that fades and is lost.  Of course, magic has a solution for that, too.
