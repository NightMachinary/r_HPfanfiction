** A decent one: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/1/Murder-Most-Horrid):]] Non-Voldemort AU; Bellatrix PoV; Bellamione.

Random question: Are there any Bellamione fics in which Hermione is the top in the relationship as opposed to the bottom? ("Hermatrix?")

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

** Does it specifically have to be lesbian or will any femslash do? And does her being lesbian have to be a big point in the plot or could it be that she just never showed any interest in men throughout the story?

Hermione will be tested in ways she never could have imagined, but with so many lives resting on her shoulder failure is not an option. She must do whatever it takes to not only prevent Bellatrix from following Voldemort, but also to take the Order's side.

Stopped reading when Hermione couldn't deal with Cormac McLaggen (and what was he doing at Hogwarts in 1998?) on her own and needed to be rescued by Ron, who just happened to conveniently be there.
