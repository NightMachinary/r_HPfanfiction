I've seen fics where characterizations are a bit over the top where these two are concerned. So it would be nice if someone could recommend a fic where Remus and Snape are in character. I don't want a long fic, though, so a one shot would be preferable.


** Huh. I didn't even know this was a thing. I don't have any recs but I kinda wanna write it now.

*** Please do! At times like these I really wish I could write because I wouldn't have to wonder what on earth Remus told him to make him say they won't have to write the essay and how Remus managed to make himself talk to Snape about this in the first place.

**** Ah don't let that discourage you. If you wanna write it, write it. We all have to start somewhere

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14828709/chapters/34318178][chapter 4]] of my fic, Humansplaining, Lupin converses with Snape right after his students turn in that stack of essays, but he doesn't actually mention the essays. Sorry, that's the closest I have.
