Hey folks, I recently heard about "HP and the Munchkins", which seems awesome...but it looks like the story's been completely taken down and I can't seem to find a record of it anywhere. I'd love to read it. Anyone have a saved copy somewhere, even though it's incomplete?

Fictionhunt and p0odyfiles seem to have a good archive in general, so those should be your first stops whenever you are in search of a deleted fic.

**** As far as I know, there isn't an easy online tool that does it for this site, but [[http://calibre-ebook.com/][Calibre]] can compile multiple html pages into an ebook. ( I haven't ever used it by the way...)
