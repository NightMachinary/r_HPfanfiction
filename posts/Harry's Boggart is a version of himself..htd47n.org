I got a little inspired by the Boggart scene in Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340) in which Harry's Boggart is a version of himself that's succumbed to greed and gone full Smaug.

Are there many fics in which Harry's Boggart is a version of himself? Could be himself dead, possessed by Voldemort, acting like a bully, or if he's particularly self-loathing it could even be just himself, as-is.

Feel free to write a scene as a fic-snippet below, too, if you can't think of any.


** Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path linkffn(11898648)

It's not a boggart, but the basic idea applies. One of the TriWizard tasks is to face yourself. For Harry, that means a full on Dark Lord version of himself. For Fred, he's a Ministry flunky.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

** Sarcasm and Slytherin has his boggart as himself, bruised and dressed as he was at the Dursley's, with his wand broken.

It's supposed to represent him being powerless to defend himself.

  It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and just like the last two, it promises to be anything but restful. House tensions are high, Harry's twin Jules, the darling of Gryffindor, doesn't like Harry any better than before, and on top of all that there's an escaped murderer on the loose who's apparently hell-bent on taking his revenge on both Potter twins.

** It's a creepypasta crossover but in linkffn(Brother in Arms by SteamGeek01) It's a recurring theme that Harry's/Isaac's boggart is himself having killed his family(by family I mean the creepypastas). The fic is currently part way through fith year and while the author currently seems to have writer's block it's got 93 chapters to read in the mean time.

*** Is the fic still good if I have zero experience with creepypasta and/or apparently the game Slender?

Also it's tagged Horror, on a scale from 1 to 10 how intense is it?

It's sort of a gray area. They don't go into the character backstories much, and most references are explained as this Harry doesn't know about creepypasta either at first. However, there are things that hit better if you know the stories, i.e. Toby mentioning Lyra in one of the first chapters, why no one told Ben the second task took place underwater, Jeff and his relationship with Liu, Puppeteer being called Jonothan as a cover name, ect.

Depends if you're okay with mild-to-moderate gore and such. It doesn't go into the actual killing a lot but there's small scenes of the Creepypastas in the beginning and end of each Hogwarts chapter, which isn't a lot overall, and there are a few scenes with Isaac killing someone. There's also an entire chapter that has a lot of death but is absolutely stuffed full of Chicago Musical references from the Cell Block Tango. So it can get a bit much, but it's not much overall, and the bad scenes are easily skippable.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.
