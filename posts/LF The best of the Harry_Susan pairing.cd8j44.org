Long time reader of Harry Potter fanfiction but this is a pairing I have almost never dabbled in. I've read "Not the Only Redhead" and remember it being okay. I liked Harry and Susan in it anyway. Got any other recs?


** I have quite a few saved up but im not able to link till later. The one problem with this ship is most people use it for harry to have access to the dmle to free sirius. They never really get super romantic and most of the time susan rides that mary sue line hard. Shes the loveable redhead who turns into a sexual deviant sometimes or its her helping harry escape his life at privet drive.

What type of Harrry Susan ship are you looking for?

** linkffn(11637611)

It is a FemHarry FemSlash pairing. However it is one of the few stories i can think of where the pairing seems to actually be about Harry/Susan (Or in this case Cassie instead of Harry) where other stories have it incidental while the story gets run over by the usual "Amelia Bones fixes everything as soon as she's informed and oh by the way here is my curvacious niece, she's in your year right? Here why don't you too get acquainted while i solve all the worlds problems"

#+begin_quote
  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.

**** Does it pick up the pace later on? Because I gotta tell you, after around 100k words, the thought of reading another 600k words with the same pace makes me want to instantly quit the story. After most chapters I am left wondering what actually progressed the story, either in plot or character development, and for most chapters I come up empty handed.

Don't get me wrong, I have read tons of slow paced stories and enjoyed them, but they all had something else keeping them interesting. Be it interesting characters, new concepts or maybe a unique plot. Concept and plot have been done thousands of times before. Some of the characters are interesting, I give you that, but I can feel that not being enough to keep me interested for another 600k words. Thats why I asked if it changes, if not it might be good to stop now, rather than later.

******* The end of third year takes a bit of a darker turn that I truly didn't pick up on as happening til it did. It is angsty, but I mean.... They are literally supposed to be like that but also have magic, so I try not to judge them too harshly. IDK to each their own, I would suggest trying to stick it out and make it to the tournament, it has a lot of side competitions as well as the main event with quite the twist with Harry's future that makes me happy with it vs other Fics i've read when it comes to 4th year. No offense taken if you decide against it.

******** Mhh, maybe I will. But I realized its something else too. I noticed that I developed quite the aversion against re-write stories. Like, year 1-7 but slightly different. I guess I finally read too many over the last 15 years. Currently rather enjoying the "X years later, screw the epilogue" stories and all the sci-fi crossovers. Maybe the aversion will go away and I enjoy these kind of stories again.

** The only ones that I found to be OK or good (mostly because there isn't a lot of people that write this pairing) were, in no particular order, linkffn(You've got a girl at home Potter; Final Protocol; Harry Potter and the Worth of a Soul; The Forgotten Contract by James Spookie)

Keep in mind that they aren't great pieces of fanfic, but of all the Harry/Susan I've read, these are by far the best ones, and I've read a lot of them. There are a couple that have Susan either as Harem Partner (which I wouldn't suggest here) and there's a couple that could've been a Harry/Susan of quality if the author decided to, but prefered another pairing. Sort of the same situation as in TE7's Letters, in which the author chose Fleur as the pairing, but it coud've been Daphne and the audience would've been just as, or more, happy with it.
