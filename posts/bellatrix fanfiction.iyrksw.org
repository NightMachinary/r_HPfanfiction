i've been meaning to write a fanfiction of bellatrix x female!oc, but been pushing it back as i struggled to think how to write her character, and obviously keep her in character. with such little detail and shown of bellatrix in both books and movies, i can't fully grasp on how she'll react to things, or approach them. i hate to write a fanfic about a character unless i am able to think of a scenario and place said character and know how they would react, reply, etc; and unfortunately i cannot bring myself to do the same with bellatrix. overall advice would be thanked and i'll love to see how other people would advise to write her with a love interest and still manage to keep her in character.

if anyone needs an example of a plot to know how to base just reply underneath and i'll give one !!


** I mean, you're right that it'd probably depend on what's best for your particular plot (or character relationship development/dynamic), but most of my favourite Bellatrixes have been one of two things.

The first, basically Fanon Cool!Guy Sirius, but with murder instead of pranks. A bit of swashbuckling swagger, a bit of hotheaded stupidity, and a plan to kill everything she encounters. Loves a good bar fight.

The second, is basically the Delenda Est Bellatrix. Cool, logical, a little mad, and not quite understanding how neurotypical folks work. Will approach every situation with the belief she can turn it to her advantage and at least a little idea of how she could do that.

*** for the plot in mind i was thinking of a quiet but popular perhaps ravenclaw, believes in pureblood hierarchy to an extend, that is if i write teenager bellatrix. and they get assigned to a project together (basic but still useful for the plot) and eventually bellatrix takes a liking to her, very slowburn. then i have another idea of second war era bellatrix, once again thinking about the oc being a ravenclaw but rather opposite than bella in everything, the oc being soft and sympathy - obviously with the latter fanfic idea i have intends of making bellatrix being a profession at hogwarts to have everything to fall into place.

**** Hmm. Yeah, I think the essay the other person posted would be very much helpful here. That balance between 'madness' and affection would probably work quite well for that sort of story, and keeps it away from the 'soften the tsundere' cliche.

Also, on that note, if you respond to the bot, the person who posted the thing won't get notified of the message. You have to respond to the original comment for them to get an inbox notification.

*** That essay is an excellent piece of work, and repays the reading if you want to write a good Bellatrix. For me, it crystallised my long-standing disquiet with the standard-issue fanon Bellatrix.
