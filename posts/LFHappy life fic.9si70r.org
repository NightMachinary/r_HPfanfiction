Where Voldemort dosnt exist and Harry just goes to Hogwarts and pulls some pranks and dates some girls


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Voldemort met his match soon after Halloween, and Harry grew up with his parents and many friends. One of the better robst fics.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861?view_adult=true][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there): No Voldemort, no magic, and yet a wonderful slow burn Harry/Ginny romance. BTW, Harry is an interesting celebrity here.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5604382/1/The-Accidental-Bond][The Accidental Bond]], linkffn(5604382): Voldemort still exists, but he is mostly in the background and not a major threat. Harry and his girls are having lots of fun together.
