Looking for A Harry/Daphne/OFC (Sirius Black's Daughter) Story, which may have a similar premise to Sacrificial Second Chance. I seem to remember Harry does something accidentally to trigger a Bethrothal Contract and/or Soulbond with both girls, and at least initially both girls are not happy with him. To be fair my recollection is a little hazy, so all details may not be totally correct. Any help with this would be appreciated thx.
