Other than To Shape and Change ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6413108/1/To-Shape-and-Change]]), I've never read a good Hufflepuff Harry fic.

Anyone know of some good ones?


** Very funny guys, but did it occur to you that there are more Hufflepuff Harry fics than the one you keep recommending? OP, perhaps you'd like some variety from linkffn(7330591).

** [[http://corvidae9.livejournal.com/344634.html]]

First in a series. This is short, but an awful lot of fun.

PS.... it would be nice to see a /serious/ fic with H. in Hufflepuff. But that doesn't seem to be a thing.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** Well, “Harry the Hufflepuff” has already been recommended a few times, so instead I'll go with “The Worst Muggles Imaginable” (linkffn(7370842)). It's incomplete and abandoned, but what is of it is quite enjoyable.
