Such that on an ordinary day, Harry might wake up to find that he's sprouted a magnificent pair of whiskers, his morning shower produces masses of pink bubbles, and his shoes transform into dainty glass slippers once he puts them on.\\
Heading out of the portrait hole to find the grand stairway has been done up as an aquarium with flying fish and drifting seaweed everywhere, he makes his way down to the Great Hall for breakfast to find an absolutely massive giant roast chicken (twice his height) amongst the breakfast foods on the table.\\
And that's a slow day.
