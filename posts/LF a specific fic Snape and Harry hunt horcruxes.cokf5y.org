:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've posted looking for this before but had no luck and I still can't find it. This is all I can remember:

• It's Harry/Severus slash

• Harry and Severus are using a timeturner to hunt the horcruxes

• Harry is reading the parseltongue on the walls of the rooms the Horcruxes were made in

• They go shopping for new clothes in the muggle world

• I'm sure Snape takes Harry to the opera

• They use the timeturner to have a mini holiday/vacation

• They visit Wools orphanage looking for a horcrux and the lady thinks they are there to adopt a child

Please help this fic is driving me mad!


** I know I've read this one too, but can't remember the name either. Maybe ask at [[/r/HPSlashFic/][r/HPSlashFic/]] as well

**** I remember that orphanage scene clearly, but don't remember if it was good either. It was definitely a pre-DH fic, if that helps.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter is tired of everyone trying to control his life. When it looks like plans are being made to continue this trend once Harry defeats Voldemort, Harry decides he has had enough. As all of his previous attempts at taking back control of his life were unsuccessful, he realizes he needs to try a different approach. With a little Slytherin help, Harry might just get his own way.
