[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEp19

AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.

The story begins with Hermione's POV but as it continues there are also times when it's written in Harry's POV.

This is not my story, I just figured I'd share it since I thought it was rather good.


** I honestly never could get into this fic. It might work for those who like wonder-Hermione, but for me Hermione seems like an adult pretending to be a kid.

That said, it's well written at least. If you're into Hermione-centric fics, you'll probably like it.

Do you think that's consistently written across all of the books? I'm not trying to 'defend' Hermione's character or start an argument. I want to know more about why you think this way.

***** That quoted item was pure sarcasm, if it wasn't clear.

Hermione's character is basically consistent through the series, though the focus changes. She's an archetypal swot with the Gryffindor loyalty and courage tropes added in, while also being the knowledge dump and semi self-insert character for the author various purposes.

In the books, every single action she takes comes from one of those places, or with struggling to live up to those ideals. Pretending to be more adult than she is, and /definitely/ being more mature than her jock friends, is how she is written. And make no mistake, Harry and Ron are jocks in canon, right down to hazing Colin, fights in the halls, and their year revolving around sports.

In this story, it still seems like those characterizations carry over, and it isn't just Hermione In Name Only. In fact, I had more trouble with some of the other characters and how they had been changed. But I also wasn't terribly into it, so maybe I read shallower than others did.

********* Susan Bones, just as an example, talks to Harry in canon, which is more than most third-string student characters. She seemed to believe Harry was Slytherin's Heir, but was sitting with Hermione and apparently was on friendly terms with her at the start of the year. She hung out with her fellow Hufflepuffs and seemed to get along with that crowd. The Slytherins harassed her and she joined the DA for ideological reasons, like many others. This seems to have nothing to do with her in this fanfic.

In any case, what most characters are and do doesn't seem like what we saw in the books. And that's because the world is so different. They grew up into different people, so why should I care about them here?

I know I said it felt like original fiction, but there is one place it doesn't work like that: a lot of the feel of story is still hung on the reader knowing and being interested in the named characters. With how AU it is, that doesn't really work for me. But that's just my opinion.

**** Yeah, compared to Hermione in canon she still acts like an adult trapped in a kids body. Hermione in canon starts off as a teachers pet, tones it down eventually, but still makes plenty of mistakes. She starts off practically worshiping authority for instance.

***** She's also a lot more traumatized in this story than in canon. That changes some things. It isn't unreasonable to have her /acting/ years more mature in that situation.

What you mention from the books still sounds like someone /pretending/ to be more mature and adult than they really are. Which is why I said what I did, based on a similar reading of the books.

Seems like you want this "false" maturity to be punished more or something. Like her being successful should be served in equal measure with childish failure.

Hermione in the books seldom failed when something serious was on the line, which again seems consistent in this story. If anything, she fails more and more often. It is just that most things in this story are really serious issues, so complete failure or a house-elf level misunderstanding would most often be fatal.

Compared to Hermione in canon --- who was plenty precocious and mature in the first place --- Hermione in RotS was abducted from her home, told that her parents won't remember her, placed in an orphanage headed by one of the most universally despised characters in canon books, and /tortured/ after her escape attempt; and she feels that she is responsible not just for herself but also for Justin and Dean. So, yes, she's had to grow up even more quickly. And, she still makes plenty of mistakes. (List available upon request.)

#+begin_quote
  She starts off practically worshiping authority for instance.
#+end_quote

Sigh... Why does this keep coming up?

When, exactly, did she "worship authority"? Was it when she didn't want to wander around an unfamiliar magical castle at night over a matter of preadolescent honor (because, after all, there might be a hungry cerebrus out there)? Or, feared expulsion from the amazing world of magic of which she has only just gotten a taste as much as she feared death (to the extent that she understood death)? Or, didn't want Harry to risk expulsion in a dangerous competition on flying broomsticks (that he has only just learned how to ride) to return an item that Draco had stolen in front of a score witnesses? Or, was it when she casually lied to McGonagall to cover for Harry and Ron after the Troll Incident? When she set a teacher on fire (because it /was/, in fact, a matter of life and death, and not preadolescent honor)? When she questioned Dumbledore's motivations, while Harry trusted him implicitly? When she brewed a semilegal potion from stolen ingredients in order to abduct and impersonate her classmates to spy on another?

Hermione only looks like a proverbial authority-worshiper in comparison to Harry and Ron, because they act like proverbial rules don't apply to them, not out of intellectual independence or critical thinking skills of any sort, but out of impulsiveness. (To be fair, their impulsiveness has saved Hermione's life.) Hermione, on the other hand, recognizes that most rules and regulations are a good idea most of the time, but she doesn't hesitate to make exceptions if the situation warrants it.

So, can we please bury the "Hermione worships authority" fanon? Please?

Speaking of that, do you mean the one where she went against /every/ authority in the Wizarding World and faced universal ridicule, all without support of her friends, in order to follow the dictates of her conscience?

As for Hermione betraying Harry, all she did was verbally promise Draco (who was blackmailing her) to work with him against Harry. What will she /actually/ do? Only the author knows.

To my recollection all Draco did was threaten revenge upon her for beating him. He then suggested that would be forgiven if she were to join his side against Harry. Verrrrrrrrry thin pretext for her to change her mind.

The narrative voice used throughout that scene describes Hermione's loathing of Draco, but does not give any indication that she will not follow through with Draco's plan. Indeed, she doesn't even attempt to warn Harry. So if the author goes back on his plan for her to side with Draco, then all he's succeeded in doing is making her indecisive.

Yes, by revealing to everyone that she and Justin and Dean are Mudbloods, for starters. That's blackmail.

Hermione? Having to decide on the spot between simple loyalty of Harry and playing Draco's games, not just for herself, but for two other people for whom she feels responsible? That, after having had a vision quest which showed her --- among other things --- Harry can, in fact, betray her in a possible future, and that she may be able to achieve her political goals by first siding with Draco then murdering him? How could that /possibly/ make her indecisive?

Anyway, I read that as an offer she can't refuse, even if it has the potential to drive a wedge between herself and Harry.

Canon Hermione suffered torture at the hands of Bellatrix and the potential end of her relationship with Ron rather than betray Harry at Malfoy Manor or in the Forest of Dean. This deviation - even if you don't believe it to be as important as I do - makes this character Hermione In Name Only as another comment in this thread stops short of saying. My own opinion is that the characterizations are /so/ different as to suggest that her role might be better filled by an OC.

The two situations aren't even remotely comparable. You compare a Hermione at the start of RotS to Hermione in canon DH, after more than six years of friendship with Harry, fighting side by side, and saving each other's lives several times; their mission would determine whether or not the world would be ruled by an immortal tyrant bent on genocide of people just like her; not to mention six years of being inculcated with Gryffindor values.

In RotS, Hermione met Harry a few months ago, she doesn't even particularly like him, getting along with him out of pragmatism. She feels far more loyalty towards Justin and Dean, so of course she would sell Harry out for her own and for their sakes. Rather than having had six years of Gryffindor adventures under the kindly Dumbledore, she feels wronged by the wizarding world and has resolved to [[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_%28film%29#Scarlett_O.27Hara][lie, steal, cheat, or kill (in the immortal words of Scarlet O'Hara)]] to get what she wants out of it, though her vision quest is making her question some of that. So, her decision makes perfect sense to me. It's just focusing on the side of the character that a lot of the fandom forgets.
