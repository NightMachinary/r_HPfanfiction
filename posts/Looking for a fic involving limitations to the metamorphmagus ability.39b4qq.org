I've searched all over the place, but cant seem to find it. There was a scene where Tonks explained that she couldnt impersonate someone perfectly with her abilities, using an analogy of a marble rolling down a hill(?) There was also a terrorist who blew up either the Ministry or St. Mungo's and looked like an uncanny valley version of Arthur Weasley. Does anyone remember this fic?


** Honey.

The "Arthur Weasley person" is the 'Marionette Man'

*** Thank you so so so much! For some reason I thought he was called "the puppet man" or "the thin man" and I could not find /anything/ on Google.

** Yes, dont recall the name. It was recommended here sometime in the last 3 months i think. Harry joins Voldemort after the resurrection and muggleborn are killed to extend the life of the powerful.
