I've read stories where the Sorting Hat decides to twist the rules he's been given as an excuse to put characters in different houses. And a common theme I've seen is that he's doing this out of the goodness of his heart (or whatever the equivalent is) or is bemoaning that the Founders's original wishes have been corrupted/lost to time.

This wouldn't be one of those stories.

He's tired, and feels like causing a bit of chaos for kicks. He barely reads his students' minds; just enough to know the House that would be the best fit, and then gives them one of the other three at random. No true rhyme-or-reason, no care for the student's personal wishes, just his own personal whims

One year, after Snape makes a snide remark that the Hat's finally lost it, Slytherin gets no new students. Another, when Sprout decides to spruce him up to see if that'll change anything, Hufflepuff gets /every/ new student.

Everyone and their mother starts wondering what could it mean about the future of their society, how they didn't know their children nearly as well as they thought.

And the Hat's just having a grand old laugh.

  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

** If you wanted to make it less cracky and more serious, or semi serious, that'd be interesting to see the parents and people in general maybe stop bad mouthing Slytherins, and stop assuming all Slytherins are evil.

Or if you want to continue the cracky theme. Maybe have someone like Hannah Abbott sorted into Slytherin, she starts crying about not wanting to be evil, and Daphne is like, don't knock it till you try it.
