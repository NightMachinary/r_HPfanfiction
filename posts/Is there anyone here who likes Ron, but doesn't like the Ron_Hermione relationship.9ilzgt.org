The types of people who fit into both of these categories seem to be rather scarce, which is why I'd be interested to know how many there really are. If you're reading this and you do fit the description, stating why you feel this way would be appreciated.


** I actually love Ron! I think he's an incredibly complex character but he's a generally good guy with a few flaws just like everyone else. I just don't love the Romione relationship because I think that respecting each other intellectually is a very important factor in a relationship and I just don't see that in their relationship. Ron obviously thinks Hermione's very smart and appreciates that, but he doesn't appreciate what she does in order to be that smart, and Hermione definitely thinks that he's a bit of a slacker even though he's clearly on her level in certain areas (strategy, for example). I don't hate Romione, my dislike of it is really just based on if I was in that situation, I would prefer to be just friends. I know the cliche is that their clashing is a means of flirting for them, but I don't personally see the appeal in fighting like cats and dogs - or rats, if you prefer.

**** I'd agree with it, in the first book its established that he is very talented at Wizards chess which is a game purely based on strategy.

***** Maybe it has been to long since I read the books, but I feel that chess was barely ever mentioned again after PS, and even in the big chess game Ron made an obvious and terrible mistake right at the start - he didn't swap out the King for one of the trio.

I feel it's one of those fanon ideas that has become so clichéd as to be misremembered as canon. Whenever people are asked to come up with examples it seems that "He won a couple of chess games against kids who'd never played before" is pretty much the only example.

Don't get me wrong, I think Ron is great and often the voice of reason in the trio, but I just don't personally buy into the whole "strategic genius" claim.

The goals of the trio are balanced by weighing the effects of the differing paths of winning and losing in chess /within the context of the meta game/. Ron's decision decreased the odds of a winning chess game, an increase in the cost of particular sacrifices places limits on the winning paths. However, his decision also minimized the potential effects of a loss; he could essentially ensure the safety of the trio by giving up his king.

As such, I don't agree that this decision was a terrible mistake; I'm not even sure that it was a mistake, although Harry might disagree.

** Love Ron, probably even more than Harry and Hermione tbh, am okay with R/Hr as a passing relationship, but I don't buy long-term R/Hr for a second. They're honestly terrible for each other. I get that they're attracted to each other, but there's nothing in their relationship that speaks "this has got marriage and two kids in it." They have no patience for each other, don't respect each other's ideas, and are honestly a bit abusive to each other (and unlike most people who act like Ron is the only problem in the relationship, I think Hermione is just as shitty to him as he is to her, if not even more so). I also don't buy that bollocks about Ron and Hermione having a better relationship when Harry's not around that some people bandy about: I'll get it if two people in a relationship are more reserved around their best friend, but do they just start sniping and arguing with each other at his mere presence? Do they fuck. R/Hr is 100% a relationship built on attraction alone, and if it were real life they'd have had a five-week relationship where they had a lot of sex to mask the fact that they're really discontent with each other outside of their physical relationship, and then it would culminate in a huge blowup where Harry and Ginny would have to spend the next few months mediating between them until they made up.

But not that part. I think their relationship would simply fizzle out once the novelty wears off and they'd have an awkward conversation where they talk circles about the fact that neither of them is feeling "it" anymore. Pretty much like the state Ron and Lavender end up before he is poisoned.

***** Ditto. Hermione is the sort of person who changes a lot growing up. I can see how she would keep reevaluating her life choices as she learns more and gains more experiences. Her mental development would leave the other two far behind. Of course, Ron and Harry would also change but not to the extent of Hermione. What they are at 17-18 and at 28-30 is mostly a normal growing up experience that most of us go through. They didn't even want to go back to Hogwarts to complete their education. I am sure they will be more at home in their comfort zone and rarely would reach out of the bubble. Harry, more so, because of his fame, and Ron because of his discomfort with learning anything new.

Hermione on the other hand is going to meet lots of people and learn and grow far beyond her peers. She would definitely not end up with one of her school mates. I see her being attracted to someone older and more experienced. She wouldn't settle down in a married life before her career actually takes off.

Based off canon, I agree, Harry and Hermione absolutely shouldn't have happened. Like you said, he already has Ginny and there's some evidence that Harry and Hermione don't really enjoy each other's company that much, which if true was an asinine way for JKR to write two characters who are supposedly very close friends just because she was afraid of some people on the internet mistaking friendship for lurve. But, I think if a few changes were made here and there to canon, H/Hr could have been a plausible pairing and IMO would have probably been a much more satisfying romance arc than H/G, simply because Hermione is a better developed and more interesting character than Ginny, who to be quite frank, isn't that far removed from a Mary Sue.

Do you also snipe at each other and argue over the most inconsequential things? Do you have no patience for the things she's passionate about and mock her for it? Does she think you're a slob and does she never pass up the chance to belittle you for it? Has she ever physically attacked you? If not, then your relationship isn't very much at all like Ron and Hermione's. Ron and Hermione are different, sure, but not complimentary with each other and are way too willing to tear each other down for me to ever think their relationship would evolve into a successful marriage with two kids. Sure you could argue that they matured to have a relationship like yours, but that's not a great argument cos you could then argue that an older, less mopey Harry is perfect for Hermione, or an older, more confident Neville should have married her, or an older, less loopy Luna would be perfect for Ron.

Even though they have different temperaments (which, frankly Ron and Hermione do not) they both have a cleverness and curiousity about magic that I think would make them both spark. Of course this precludes Fred's death and it's probably transferable to George, but I could see JKR's “opposites attract” in one of the twins much more so than Ron.

Ginny is hardly mentioned in the books, we know almost nothing about her. "Hot and fun" is short-term, love is long term. The nearest we have in the books about Harry's interest in Ginny is the "jealous chest-monster" Harry had at some point. Not a good foundation for a relationship.

Ron is a good but flawed character, like most everyone else, but he's not a good match for Herrmione. Pair her up with a nice Ravenclaw.

I personally attribute the "chest monster" bit as an unfortunate artifact of JKR writing a male character when she is, in fact not a man. It was an awkward metaphor for a combination of Harry's libido, pride, and jealousy that didn't really work.

***** Actually Ginny is mentioned a good amount, especially in books 5 and 6. It's just usually her scenes are part of an ensemble of people so they might not stand out as much.

Ginny and Harry actually are shown to be incredibly compatible, and way more than just "Hot and Fun." Ginny frequently is able to provide Harry exactly what he needs in the moment, whether its a understanding ear, a dose of reality, or just something normal. Harry isn't necessarily someone who seeks out touch. Even his kiss with Cho was basically her invading his space. But he seeks out Ginny's touch. The thing about Harry's attraction to Ginny is he doesn't really start to feel it until he spends actual time with her during the summer. He finds they share a lot in common, including a sense of humor. Humor is really important to Harry. The foundation for their relationship is not his chest monster. That was just a manifestation of a feeling he had at the time. The foundation of their relationship was shared attraction, shared sense of humor, shared interests and shared understanding of the evils of Voldemort.

Draco and Hermione, meanwhile, over the course of several chapters, slowly come closer and fall in love. So, the reader can root for the couple without any feelings of guilt!

This is very evident in GoF and OoTP where JKR almost goes to pains to show that Hermione really does take what Harry says seriously, to the point of even memorizing things he says at times. And from Harry's side, even when he's in a blind fury that Sirius is being tortured by Voldemort, he still listens to Hermione after arguing with her. The scene was rather telling, as the other bystanders (Ron, Ginny, Neville, Luna) are described as just watching them, not really able to contribute.

What I was talking about is the very real fact that Hermione and Ron have some major incompatibilities, not the least of which is the way in which they show affection to others. For example, in conflict. Whereas Hermione listens intently and gives her loved one(s) relevant, personal feedback, Ron is more likely to jump into physical action, which can often be detrimental.

** I ship Romione, for different reason, but the #1 reason is because Ron Weasley is my baby boy and I just want him to be happy. For some reason, in which I will never understand, Hermione is the person that makes him happy.

Ron deserves better, Hermione is nowhere near good enough for him, but he loves her so I love her, and have to belive, over time, she changed her ways and became a better person.

Why do I feel this way? The first thing that comes to mind is Hermione's jealousy and anger issues. It's a HUGE problem. When Ron sees Hermione at the ball with Krum he's grumpy and it turns in to a argument, but then next day's they're fine, overly polite, but fine, he gets over it for the time being. Fast froward to 6th year Ron discovers that Hermione had been lying to him all this times about her and Krum being "just friends" and "Pen pals"., how does Ron react? He becomes a moody git, he's cold and snippy to Hermione, but he doesn't freeze her out.

Ron kisses Lavender and Hermione attacks him, physically attacks him with birds to the point that he still has scratches weeks later. It's not the first time she gets physical out of anger and it wouldn't be the last time she physically assaults Ron because she's mad at him. Are we supposed to ignore her abusive tendency because she a girl? Imagine how the fandom would have reacted if Ron sent a flock of canaries to attack Hermione after finding out she kissed Krum. Hell fire would have rained down on Ron, but Hermione gets away with it. And she completely freezes Ron out after that, only talking to him again after he nearly dies.

What did Ron do wrong? He got a girlfriend? He dared to date someone who wasn't her after she completely dragged him saying he can only play well on lucky potion. After going on and on about how "fanciable" Harry was while at the same time shooting him dirty looks for trying to show how, he too, measures ups to what is seemingly Hermione listing what she finds fanciable in a guy.

One off handed invite to a party while in the middle of an argument where she mentions hooking up with another guy does NOT make Ron her boyfriend. He was perfectly free to date whomever he wanted, but Hermione somehow feels like she's was entitled to Ron's affection. How dare he date Lavender and not her! What kind of BS friendzone mentality is that? "Hermione was young" yeah, well so was Ron and he never reacted to her and Krum in the way she did he and Lavender.

When Hermione "dated" Krum, Ron never got angry at */HER/* all his anger and jealousy was aimed at Krum. Hermione is not the problem, it's him, Ron, who's fells like he's lacking something that prevents Hermione from being interested in him. He never stopped speaking to her and he never physically attacked her. Ron dates Lavender and */RON/* is the problem, there's something wrong with Ron not her. Not only does she physically attack him and stop speaking to him all together, she sit there and rubs Cormac and Krum in his face talking about how she "Only dates good quidditch players" B*TCH!

Everyone wants to get on Ron for dating Lavender to get back at Hermione but competently ignore that she messed around with Cormac to annoy Ron. I thought Hermione was supposed to be the mature one? She's not.

She plays on Ron's insecurities while lecturing Harry about how he should be more understanding of them. Time after time Ron proves his skill, intelligence and maturity and both Hermione and the fandom discount it. Why? I honestly don't understand. Hermione floats a feather first lesson and it's proof that she's highly skilled. Ron breaks Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration and creates a boggart and... nothing.

The thing is, of course Ron in CC doesn't show any of his old flaws, because he isn't a person. I mean, he literally has a line where he says that he was so drunk at his wedding that he can't remember it. He's just there for cheap laughs and a complete man-child.

I don't like Ron, but at least he had characterization. The CC writers should have stopped messing with the canon characters if they aren't going to be part of the play anyways, but at least now I have a good idea how I can bash Ron without upsetting fans too much (patronize the fuck out of him).

** I like Ron quite a bit. I actually found myself siding with Ron when he and Harry had their spat in Goblet of Fire. Over time, however, I liked championing the Harry/Hermione pairing. Part of the reason was that I saw the first three Potter films before I read them, but afterward started reading the books before seeing the rest of the films. Because of that fact, my young mind had been molded into thinking Harry and Hermione belonged together (as Dan and Emma had great on- and off-screen chemistry) and the fact that some of Ron's lines were given to Hermione instead (especially in Prisoner of Azkaban).

​

Over time, however, I actually came to terms of not particularly minding Ron and Hermione together (even though I hated them initially) and still, to this day, don't find their marriage infuriating. But, I still prefer Hermione with someone else, namely Harry or Charlie Weasley (because of my interest in FanFiction, which started in 2015). I actually like to think that Ron and Luna would've been a good fit.

​

So to answer your question directly, I prefer Harry and Hermione because I saw the first three films before reading the first three books, and like Charlie and Hermione because of FanFiction.

Even though I'll occasionally read some Dramione, I can't see canon Draco and Hermione at all.

I can see Draco doing a huge turn-around after the war. A clever writer could attribute his caustic attitude to the tensions in his family life and the looming threat of Voldemort. Of course that still leaves you with a bigot and a racist, but the end of the war and the actions of the heroes could instill some kind of epiphany/awakening process, distancing himself from his Family (except maybe his mum), trying to make up for his mistakes, etc. IMHO it would be really hard (and extremely stupid) for him to still see Harry, Hermione, Ron or even Neville as inferior after all that transpired.

Whether Hermione would ever go for him, years down the line, after all that happened between them is the bigger problem.

Ron and Hermione might have an okay relationship for a few weeks while they're both teenagers. But in terms of staying together forever, it makes much more sense for Hermione to marry Harry. Once the two of them have mellowed out and aren't constantly stressed out, their potential problems with each other would be pretty limited. Their loyalty to each other is beyond incredible, they can actually have fun if Harry isn't extremely moody (for example, the section in HBP where they laugh together over the idea of Filch and Pince having an affair), they both have the confidence that wouldn't inevitably lead to any jealousy or insecurity (which R/Hr would definitely result in). It wouldn't be perfect, but they go together very nicely once they've grown up.

Sure, some of this is related to circumstance by birth. I have only one (younger) brother. But on the other hand I have a large extended family and most of it is like Percy (or worse). I would have loved to have an older brother who could be a role-model and being pissy because of their success is an alien concept to me.

Moving on from that, another thing that I value highly is "think before you talk". Ron never learns this and is basically a textbook example of how not to do it. No one is perfect and I had to learn this too, but I never the less learned it at some point. Maybe I could relate to Ron if he wouldn't refuse to grow up.

I also can't relate to Ron's loudness and his attention seeking. Not to mention his tendencies to blame external influences for all of his problems. All of these are things that I see as a negative role model and try to actively avoid.

I'm also not a sports jock and can't relate to being this crazy about a sports team (not that that's bad, just can't relate to it at all). His disdain for intellectual - or what he considers to be 'odd' - pursuits reminds me of the worst I've seen from some of my peers when I was young (not just directed at my peers, but everyone who didn't follow the main-stream) and is also not something that I'd wish to emulate.

Firstly: I find this low standard for teenagers insulting. As I said, I can't relate to Ron and certainly didn't act like him in regards to my friends when I was a teenager.

Secondly: Excuse me? Are you saying Ron values the friendship more than Harry? Clearly and objectively it is the other way around. Ron is a charismatic, likeable guy and not the center of attention of school and society. He could have any friend he wants to. Harry is clearly desperate for friends, which is why he immediately takes Ron back, no questions asked.

In any case, particularly in this regard I relate to Harry, not Ron. I grew up with few friends and those few are and have always been incredibly valuable to me. In no scenario can I imagine being jealous instead of proud of their accomplishments and I certainly would never have denounced a friend publicly just because we had a fight (and I've had plenty of viscous fights with friends).

Harry, as the Boy-Who-Lived, can have any friend he wants.

** I mean. It has potential to be something. Ron's the type of guy to not let people roll over him. Hermione is the type of woman to absolutely steamroll over everyone (except Harry, though she tries and Harry just tends to ignore when she gets like that). So you have those two types of personalities clashing. Ron, because he cannot stand another version of essientially his mother nagging him to death (except shes attractive) and wont stand for it and for Hermione her attaction to a guy who wont just let her steamroll all over him. Thus the arguing and belligerent sexual tension ( Tho it really is just arguing for the sake of arguing IMO, which is why Im not fully into the ship.)

If you notice, Hermione is attracted to really hot guys (Lockhart and Krum) and people who she cant steamroll (Harry, Ron, and the aforemtioned older men who'd she'd look up to by virtue of them being older, if you'll allow me to pyschoanalyze).

Ron is pretty straightforward, like most dudes are. He didnt realize Hermione was someone he was attracted to until she cleaned up for the Yule Ball and saw her with essientially an older idealized version of himself (he did want to be a quidditch player at thia point in time). And for a less admirable point that most men and women do, thought she'd just be there waiting for him whenever he got around to her (as she was still firmly in the friend category still).

** Even JKR admitted maybe they shouldn't have ended up together, didn't she? I feel this. Love Ron. I even accept them as a cute pre-teen early teen pair. But I feel like they would have to grow apart or end up hating and resenting each other at worst or being complacent and unhappy at best.

** I love Ron as a character but I don't like Romione. I think he's hilarious, courageous, generally a good guy. But he's just not on Hermione's level intellectually. He discounts a lot of her ideas, scoffs at her work ethic... I just don't see how Hermione could be happy with that long term.

I am a fan of Dramione - I know a lot of people aren't, and in canon it would probably not work as well as in fanfiction. I just really think there would have been potential for a nice love story there if Rowling had shown him questioning his choices more and more by, say, HBP (and if the series was written from Hermione's perspective). Git or not, he is smart in an intellectual way, and he could keep up with Hermione while calming her down a bit I think. I'm not a fan of Harry/Hermione - if not Draco, I'd rather see her with someone else, like one of the other Weasley brothers.

**** Canon Draco, I agree. But we're talking alternate scenarios here! Going with your analogy - what about radical Nazi parents, raising their son in their ideology and sending him to Hitler youth, but then he starts questioning that belief because he falls for a Jewish girl? It's heavily romanticized Romeo & Juliet material, sure, but it's not unheard of. That's the appeal.

***** Not to rain on your analogy, but the whole point of the Nazi thinking were Jews were less than human. Same for Death Eaters and muggleborns. So unless Draco doesn't know Hermione is muggleborn in this AU scenario, I don't think this would work.

****** Why would he have to be unaware that she's muggleborn? The whole point of the scenario is that be starts questioning what his parents taught him BECAUSE of her heritage. If he didn't know, he'd have no incentive to start rejecting the ideology he was raised in. In this AU scenario, he grows up only ever hearing one thing, but at school he meets Hermione, gets to know her, recognizes her brilliance and realizes that his parents taught him bs.

**** But don't you think specifically mentioning Hitler Youth instead of a plain Nazi makes the Dramione ship more believable? It would be easier for an indoctrinated Hitler Youth kid, or for example, a child brought up by scientologists, to change their mind on the bigoted crap they believe in, because they haven't been exposed to ANY alternate schools of thought and a kid/teen is far easier to influence.

As opposed to an adult Nazi , who is in for the full ride - and in most cases,is someone who knowingly defends and promotes harmful ideologies - the definition of pure evil.

*** I'm not a huge fan of Draco, but I could see that ship working if it begins after the war. There's no realistic way for him to have enough change of heart for it to work without him being completely out of character before that, but I could easily see the Malfoys branching out in order to regain status.

**** Sure I see the problems. Draco as his canon self and Hermione aren't a good pairing at all. The story would have had to develop drastically different for them to develop a romance. In fanfiction it works exceptionally well though and I can totally see the chemistry.

** I like their characters but I do not think of them as a suitable couple as I see them arguing a lot as much as they care about each other. I always liked the idea of Hermione ending up with either Viktor Krum or Harry. With leaning more to Krum as I fancy Harry with Luna Lovegood more then Hermione, personally.

New story from ashh.kv,

Yes, I'm Muggleborn!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13119842/1/]]

Harry Potter

Words: 2,136 Genre: Adventure/Romance Rated: M

This story follows our unsung heroes, the Muggleborn Wizards from Gryffindor. I also added a new twist to Ron's character, which is more mature and playing to his strengths. Harry and Hermion will play a key role, but the spotlight will be stolen by Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas & Colin Creevy. Smart Ron, Half-blood Dean, Savage Colin. Rated M for Language and Graphic Violence!
