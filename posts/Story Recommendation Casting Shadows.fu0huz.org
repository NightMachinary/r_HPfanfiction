Recently I found this post war story. Though It starts slowly, it's getting better by each chapter. I really liked last few chapters. Pairing with Daphne. No bashing. (iirc actually Ginny broke up with Harry). Bill has a prominent role.

** +Just double checking, is reading the prequel necessary to understanding Casting Shadows?+

Edit: Never mind, I just got to the part where the author says it isn't. As in literally the next sentence after mentioning the prequel, lol.
