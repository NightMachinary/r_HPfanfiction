The HP FFs that I tend to like the most are the ones written in the story-telling, simplistic (?), and slightly whimsical nature that JK wrote her 7 books. Granted, I haven't read that many FFs yet (I am a sloooow reader), but I did love the first couple of James Potter books and all the Alexandra Quick books and find that what I enjoyed the most was how closely the writing style emulated JK's (in my opinion at least).

Are there more full-length FFs that are similar to this? If so, please recommend! Thank you!

Edit: doesn't have to be HP characters! Can be OC or AU! Gracias for all the recs so far. I am excited to dive in :-)))

*Extra Edit*: Thank you for all the recs! I can't wait to dive innnnnn! :)


** I'm sure you've already read linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided) by the same author as Alexandra Quick, but that's the single best example of JKR-style writing that I always cite when people ask this question.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

****** D: My curse-thought to be joking when I'm serious and serious when I'm joking. I have a junk sense of humor! In this case, I'm serious. It's been awhile since I read it, so I don't have many specifics (is that the joke? I didn't "accurately describe" it?).

The premise of the story was interesting and I was initially curious to see where it went. However, it became more ridiculous as it went on with cartoonish talking dragons, previously hidden family, mansions, Weasley-esque twins, unexpected parentage, becoming an Animagus too easily, etc. To be honest, I would have loved it when I was twelve! I'd say it's worth trying, but not forcing yourself to complete it.

******* I find it stylistically and tone-wise to be in keeping with the first half of the HP books which were unashamedly childrens books. It's far more expansive and silly about magic and the sport dragons fill out the same role as the Midnight Barking in 101 Dalmations. Since the fic is Petunia-centric and about her torrid affair with magic and taking things in stride, it takes quite a few of the fanfic cliches and focuses them on her instead, eg, the aforementioned weird inheritance and a reverse-harem. There are a couple of other plotlines central to the story as well like their ancestral family's feud with TMR which will predictably culminate with Harry but Petunia is trying her best as a reponsible adult to circumvent the prophecy. The chapters tend to be short so I feel that counters the 100+ chapter count.

** Ooh. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) is incredible. It is quite whimsical at times, but it is not pure comedy, and does, in fact, have poignant moments.

linkffn(Forging the Sword) is also a really good one, and keeps with the Hogwarts arc while being incredibly engaging. A bit dark, though - something more along the lines of what you would expect from the last two-three books Rowling wrote.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbone) *would be my top pick in this category.* Rowling's voice and style is emulated well, but there is much more focus on Harry's personal development. It can be whimsical, it can be sad, it can be surprisingly poignant at time, and it's a great read.

I love both of these. Obviously neither of them are perfect, but I think they do a great job of exploring the universe that jkr created without going into a whole new genre. The other thing that stands out to me about these fics is that we're pretty much following one narrator, which is a major feature of the cannon. Fics like linkffn (innocent) are great and have good tone, but the inclusion of so many more narrators gives a very different feel to the story.
