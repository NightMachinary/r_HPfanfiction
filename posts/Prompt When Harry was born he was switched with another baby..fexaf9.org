Now, Warlock, really the son of Lily and James, true boy of Trelawneys prophecy, living as the son of an American diplomat, gets his Hogwarts letter.

Meanwhile Harry, really the son of Satan, boy of the biblical prophecy, living with the Dursleys after surviving Voldemort's attack, gets a dog for his 11th birthday.

Dumbledore and Crowley and Aziraphale realize at the same time that they have the wrong boy.

Good Omens Crossover!

******* Yup, I admiti that I was disappointed when I read it for the first time, but to be fair at that point there really isn't much the author could write about. I mean at that point Harry could end petty much any problem by himself in an instant and trying to block his use of his powers would seem kind of forced.

******** Simple- christ comes to Earth, talking about how it is his territory. Many ways to expand upon it, again like how would a romance work with being the antichrist, and so on.

********* Maybe, but I honestly can't see a way of going that path without seeing forced.

The Jesus path, forcing a rival upon him to create conflict while there is really no reason for them to fight unless Jesus wants the apocalypse or something like it, and that would need a convincing explanation.

And romance would really only serve to put unneeded drama and angst.

********** True, romance would cause unneeded strife. You could easily paint Jesus as automatically believing he will cause the apocalypse whether intentionally or not, so takes action to prevent it.

** I don't know about the swapping, but there have been a couple of good-omens crossovers. Mostly with Harry being taken from the Dursleys by Crowley and the two raising him together. Harry is also actually the Antichrist in a published graphic novel in the League of Extraordinary Gentleman fandom. The last link is to a wikipage that apparently names the book somewhere.

The first link is a series I remember reading (I can't currently find where I've sorted the other links to, but I'll update if/when I find them). The second is just the Good Omens fandom page on ao3 with 'Harry Potter' fandom selected as a filter.
