** "Why are you so attached to that stupid rat of yours!" Hermione screamed. "It's not my fault you expected Crookshanks to be put in a cage but not Scabbers!"

Ron glared at her, turning red in his anger. "Because I love him! How do you expect me to trap my darling in a cage? Would you imprison /your/ soulmate?"

"W-what did you just say?"

"I said I love him, you daft bint! I loved his soft grey fur, the way he squeaked when I pressed my lips against his, how he stood up for me against Crabbe..." Ron's eyes glistened. "But you killed him! You killed my one and only, the only being in this universe that has /ever/ made me feel like I'm worth something!"

Ron burst into tears before running away, leaving Hermione confused and terrified.

** Is it just me or is there no Harry/Bellatrix or Harry/Fleur? I mean, not that I like the pairings, but I got the impression that they're fairly common.

*** I'm pretty sure they're much more common on fanfiction.net than ao3, so it wouldn't have shown in this image. Also, there /was/ Harry and Bellatrix in this image, it just wasn't very popular.
