I'd preferably like it to go something like this Pettigrew was watching Harry but Harry wouldn't stop crying so magic snapped out silencing Harry. Harry doesn't make any noise whenever Harry claps, walks, talks, snores etc. This results Harry haveing to learn how to write and do magic early and silently. Preferably Lilly Andy James alive, and Harry 1.wbwl 2.super smart and powerful. Unfortunately I can't find any fics similar to this. If you are an author feel free to use this idea. Please help me! Btw it's fine if Harry is not wbwl or super powerful

Similar prompt idea. There are very few mute Harry stories to begin with, quite a few are recommended in that thread. Probably even the majority of the good ones.

** This isn't what you're asking for, but it is a cousin. In this fic, Harry is traumatized by Voldemort killing his mom in front of him and doesn't speak. He still makes noise and can occasionally talk if he feels comfortable, but generally doesn't say anything. It's a rare WBWL in that James survived the attack and is not abusive.

  Only two people know what happened the night John Potter became the Boy-Who-Lived: Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter. And neither of them are talking.
