#+begin_quote
  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after.\\
  Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical.\\
  After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks.\\
  Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

  The additional tags of: abortion, corporal punishment, domestic violence, dubious consent, rape/non-con elements - do not occur between Lily/Severus.

  Platonia is the name for a hypothetic entity of a timeless realm containing every possible "Now" of the universe. The physical world is not as real as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. But change is a constant factor in life. Tom Riddle doesn't like change he can't control.  „Tom.“, he didn't look up from the books that were laid out before him. The mean gleam in her eyes deepened and her smile turned predatory. She felt like the tigress stalking her prey, but she knew it wasn't like that. He only let her be the tigress, because in reality he was the most beautiful predator she had ever seen. And she wanted him to be hers.  Tags and Summary may change as story progresses

this uses Marauders era political tension in hogwarts as a not so veiled allegory for facing racism, and Lily is putting to head some big plans. seems like slowburn JILY but i really like the way the tension is written. it's still being written but excited for updates.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Four starts on 9/1/20. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Sorted into Slytherin with the whisper of prophecy around her, Hermione refuses to bow down to the blood prejudices that poison the wizarding world. Carving her own path forward, Hermione chooses to make her own destiny, not as a Muggleborn, a halfblood, or as a pureblood... but as a New Blood, and everything the mysterious term means. ((Short chapters, done scene by scene))

** For the Wrong-boy-who-lived genre I'd recommend: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin by The Sinister Man) linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes) linkao3(Harry Potter and the Forsaken's Ascension by ACI100) All of then are still updating. The author for Den of Snakes, which is part of the Sarcasm & Slytherin series abandoned their account halfway through the fifth book and continued the series under the username anonymousmagpie. Forsaken's Ascension is part of the Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos series. All three of these series' are still updating.

Each of them are different, but the general premise is that Harry's twin is the boy-who-lived, raised by James and/or Lily, while Harry was abandoned to the Dursley's for being a squib. Even though he isn't a squib. There's no extreme exaggeration, and any bashing is well earned.

[[http://redhen-publications.com/files_to_post/publications/Pimpernel-lowRes.pdf]] is the link for The Scarlet Pimpernel. The most highly recommended Percy-centric fic set when the ministry is taken over by Death Eaters. A BAMF Percy helped the muggleborns escape. Completed.

linkffn(Unseen Perspective by TendraelUmbra) linkao3(Unseen Perspective by Tendrael) The Fanfiction.net and AO3 links for the same fic. Voldemort is a woman and she isn't a blood purist. Her goals haven't been revealed though. The beginning is in the graveyard at the end of Goblet of Fire. Delphi Riddle is also a character in this. Voldemort is OP and cringeworthy. Still updating.

linkffn(A Joke Gone Wrong by Atana) The start of a series by the same author where Dumbledore is a father figure to Snape. Marauders bashing. Set right after the prank where Snape runs into the forest to attempt suicide. By the last book, Snape joins the Death Eaters with the purpose of spying on them for Dumbledore.

Linkffn(The Well Groomed Mind by Lady Khali) Possibly the best Manipulative!Dumbledore fic that exists. I am not the only one who thinks that. Sadly, it's abandoned. But it's abandoned partway through the second book so you can still read the first one if you don't like reading abandoned fics. The summary doesn't say a lot. Basically, Harry's whole reckless, Gryffindor, rushing into danger before thinking personality doesn't exist. Dumbledore essentially mind-raped Harry with Legilimency to create this false personality so he could use Harry as a weapon for a prophecy that doesn't exist. Barty Crouch Jr also teaches Harry occlumeny and is a main character through the books.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up abused and alone and unlike his brother, he quickly had to learn to fend for himself. Abuse changes people on both a physical and psychological level, so when Harry Potter showed up at Hogwarts just a little bit different to how people may have expected, they really ought not to have been surprised. They should not have asked themselves what had happened, they should have asked themselves what would possibly happen next. WBWL, Slytherin Harry, Fem Voldemort, Grey Harry.
