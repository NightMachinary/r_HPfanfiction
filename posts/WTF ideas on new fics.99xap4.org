Were there any type of ideas or thoughts at the back of your brain about a possible future fic that you'd write which was borderline terrifying?

I don't know if this qualifies, but I remember once thinking about a villainous OC that used a combination of magic and muggle technology, and what he would do is kidnap purebloods and muggles and then transfer their blood into one another. Then he'd discard the muggles by using them as magical bombs since the blood inside them wasn't compatible, while the purebloods just go crazy and kill themselves.

He was like this Muggle-born psychopath who was intent on destroying purebloods and anything with wizard ancestry. For me, it was super fucked up and I had to take a good look at myself because it was just gruesome in my head. But I'm just curious if anybody else had these type of thoughts.


** I always had this idea for a one-shot that took place in Hermione's fifth year and the stress she had when studying for O.W.L.s. She and Harry talk in the common room one night where she explains how it's so hard to study in her dorm because of how much Lavender and Parvati talk and giggle about cute boys. Harry asks about the library and Hermione answers people talk in there, too, but it's much worse because there's more students there than just Lavender and Parvati. Hermione resolves that she'll have to think of something to combat the distraction. The next morning while unpacking her trunk for her clothes, Hermione resolves that she has successfully eliminated the distraction and smiles down at the decapitated heads of Lavender and Parvati.

​

I wrestled with the idea of writing this but thought it was too gruesome to actually post online. That's not even mentioning how wildly OOC it is for Hermione to commit murder as a teenager.

He wanted to eat Harry for surviving the bite of his greatest progeny, Slytherin basilisk.

I'll probably still use this still though.

“You ask what such a paltry thing as a scale may do?”

** Need some WTF horror fics of what Hagrid gets up to w/ cross breeding magical creatures. Like have him crack up after his stay in Azkaban after yr2 and suddenly its the Island of Dr Moreau. He starts crossing humans with other creatures, and it turns out that He is just carrying on the work of his mad father. His story about his giant mum and tiny dad loving each other is just a fairy tale he tells himself.

** I'm a dark fic writer tbh so getting to ‘what the fuck?' fucked up is a little hard for me lmao. Probably the darkest fics I've written for this series have been the ones centered on the Black family and their crazy internal power dynamics because that's what I live for.

But I haven't really posted many of those because I usually only write them for friends.

I guess the darkest one centered on Orion gaslighting Walburga, because he thought she would raise Sirius as badly as she raised her little brother, as a means to commit familial kidnapping which resulted in her having severe separation psychosis and delusionally believing Sirius wasn't her child.

** I had this ritual about making Muggles, wizards. Never implemented it anywhere.

It's basically a ritual where a muggle "steals" a wizard magic. The ritual would need to be completed on Hallow's eve. It is marked by the purpose of leaving one's life behind to start a new one and require appropriate sacrifice: five family members related by blood need to be bled and killed. A wizard you wish to steal the magic from need to be captured, and also bled. The blood need to be drink.

Or something like that. Didn't have much details.

*** I read a fic where "Blood Magic" was really just "Take someones blood, put it in yourself. If you don't die, you get their special magical talents." But since blood typing is a recent (and muggle!) invention, blood magic was incredibly dangerous, hence all the crazy rituals and lore around it. One psycho with AB+ blood type probably got it in their mind that doing these special things is what protected them from the risks of blood magic, and it just kinda stuck.

Though the fic didn't explore the fact that blood wears out and is discarded, so do you get to keep the talent when the last of the blood is removed from your system?

And what if you got a bone marrow transplant? Would you then get their talent forever?

So that would be a hilarious fic. Muggles accidentally figure out a "ritual" to steal magic... plain old blood transfusions for temporary power or fairly mundane bone marrow transplants for permanent power. Probably discovered when some muggleborn's sibling got sick and needed a bone marrow transplant and their magical sibling was a match. And suddenly, the non-magical sibling was /also/ magical. Most kids don't give blood for transfusions, and I doubt there's many adult wizards who do, either. And even then, the person who got the transfusion would have to experience accidental magic and figure out that it /was/ magic and then trace it back to the blood which then gets traced back to the donor... all highly unlikely. They'd probably just heal a bit faster than expected and nobody knows why. So it would pretty much have to be a bone marrow transplant between people in the know that lets them figure it out.

**** Dude I love this so much! As I said, I didn't go into much details other than what I wrote, but it would be majorly horrifying and sad if it wasn't permanent. So you kill your family and you don't even get permanent magical powers. Only as long as the speed of your digestive system.

**** I mean my headcanon is that 'blood magic' is using blood as a magical channel, and it requires use of a special kind of ritual knife or something.

This was due to a "Sirius goes rogue-er and raids Grimmauld Place. Uses everything - and I do mean everything - he can find in a one-man crusade against the death eaters" fic I was working on, where he shanks Lucius Malfoy and apparates using his blood to get past the wards (the body was still on the knife at the time).

** A postwar Harry/Andromeda relationship which plays on the fact that she would not only have a romantic role in Harry's life but also his substitute mother who patched him up after the war. Basically, she first establishe herself in the mother role, maybe as far as having Harry call her Mum because he is both a stranger to deeper romantic and familiar feelings and kinda misread what exactly he wanted from their relationship. Andromeda clung to the idea because after losing both her husband and daughter in rapid succession, she wanted as much family as she could get her hands on (maybe throw in Delphi here).

Basically, two damaged people who help each other heal and develop a strange relationship out of their need for comfort.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

**** Nope, one of my own plot bunnies. I have quite a few where I began to outline the plot or write a scene but eventually run into some obstacle and ditch the idea, or massively alter the original idea.

For example, my story "No longer alone" originally began a year earlier, had a supportive McGonagall, explored the Chamber of Secrets, had a Harry/Katie pairing and a lot of Ginny in it. The version I have up on FFN ditched all of that (well, Harry and Katie are good friends, but that doesn't count).

** I just wrote this fic early this morning. Its about about an idea that popped into my head and I decided to write it out. Its my first fanfic and I hope you guys like it!

New story from ashh.kv,

Yes, I'm Muggleborn!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13119842/1/]]

Harry Potter

Words: 2,136 Genre: Adventure/Romance Rated: M

This story follows our unsung heroes, the Muggleborn Wizards from Gryffindor. I also added a new twist to Ron's character, which is more mature and playing to his strengths. Harry and Hermion will play a key role, but the spotlight will be stolen by Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas & Colin Creevy. Smart Ron, Half-blood Dean, Savage Colin. Rated M for Language and Graphic Violence!
