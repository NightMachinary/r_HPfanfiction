Hello! I read a Hermione/Snape fanfiction a couple years ago that I want to reread. What I remember is that Hermione goes back in time and becomes close with Lily and the Maurauders. She becomes romantically involved with Snape and eventually is named Harry's godmother. I remember there's a scene where teenage Harry meets middle aged Hermione, and it all makes complete sense in the world of this fanfiction. Any chance you know what fanfiction I'm looking for?

  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...

*** I think this is it! I'm going to read some of it, and report back to confirm if it is or not.

Thanks a bunch!

Edit: Read it and really enjoyed it! This is definitely the fanfiction I was looking for!

** forgot description: AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.
