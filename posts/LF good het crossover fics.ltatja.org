I don't really care about the fandom but I'd like the pairing to be Harry/girl from other fandom.

As I said in the title I'm looking for get fics, so no fem!harry.

The only good ones I've found are Star Wars Crossovers ( linkffn(Sword and Magic by bluminous8), linkao3(A New World by alexandertheII), linkffn(Revenge of the Wizard by Darth Marrs) ) and I feel like I've exhausted that fandom already.

Thanks in advance!


** Linkffn(Shadow of Angmar) is a fantastically written slow-burn LOTR/HR crossover that seems like it's going in a Het direction. The author's love for LOTR and it's lore make it a gem, but it is definitely more of an LOTR and HP story. There was also a novella called linkffn(The Wizard of Harrenhal) that was a nice HP/GoT cross. I also enjoyed Something Wicked This Way Comes, though I'm also a Bradbury fan so Mad got me with the title. Your best bet is just to browse ffn HP crossovers. Select by reviews, by length, by subject. A few are bound to come up. You're also welcome to check out my C2 on ffn under the same name. Over 400 stories I've enjoyed over the years.\\
Good reading.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

** I dislike most cross-overs which are normally suggested (Marvel superheroes stories, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings), so what I like is probably too weird for others.

1. “Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla” linkao3(784221) is combination with MI5/Spooks TV serial
2. Just this week I found about “Lone Traveler: Harry Potter in Arcadia by dunuelos” linkffn(10652736) is the continuation of the very obscure American TV series “Joan of Arcadia” (I don't know if it was ever shown outside of US, but we were living in Boston when it was on TV).

  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him..."So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdos how to do our job?""Yes, that is the general idea."Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done, and with cooperating magical and Muggle terrorists on the loose, working together might just be a necessity anyway.Set in Spooks season 5 and after the Deathly Hallows, but before the epilogue of Harry Potter

  As his and Voldemort's spells collide during the Battle of Hogwarts, not all is as it seems. Yes, the Dark Lord is defeated, but something weird happens to Harry, too. Without having a real explanation as to why, he is thrust into an alien world. Some would let this development crush their spirit, that was never something he was good at letting happen. Instead, it becomes a chance.Now complete, work on the sequel well underway.
