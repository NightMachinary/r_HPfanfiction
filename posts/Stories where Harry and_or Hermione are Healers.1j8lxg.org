I only read novel-length fics, and I'm not a fan of pairings with Snape, but other than that I'm open to suggestions. I just finished [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4842696/1/Reparations][Reparations]]/[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5047623/1/Foundations][Foundations]], which I can recommend if you like slash.


** Since nobody's offered up anything, I'll toss out there [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6585807/1/Harry-Potter-Healing-Hands][Harry Potter: Healing Hands]]. It's 90k words, WIP (probably abandoned).

  Harry, indignant over Remus Lupin's resignation at the end of his third year, has an epiphany-and channel his "saving-people-thing" differently. He wants to become a Healer. Ch-19 Confrontations

*** I think people who abandon good fics go to the special hell. :(

***** Personally, I wouldn't post anything until it was finished or nearly finished. I think it's not cool to get people engrossed in a story then disappear.
