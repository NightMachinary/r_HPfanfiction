As a reference without a title: I believe there was a crossover fic where these bigass robots that apparently are kinda alive attack the world. Lily Luna is minister I think. Basically London gets fucked up but Harry and some teachers save Hogwarts. He kinda threatens but not really, the Flamels since they owe him a favour for saving the philosophers stone. Goes to an emergency meeting of the ICW? Threatens some more people. Goes to the Moon and fucks up some polish wizard for dabbling in some magic he told him nono to.

Kinda like that. Cheers.

It's a Dresden files crossover, if that matters. Thoroughly dead unfortunately, just like everything else by ryuugi.

*** This is one of my favorite stories, which is why I can say with confidence that it's not the one being requested.

  The day the Reapers invaded Earth, one landed on Hogwarts. The castle survived, but the Statute of Secrecy won't.

**** This is definitely the one OP was talking about, but i think he's looking for similar ones. I too would like some tbh. And this fic is amazing, I can't wait til it updates again. I just hope it's not dead
