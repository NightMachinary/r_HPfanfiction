i have read linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13247979/32/Three-Black-Birds]]) and really enjoyed it and was hoping for more along the same lines

i have read WBWL stories but they always have the potters be complete jackass's and dumbledore be a manipulative bastard and it just ruins the immersion for me. I have no problem being with them being neglectful/forgetful but it's a real turn when James is portrayed almost identical to fanon Ron (the one from bashing fics)

bonus if harry has a third sibling that he is close to

no hinny no harmony and no slash and no fem!harry pls


** I would like one where harry is the younger sibling, instead of the oldest self righteous one

** I don't usual read this genre but I assume you've read Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by Santi right? I know I'm recommending the most recommended fic but on the off-chance you haven't it's one of the best out there.
