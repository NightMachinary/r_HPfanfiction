I like how I say I hate universe crossing but the harry potter fic I'm writing I literally inserted Weiss schnee from rwby into my fic as the main character ðŸ¤£ she's molded into a proper witch but I kept her looks and personality intact, and instead of glyphs from rwby she favors ice elemental spells and is quite astounding with them

*** Allow me.

--------------

Harry was sifting. It had occured to him one day to cast a simple spell in the Room of Requirement - /"Accio Money"/. Needless to say it had rained money so hard he had to cast a shield charm. But after collecting about 239 galleons, 2000 british pounds of various years, a few dollars, twenty euros and a variety of other, older currencies (including what he was pretty sure were genuine roman denarii) Harry finally saw the potential of the room.

And so, he spent every free moment of his time sifting through the great heaps of, to be quite frank, trash, finding amazing treasures every once in a while.

Already, he was the proud owner of a wand holster, a sneakoscope, several mysterious, unlabeled potions that still glowed with magic, a case full of cut rubies and had just spied the most massive gemstone he'd ever seen.

Perched on top of a broken cabinet lay a baseball-sized crystal orb that glowed faintly from within. The customary /revelio/ spell he cast on everything after a book had bitten his fingers revealed some sort of magic, but nothing immediately harmful.

The effect became obvious when he touched it, however.

*/"A NEW HAND TOUCHES THE BEACON."/*

--------------

The voice blared into his head for a bit, instructing him to go to Mesopotamia.

It referred to it like that was an actual country, too, which was a bit weird.

The voice inside the orb seemed to be very primitive, and could only repeat sections of its speech - save for one new thing, which it revealed when he asked why he should do as it demanded.

*/"THERE IS A WEAPON. A BLADE OF GREAT POWER THAT WILL BE USEFUL IN YOUR PURSUITS."/*

Well, that did sound enticing. Harry didn't really have much confidence in him beating a seasoned dark wizard that could survive death on his own - so a great weapon might be just what he needed.

Luckily, the summer was near, and so the next time he entered London, he simply vanished into the crowd and sook out the nearest travel agency. From a cursory glance at his history books, he knew that Mesopotamia was in southwest asia, about where Iraq was located now.

So he purchased a trip to Iraq (getting a strange look from the agent), cowed his relatives into silence by using a bit of fear-inducing draught in their coffee and waited until the date on his ticket came to pass.

--------------

Turns out that the travel agent had been weirded out because Iraq was a bit tense at the moment. There'd been some wars in the region, but he just walked out of the airport under his cloak, and vanished into the wilderness shortly after, so he didn't really get a sense of scale or history. The ball instructed him to travel southeast.

Harry flew, occasionally walked and spent the nights in his wizarding tent, which was stocked up with food. Merlin bless the muggles for tin cans.

After a few days of travel, Harry set down in a small, isolated ruin inside a mountain valley that had tingled with the telltale sign of a defensive enchantment - at least, until the crystal ball had pulsed and the enchantment had folded over him like a piece of origami instead.

The ruin was a surprisingly well-preserved sumerian temple - exploring it, Harry found a lot of intact pottery and some very potent curses, which he could sometimes only barely avoid triggering.

Arriving in the deepest chamber, Harry encountered the strangest thing he'd seen yet. Two pillars, carved with some sort of ancient language, the air splitting open between them as he walked near.

The ball's voice prompted him to enter, and so he did.

--------------

If apparition was bad, this was worse. Harry felt like he was turning inside-out, like his willpower was the only thing maintaining his existence, like his body was made of wind and fire instead of flesh and blood.

But only for a moment. The feeling passed, and before long, he found himself upon a craggy hill in what could only be described as Hell itself.

*/"IT IS THE DEADLANDS."/* the ball said helpfully. */"SEEK OUT MY IDOL IN THE DISTANCE."/*

Dodging pyroclastic flows and the occasional, very angry humanoid in bloody warpaint, Harry snuck across the flat plane lined with craters and cliffs and rifts until he arrived at the foot of a badly eroded angel statue. He leaned against it, and his body felt like it was being compressed down into a thin noodle and sucked through a straw.

--------------

Harry came to inside of a bedchamber, the crystal ball on a velvet pillow across the room.

Hearing footsteps approach, Harry quickly summoned the ball and his pack, then made off out of a high window.

The ball prompted him to go upwards, and he did - until he felt gravity becoming stronger than his broom could fight.

He flew downwards, landing in a small courtyard. Before he could look around, two men in equally strange clothes arrived through one of the entrances, the more colorful of the two moonwalking across the courtyard as to maintain eye contact with the other.

"You've got to forgive the little mortal, Haskill. They have quite the habit of wandering off. I'd know, I was one myself once! Haha!"

Harry cleared his throat, and both men turned towards him. That is, their heads did. The suited man's body remained in place, with his head turning 180 degrees, the neck twisting up like the plastic on a bag of toast.

"And who are youuu, hmm?" He asked in a sing-song voice. Before Harry could respond, the man spied the crystal ball in his hands, and his face scrunched up.

"Oh, you're one of /those/. You're no fun, though no wonder you walked off. Hey, Merry, I know it's you in there, why don't you ever visit me for teatime anymore? Do you have a new best friend? Actually, I do as well. You wouldn't know her, she's prince of a different realm of Oblivion. Now beat it!"

He snapped his fingers, and Harry was enveloped in a vortex of purple light.

--------------

When he came to, he was floating. Not in space, not truly - but in something close to it. Looking around, it was like he was floating in midst of a large, complex nebula, with the occasional star twinkling or shooting across the space.

One of these stars approached him, quickly becoming larger and larger, until he had to shield his eyes.

*/"HELLO, MORTAL."/* said the star, and Harry recognized its voice at once. */"MY TASK IS THUS: YOU BATTLE THE DEFILER, MALKORAN, AND CLAIM DAWNBREAKER - WITH ITS POWER, I WILL THEN SEND YOU HOME, TO USE IT AS YOU WISH."/*

In the being's overwhelming presence, Harry could only nod. As soon as he did, the star disappeared - and so did everything else.

**** The ground was cold, and the air smelled of death. A shambling corpse shuffled by, and Harry crouched closer to the entrance of the deepest chamber. He'd appeared on an altar only a few staircases higher, and beyond the door, he could hear a voice cursing to the heavens.

"Damn you, Devil! Who are you to take this from me? I earned this power!" It shouted.

Casting a bit of grease at the door, Harry managed to soundlessly open it, revealing the crouched, hooded figure of a man, kneeling before a small altar. Surrounding him were two beings much too close to Dementors for Harry's liking.

The man opened a book, and Harry felt his chance - a whispered /stupefy/ later, and the man fell to the floor, soundlessly. However, apparently his sudden loss of consciousness had broken his control over the specters, as they began mercilessly pummeling him with their weapons! Before Harry could react, one of the shades caught the man in the neck, and his body began to bleed dark shadows from the wound, until a much larger specter manifested above it.

/"Who dares???"/ it shouted with an inhuman chill, and all three specters began fanning out across the chamber. Seeing his chance, Harry jumped out of his cover and shouted the Patronus Charm, Prongs jumping from his wand like a miniature sun.

The three specters cringed from the light, but were too slow on the draw as Prongs gored the leader directly through his torso, causing his darkness to shred apart with a fading scream.

The other two specters exploded at the death of their leader, and Harry felt the voice of the star-entity once more.

*/"MALKORAN IS DEAD AT YOUR HAND. YOU HAVE MY THANKS, MORTAL. TAKE DAWNBREAKER FROM ITS PEDESTAL."/*

Doing so, Harry noticed how ridiculously well-balanced the blade actually was. Swinging it took almost no effort, and on a whim, he held it aloft like one of those comic-book superheroes.

The glow on Dawnbreaker's core intensified, and Harry vanished from Kilkreath in a twinkle of starlight...

--------------

... right into the middle of a battle. A battle his side was badly losing. A tide of black-cloaked, skull-masked evildoers was doing its best to push back a more diverse army of aurors, civilians, teachers and students, who'd partly barricaded themselves into the castle to their back already, shielding against werewolves and dark curses alike.

Right at the center of the Light side's formation, the shield spells faltered, and the hulking form of a monstrous Werewolf was upon the hapless students who'd held it - but just before its jaws could close around their necks, everyone was blinded by a flash of light, cold as the stars themselves.

In their midst, Harry Potter had appeared, wielding a blade that shed a cold, cruel light unto the Werewolf's pelt.

It snarled, and made to jump, but Harry's swing cleaved through its skull like butter, bringing it low.

The light side cheered, not only because they'd gotten their savior back, but also because they'd run out of silver to fight the wolves with a while ago. Harry danced between the Werewolves like an artist, lopping off heads and legs and torsos in half, while the Light side army used the distraction to push forward once more, crushing Death Eaters against a wall of shield charms, punctuated by the occasional curse.

Eventually, the battlefield darkened, and the Death Eaters instinctively parted for their master. The Dark Lord himself had come, come down from his perch to deal with the threat of Potter.

The two remaining combatants formed a rough circle around the two, Voldemort holding his bone-white wand lazily in one hand, on his opposite a grim-faced Harry, holding aloft a silver blade that glowed with eldritch light.

/"You will die here."/ hissed Voldemort, a statement more than a challenge, and opened the bout with his signature curse.

Harry leveled the blade, and green, poisonous light met arcane metal in a deafening /CLANG/, the light bouncing off the blade and striking a hapless Death Eater among the crowd.

With a shout, Harry began sprinting at his enemy, who began throwing darker and darker curses at him, all of which were deflected by that accursed sword.

Voldemort's eyes widened as Harry was upon him, and he attempted to lift into the air, but the blade cleaved into his neck, severing his head from his body in an instant.

As the blade passed through undead flesh, it ignited with a holy flame, exploding outwards, pulverizing what remained of the Dark Lord into a cloud of ash, and striking all the living Death Eaters, who clutched desperately at their forearms as the smell of burning flesh and a sickly sizzling noise filled the air.

** The Book was so strange, simple runes that were essentially a simple cipher of English. Once Hermione had figured it out for him it was easy reading... Easy and interesting.

The Planes of Oblivion were.... ominous sounding, to say the least. But then, many things in the wizarding world sounded quite ominous.

Making a sacrifice was simple enough, the Forbidden Forest was right there. It was a bonus that the Acromatula were sentient. "I wish to make a bargain." he said, his wand swiping down to take the life of the giant spider, "I am overwhelmed and in need of help."

"Well then." came the voice, high and joking. It sounded no older than him, "You have come to the right place Harry Potter! My name is Clavicus Vile!"

---

Harry noticed the effects almost immediately. This new magic was strange to say the least, but it was STRONG. Most wizards pulled magic from within, most RITUALS pulled from the ambient magic in the world. Harry now pulled it from a place known as Aetherius. Well... Aetherius and Oblivion. Vile had come through in spades, and all he had to do was take care of a dog. Said dog had promptly left on its own, but the power had remained.

Spells cast using Aetherius' power were easy, instinctual. Every class he impressed on the first time. The teachers didn't look twice, none but Snape, but praised him for finally realizing his true potential.

But the Spells using Oblivion... He had to KNOW those spells backwards and forwards or they would go wonky, but when Harry used them they were strong, too strong almost. He had cast a disarming hex and took down a tree... He was curious to what a Blasting Curse would do.

---

"+FUCK+!" Harry yelled, standing over the body, "YOU SHOULD HAVE DODGED YOU IDIOT!" now Goyle was dead, all because he tried to block a spell.

Out of the corner of his eye he could see a figure move, his wand moved and a red light filled the room... A dog?

"Vile?" he asked hesitantly. If anything the dog looked disappointed, "He should have known! I broke his shield everytime!" he yelled, looking down at the body again.

And then the dog spoke, "You need to hide the body kid."

Harry just stared for a long time.

"There is a dog talking in an American accent telling me to hide a body..." his hand went to his face, "I've gone barmy. They'll lock me up right next to Lockhart."

"Great, dramatics. You CAN get rid of the body right?" it asked, "You fucked up, but I have a job to do here, and I can only do that while YOU are still alive. THIS might mess that part of the deal up."

He stared, "I... I can vanish the body." Harry agreed, "Over power it with Oblivion energy and... Ok, ok!" and with a wave the body was gone, whisked off to Vile's side.

"Good... now what can you tell me about these 'Dementors' I've been hearing about?"

It's similar in concept - i keep looking for some that explore the daedric magic more and its possible corruption / influence on harry, but I've found nothing satisfactory.

Most are all "oh the daedric princes are friendly beings" and not "oh the daedric princes are entirely other and foreign to anything I'm familiar with".

Knowledge is power comes the closest I've seen to treating them in a lore friendly way.

(Not that authors can't write what they want, it just doesn't tickle my fancy to read about daedric princes acting so mortal-like)

Harry ends up in his care because Sheogorath was wandering around godrics hallow when harry was orphaned. According to the summary of the story Sheogorath was "Enraged by the Cruelty" of the act. The Only Prince I could see being enraged Is Meridia, But thats more because OF the soul anchors than anything else. Maybe also because the unforgivables might resemble necromancy.
