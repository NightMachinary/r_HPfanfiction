If I remember correctly, Harry was older, but stoped physically age at 17. He put charmes on hisself, so he would look according to his age. And he worked with Tony and Bruce in the lab? They didn't know he's a wizard at first. Or that he looked young.

  When Harry finally accepted the fact that he had stopped aging, ten years had passed and he knew it was time to leave. AU.

*** Mmh, no. But thanks. :)

I might mix two stories in my mind, but Harry was some kind of scientist, or Tony&Harry(&Bruce?) experimented and tryed to build a portal / way in Harry's world... But I remember that they dind't know Harry looked young till some art of accident happened and his charms washed off.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.

** Other threads with Harry Potter/Avengers cross overs: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/30ph48/lf_hpavengers_crossovers/][1]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2ignef/looking_for_a_hpavengers_cross_over/][2]], [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4r9ka1/any_recomendations_for_hpavengers/][3]]. It might be worth going through them to see if it is there.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8240089/1/Mortem-Cantor][Mortem Cantor]] linkffn(8240089) is a lot of fun, with Harry is boarding on mad scientist and Fury is exasperated. However, the interaction between Harry and the Avengers is minimal, but it does fit. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10835321/1/Behind-the-Shield][Behind the Shield]] linkffn(10835321) is a little AU of Mortem Cantor which is reason alone to read Mortem Cantor. I still giggle when re-reading it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8208936/1/Wanderer][Wanderer]] linkffn(8208936) has an unknown wizard Harry interacting with Marvel. But Bruce isn't around yet, so it probably isn't that. It's by the same author as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8148717/1/Finding-Home][Finding Home]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8275548/1/Mirror-Mirror][Mirror Mirror]] linkffn(8275548) is also the same (even if it is marked slash, it hasn't yet shown any) and is really excellent with how SHIELD would react to finding out about Harry. The interactions between Harry and most of the group are not friendly though. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8212843/1/I-See-The-Moon][I See The Moon]] linkffn(8212843) has a great broken Harry and helping Bruce. Tony is also great in character too. No one quiet knows what is wrong with Harry (except maybe Loki). But I think you want a more competent Harry?

Can you remember any more details? Like is Harry from a parallel universe, or has he just run away from the Wizarding world, or maybe he is there deliberately (as a liaison)? Was it humor, or kickass Harry, or hurt/comfort?

  Life's a lot easier when no one knows you and your only worry is whether or not people in each world speak the same languages you do. Harry can attest to it; he's been jumping for years. He knows how to keep his head down and not get invested. On hindsight, with his track record, Harry supposed it was only a matter of time until he did exactly that.

  After losing everything he holds dear, Harry Potter is thrust into a new world; one with Superheroes and evil Villains that make Voldemort look like a kitten. Struggling to survive in this new world - and, meanwhile, gaining the attention of S.H.I.E.L.D. - he attempts to live a NORMAL life. But, he is Harry Potter after all... what could possibly go wrong? Possible Slash!

  It was a good thing the new scientist, Dr. Harry Evans, was working out so well. Because nothing else was going Fury's way. And that was before Loki made off with the Tesseract and some of his people. Maybe AU to Mortem Cantor by Kyandua.

  One day, Harry J Potter made a wish in front of the mirror of Erised. One day, Bruce Banner woke up naked in a green-eyed man's aparment. One day, Harry introduced himself with his father's name to a strange man he found naked, green, and angry on the street. One day, SHIELD discovered human magic... and tried to make weapons from it.
