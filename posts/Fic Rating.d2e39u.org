I'm sure this gets asked regularly, so if there's another thread with everything answered I'm happy to be pointed in its general direction, but what constitutes a graphic depiction of violence? I'm writing a fic now, and am about to kill off an enemy goon with a shotgun, at close range. I don't see myself holding back from describing it (though also not going to make a song and dance about it). To be even more blunt, does a load of buckshot to the face constitute a graphic depiction of violence?


** Depends on details. You can gloss over it and get away with a lower rating ("The roar of the cannon erased his face and any lingering appetite I had for spagbol in one blast") or you can count out all of the messy, goopy bits of gray matter being splattered on walls, bystanders having to tweezer out splinters of skull, etc.

** A load of buckshot to the face with description of where pieces of head go and blood etc is graphic, and should get an M.

Someone getting shot in the face with a scene change to their funeral or whatever is not graphic and should get a T.

** Violence is violence. Its reality, some people who are very squeamish are pussies. If we get into WW3 than we are fucked.

So I'd say M.
