This chapter had Harry desecrating a mosque with a curse to forced anyone looking at the place to hate Islam and ended a section with:

#+begin_quote
  The morons driving trucks into crowds were in fact far less dangerous than the quiet types that just went about their business and had ten kids, because those ten kids would also be raised to a narrow-minded, intolerant belief system that despised difficult questions and critical thinking. A system that they espoused as perfect, and therefore unassailable. A system that cared nothing for truth or wisdom.

  Europe had not painstakingly dragged itself out of the Dark Ages just so that it could be plunged right back into them.

  He, Harry Black, the most powerful sorcerer in the world, would not allow it, even if these wimpy modern day politicians would. Even if he had to instigate mass killings and pogroms. Even if he had to step deep into Dark Lord territory. After all, who would do science for him if Europe became an extension of the Middle East?

You lot seen any fics go as sideways as this one has?

** The thing is, if a powerful wizard wanted to reform a religion, they could easily spend a few months, tops, to use the false memory charm to turn the most prominent and influential religious leaders around. You can dress it up as them having visions from god. No need for any pogroms or killings - just have influential people pass out decrees reforming the religion. Then spend a few years treating replacement leaders who try to form a backlash with the same spell until it sinks in. If needed, add some "Miracles" for the most stubborn opponents. Religious fanatics are really easy to manipulate if you can do magic.

I think it was the third story of that series there was a bunch of omakes where he starting mocking religions, which he then put in as fully fleshed chapters in the fourth story. He was no less blatantly condescending than he is in this story, so I very much doubt he will give a single shit about all the gibbering people are doing, regardless if it is well deserved or not. Every single one of his stories are basically porn of varying degrees of quality as the main character ascends to ludicrous power levels and curb stomps various analogies of people/characters that the author doesn't like, the only people that would consider this one of his stories going sideways are those that haven't read any of his others.

** It looks to me like an author taking Harry through the process of radicalization.

Harry is forced into hardship at a young age retarding healthy mental development. As a young person he becomes used to taking real world actions that have devastating consequences for the people he considers his enemies. He develops strong personal beliefs.

He's a person who was socialized badly in their youth and "might makes right" has been mentally ingrained into his thought processes whether or not he realizes it. He's used to taking direct action to fix what he perceives as a problem.

In the past this hasn't been an issue because the people he's had a problem with were obviously bad people. But now this major religion runs against his strong personal beliefs and he has the power to do something about that. Then he does.

He's an evil dickhead but from his point of view it's both logical and reasonable.

It would be kind of cool if Harry one day finds that he's become Voldemort and a prophesied savior is born to save people from him.

I think it's more likely we're following the author through his own and it's just showing in his characters. I thought the same as you during that first controversial chapter but the author's rants at the top of the chapter have convinced me otherwise. Though the fic is definitely a few steps up in complexity and length from the other stuff the he's written I don't think he's the kind of writer who'd go for something so complex. It would definitely be really cool though.

I thought it was kinda funny to have some harem story suddenly turn into a self-insert's genocidal fantasy.

************ I don't think the dude has even met a Muslim once. He said that in his authors note in the previous chapter that he never leaves his house and fan fiction is his only contact with the world now.

Honestly he's the one brainwashed with no ability to think critically about his ideas if that's true.

** It's not even that bad of a fic, tbh. It's genuinely quite enjoyable, well except for a lot of the other taboo crap the author shoved in.

It's also kind of funny seeing how he's reacting to the whole outrage by ramping it up even more, even if his ANs are a little pathetic and oversensitive.

** Holy shit...... So glad I stopped reading the moment I saw hints of a harem. I checked out his author's notes on the chapter you linked and the last one and it's really fucked up. He has no understanding of history and it seems we're just getting a look into the author's unfiltered thoughts rather than Harry's.

A few quotes from his A/N that stood out for me (if you don't want to read through that garbage) -

From the "Guest review section" in chapter 53:

#+begin_quote
  *B. Netanyahu -- hate to break it to you, but Harry only despises Jews less than Muslims because they don't make as much noise.*
#+end_quote

Chapter 53 author's note:

#+begin_quote
  *You can wail about it all you want, but places like Africa and the Middle East are not exactly beacons of enlightenment these days. The backstories don't matter. Even if we humor the delusions some of you have and say that it's all the fault of the evil Europeans and USA and that those places would be utopias otherwise, Harry just doesn't* */care/*. He would sneer at a slave for not casting off their own chains or die trying.

  *Yes, I obviously hold some variation of these beliefs myself. Congratulations, you've discovered the concept of author bias. What an earth-shattering revelation. The very fabric of reality echoes with shock at the thought of an author whose writing is influenced by his personal opinions, especially on a hobby website.*
#+end_quote

I've read some really, really dumb stuff on this site from stories with terrible English to Mary sues to Dark_Harry.exe to mpreg. And some of the authors had equally dumb rationale for the shit they wrote. But I've never come across an author's note as toxic as this...

*** Yeah! Censure and silencing always work!

This is speech against people who drive trucks into crowds and those indoctrinating their families into viewing that as acceptable. Not at all innocent. Very guilty, actually. The fact that nearly all of them are Muslim is just that --- a fact. I mean, has anyone ever driven a truck into a crowd of people, killing dozens, while shouting "Hallelujah"?

Now, where the author goes with it is strange at best and inefficient at worst. Many better ways in which a powerful wizard could steer a religion into a more civil place besides mass killings.

Not that I'm aware of, but there was this whole thing with crusades awhile back that was pretty shitty. Not sure if you've heard of those.

But there's plenty of Muslims that /aren't/ radical- peaceful people that just follow a religion. Some of the people in that religion decided to make it a reason to murder people and spread fear.

***** I think if you want to portray Christianity as something bad, you're better off using paedophile/rapist priests as an example. The crusades are ancient history. Everyone did things that are abhorrent by today's standards back then --- if you didn't, you were conquered.

I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with. My point was that mass killings are no way of dealing with radical extremists --- especially if you have magic powers.

***** Nope, not forgetting those. The OP wasn't talking about them, so why would I? Truck -> crowd was used as a specific example, and I pointed out how killing people in retaliation to that is no way to do things.

I wonder how much of that quote was what the author really thinks and how much of it was there to stir up controversy and get clicks.

******** Haha, i am Communist! how совпадающий . Buddy, i'm one for ending oppression. Listen, I don't want this to go onto a all night long argument of philosophy , so I'll keep this short, Say... you run an online forum, and some lad comes along and start advocating Nazism, and putting swastikas all over a forum page. He is oppressing the right to freedom, He is probably an anti-semanticist, as well. You, being the owner of the forum, ban/whatever to this person, yes? This, Nazi is advocating Hate Speech against a peoples. Would you say it was wrong, then, to suppress someone's views? Look, Fanfiction, is a company, they have their own site, their own whatever. What I'm saying, is that NoodleHammer's hate reflects badly on them. imagine main stream media found out, that on a site with a large community, in the upper tier of the favorites section, that there was an author advocating Islamophobia in a story favorited by many people? Fanfiction, like PewDiePie was branded as a Nazi, would be branded as a Islamophobic site. I don't want that to happen to [[https://FFN.net][FFN.net]], i read most of my fics there. It is in the best interests of Fanfiction, and the Fanfiction Readers to have this literature removed.

Look, I'm sorry if people got upset by my first comment, okay? But it should be removed, ASAP, for the future of Harry Potter Fanfiction, and other fanfics.

Thank you, and до свидания

********* It's a bit late for having "wholesome" fics at the top of favorites list HP fanfics are filled with underage sex, incestuous relationships, massive harems with adults sleeping with teenagers, yet this crosses the line?

Really feels like your randomly cracking the whip to make yourself look like a leader.

If we have to get rid of this for hate speech then please advocate for the censorship of pretty much all the other fics out there with questionable content on the site.

********* You are aware of the rampant incest, rape, violence and just plain genocide in a lot of the stories that are already on the site........right? The fact that a single author is saying rather in a rather ham-fisted way that he thinks all religious people are basically intolerant idiots, with muslims being prone to violence on top of that, which while extremely distasteful and mostly untrue, but I really doubt that this will be the straw that broke the camels back, especially considering his older stories have already done similar things. How on earth you think he is oppressing anything is beyond me, its literally a stupid story on the internet about a horny wizard who doesn't care what anyone else thinks, not someone with any actual power trying to infringe on peoples rights.
