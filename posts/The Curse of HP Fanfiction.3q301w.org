*** Agreed. I was enjoying (although guiltily) the "like no other" series. Abruptly, it stopped. Then the author said she would take it up again, about a year ago. But it never happened. After going back to her site about 50 times, I just stopped. I know she doesn't really owe any of her readers the time and effort, but...

**** This is why I've never posted the fic I've been writing. 55,000 words in and I've been doing it for a year now. I go so slowly, often ignoring it for an entire month at a time, that I know I'd just frustrate readers with it.

If I ever finish it I'll post it, but I don't want to be that guy who posts a half finished fic and then bails.

**** Well, she finished two of them. From what I can guess, it looks like a big problem is her beta/sometimes co-author isn't able to help anymore. Still, that story was begun 11 years ago and was still being worked on one year ago- I wouldn't count it out entirely. Just bookmark it and check back every six months or so.

*** The most annoying things are when a writer abandons a fic and marks it as finished, or when there's a separate one for each year and they abandoned it after first year.

honestly? when something is exceptionally well written I would read it even knowing full well it's not, and won't be, finished.\\
I actually did on a few occasions, other things by those writers were so good I just dived into the story to indulge some more. sure there was a sudden heartbreak but it was totally worth it.

** Quality writing, full stop. I've read a lot of abandoned or interrupted WiPs (and have committed the sin of stopping all posting on my own stories when my life took a header off a cliff). I've never regretted reading an incomplete fic (well, okay, I have, but not because it was incomplete), and I'm always grateful for whatever chapters exist. I'm sorry I don't get to read more, of course, and I'm wistful about the ending that will never be. But I wouldn't wish away those unfinished words for anything. Two of my favorite fics, the Bittersweet Potion series and Elective Affinities, are abandoned and will probably remain so, and I wouldn't give them up for all the fics recced on this comm. You'll have to pry them from my cold dead hands. ;)

Irregular updating doesn't bother me. If it's been a long time since the last posting, I take it as an opportunity to re-read the fic.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

*** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) isn't half-bad either. He's breaking for November NaNoWriMo and I'll really miss his twice-weekly updates.

I think the 0800-Rent-A-Hero author is over their writing slump too.

  What if Harry were a Slytherin? What if everyone thought his twin brother was the BWL? What if someone tried to do something creative and innovative with the two most overused cliches in HP fanfic? AU, currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NOTE: There will be NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year.
