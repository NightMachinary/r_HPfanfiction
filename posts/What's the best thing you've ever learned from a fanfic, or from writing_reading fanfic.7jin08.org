**** Polyjuice Potions. Amortentia. Imperius Curse.

There's a theme here that I'm not sure is such a great one...

On the other hand, imagine the philosophical questions that could arise.

Like, is it beastiality if the horse is also part human capable of intelligent thought? A spider capable of speech and manipulations?

Are snakes intelligent? Can they give consent?

Is it considered rape to have sex with a house elf because they're forced to obey you?

I... am also uncomfortable with the direction this took. Magic is scurry.

** Simply from writing fanfiction I learned a few things about creative work.

Its not the end of the world to can a project. Sometimes holding onto an idea is toxic to your creative process. Flexibility in your approach to a problem is key to creative work - the methodology is always fluid and should never dictate your work, but your work should always dictate your methods.

If you've done it right, you should find a hundred things to do better afterwards. It only means you learned from the project. But do not be afraid to publish your finished work just because you see it as less than you can do in your post-project state of skills. It may be great to some and it is a stepping stone to be proud of for you.

** I've learned a lot from fanfiction, actually. I've learned some history/cultural things from many fics, some basics of Latin. I've also learned a lot about understanding others and I learned a lot about myself. Also, strangely enough, I have learned quite a few tricks that helped in the bedroom. I mean, not to brag, but I get a lot of praise for my--excuse my language--cocksucking skills.

** As an older fan, I got into fic when I was in high school, but I had always been a writer--I've been churning out half-finished (very bad) original novels since I was in middle school. I moved away from it onto more "serious" writing, getting published, feeling frustrated and lost with my "serious" writing but feeling like I need writing in my life, and have only recently returned to writing fiction at all through the lens of fic.

I think that fanfic has taught me a LOT of things in the past year. It's taught me that I can produce content at a breakneck pace, that I need to trust my plots are going somewhere, that I don't need to have every twist and turn mapped out--in fact, that having things mapped out that rigidly is counterproductive for me and inhibits character growth. And that writing doesn't have to be Serious. Because who the hell am I doing it for? I'm doing it for me.

It reminds me of something GRRM said about writers.

He said there are 2 types of writers; architects and gardeners. Architects plan absolutety every small fucking detail beforehand. Gardeners just plant the seed and let the characters and story grow. GRRM is a gardener. You're a gardener. I'm a gardener too. I cannot for the life of me be an architect.

**** Totally! Also, on craft, there's another crucial thing I've figured out: if I'm bored writing it, skip it. If you have stuff for your characters to DO on your long journey then by all means write it in detail. But if you're blocked because you don't know what happens and you're pretty sure it's boring then skip it. Skip it! You don't have to move people around like pieces on a chessboard! You can have character x show up in place y and explain it with a line or two and get to what you ACTUALLY want to write!

** I've become a far better writer in all things, from writing educational documents for work to writing emails and letters. I've also become better at spoken English. My vocabulary has improved, as has my diction and grammar as I drilled myself in the proper forms. My pronunciation is still terrible though, turns out reading and writing doesn't help you know how to pronounce words.

I've become a better, more astute reader as I learn the tricks and signals that writers use to foreshadow plot details or reveal information they think is important.

I've also made some pretty big mistakes, someone which I regret a great deal as they really soured a story.

I've also had a lot of fun, especially talking with readers about my stories. It's always interesting to see people's opinion on what you wrote.

** Not sure about best, but the most recent is the composition of bowling balls.

Bowling balls used to be made of wood, then of hardened rubber. In the 1950s, they started using plastic, and in the 1970s they transitioned to polyurethane. These days, you can get bowling balls in plastic or in polyurethane with additives and imbued with oil.

** I discovered I could actually write something that people were interested in reading, which, even after a year of writing, still amazes me.

Learnt numerous little tidbits of Potterverse trivia from all the times I've been fact checking on the HP Wiki.

I read up on Norse mythology while I was working on some of the chapters and delved the internet for magical beast when I couldn't find one suitable for my story. Ended up discovering the Ichneumon, something I might have been vaguely aware of, but never knew the name or details. Ended up with quite a prominent role in my fic.

Yes, now that we're all adults we like to go back and point out the plot holes and add sex and fiddle with the world, but do not deceive yourself. The Harry Potter books were very well done, even if the Deathly Hallows came right the hell out of left field.

**** Rowling is indeed a good writer. She chose her priorities and stuck with them, and didn't get lost in the minutia like the rest of us tend to. Magic was a tool to drive the plot, not an end unto itself. That left a lot of loose ends, but it made a good story, and I applaud her for that.
