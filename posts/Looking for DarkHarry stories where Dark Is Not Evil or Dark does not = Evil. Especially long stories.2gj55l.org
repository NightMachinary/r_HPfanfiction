Stories where Harry and/or other characters are aware (even though Dumbledore, the Weasleys etc. may not be) that Dark does not = evil or bad, and that sometimes Dark spells get things done where non-Dark do not.

Especially stories with this theme that feature non-canon or against canon House placings of Harry and/or other students in his year. I know Slytherin!Harry is common but I've recently been enjoying Initiate's Gryffindor!Draco and various Ravenclaw!Hermiones. I also love Hogwarts Battle School's ruthless logical Hermione; that's not a character direction I normally see writers go with her.

Thanks for the help guys! I'd be happy to discuss my favourites too!

EDIT: Slash is absolutely fine, doesnt offend me in the slightest. I am an adult ;)

** I was recently recommended the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave][Sacrifices Arc]], and it's bloody fantastic as far as I'm concerned.

To summarise; Connor Potter is Harry's twin and is the one that reflected Voldemort's curse, knowing that Connor would need to face Voldemort at some point - Lily (yes, she's alive. as is James) trained Harry to protect Connor at all costs. Things start going wrong almost immediately and only get worse from there. The fic is focused on Harry but occasionally has chapters from other perspectives, there is also some Harry/Draco but it's not until the fourth year.

It's pretty damn big too, as big as the originals as far as I can tell.

*** The Sacrifices Arc is what got me trapped into fanfiction. Parts of me are still trying to find scenes as memorable as some of the stuff in there.

The series is also great in doing tons of magic building.

**** I've only 'recently' (a few months ago) got into HP fanfiction and so far I'm almost certain that this is my favourite fic and I'm not even into the last two books yet (starting year 5 in about 10 minutes).

Probably the strongest point of the whole series is the creation of new spells that fit almost perfectly into the canon universe and also the expansion and detail given to things we already know. Like the wards, for example, they're explained so much better than they were even in the original books - even if they weren't called wards.

Actually getting into the point of just how ridiculously rich some families are is also fantastic. In canon we were told that the Black family (and Malfoy/Potter etc.) were rich as fuck, but it was never really explained in terms we could understand. In the Sacrifices fic though we can truly see just how much money they have; properties left right and centre, money enough to just give away 1000s of galleons (Â£5k), artifacts out the arse etc.

*** I actually can't remember off the top of my head, I'll have a brainstorm for you. I think Methods of Rationality has Ravenclaw!Hermione but I may be wrong with that.

I also want to recommend to everyone Prince of the Dark Kingdom; I can't remember how in-character the sortings are in that but there is definitely Slytherin!Ron, convincingly.

THIS IS SLASH but if that doesn't bother you, after a somewhat slow start (at least for me now, I loved it the first time, but her writing gets better as she goes on) you get a resorting, slytherin!Harry and some very cool celtic mythos to boot. It is epic length and has a sequel, both are complete, though she doesn't write anymore.

There is some serious Weasley bashing if I recall though.

*** That sounds absolutely wonderful. I love Weasley-bashing and in general alternate character interpretation - just because you can find it in the text; its a really INTERESTING perspective on them.

One of my favourite fanfics is a story which properly character-bashes Molly Weasley and Ginny and I think kills off one or both of them; but it does it so convincingly! Doesnt change my view of the original books, its just an alternate POV haha

This one has very dark themes though Harry isn't dark as such. Also slash. I don't want to give anything away in it, and it made me cry. And I believe it is good all the way through. Complete

Also... TN might be used more often than NN for true neutral.
