Hello!

I don't know if this already exists somewhere, if so I never found it.

I had this idea where Harry would start to really dislike the Wizarding world. This dislike would grow into hate and this hate, this hate would go on to his own magic. He just doesn't want to be a part of this world anymore, so his only solution to really be free of them is to permanently lose his magic. Something where he moves to a different country would be great too.

But please DON'T recommend a fanfiction where the main pairing is Het. Slash or Gen pls
