I am looking for good Dark!Trio or Slytherin!Trio fics.

I read for example "Of Lies, Deceit and Hidden Personas" (which is great btw) and it is one of the only fics (I found) where there is no Ron or Hermione bashing, while the other ones go dark.

I would welcome all fics where all three are dark and/ or Slytherin. I dont mind Dumbledore!Bashing (actually I love it, give me more) and I dont care whether it has (TomHarry) slash or not. It can start at the beginning of the school year or start after eg 5th year, I dont mind.

I would prefer though, that the fic was either complete or still a WIP and not abandoned 5 years ago, because that is just frustrating.

Thank you!
