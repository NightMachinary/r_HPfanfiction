I recently started writing fan fiction (I've got a James Bond one, but have spent more time on a Harry Potter one). It involves a new character and his story of being a wizard. There are minor characters from the original series that make appearances or have semi-major roles - but primarily follows this new character.

It's a non-relationshipping fan-fiction, you're not going to see Harry+Voldemort or Harry+Hermione or anything. It's written in as HP1-7 realistic kind of way. It attempts to hold true to the world that was created (following as many of the rules and tropes as possible). Also non-crossover. For what it's worth, it does ignore (at least at this time) the Cursed Child - despite the fact that I enjoyed it...I just started writing before it and going back to change a few things would be challenging.

What kind of interest is there in a full-length Harry Potteresque novel? I tend to see shorter fanfics with reimaginations or re-writing of certain characters/storylines. Would it be worth sharing a "true-to-the-original" (re: true-to-canon) story here or not? I'm not finished with it (about 40% finished) but have the story plotted and outlined. I wouldn't share it until the story is complete - probably not for a few months.

EDIT: On a related topic, any suggestions on ensuring my writing sounds "British" enough? As an American, one of the things I struggle internally with is the fact I don't know the British lexicon. Should I write and complete this and then have it read by someone British or is there a American English to British English translator out there? (Totally serious :p)


** Do it. Done right, like Alexander Quick, it is the best possible fanfic. It's high risk, but high reward.

*** Interesting. I wonder if it'd be worth reading that before getting to deep into my own adventures. I've actually chosen to skip the James Potter novels that were written a few years ago as to not feel the need to fit that into the canon my novels have. But with the Alexandra Quick novels being set in America and seemingly (based on quick searches) being unrelated to the original series seem like it might be okay.

"High risk" definitely seems like a good phrase. I'm working on my writing...I know my grammar (especially keeping my verb tenses consistent) can be challenging but I think the story itself is pretty solid.

Thanks for the encouragement!

**** Read linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the Thorn Circle) at the very least. It has to be one of the best "original fiction" style fics out there - could easily pass for a novel by itself, I imagine.

***** Thanks (and thanks to the [[/u/FanfictionBot]] for the link. I'll check it out. Like I've said, it's not completely original (plot is with only a few vague details references coming from the original canon). My dream is for the word count to be on par with HP1. I have a rough outline for future books, but the commitment to something this large would be extraordinary.

** I'd love to read a fanfic like this. The strongest point of the Harry Potter franchise is the setting, and a fic that takes the setting and lets new, original characters play with it is the best kind of fic.

If you do start this, please make a note and send me a PM with a link of the first chapter, so I'll know not to miss it!

** I too, am totally interested in this, the Alexandra Quick series is perhaps my favorite fanfiction for Harry Potter because of how it uses the incredible setting of Harry Potter without feeling the need to be chained down to the original plot and characters (which I feel were decisively concluded).

Please toss me a PM if/when the first chapter comes out, because this sounds right up my alley

*** There are characters from the original series that make appearances (some more than others). So it isn't completely original characters (which Alexandra Quick sounds like it is).

Will gladly share things when I'm ready to. I'm unsure why I might share things chapter-by-chapter. I'd much rather share the finished product as to not mislead or share something that someone might never be able to finish.

***** Most certainly! While the main genre of the original series is Fantasy/Action, mystery is definitely involved in each of the novels.

My humour (working on using the British English there!) is sometimes a bit strange, so hopefully my humor works :).
