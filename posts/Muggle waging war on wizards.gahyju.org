Does anyone feel that muggle vs wizard wars arent realistic purely just because of the law of motion and gravity giving the wizards a rather large advantage.

If you need an area gone just get a item of a large weight and apperate high above that area and drop and and wala you have a small astriod stroke that is easily repeatable and do able by most wizards and yet not stop able or track able dust due to speed the object falls with.


** Muggle vs wizard wars are unrealistic because a single wizard with apparition and Fiendfyre can raze a city in a day. There is no defence that muggles can raise against that.

That's not even getting into the nigh-unbreakable mind control that is freely accessible to every single wizard the second the Ministry enacts wartime protocols.

** Also think about logistics. You always attack your opponents centers of gravity and supplies are a big part of that. So the first attack by muggles should concentrate on wand makers (and from the little canon provides there are only a handful). So kill them and destroy all the spare wands you find and wizards are then in a very tough spot. As the number of new wands will be drastically reduced.

Then 1st procedure once a wizard is down is destroy their wand. Without a wand most wizards are worthless. In fact even with wands most wizards are worthless. If they weren't there would be no way for half a dozen deatheaters to terrorize and destroy hundreds in their attack. I mean come on if there are 100 wizards in Diagon Alley when 6 deatheaters attack do you think the deatheaters shields or themselves would survive if every single witch and wizard turned and fired their strongest bombarda or reducto at them?

Think about it the entire society is armed at all times and a simple handful of bad guys control them?

*** Muggles are completely incapable of perceiving wizards settlements. They can be looking right at them and say “doesn't look like anything noteworthy to me”.

As for most wizards being worthless, that's simply not true. They struggle to root out an insurgency led by the second most powerful wizard of the era, mostly because their own government is already infiltrated and the terrorists have weapons which that same government refuses to allow the use of for ethical reasons.

However, an adult wizard who has completed their Hogwarts education is essentially a demigod compared to muggles. There's no comparison at all.

Basically, in terms of individual threat, a Death Eater is a tiger, a regular wizard is a housecat, and a muggle is a garden skink.

** Such a conflict would be impossible to give a clearcut answer to. Wizards have capabilities that - if employed in a smart manner - a conflict with muggles would be easily avoidable (eg - the ability to teleport in past any countermeasures to mind control the leaders of a nation).

However, the canon wizarding world is not particularly logical - and doesn't seem particularly well versed in muggle culture, far less muggle weapons/tactics.

That's what makes it hard to say what would happen - because so much of it depends on the context, and the fact that wizarding numbers are so low. For instance, if the muggles are the aggressors, catching a handful of wizards in an ambush might be enough to win the 'war' right there and then, given how small the WW is and how few wizards seem capable of really fighting.

On the flip side, the devastation/death/damage even a single wizard could cause is massive.

However, I'm not sure about your idea. I'm not sure we know how many wizards can apparate - nor if it is even possible to apparate with a heavy weight or up in the air. You'd also need to go fairly high up, and have a very big object, for it to really be as devastating as you say. It's enough qualifications that I doubt that it'd be doable - particularly since it's two apparitions in short notice, one into thin air, and the other while in freefall.

** Then another thing to consider is that the war won't be wizards vs muggles. It will be wizards versus muggles with disgruntled squibs and muggleborn who have been chased out of the wizarding world by the bigots, and the prejudiced laws they passed.

So with the help of the muggleborn and squibs wizarding places like diagon alley and hogsmeade are now susceptible to muggle attack as they can show the muggles the way.

So if a war between wizards and muggles occurred it would be incredibly devastating to both sides. And because of the low numbers in the wizarding world I think they would suffer more. I mean at a certain point with enough wizards and witches killed genetic diversity disappears and those who are left will slowly fade to extinction.

*** You should have stopped at “it won't be wizards vs muggles”. Because there is no war to be had, step one is “Wizards apparate into national parliaments, imperio the entire government, and puppeteer them into defeat.”
