** Sounds like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unexpected Friend by CaskettFan5) but there isn't contract I think. They become friends in the second year and Daphne goes to CoS with him and they don't tell anybody. It also has a sequel which was updated just a while ago.

  Complete. During Chamber of Secrets, Harry finds a friend in someone he'd never thought about before. That was the beginning of an experience that opened his eyes to what he had been missing.
