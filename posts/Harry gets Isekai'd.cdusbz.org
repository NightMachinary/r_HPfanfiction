In a fantasy world, he gets magically summoned before the king type of cliché

Edit : Doesn't have to be Harry, any other person in HP is fine as well.


** Shadow of Angmar by Steelbadger [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11115934/1/The-Shadow-of-Angmar]]

It's a Lord of the Rings crossover where Harry is summoned by a King during the fall of Anor.

Only that king is the Witch King. And he had been trying to summon the Master of Death, the dark god Melkor. Sauron's old boss. Oops!

*** LOVE THIS STORY! I can't wait for the next chapter, I think it's gonna be the first one in the Hobbit arc? I kinda got blue balls when the latest one ended up being some historical interlude.

**** Next arc looks to be set when Thorin was a young dwarf. So 60 or so years before the hobbit.

I'm also very much looking forward to it! But i guess we'll have to be patient. The chapters have been yearly or so for the past three so i expect next will be out in 2020. ... Damn, that makes me sad.

** I'd really like to know if there are some good fics like that too.

I'd ike to write one with a HP character thrown to Azeroth, just for the lulz, because this world is insane and the things that populate it are so powerfull than even an OP Harry would run for his life from time to time.

It is not an HP in Azeroth. It is a Menma in Azeroth. The only reason why I recommend it is because the author writes very well, and they are updating it periodically.

  A hero was NOT what he wanted to be after being turned into the Magical society's clean up wizard. He was far too jaded to be one anymore. So when he gets summoned to save yet another world from destruction, needless to say he wasn't pleased one bit. He knows where a hero's path leads, and he wants no part of it. Too bad they aren't giving him much of a choice.
