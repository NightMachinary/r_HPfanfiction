It's been many years since I've read it but basically from what I can remember Hermionie and Ron are married, but Ron is cheating on her with Lavender. Hermionie finds comfort in Harry, but from there I can't remember what happened. Once scene showed Hermionie in the bath pleasuring herself while thinking about Harry. She used magic to mimic the feel of his hands (and I think eventually Harry comes in to take its place). Another scene had Hermionie fall on top of Harry while in a towel.

If anyone knows what I'm talking about, please please link it to me! It has been so long since I read this fanfic, and I would like to read it again for the sentimental value.

Thanks in advance!


** it sounds very familiar. i'm sorry but i forgot what it was as well. good luck!

** Not sure of the fic, but I feel like this needs a NSFW tag bc of subject matter?

*** Nah. NSFW tag is only needed for detailed smut or pornographic pictures.
