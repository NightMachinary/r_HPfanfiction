Where either the annoying protagonist (looking at Sinyk's Harry) or love interest bite off more than they can chew and promptly get murdered.


** Wow... Someone's feeling.... Psychotic!

*** It's just so cathartic. I mean have you read some of them?

Some of them I root for the villain to win, because the hero is just a douche.

***** Here's why.

Let's look at Sinyk's Harry. Attacks people and uses a lordship as an explanation for it. Other ones will get a lordship, or start attacking students who do insults.

Daphne Greengrass, the canon OC. So smart she never gets mentioned in the books and is apparently "neutral", which means they couldn't care less about the +jews+ muggleborns. I can't really say much because the OC (the character is one) doesn't even have a base set of characteristics.

Hermione. Now I'm not a fan of the character, but the authors will use her as a moral compass and right about everything, and apparently the most brilliant student ever. And try to use canon to justify it. Hermione was a smart kid, but she wasn't the sort of talent you see out of Snape in Hogwarts, let alone Dumbledore or Voldemort. She wasn't that great at Dueling, and she wasn't this super athletic girl. She's treated as this sort of goddess, when she's human.

Susan Bones. I mean she gets written as a red-headed Hufflepuff with huge breasts who uses +nepotism+ her aunt to get things done. She has no personality. She isn't even particularly talented in the DA. What we do learn is that her Aunt is frankly a terrible person who does jack shit without a teen's input.

And then you get to the relationship. Seriously, why is it that with Gary Stus, they take their girlfriend to task, and Mary Sues, women are always right. That's a stupid trope. Look at Hermione in canon. She attacked her romantic interest with birds. A good rule of thumb is that if you're outraged if you switch the gender, then it is wrong.

** If you kill the Mary Sue then it ceases to be a Mary Sue. If the MarySue character is capable of dying before the narrative ends then she can't possibly be enough of a world-bending scene-stealing universe-warping Central Focus to qualify for the title.
