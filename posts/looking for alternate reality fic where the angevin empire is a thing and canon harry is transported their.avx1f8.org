I've a vague memory of a fic where harry gets transported accidentally from Hogwarts to a reality where I think Dumbledore is one of about the few wizards capable of anything useful due to magic being far more difficult to use and iirc he's a professor at Oxbridge(Oxford or Cambridge they merge into one for we lowly brits that didn't go to either), also the angevin empire is still a thing, iirc harry looks sort of like a member of the royal family of that reality(not sure if his dimensional double is a prince or it's coincidence deal), I've tried googling but failed miserably, not helped by my total inability to remember where I read it or who wrote it


** I think you're looking for linkffn(Plantagenet by HiBob). It's not exactly as you describe, but I think it matches up well enough.

  Harry found the boy by falling on him. He remembers the blood. Professor McGonagall recognized the boy, even with Harry next to him. His presence would change the future more than anyone could imagine. A completed story.
