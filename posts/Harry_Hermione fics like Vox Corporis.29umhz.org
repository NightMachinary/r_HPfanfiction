  Maybe even with Harry and Hermione being equal in the relationship as they were quite close in that regard in VC (not a major deal to me either way),

Well, that excludes at least 80% of them... Most authors seem to be unable to write the romance without degrading one character or the other in some way.

I don't, generally, read pure romance fics, but here are some of my favorite HP/HG fics (unfortunately, most not complete):

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen][Harry Potter and the Witch Queen]] by TimeLoopedPowerGamer

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEph19 (not 100% sure there will be romance, but it focuses on their relationship/rivalry)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]] by Kwan Li (again 100% sure it's HP/HG pairing, but it's highly likely)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6471922/1/Coming-Back-Late][Coming Back Late]] by alchymie (post-Hogwarts)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and a Temporal Beacon]] by willyolioleo

**** These two fit the bill with a "more dominant Hermione", though neither has updated in a while:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7296047/1/Rule-of-two-dreams-come-true][Rule of Two, Dreams come True]] by Darklooshkin
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8375078/1/Labyrinth][Labyrinth]] by Kroontjespen
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8885902/1/Remedial-Lessons][Remedial Lessons]] by SymphonySamurai: this one's finished, but it's a bit of a hodgepodge.

Actually, here are two more for my list upthread:

- [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]] by Couldson Eagle
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]] by Material Blade: The only Soul Bond fic that I've found to be worth reading. (unfortunately, abandoned, but what's written so far is very good)

I am deliberately focusing on within-Hogwarts fics, since that's what was asked. Also, again, I don't read many pure-romance fics, so I am probably missing a lot.

For Harry being dominant, that would be 90%+ of the "unequal" fics, and I don't know of any that I liked (perhaps because, starting with their canon characters, it's /very/ difficult to make Harry "dominant" without degrading Hermione), but it's different strokes for different folks, so [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/][here's a thread]], nominally about HP/HG pairings where they meet some time after their first year at Hogwarts, but basically every fic linked there fits the bill, which makes me very, very sad.

****** To avoid repeating myself, here's a link to [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/cij8m0d][my rant]] on that thread and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/cijzwk5][the follow-up]]. [[/u/TimeLoopedPowerGamer][TimeLoopedPowerGamer]] also has [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29vns8/anybody_else_find_themselves_unable_to_read/cipe4zt][a good recent post on the topic]].

*TL;DR:* In almost all late-meeting HP/HG fics, Hermione is portrayed as having no real goals, ambitions, relationships, or agency of her own, basically useless and is not allowed to be happy or to achieve anything interesting until Harry enters her life (and after he does enter her life, Harry usually does all the achieving anyway). Meanwhile, Harry spends his pre-Hermione period becoming Very Powerful and having amazing adventures and achievements (often in secret). Once they do become acquainted, Hermione mostly serves as a damsel in distress for Harry to rescue. If she is lucky, she gets to contribute her prodigious research skills to helping Harry become a more powerful wizard.

Unfortunately, even [[/u/KwanLi][Kwan Li's]] /Hogwarts Battle School/ --- which I had listed as an exception to the rule --- seems to be going in that direction.

** If you don't mind reading Hermione's point of view for a change, the fanfic [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=805][/Hermione Granger & the Goblet of Fire/]] fits your description quite well - no smut, the HHr moments are quite subdued throughout. The caveats are that in this story the author focuses much more on Hermione, and that the fanfiction is *not completed*. Still, I think you may want to try it.

Note: /Vox Corporis/ is quite unique in that it manages to showcase a young Harry and Hermione without making them overly powerful or too obsessed with sex. (Not that it is perfect, as it has its weak moments like any other story). Most of the HHr fanfics I have saved on my rec list are post-DH or post-War for this reason. If you manage to find something similar to /Vox Corporis/ I think many people would appreciate your posting a link here. Finally, let me just dump a number of general HHr fanfictions here:

- Shadow Walks

- Notebooks and Letters

- Love Lost, Love Found

- Unlike a Sister

- Biding My Time

- Eighth

- The Cardinal Curses

- [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cheering_charm/BBAB01a.html][Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]

- Teacher's Pet

- All Nights

- Living Past the End

- Blood Bound: a Vampire story

- Forever Knight

- Come Undone

- Welcome to Hogwarts

General rating for the above: *M*

EDIT: [[http://www.harryloveshermione.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=8]] is a good list of recommended fics as well

Good news! The fanfic in question [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][is, in fact, finished, on Portkey]]. Me, I think that it's a unique contribution to the fandom, the only fic I know of that explores how someone like canon Hermione --- lacking Harry's fearlessness and athleticism, but being more diligent, disciplined, and better at magic --- would handle the Tasks. The technicals and characterization and character development are generally good, and the romance works. The downsides are that the fic could probably be edited down by about a quarter of its length to remove plot threads that don't lead anywhere, and I found the ending to be generally too neat, a bit clunky in places, and a bit contrived.

*** Really? I've found robst's stories to mostly be awful. He seems to portray the characters as either immaculate perfections with no flaws or demonic monsters with no desire to do anything else but evil. Also, there is never any buildup to the H/Hr romance in his stories, which is the complete opposite of amazing fics like Vox Corporis. I often think that he is the worst offender of the assumption that Harry and Hermione would be a boring couple with nothing interesting to do whatsoever, which is something that I think is completely false. I can see how that assumption is made though, if a person's only exposure to the paring is through his stories. His characterizations are just so...boring! Anyway, excuse me for my rant, I just don't think that stories by robst should be seen as the standard for H/Hr stories. An author whom is much truer to the characters and makes the best of their dynamic is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/636397/][lorien829]].Every one of her stories that I have read have been amazing and much closer to what OP was looking for when asking for stories like Vox Corporis.

***** If you can read with a grain of salt, robst's stories can fall into the 'so bad they are actually kinda amusing' category. There is sometimes an interesting plot idea, but on the whole they FEEL like a bad Mary sue, with Harry as the flawless stand in.

****** I used to be in this camp. I followed /Harry Crow/, robst's most popular fic, for a while, initially as a guilty pleasure, later to satisfy my morbid curiosity. But, ultimately, the sheer /banality/ of it got to me. I found myself skimming through the chapters on my e-reader when they came in, then skipping them altogether.

There is a number of trainwrecks that I follow for amusement, but /Harry Crow/ isn't a trainwreck. This train is in perfect repair, going, at an impressive speed, /absolutely nowhere/.
