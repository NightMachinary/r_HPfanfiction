** Well the general advice is to start 'in medias res' (in the middle of things). So you really need to open at a pivotal event in your plot--whatever your plot is. Backstory can be woven into the narrative later.

** That entirely depends on how much plot happpens in the childhood. Don't include things that don't move the plot along or have significance in some way. If the childhood is important for reasons, include it. If the Hogwarts Express is important, include it. Otherwise, skip to the important part. You don't even need to include the first few years if they're not vital.

** Neither, the Hogwarts express is a boring 12 hour train ride and you should never start with backstory. The intro to a story is supposed to /hook/ the reader into continuing on, not introduce the major characters or provide background to the story. Unless the train ride is going to include an attack (which could be interesting if it wasn't a way overdone trope) or introduce some sort of mystery, I'd say start somewhere else.

** I would love to read unusual self inserts like this! :) Yes, like marauders era and maybe even tom riddle's era, or you are in the BODY of tom riddle and you choose to become a normal productive society member? :) You could become the world's greatest hero instead of a greatest monster! The irony of the self insert! :)

** I don't think there's anything wrong with starting on the Hogwarts Express. It's where children get a chance to meet each other for the first time, and so as long as they behave realistically, I think it could be interesting. Also, if your SI is going to be an influence on e.g. Snape, it's a good time to signal such to the reader.

The issue with starting on the Express though, is that you've then mired yourself in First year. You'll have to find a way to show a scene on the Express and either then skip to a more interesting year, or zoom through the first few years. I think linkffn(On the Way to Greatness) does this quite well, showing the key bits of early years and then giving the story more space and the stakes rise.

** “Is this the most interesting time in your character's life? If not, why aren't you writing about that instead?”

Fanfiction can be forgiven for being more wordy or less to-the-point than published works, and books can handle more characters better than a movie.

However, if what you're writing is boring, it's likely the reader won't keep reading forever to eventually get to the good parts. So just write the good parts.
