Teresa Mary Riddle is told by a seer that her true love/equal (the same thing in her mind) is in a parallel universe. Being one of the most gifted witches of her generation she won't let such a little thing like time and space seperate them and comes up with a ritual that will send herself to wherever he is.

A Harry is surprised when a girl appears out of nowhere in the decrepit ritual room he was cleaning in Grimmauld place.


** Harry wiped his forehead with the back of his hand and cast a look about the marginally less dusty basement. Cleaning was a pain, but down here, he at least had some calm and quiet.

A gust of frigid wind caused the flames of the gas lamps to dance. He flinched and looked around wildly.

"Sirius?" He laughed nervously. "Are you messing with me?"

Everything was quiet. Just when he began to relax, the wind blew with renewed intensity. Something crackled, and a sharp smell of ozone wafted to his nostrils. The wind rose into a gale, causing him to stagger and shield his face with his sleeve. Then, as quickly as it began, the wind died.

He lowered his sleeve, blinked, then rubbed his eyes. Where before there was only a grimy floor now stood a young woman. Pale-skinned and black-haired, she had the slender build of someone not averse to physical activity. He could see that very well, given that she was starkers.

Her dark eyes scanned the room before focusing on him with unnerving intensity. She opened her mouth as if to speak, but only made a gagging noise. Tilting her head back, she stuffed her fingers down her throat and fished about. Slowly, she pulled out a long yew wand.

"/Bwegh/," she said. "You wouldn't happen to have a handkerchief, would you?"

He gaped.

The woman tapped her foot until sighing and conjuring one with a casual flick of her wand. She dabbed her lips before proceeding to wipe the saliva off her wand. "Standard procedure. Nothing outside the boundaries of the body survives dimensional transfer." She winked at him. "I got very good at stuffing things down my throat."

He gaped.

She frowned a little and glanced down her front thoughtfully. "It was either that or my--"

"I, I get it!" he squeaked, turning away with burning cheeks.

"Finally," the woman said. "I was beginning to fear the inhabitants of your dimension did not use verbal language. So, what do you think?"

He shot her a side-glance. "E-excuse me?"

"About this. Me. I'm gorgeous, right?" She spun around. "I mean, /obviously/, but we're not just talking something vague like standards of beauty here. There's no one more compatible than us in the multiverse--I calculated it arithmantically." She stepped closer and frowned when he retreated. "What's wrong? I'm certain I didn't make any mistakes. Sure, the locator spell wasn't in line with Campbell's Theorem, but Campbell was an old fart who didn't know what he was talking about... My derivative equations proved that..." Her fingers tightened on her wand. "But in case I failed..."

He gulped, not liking her darkening expression at all. "That's not the problem! I don't even know you, and besides--"

"Oh. Where are my manners?" She placed a hand over her chest and smiled proudly. "Teresa Mary Riddle, a pleasure to meet you."

A terrifying realization jolted through Harry's brain. Those aristocratic features. That wand. That /name/.

"Are... are you /Voldemort/?" he choked out, inching backward.

"Where did you hear that?" A flush crept up her cheeks. "It was just a phase--a doodle in my notes--how can you /possibly/ know about it?"

"Er..." Whatever reaction he expected, it wasn't this. An absurd hope welled up inside him. "Are you by chance /not/ interested in taking over the world and immortality and all that?"

She gave him a perplexed look. "Of course I am. Why do you think I'm here? As equals without peer, we'll give rise to a family of the most powerful mages to ever exist. In time, they'll come to dominate the world, and we'll be forever known as their great ancestors." She licked her lips and stalked toward him. "Oh... All this talk got me in the mood. Can we get started right away?"

He stared like a rabbit mesmerized by a snake until a flick of her wand made the buttons of his shirt and trousers pop out. Squeaking, he turned tail and barreled up the stairs. Hexes impacted the walls, making plaster rain on his head, but he somehow reached the ground floor.

"Sirius!" he bellowed at the top of his lungs. "A crazy Voldemort chick from another dimension wants my babies!"

After a moment of silence, Sirius's voice drifted from the kitchen. "Is she hot, though?"

"/Sirius/!"

We do not know if there is any such tradition in Evans family, many witches in HP have flower names and it seems to be a Thing™ in England overall.

The name Harriet has much more sense than the others randomly given to fem Harry considering the meaning of both names derives from germanic /home + power, ruler/ which somehow fits to the plot of the series.

***** Its not really possible. If you keep the Riddle surname then the remaining letters of 'i am lady Voldemort' are "am ay volmot". You can make a first name of Tam or Tammy but neither of those are likely; Tam is a variation on a jewish name and Tammy wasn't used as a name until long after she would've been born.

So beyond me finding using an anagram at all ridiculous let alone of a name you hate, i find it nicer and easier to just keep the same initials. Or you can just do what linkffn(power is control) and linkffn(departure from the Dairy) did and have the Voldemort nomme de guerre be completely unrelated to their actual name

** That's an epic prompt.

Let's see:

__*/x/*__

“So you are the Chosen One.” The gorgeous girl that appeared of nowhere said calmly as if she wasn't dusting herself from where she had landed haphazardly in the midst of the dusty ritual room.

Harry had long since abandoned the broom and his wand was out, pointed at her. He had learned by now to roll with the eccentricities life threw at him. Of course that was done with a wand raised in defense. Or offense depending on the outcome.

He scowled, “I haven't been called that since years. Been there, done that. Who are you, what do you need? And most importantly how did you get in here, bypassing the wards?”

“What wizard uses a broom for cleaning?” She looked at him disdainfully.

“A wizard, who prefers muggle methods of cleaning.” He remarked sarcastically, “Now answer my question!”

He felt an eery sense of familiarity from her which was strange since he was pretty sure he had never seen her before.

The girl quirked a perfectly groomed eyebrow, lush lips curving into a smirk, “Good reaction time at least. That's to be expected of my ‘equal' course. And I can sense a lot of magical power from you. The seer was correct.”

“What?” Harry whispered heart thudding.

“Exactly; equal, soulmate whatever you want to call it. Personally I feel soulmate is sentimental drivel. Anyway, you made me put a lot of effort, better appreciate it. I crossed time and dimensions for you, do you even realise how difficult the runic and arithmantic calculations were? That's not even counting the perfect astronomy placement of the planets and the power needed.” She scoffed.

“What?” Harry croaked mind blanking.

“But of course I am the most powerful witch, so it was a minor issue. My name is Teresa Mary Riddle. Now you could at least give me the name of the man who I crossed universes for.” She continued arrogantly, white teeth glinting as he traced her high cheekbones before glancing at her eyes which flashed red.

“WHAT!” Harry Potter let out a bewildered shout.

She cocked her head, “Are you broken?”

“Nevermind, all the better for me. First things first, we need to train that uncouthness out of you.” She sniffed imperiously looking at his wide eyes and dropped jaw.

Voldemort strode through the halls of the ministry searching for his prey. It has been several days since his connection to Potter was gone, snapped, /severed/, and he needed to find out what happened. To that end, he set a trap, made sure Lucius' son overheard some of his plans - all lies, of course - and then it was just a matter of waiting until the boy slipped and Potter found out. That this would put the Malfoys further in debt to him for his mercy was just a bonus.

So here he was, stalking the ministry, taking the risk of exposure in order to ensure his success. His Death Eaters had failed him one too many times, but even aside from that, he couldn't risk them discovering something they shouldn't. He had to do this himself.

Sure enough, he found Potter frantically running through the corridors, blind to the danger ahead. Despite the severity of his task, he couldn't help but smile as he got into character and dropped his disillusionment charm. Melting out of the shadows like some dark wraith, he greeted his child-nemesis with a sibilant hiss.

“Harry, Harry, Harry... did you really think you could stop me? It was I who guided you to this place. You've merely been following the trail of breadcrumbs I'd laid out for you. It's still not too late. Join me and-” was as far as he got before the teenager slammed into him, grabbing onto his robes.

“Thank God you're here! You have to help me!”

Voldemort blinked. This wasn't part of the plan. Looking at him closer he saw that the boy indeed looked wild-eyed and disheveled-er. Yes, he looked significantly more harried than even that meeting in '92, when he was still just a first year. Before he could smite the whelp for his insolence, he heard the /clack-clack-clack/ of heels on the marble floor. Judging by how his eyes bulged, Potter heard it too.

Before he could protest, the boy grabbed the hem of the Dark Lord's robes and scurried between his legs. Voldemort was quite scandalized! Sure, he was a sadist and a psychopath, but he had no desire to explain why he had an underage wizard under his robes. He had /standards/, damn it!

His outrage fled him as he saw the woman that rounded the corner. It was such an uncanny thing, this feeling. Black locks and brown eyes stared at him from a face whose features he felt he should know. As she got closer, he couldn't help but think that if he'd had a sister, this was how she would look.

She met his eyes fearlessly and he felt her rummage through his thoughts. His occlumentic barriers weren't broken or circumvented, they simply let he through /'As if we're the same person.'/ As she explored his mind, he found himself remembering Potter, who was long gone by now, not that Voldemort noticed. He watched her face morph from indifference, to confusion, to curiosity, until finally settling on wide eyed wonder.

As she spoke “It's you-” that wonder quickly morphed into fury the likes of which he'd never seen "-*/you're/* *the one that was inside my boyfriend!"*

______________________________________________________________________________________________

Harry ran and couldn't help but wonder at the exceptionally odd day he was having, even by his standards. Having a girl step out of a hole in time and space was strange. Having her immediately profess her undying love for him -- even stranger. And sure, he was /grateful/ when she helped him remove what turned out to be a soul-shard lodged in his skull, even if it was excruciating, but he drew the line when she decided to /recreate/ the phenomenon that put it there. /“We'd be closer than anyone! Our souls forever entwined”/ she'd said. He had no desire to see if he could survive another Killing Curse.

So he ran. And as he ran, he began to think of another blight on his life. Voldemort was always trying to kill the people around him. Maybe, /just this once/, he could let him take care of things. Assuring himself he'd made the right choice, he was so busy running, he never felt the spell impact his back.

Tumbling to the ground, trussed up in conjured rope, he came to just in time to see the Dark Lord sprint past him at a dead run.

“It's you or me, Harry!”

... wanker didn't even look back!

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

It was another dreary day, in a dreary house, of the dreary life of one Harry James Potter. The war was over and many of his friends were gone. As the final sentence was rendered in the courts and the wizards set to rebuilding, he found he didn't know what to do with himself. The had been over two years ago.

When it happened, Britain celebrated. The people were out in the streets, swept up in the euphoria of knowing a monster was gone from the world, as if they didn't enable his rise to power in the first place. Those that remained, friends and enemies alike, mourned, healed, and tried to get back to their lives. Back to when things were normal.

It was some time before he realized he didn't have that luxury. There were expectations of him, it turned out. His role in the war had elevated him beyond the common people and placed the burden of their safety on his shoulders.

Even beyond that, the conflict had shaped his entire life. He had grown up on Privet Drive because a murderer saw a threat and took his family. He made his first friends on the edge of life and death and for all the relationships he built, there was always the Grim Reaper looming over him.

He'd tried to integrate, share the experience of being finally free of the nightmare, but, to his horror, without it there was barely anything left.

Ginny and him fell apart. They were still good friends, but they quickly realized that they just weren't what each of them needed in a partner right now. Dating after that was a disaster -- everyone was only interested in “/The/ Harry Potter”. Thankfully, his friends were always willing to lend an ear and commiserate. Not that Ron and Hermione had those problems, the lucky gits.

Eventually, he sequestered himself in Grimmauld Place where he could be miserable in peace and didn't have to be a burden on everyone. Here he could remember Sirius and learn more of a family he never knew. And the décor really lent itself to his flourishing depression!

He was clearing out a ritual chamber /'Who knew there was so much upkeep needed for a house that actively tried to kill you?'/ when the room sparked.

That was all the warning he got before, with the sound of thunder, a flash deposited a newcomer in the middle of the room.

His wand was out and he was already checking for viable cover before the light fully died down. In contrast to that the newcomer /'Woman. Beautiful./ */Dangerous!/*/'/ appeared to care not one whit for the situation she was in.

“Who are you?” he said, his voice steady, calm, and commanding, as she finally acknowledged his presence.

Her look made his heart beat faster. Luscious lips, warm brown eyes, and dark tresses on a fair-skinned face made her appear the image of a classical beauty. It also made him more aware of the threat she represented.

Her smile was proud, almost arrogant “Why, if my calculations are correct, I'd very much like to be your wife.”

That settled it. Today was one of those days...

“...What?” He couldn't help the flat question. This was all too surreal. He watched impassively as she adopted a teasing smile and said “Not very eloquent, are you? You're lucky you're handsome, at least.”

Harry just shook his head. He wasn't having this and raised his wand in case he needed to take down the crazy person. “I'll ask again -- who are you? What are you doing here?”

The woman huffed in annoyance “I believe it's customary to introduce oneself before inquiring someone's name. Or are manners taught differently here?” He ignored the criticism and began to scrutinize her instead, peering at her as if his gaze alone could divine all her secrets. Damn, but he wished he'd learned legilimency.

Despite that particular shortcoming, there was much he could tell - she was sure of herself, unafraid, and, most importantly, had no idea who she was speaking with.

“You really don't know who I am, do you?” There was an undisguised sense of wonder in his voice. How long had it been since he was allowed to be /just Harry/? He found himself relaxing as the woman's mood picked up. “You're very well known then?” Her excitement seemed devoid of the worship one would have for a celebrity. If anything, she seemed happy to learn something about him personally. It was decidedly an odd experience for the young man.

“People like to believe they know me,” he said sullenly “though, yes, they do know of me.” He tried not to sound petulant, he really did, but his fame had always been a sore spot, and it hadn't gotten better with time.

She preened at him as if she'd received some great news and gestured grandly as she began her introduction. “It's only right they should! Did you think I'd cut across time and space for some little pissant?! They called me mad! That I shouldn't try this on the word of some two-bit seer!” she was beginning to look more than a little manic at this point, but Harry was all too used to crazy monologues /“'All this for a soulmate? Think of what you have, be reasonable!'/ Idiots!” you could practically taste the contempt in her words “When it was prophesized to me that my equal was in another world I was devastated for a minute, I'll admit, but, like always, I knew what I wanted and let nothing stop me from getting it. I pooled all my resources -- made the grandest ritual anyone'd ever seen! - and jumped through /the Veil of Death/” She looked proud of herself, pausing to let the tension build “And so here I am-” she said with a smoldering look “-and there you are.”

Whatever response she was expecting, Harry storming away wasn't it. “Where are you going?!” she sounded almost distraught as Harry climbed the stairs. His angry shout of “*/Drinking!/*” did nothing to assuage her. He couldn't handle this and if the world wouldn't slow down he'd just make it go away for a bit.

Now in the house proper, the woman cautiously made her way into the kitchen where Harry was sullenly working at a bottle of Ogden's Finest. As he made no effort to stop her, she gingerly took the seat next to him. “I realize it's a bit much,” she carefully began “but do I truly seem so horrible that you'd try to drown yourself in alcohol?”

At first he made no effort to answer, just stared into his, now full, glass. Then, suddenly, he downed the whole thing before refilling it and staring at it once more. It was minutes before he spoke and the contempt in his voice was something fearsome “I lost my parents before I could even remember and had to fight and kill since I was twelve -- /TWELVE!/ - on the ramblings of some third-rate alcoholic. I've done my duty! /Over and over!/ And now you come to me with /another/ prophecy. Is this why I've had to be alone? Why I can't have anything /normal?/ Because /Fate said so/?!”\\

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Nearly twenty years of hurt and disappointment were held in his words. He hadn't meant to blow up like this, but he couldn't stop himself. Everyone had their limits and he'd simply found his.

Breathing heavily, finally regaining some sense of composure, he was about to apologize to the stranger for his outburst, when he felt a gentle hand on his own.

Looking over at her, what he found in her eyes wasn't pity or an appeal to stay strong -- something he often found in various well-wishers -- but compassion, patience, /understanging --/ Everything he'd ever wanted! -- and it was nearly enough to make him break down again.

She spoke softly now. Careful, as if the words could hurt her “It's because you're exceptional.” She turned to face him more fully, willing him to give her his attention “It's because you're more than most people will ever be that they burden you with their problems and why none of them can stay beside you for too long. I've seen it happen.”

“When I was a young girl,” she continued “I had no one. I was different from everyone else. They could tell and never let me forget it.”

As she spoke, he could see her getting lost in her own memories, but continue “When I discovered magic, that other people had magic! I was thrilled! I thought I'd finally have somewhere to belong!”

Her joy at these old memories sounded so familiar as to be painful to him, yet she kept talking.

“But it turned out to be just another disappointment.” she said morosely “For all it's wonder, magic was just another tool and the people wielding it were just as mediocre as their mundane counterparts.”

Her expression shifted to something unpleasant, as she continued “Worse yet, I was their lesser. Because I was born a woman with no pedigree -- an accident of birth - many saw me as beneath their consideration -- just some toy to use and discard once I'd /“ripened”/ to their liking” she said in disgust.

“I wouldn't have that. Not for these cretins!” there was fire in her words now. Some dark passion that drove people and could incinerate them if they failed to control it “So I resolved to be the best I could be” she said harshly. “I grew in knowledge, skill, and power -- did things most feared to even /dream/ of! From being something to toy with, I became a coveted possession and, finally, a figure of /fear/ and /respect./”

Her pride in herself was evident, forged from overcoming life's obstacles and those who would trample on her.

And just like that... it crumbled.

“... and /utterly/ and /hopelessly/ alone...”

She looked weak now, as she looked at him. Vulnerable in a way only someone baring their heart could be. “I don't know what kind of life you've led, though I can tell you've suffered-” she said, her hand brushing over the scars on his /'I must not tell lies'/

“-but I'd like to get to know you. Not because you're some kind of /chosen one/, but because, /just maybe/, neither of us will have to be alone anymore... please?”

The spell was broken and beyond her beauty and majesty, Harry could see someone just as hurt and lost as he was. As she looked at him imploringly, his response was warm, /kind/ “I think I'd like that” something he hadn't felt in a long time.

Life and a spark of mischief came back to her eyes as she asked “And might I have your name?” fluttering her eyelashes coquettishly.

He huffed in amusement at her quick recovery “My name is Harry James Potter. And what happened to introducing yourself first?” he teased back.

Her smile was cheerful and sincere in a way she hadn't shown yet, as she answered:

“I'm Teresa. Teresa Mary Riddle.”

********* Go ahead! I don't have a profile there or on AO3 so I'd appreciate a link to it, once you have it up. I'm curious what the reception would be, but also kind of dread it, if that makes sense.

Edit: I'm paranoid, so I'd like to clarify some of my intentions with the characterization. Mainly because this portrayal of Teresa fails the Bechdel test /hard/.

For Harry, I was going for a kind of "soldier without a war" vibe. After the events of canon, I couldn't imagine anyone turning out as a well-adjusted /anything/ and Harry, unlike his friends with their loving families, would just go back to an abusive home after every "adventure." They all had it bad - he just had it worse.

For Girldemort I tried to give her some traits of her canon counterpart - lust for power, exceptional skill, and more than a little megalomania and narcissism - just more benign.

So, you end up with someone used to taking what they want, giving "impossible" the finger, but not very socially adept (being surrounded exclusively with assholes and sycophants would do that I imagine). Hence her throwing herself at him. She's got no idea what she's doing, so she just comes on fast and hard.

Thanks for listening to me ramble!

** "Say it again, Harry."

"Fine," Harry groused. "I won't touch anything I don't recognise, and I'll stay the hell away from anything that I do recognize. Other than that, I'll clean it up."

"Exactly," Sirius ruffled his hair, "on you go."

Harry grabbed the old fashioned silver broom from Sirius and walked to the old ritual room. The door was very heavy wood, and the torches on both sides of the door dimmed slightly when he approached it, but quickly brightened again.

"And that isn't ominous at all," Harry muttered to himself.

He grabbed the handle and yanked the door, ready to face whatever horrors lay within. The room greeted him with darkness.

"Alright," he sighed, "let's get on with it."

Broom in one hand, sand in the other, he entered the room.

The torches on the walls lit up, bathing the room in a gentle orange light.

Shelves upon shelves were lined up around the walls, filled with various highly specific ingredients in small quantities kept safely inside glass vials. His eyes scanned the room, looking for anything alive, or anything /not/ alive (you never knew with the Blacks).

Finally, he looked down, at the thick layer of dirt coating the whole room.

And he started sweeping.

"Watcha doin'?"

A high pitched "EEEP!" left his mouth before he could clamp it down, the broom dropped from his hand as he turned around, wand aimed at the source of the previous voice.

"Huh?" was his eloquent response.

"A bit dank and dreary for my tastes... but oh well," the girl that stood before him, naked, regarded him curiously, "now just where have I seen you before?"

"Uh..." Harry was discovering his puberty for the very first time.

She finally noticed his eyes staring at her, as she had been busy checking him up, and suddenly realised the problem at hand. "Boys," she sighed.

Harry thought that the girl should keep sighing forever, whoever she was.

A flick of her wand had her covered in standard Hogwarts robes.

His mouth finally closed with an audible snap.

"Tonks?"

"Really? You see a girl naked and the first thing that comes to your mind is a kitchen instrument?" The girl looked up. "Are you sure he's the one?"

Harry's brain rebooted, finally realising the danger of the situation. "Who the hell are you?"

"Hey, that's not the way to greet a lady! Or... it wasn't back in my England. That sure will get weird. Quick check, does the word 'Fuck' mean anything to you?"

"Your England?" Harry's mind was busy catching up. "What does..."

But then Harry stopped.

No it couldn't be. No, no no no.

"Are... are you a time traveller?"

Unexpectedly, the girl started laughing. "Well, you do seem to possess some decent amount of intelligence, I'll give you that."

"No!" Harry shouted, "You're not supposed to mess with time! Hermione warned..."

"Hermione? Could you mean Herman Granger?"

Harry's mind simply gave up and shut down, waiting for the time when the world made sense again.

"Seems like I broke him," she spoke with mild concern, "Huh, would you look at that."

Harry just stood there, looking straight ahead, his eyes diluted.

She sighed. "Stupefy!" He fell where he stood.

"Sorry, but it'll be easier to carry you like this. I see a door. Let's go."
