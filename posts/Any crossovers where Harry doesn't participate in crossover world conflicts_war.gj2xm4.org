I mean I really hate/tired of this trope. Harry goes to new world where he immediately stops bad guy from killing good guys. And he joins the cause of protagonists and fights for them without any research and taking their word on face value.

Even worse, he heals all of them, gives them unlimited food, gold...etc. solves all their problems but they never trusts him completely.

I want fics where he was powerful but never joins or joins very late in the main conflict. Or where he was like Gandalf only interferes when absolutey necessary but guides the protagonists.

No slash

*** I think I read one like that long time ago. He goes to Westeros and travles to YiTi(that's name of the place I think) and decides to help God Emperors daughter to overthrow her father. He wins war against all the nobles single handedly but when he returns to YiTi capital he learns the truth. I don't want to post spoilers. I don't remember the story name.

  Steve has a routine, and god help him if he's going to break that routine for anyone - yes, that includes you, Tony. Enter a local barkeeper with a penchant for the occult and the gift of good conversation. EWE, not slash, just a couple of guys and a few hundred drinks. Rated for fear of the thought police.

  [Currently Discontinued] Stockholm Syndrome is for idiots and Vayne won't stand for it, even if her captor is going against her expectations, and making her feel almost too at home. She refuses to be fooled by Elise, it's a matter of pride, and right now pride is all she has.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

  Voldie's dead, Harry just wants to be left alone. As if! You don't kill a Baddie like Voldie without people noticing. Now EVERYBODY wants Harry, not just the Quidditch teams. Multiverse cameos, character bashing, Harry/female canon character not telling! . Hetero!Harry don't get used to it from me , no spoilers, non-Epilogue compliant.
