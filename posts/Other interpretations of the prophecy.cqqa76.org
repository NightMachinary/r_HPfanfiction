I just finished reading Promises Unbroken linkffn(Promises Unbroken by Robin) and the prophecy was talking about either:

Neville or Harry or Sirius/James/Remus or Snape. It was a unique interpretation of the prophecy. I've seen fanfictions where it's Neville Longbottom who's the subject but it's not really a different interpretation, is it? Maybe it's Mundungus Fletcher after all, or maybe Regulus Black or Albus himself. In another fashion, the prophecy could be talking about Voldemort himself.

Any recs?


** I vaguely remember one where Hermione and Daphne killed Voldemort, they had previously been called Harry's left and right hand.

** Hmm, I'll have to go back to look for them, but I'll leave a synopsis of each here.

Dumbledore is the dark lord and elevated Harry as a fellow defeater of a dark lord. He cannot live in glory while Harry lives and Harry cannot live while he lives.

The Power he knows not was sharing information.

Seventh Horcrux did it as a joke, but Ron Weasley was the child of the prophecy.

  When Harry and Cedric grab the Cup, they are transported to a graveyard, where Harry witnesses the resurrection of Lady Voldemort... who isn't quite what he'd expected. For one, she isn't trying to kill him. For another, she doesn't seem to like the Death Eaters either. Harry/fem!Voldemort.

  Sirius Black remained the Secret Keeper and everything he feared came to pass. Ten years later, James and Lily live, Harry attends Hogwarts, and Voldemort remains...yet the world is different and nothing is as it seems. AU, updated for HBP.
