Vodemort kills Potters. Custody of Harry goes to godfather Sirius. Sirius gets then branded as criminal unfit for custody. Malfoys move quick or there is enough time before accusations of deatheater ship. Beatrix is known deatheater and Andromeda is legally no longer a black. Therefore Narcissa ist closest family. Harry goes to Malfoys on ministry orders and Dumbledore has to give in (for whatever reason).

Have I overlooked closer(legal) ties? Could this work?

I'd assume that custody would go to the Dursleys after Sirius. Sirius had custody because he was appointed as guardian. I'm pretty sure, though I'm no lawyer, that custody reverts back to closest living relative after a guardian in UK law. Custody is not given to the family of the guardian.

Plus canon did take the route of the government giving custody to the Dursleys when Sirius was thought to be a Death Eater. The ministry knew full well where harry was.

It'd take a hell of an AU for a government to grant custody of a child hero to any family remotely associated with the words "dark" and "death eater", even if they have good excuses. Plus Dumbledore probably still exists in your fic.

**** In which case, wizarding law granted the Dursleys custody in canon? Hell, Fudge even liked it and was worried when Harry didn't want to go back.

#+begin_quote
  “Ah, you're worrying about the reaction of your aunt and uncle?” said Fudge. “Well, I won't deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to take you back next summer as long as you stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holidays.”

  “Now, now, I'm sure you'll feel differently once you've calmed down,” said Fudge in a worried tone. “They are your family, after all, and I'm sure you are fond of each other --- er --- /very/ deep

  down.”

And again, what government would give the boy-who-lived to someone remotely associated with Voldemort?

***** Was that third book when Dumbledore was still a saint? It strongly indicates the ministry accept the guardianship, but it could still be just a case of Dumbledore says.

On the other hand surly they would have tried something in the future book if it wasn't squeaky clean.

Meh let's go with goblin contracts /s

****** The only way you can make it believable is that Dumbledore dies in the war or they kidnap Harry from the Dursley's. Otherwise it would be difficult to digest.

** I think that's one of the reasons why Dumbledore put Harry at the Dursleys, because he considered it better than ending up at the hands of someone who might be a death eater

** I think it's a reasonable path, but I'd recommend tweaking the backstory a bit for the Malfoys. Namely, to make this believable Lucius has to be (generally) above suspicion as a Death Eater IMO, because he'd have no control of the Ministry at that point in canon.

One option there could be to have him lead some sort of unaligned faction, that Voldemort wanted set up so that he could manipulate them in some way? That way the Ministry - even if Dumbledore tried to stop it - might not want to start a conflict with a still powerful Malfoy power bloc at that point.

An alternative option could be to push it a few years forward in the timeline - and have the Malfoys discover how the Dursleys treated Harry. With some planning - perhaps they find out that Sirius is Harry's godfather and should have been guardian, and by this point much more firmly back in grace in the Ministry, they could be able to pull the same sort of legal fiction you put in the OP - with Dumbledore getting put on the defensive due to what's been done to Harry + the ammunition it'd give to the anti-muggle wizarding block.

Those are my thoughts, at least.

*** Tbh I assume I assume he already had a power block to get his imperious defense through the wizengamot.

I think, as stated elsewhere, only with a deal with Dumbledore would this be possible.

Or maybe invent a big distraction for Dumbledore (maybe the same reason why he didn't push for a trial for Sirius?), Like the spirit of Voldemort popping up and Dumbledore hunts him east Europe or something.

**** The way I see it is that he's rich enough and influential enough to avoid being thrown in Azkaban - but this is the phase of the Ministry where anti-Death Eater sentiment was super high and pseudo-martial law was still there. So Malfoy would be laying low if he's as connected to the Death Eaters as he is in canon, at least publicly speaking.

A distraction with Dumbledore might work, or having a more pliable Minister earlier on. I still think it'd need a tweak for what the Malfoys were doing if you go with an early route, or that a few years later would fit better.

***** I thought about the Malfoys suddenly going all progressive or something, literally leaving the sinking ship. "I was only racist because Voldemort told me to" and "it's all blurry, imperius you know, but that Nott fellow I remember him clearly. Oh yes of course I own a majority of this business, but that has nothing to do with that"

** Personally I don't find it believable at all that custody would flow from the godfather to the rest of his family. If Sirius is unavailable, the Blacks ought to lose all claims.

Of course, you could easily solve this by making James the son of Charlus Potter and Dorea Black instead of Fleamont and Euphemia. That way you can easily make it look like you're following up on James's side of the family (ya know, the pureblood wizards instead of the muggles) for custody rights.
