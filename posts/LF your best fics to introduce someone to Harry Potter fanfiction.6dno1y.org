Looking for your favorite stories. The ones that kept bringing you back or that you remember years later. No requriments for theme or pairings if any. Would prefer completed or actively updated fics, don't want their first taste to be left unfinished.


** From when I saw the "pick 5" thread but was too late to post, covering a good range of genre and length, though tending to around 100k.

linkffn(I Know Not, and I Cannot Know--Yet I Live and I Love by billowsandsmoke) - Shorter, canon-compliant fic that highlights "behind the scenes" interaction and develop two really strong characters (I do have a soft spot for Luna).

linkffn(Seventh Horcrux by Emerald Ashes) - I don't see how any top 10 list could leave this off, as the best in comedy HP fanfic has to offer (alongside nonjon, they're pretty much tied for me). Absolutely hilarious and extremely well-written.

linkffn(The Unforgiving Minute by Voice of the Nephilim) - I think this is best described as an action fic, with an intro to a darker Harry for people new to fanfiction. Tons of magic and great fight scenes. Also an intro to time travel AUs.

linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble) - A beautiful mystery/noir/drama fic with as twisted a romance as you could get, and another favourite character of the community, Daphne Greengrass. Just some quality quality writing, though it is darker too, in a different way to The Unforgiving Minute.

linkffn(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) - the only incomplete fic here, and also the longest. Also the only fic with an OC, which is pulled off to perfection here. Definitely more slice-of-life and not very magic-y at all, but also very close to canon compliant.

There are definitely some other great fics out there, but I think the 200k+ epics are a little too much for an easy intro to fanfic - it's quite the commitment to start one of those for someone new. And oftentimes, quality writing is knowing to not write too much anyways.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

** Amazed no one has mentioned linkffn(6892925) yet. Simple divergence from canon that's teased out over the course of the story and is an absolute gut puncher at multiple points. This might as well be an alternative Turing Test, because if you don't tear up at least once while reading it, you're a robot.

** I have three that pulled me in. All are complete.

linkffn(Just a Random Tuesday) - A three-chapter fic exploring a random Tuesday in the life of McGonagall. Mostly humorous but explores some of the relationships between faculty, most notably McGonagall and Snape. Takes place in fifth year.

linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair) - A brief one-chapter that's surprisingly poignant. Dennis Creevy finds his brother's old camera and uses it to take photos of the survivors from the battle at Hogwarts.

linkffn(A Black Comedy) - Probably suggested elsewhere but this is one of my all-time favorites because it ticks a lot of my boxes. Solid combination of humor, plot, action, and feels.

** If you're looking for something to take "baby steps" into fanfiction, then one of the best longer fics is "Not From Others," which tells /Deathly Hallows/ from Ginny's point-of-view.

There's also "Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection," which tells /Order of the Phoenix/ from Luna's point-of-view (this one is pre-HBP, so there are some things that don't quite hold up to canon, but still, credit must be given where it is due)

** A lot of people recommend canon compliant one-shots when they're asked this question but I just don't agree with that. Sure, it can serve as a nice first taste but fanfiction is about something different for me.

It's about Alternate Universes and simple 'What If' questions, it's about what-could-have-beens and what-should-have-beens, about silly wish fulfillment and OTPs.

I realize that not everyone sees it that way but that's my opinion and that's why i personally read fanfiction.

With that said, here are my favorites.

linkffn(5904185) Emperor. I think this story embodies what fanfiction can be. It had a fantastic premise and it started of amazing and while it still had it's moment in later chapters (I'm a particular fan of Ginny's plotline and character development) it basically went to shit. That said, it's still one of my favorites simply because the author tried to do something radically different and epic in scope and mostly succeeded with drawing me into his story even if i'm dissatisfied with where it went.

linkffn(5353809) Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived. I don't think i need to say much abouit this one. Without a doubt one of the best twin!Harry stories out there. It died before its time but it's still fantastic. (While we're at twin/WBWL stories, there's obviously 'Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin' but i don't think that's a good introduction because of the way it plays with tropes.)

linkffn(11762850) Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux. I wasn't sure about recommending this one to someone new to fanfiction but when I thought about it I couldn't really think of a valid reason not to. This story is different in that the author put a lot of work into research and while the plot at first seems fairly straightforward it gets a lot more interesting as it goes on and is markedly different from a lot of fanfiction in the way it detaches its main plot point from canon while still actually following all the stations of canon. It's quite remarkable really. Also has an amazing author who puts a lot of work and thought into his work.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A difference in the family]] is an absolutely incredible canon compliant telling of Snapes life from birth to death. its long enough to act as a stand alone novel. It's actually one of my favourite stories and I read it parallel to the series every time I re-read.
