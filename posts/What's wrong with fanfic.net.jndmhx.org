FF.net isn't working for me? I'm receiving updates but can't view the stories? It's says URL broken for all of them. Can anyone tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?


** Since Saturday ffn has had trouble displaying newly uploaded chapters. So far Fiction Press hasn't acknowledged the problem.

**** There's the help button on the website that should lead to a support email, you can also tweet at Fiction Press, but from what I've heard no one has gotten a response from them.

However, there are also reports that the app is functioning and you can see the new chapters there. I can't confirm this as I don't use the app myself.

****** You do you, though there's nothing wrong with reading and writing fanfiction. The symbol of it is just two Fs on a blue background so people probably won't know what it is if they don't use it themselves.

******* Fanfiction doesn't get a good rep, I'm more concerned with my parents seeing and how they'll feel.

I just wrote an email to their support team. Let's see how they respond.

********** In early 2018, there was a period of several weeks when...I want to say that new chapter notifications wouldn't go out, but looking at their Twitter feed, it might have just been persistent site crashes. That was when I started cross-posting to AO3.

** I just checked and I'm still able to read on the website. If you haven't already, I recommend downloading the FFN app. I've never had issues with it crashing or ads being placed in the middle of the stories.

** FFNet, while having some of the best stories, has a long history of being kind of, well, complete and utter crap.

** Get the app, the site has had issues ever since the week end, but so far, the app is doing just fine for updated fics, at least for me.

Still, Fiction Press has been very passive this last year and they did not even acknowledge the issue despite people complaining on their twitter. No response, nada, niet. Guess that's what happens when a site is left to rot by its admins smh
