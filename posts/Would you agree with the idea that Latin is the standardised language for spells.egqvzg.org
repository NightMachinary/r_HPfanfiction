I'm working on a fic and I'm unsure of whether I should use only Latin for the spell incantations or branch out into other languages. I know that there are a few (/very/ few) spells in canon that don't use Latin, but it's always been my headcanon that incantations are just used as crutches to learning the feeling behind the magic of the spell. If they /did/ mean anything, then it should work if, instead of /Wingardium Leviosa/, people used /rise up/. What are your thoughts on this?


** My head canon is that spells are usually based on dead/ old languages and that Latin is used a lot for western/ European wand magic because Romans destroyed most druids and replaced them.. but there's probably spells in celtic, Germanic, Arabic, Asian, Greek languages.

I guess you could go with mainly Latin if your stories has Romans as the ones who mainly developed and spread wand magic..

** In PS, we're told that accidentally getting the incantation wrong can result in your casting an entirely different spell inadvertently. In HBP, we see Harry cast Sectumsempra without knowing what it would do.

Both of these point towards the objective nature of spells. Magic is not an expression of the caster's subjective intent, it is a skill which you must learn and which you can get wrong. Which is a far more aesthetically pleasing system than an intent-based one, too: a system where knowledge, skill and talent are the keys to power, not your ability to merely /want something/.

******* Divination is defined as 'the practice of seeking knowledge of the future or the unknown by supernatural means'. Which means the future /is/ the purpose of the practice.

But if spells are already premade, ready to be discovered, why would we need to know the future? The spells have already been made, so we should see the past, in which Divination is useless. And if we do see the spells being used in the future, why should a seer change the future just to introduce a spell earlier than it should be? Unless the seer is the one to introduce it, but then that would imply that the future is also already set in stone, which destroys the purpose of divining anything in the first place.

I should mention (to avoid the barrage of downvotes that I'm sure I'll be facing otherwise), I'm not saying you're not right. I'm just presenting my opinion so as to find a clear answer (or as clear as we can get anyway)

******** I kinda feel like you proved my point with the first sentence of your reply. But then again, it makes sense for people to focus on the 'predicting the future' aspect of Divination, because if there's one thing above all others that Humans fear, it's the unknown; and what's more unknown (and indeed, unknowable) than that which hasn't happened yet. So it makes perfect sense for countless individuals to dedicate their lives to catch even the slightest glimpse of future events, for either selfish or selfless ends.

Saying that, I feel that it does a disservice to the aspects of Divination not related to foresight: be it discerning truth from lies, determining the location of lost and forgotten objects, or other similar endeavours.

** My theory is this: Latin isn't necessarily a "crutch" per se, but a way of forcing your focus.Magic is based on intention and learning to say your intention in Latin helps to focus on that intention. Much the same way that magic works in the Inheritance Cycle. It's possible to cast magic without saying anything, but magic in its very nature is wild and unpredictable.

The magic in the Inheritance Cycle is a lot more wild and the slightest distraction could cause havoc. Wizarding magic is a lot easier to control, but I think it works more or less the same way. By saying Wingardium Leviosa, your mind, and therefore your magic is focus on making an object levitate.

** Well, Avada Kedavra is Aramaic. Imo, England was just more influenced by the Romans than other cultures. I think each culture made spells in their own language, although it's frankly strange that there are no spells in English - did they not evolve since the Roman times? Or did they just make Latin the "traditional" language for spells?

Someone wrote above that the spells shouldn't be in the language you speak, but that would mean the Romans weren't able to use spells. I speak Hebrew, and I feel that Jewish wizards would certainly have spells in Hebrew and Aramaic (like in our religious books, they'll insist on using these languages). Also, don't you think many people (in pop-culture) prefer to make spells in Hebrew/Arabic/Latin and so on because... Well, it sounds magical to them? Most books use a foreign language for magic /just/ because it sounds more magical.

So, in conclusion, I'd say spells can be in whatever language - but maybe England is encouraging spell crafters to use Latin.

About the Latin spells in canon, many of the spells are in "bad" Latin, so maybe you need a specific rhythm or syllables.

So maybe not "rise up", but "ra-ee-se oo-pah".

That's my two bit of a disorganized text wall, enjoy!

** My magical theory fanon is that casting a spell is like making a piece of pottery. If you are practiced at making the piece of pottery you can shape it into a bowl or whatever without instructions. Just as someone who is practiced with magic can cast a spell (shaping the magic) without an incantation. A person who doesn't know a spell can still cast it properly if they follow the instructions properly, such as Harry casting levicorpus. Creating a spell probably starts with the desired outcome, figuring out how to shape the magic to get that effect, and then creating the wand movement and incantation. I imagine arthirmantic (fanon version studying magical properties of numbers) principles guide the number of syllables in creating the incantation.

As per language, I like to have wand and incantation magic be a roman invention, spread through the Roman empire. Countries that were controlled by Rome will have by and large, lost much of their local magical traditions over the centuries and use latin incantations and wanded magics. Countries that were colonized/invaded/culturally westernized later will use wands and incantations to a lesser extent, while still retaining strong ties to their ancestral magic (Japan, India, South American countries, etc). In countries with weaker ties, I would have old incantations be latin, but newer developed spells be in the local language. The magical Britain of Harry Potter still has very strong ties to its roman influences as seen in the sheer number of Roman names among witches and wizards. I wouldn't expect to ever see a British wizard invent a spell in any language other than bastardized latin.

** Spells aren't Latin. Most of the time it's some bastardized form of it mixed with English. And in some cases it's not Latin at all like with the killing curse.

It's canon that spells need to be created. And you don't need to know what a spell does in order to use it. We see this in HBP with Snape`s spells. I always imagined a spell creator somehow writes down their intent with the help of Arithmacy and/or runes. Then the creator has to find a wand motion and an incantation that fit with his Arithmetic formula and after that he does some ritual that binds the whole thing into magic itself so that anyone can use it.

That's the best explanation I could find for myself if I only look at canon. Some fanfiction explanations I've seen are much more elegant, but they contradict the books...

** There's no reason why the universe should decide that a specific word in a specific butchered language should have any effect. My headcanon is that the rhythm pattern of the syllables has to match with the pattern of the spell, but you can use any incantation with the right pattern, people just use latin because it's traditional. Other languages work just fine, but a dead language is preferred so that you don't accidentally say an incantation and cause people to think you're casting a spell. When you invent a new spell you can use arithmantic calculations to figure out the optimal geometric wand movement and rhythmic syllable pattern and choose a word that fits and also describes what the spell does, to make it easier to remember.

**** Yeah, I dont think colonization (and even population changes in the Old World) had the same impact in the Magical world as it did in the Muggle one. For starters, wizards would have been on par technologically... or magically, in this case. Wizards can also heal Muggle diseases pretty easily, so the epidemics brought by Europeans would not have affected Wizard Natives nowhere near as much as they did Muggles. They can also travel the planet quite easily, so other than Americas, I dont think any of the geographical discoveries in Africa, Far East, Oceania and India were much of a surprise for Wizardkind.

Only way I could see Europeans gaining dominance over Natives in the Magical sense is:

A. Immigration towards a /land of opportunity/. I could see a ton of Muggleborns and even Half-bloods wanting to leave Pureblood dominated Europe. As Muggle immigrants grow as well, so would the number of European Muggleborns, eventually leading to a cultural shift. This would be really obvious in places where Muggles almost fully replaced the Natives, like NA and Australia.

B. ICW launching a war on Native Wizards, perhaps even aiding Muggle colonization attempts. This especially in Americas, and to a lesser extent Africa. I doubt the wizards in those places would have been okay with both surrendering their autonomy to a foreign political body /and/ adopting a monumental law as the Statute of Secrecy. ICW could have easily went into a frenzy when Native Americans and Africans told them to go eff themselves. The resulting ICW victory would have also lead to a cultural shift.

I really headcanon Natives having a strong influence in NA and Australia and being pretty much unaffected by Colonization everywhere else.

it seems to be popular in fanon that most spells come from older languages; i think there was a scene in The Arithmancer series explaining it, and Hermione experimented with creating a spell in Sanskrit? i might be remembering it wrong.

in any case, it wouldn't be logical for spells to only work in Latin/Greek even in canon; magical culture, in canon, exists all over the world. including places where usage of Latin likely wouldn't be popularized or taught at all.

** You seem to be asking two questions here. One, if most spells are in Latin; and two, if incantation can be substituted (rise up instead of Wingardium Leviosa).

In answering your second question, I would have to say that canonically we know that incantation is very strict - saying it differently can create a different spell (Flitwick's buffalo anecdote) and silent-casting needs to keep the incantation in your mind regardless of vocalisation. From a strict canon-interpretation, substitution isn't possible, but this is fanfiction. If you want to have substitution, make something up. Perhaps Arithmantic equations are both Numerology (as in Canon) and Spell-Crafting (as in Fanon) and each spell has a sum total (eg. 90 = Incendio) and so long as the Arithmancy adds up to the same number, the Intent, Power, Motion, and Incantation sections of the equation can be changed about as needed.

22.5 + 22.5 + 22.5 + 22.5 = 90, and so does 15 + 25 + 30 + 10, for example. The first could use small amounts of power, intent, and motion and need Incendio to work, but the latter could use more power and be able to use 'Burn' instead.

Regarding your first question on the primacy of Latin, we know that the language isn't universal. There's some Greek, some Aramaic, etc, so it's not absolute that all spells must be in Latin, meaning they either are because people want them to be, or they aren't and we simply only get mainly the Latin spells due to Harry's viewpoint. We also know that there are different magical practices for different cultures (eg. there's an African school that doesn't use wands). Thus, it's possible that there is cultural variation in magical incantations and we just get Latin because Wizards want to speak Latin or because British people mostly do Latin and Harry is an incurious bastard - he'd never bother learning if India did it differently despite the fact that he'd only have to walk to the common room to ask Parvati.

I could see it being an ICW-enforced widely-accepted convention for understanding and convenience though, like Latin Names for Organisms. For anyone reading this who doesn't know, there's a universally used system for naming creatures where each one is given a name in Latin, so every scientist in the world has a single thing to call a creature that they'll all understand and know to use without having to experience multiple 'wait, what the hell is a pigeon?' type questions. The creatures still have names in individual languages (pigeon, colm, duif, duva, taube, etc) though, but the Latin name is almost always used in internationally professional scientific contexts.

If everyone casts most of their repertoire in butchered Latin (maybe chosen because the Romans really got around or invented wand-magics, or perhaps because the ICW headquarters could be in Italy specifically or somewhere in Europe generally and the founders were thus culturally biased?), then firstly everyone knows what other people mean when they refer to the 'Cutting curse' or the 'Killing Curse' or 'Wingardium Leviosa' or whatever incantation/name is used which makes conversation easier than having "I want to use the cutting curse" - "Oh, which one? The French, the Italian, the Russian, etc etc." and secondly the ICW populace will be able to learn a new spell - that a spellcrafter would want to get popular enough to be widely used or noticed specifically by those to whom it would be useful so they're paid well for their work - more easily than if it were in, say, a language that the majority have no familiarity with like Japanese where only the Japanese would be able to cast that spell easily. They might still have some small spells or spells left-over from the old days in non-Latin languages, but broadly later Spellcrafters could just be encouraged to use Latin by ICW regulation. People (like tinkering Dark Lords) might also invent spells in certain languages to better protect the incantations and keep the spell for themselves. It makes sense with the canonical 'Incantation is very strict' rule - you'd want to make learning and pronouncing that incantation as easy as possible for as many people as possible to allow for standardisation and interaction.

Apologies if this is a bit long. Worldbuilding is a fun hobby of mine and I can talk at length about this sort of thing.

**** Cool. Happy to help. Just an addendum - if Latin isn't a nigh-universal practice or formalised standard, it is possible that we'd get convergent spells being designed. So, 'Wingardium Leviosa' would be the latin-ish levitation spell, while French might have a spell in their language, separately developed, that just does the same thing.

Come to think of it, spells'd most likely be in other older languages that aren't colloquially spoken for simple safety reasons. Otherwise you might say 'Rise Up' and start floating to the ceiling - accidental magic being a thing and all. You probably aren't too likely to say something like Avada Kedavra or Wingardium Leviosa unintentionally in conversation.

** I always thought that magic itself has no language, rather wand movements + spells form sort of language with which to communicate the meaning. They train so that specific wand movements and pronunciation evokes certain mental state, prepares ones magic and adjusts feelings required to perform a magical task. Hence spells.

Even when learning a new spell the wand movements and incantation forms the basis for understanding and being able to perform the said spell.

Someone who understands magic enough, with practice and training can learn to use any wand movements and incantations they like. But even most skilled wizards don't bother with it as magical "lingua franca" is just that useful.
