So, I like serveritis (tell me if I'm spelling that wrong. I'm still relatively new to the HP fanfiction stuff) but I also like romance between Harry and a girl character. So I'm looking for a good mix of both. Got any suggestions?


** Best one that I know of is the R trilogy by greengecko. Honestly, I don't like Severitus at all, but once you get past the wishwashy premise of it, it gets pretty epic. linkffn(1795399)

*** Thanks! I didn't like severitus at all either, at first, but I've grown to it. I have to be in a certain mood though.

**** The rec is *really* good (it's my all-time favorite fic), but you should know going in that the third fic has been abandoned. It's about 90% complete (bumps up to around 95% if you're willing to read missing chapters from the author's blog). For me, it's not a big deal, but it's /a lot/ to commit to without a proper resolution.

** This is an excellent and classic Severtius, but it's mostly gen. Then again, it's absolutely worth reading.

**** Aunt Petunia gets cancer and Vernon demands that Harry fix it with his magic. I don't want to give away the plot beyond that and idk how to do a spoiler cover, so I hope that jogs your memory.

***** That sounds familiar, but I thought that entire plotline was from the Psychic Serpent trilogy. I read the bulk of the fics I've read over a decade ago, and with rare exception, it's all kind of blurred together at this point.

****** Yeah I totally get what you mean. When I thought of this one I had to do a little searching to figure out which one it was. I think there was a whole slew of 'Harry dealing with cancer' plots all around the same time, and idk which one started it off (there was another with the same idea, and he ends up dating Parvati. I vaguely remember the title being a two word spell, R___ C____ or something). This one is one of the better of that trope though.

******* It doesn't help that I have a very narrow tolerance for fics, so most of what I read was sort of similar anyway. I spent, conservatively, eight months trying to remember enough about a fic to post a thread about it, and randomly found it looking through, like, a Dropbox folder where I used to save HTML files from HPFF.
