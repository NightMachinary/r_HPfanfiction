/[Another old fic I had planned out]/

Though no Seer, Lavender Brown's skill with the art of Divination is in a league of its own. In certain circles, one may argue her gifts to acquire information through the magical art is far more useful than the prophecies of Seers like Trelawney.

A sudden burst of confidence in her skills (as well as plain curiosity) causes Lavender to scry about the events in the graveyard shortly after Cedric Diggory's death. The young woman horrified at the information she received...

Yet, a deep rage settled within her as well. Righteous and on the behalf of her classmate, a boy she realised she knew very little of. Incensed he'd seemingly ended up as persona non grata of the most evil wizard the world had ever known...

Summer came and went, but Lavender did not spend it relaxing like Parvati did. Her... "friend" was the target of a Dark Lord, one the world refused to believe had returned. She could not see far enough ahead to know what he would do specifically, worrying her that he was planning things in the shadows, but a dark cloud had settled over the future. Nowhere was it bleaker than around Harry himself.

Herself further incensed at the treatment her classmate was being given in the Prophet, and further ahead seeing actual attacks and further slander in his future, Lavender could not help wanting... no NEEDING to protect him. Especially with further, admittedly invasive, peeks into his secretive past.

All further solidifying her resolve to ensure nothing bad befalls him ever again...

So when fifth year arrived, a young lady stopped Harry James Potter on the Hogwarts Express (shooing away a slightly miffed Cho Chang) to let Harry know the intelligence and resources she'd gathered on his behalf, and to offer her services in his crusade against the Dark Lord going forward.

The future is forever in flux, as an avid user of Divination, Lavender Brown knew this better than most. But she could see a path to a brighter future for her Harry and her people.

And she would trample over whomever she had to, to get them there...

** That sounds really lovely. Better use of Lavender Brown is always welcome in my books.

** Funnily enough, although it's slammed in canon and fanfiction, all divination across all the books comes true. Mostly not how you would expect it, but it does come true in some form.
