Ok, so who's the jerk who recommended this story on another thread? If there's something I hate more than poorly written Fanfic (whether it has good ideas or not) it's good, engaging Fanfic that's abandoned without conclusion or explanation. I started getting this feeling of dread around chapter 10 when I realized it wasn't a bunch of fics split up by year, but had to keep reading anyway. I can't bring myself to read the last chapter because I skipped ahead to the end of it and saw it wasn't complete.

On another note, I've been reading fanfic for a long time (since just after GOF was published, if I remember correctly) and never came across this one before - what other good, older fics have I missed?

Because I'm old-school, I prefer canon pairings, and because I've read so many of them, I'm a little tired of canon rehashes, unless they're really well done with good characterizations and interesting changes that make sense within the HP Universe. I tend to not read slash fics, and poor writing is an immediate "Next!" for me. (I recently read what was otherwise a decent story, but the author used 'midst' 3 or 4 times in the span of two paragraphs, and it wasn't even used correctly at least once. Closed the tab.

I've been following 'Hollow Ash' which is an awesome story, as was the prequel. I also recently read "You Don't Have to Stay" and all of AnnerB's other posted fics and absolutely adored them (including 'The Changeling' which I didn't think I would enjoy, but really did.)

Some of my favorites over the years have been anything written by Jeconais, or posted on his site (Jbern has great stories and characters, but the second-person story took some getting used to.)

So help me out: what are the other good fics I've apparently overlooked in the last ten years?

*** Its prolly my favorite Hary has a twin who is the BWL trope, since so so many of those go with Harry being abandoned at the Durselys and forgotten about until hogwarts. Which while theres a small number I like of that type, still seems wildly out of character for Lily at the very least, since pretty much the main thing we know about her is she was willing to die for her baby. To then the very next day be willing to throw away one of said babies just seems unlikely.

** If you don't read in incompletes, you're missing out on some of the best stuff out there. You could easily look at them as a long, long, /long/ slice of life fic, or something where you're supposed to imagine your own ending, or just assume all end with Voldemort defeat and happily ever after, lol.

After I finish a fic, the ending isn't what sticks out in my mind. It's the best scenes and conversations and startling ideas. I guess it's otherwise for you, but it's so crazy to me to skip ahead and stop reading a fic you really enjoy just because it's not wrapped up with a bow at the end. What about all the parts you could've loved from here to there?

*** I honestly couldn't disagree with this more lol. Starting an old fic I've never read before, only to realize it hasn't been updated in 5 years not because it's finished but because it's incomplete/abandoned, is the most maddening thing to me.

To me, it would be like reading an amazing book, and at some point half way through just saying "ahh, whatever" and putting it down and never finishing it.

**** DLP's "Work By Author" section, where the chapters are posted, is a forum for writers to receive feedback on their work (like betaing by community, covering both content and technical writing). Santi never uploaded them to a fanfiction host because he did not consider them ready for consumption by the general public, being first drafts not the finished product.

He always planned to incorporate the feedback given in WBA to edit the chapters into a final form then post them. But he said that given the choice between editing draft chapters to make them ready for posting and working on the draft of the next chapter, he would always choose the latter. So the chapters just stayed in draft form permanently.

  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

***** Just for reference, I thought the end of Alexandra Quick was great and very in-character. The author knows how to write character flaws well.

Some readers expect perfectly reasonable characters, I find that unrealistic and fake-feeling.
