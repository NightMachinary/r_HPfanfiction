** Summary: Twenty years after the end of the Dark War and the world has changed. There is no such thing as a hero, and if there was, Harry Potter certainly would not be one. A dark accounting is forged in the truth and tragedy buried amidst the ruins of ascension. This story is a one shot, but is well worth reading.

*** I doubt it. Considering the fic is about two years old, and the author has some of the best stories in the fandom, which have been recommended in this subreddit more than a few times.

*** Not at all, Joe is now a published novelist as well as having multiple ongoing fics that have huge fanbases compared to this.
