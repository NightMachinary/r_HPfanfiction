** What do you like about it? The OP!Harry, the harem aspect, the runes?

I ask because it is hard to know what to recommend without more info.

*** Well I like all of the above, but the main aspect was how the fic was written. I simply wanted to give an example with my request, I meant the high quality, thought out writing, character development etc. Main interest out of the mentioned would be a combination of OP!Harry and runes, as it's not op that's just raw power, it's something that has reason and requires some effort, and he still definitely makes mistakes.

**** To be honest, I'm not sure about other (good) runes fics.

For good character development and well thought out plots, though, i could make a few reccs. Hopefully one of these strikes your fancy.

It is a story of growth and maturation.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.
