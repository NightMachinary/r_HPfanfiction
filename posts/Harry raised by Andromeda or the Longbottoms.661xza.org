I have read a lot of fics where it is mentioned that Harry was supposed to go to Andromeda or the Longbottoms but I can't remember reading any where he actually does.

*** I know of one fic where Tonks finds Harry in a park, sleeping and he ends up at the Tonks house. Dora is the same age as him in it.

Bu for the life of me I can't remember the name of the fic.

*** As far as I know sadly there are no fics that match your request. The best I could offer is a sane Bella raising Harry but that fic never got anywhere (current progess has Harry in Bella's care for less than a month and it has a strange, very OOC Lupin thrown in the mix).

There are few fics where someone else besides Sirius or Remus raises Harry and most of them paint murderers like the Malfoys or even Riddle in a good light. I would love to read a story where Andromeda plays a large role in raising Harry but the closest we get is either the R-Series, which is mentioned above or "Old Friends, New Friends". The later is a story with an amazing and touching beginning but it really falls off after the third year and the ending and resolution is not really good.

  "Actually, I've lived with the Tonks family in a muggle town." A student sitting fairly close by choked on his food. "You mean you grew up with that ruddy Metamorphmagus for a sister!" Another of my 'Harry raised by someone other than the Dursleys' AU.
