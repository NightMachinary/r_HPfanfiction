For example, maybe being Slytherin's heir is very important and completely rejecting his given name would erode his legitimacy, but using an anagram of his name is enough of a connection to offset that.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222805/1/Blitz][Blitz]], linkffn(13222805), offers a good solution. On Grindelwald's suggestion, he abandoned the anagram nonsense and took the name Thomas Slytherin.

  One-shot. In an alternate history where the Blitz lasted a few months longer in London, the young Tom Riddle's life takes a very different turn.

****** Well the first has alliteration, sure, but from an English speaking western-raised individual? That is not a normal name, not in the slightest. I, on the other hand, met someone with the surname Slytherin once. They had a normal first name though.

** I don't know any fics but it really makes sense because someone who knows someones true name holds power over that person. In mythology you shouldn't ever tell fairies your name.

** There were some ideas, in some fanfics, but never fully developed as far as I know, that basically had wizard's full name function a bit like in Dresdenverse. So Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was an insanely good name, since you couldn't focus on all of the names at once to curse him from afar, and it was his full name.

Same reason that Tom Marvolo Riddle, official name, changed his name to Lord Voldemort, so that nobody could curse him. It has some drawbacks, like Dumbledore knowing, but then you could imagine it's way easier to protect from one person than from multitudes of others.

Anyway, it's an interesting concept that has been touched upon by several fanfics I've read, but never fully developed.

** In my fanfic I'm writing, I changed his original name so that it's not a valid anagram. And Voldemort is actually an anglicisation of his Wizenglot (a conlang I'm working on) name he coined. Still working on what it will actually mean, but probably something like conqueror of death.
