I've just completed the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Alexandra Quick series]](which I wholeheartedly recommend) and I'm looking for something that has the qualities I liked in it. I'd really, really appreciate some good recommendations and I hope there are some which fit my criteria! :) Sorry if the post is too long, please bear with me!

So, basically, something:

- well written
- without grating grammar mistakes
- no clunky dialogue
- no too overwhelming teenage love drama or slash fiction(nothing against people who like it, just not my cup of tea).
- relatively realistic(in terms of story and writing)
- if possible(but not mandatory), does not include Harry and co. simply because it's very rare that someone sticks to the canon characters' personalities well enough for me to immerse myself.

Basically, I'm looking for stories that are set in the HP universe, but mostly stand on their own two feet. I know it's a lot to ask because the fans aren't professional writers, but I'm sure there are at least a couple more works I'd like. In essence, I'm looking for a Good Book situated inside the (more or less) canon Harry Potter universe. I know I might be too demanding, and I apologize if I'm being a jerk about it.

--------------

P.S.

I read Delenda Est and A Difference in the Family and liked them. The first because I found it innovative and relatively realistic, apart from the somewhat unlikely scenario of Harry somehow overcoming his (justified) prejudice against Bellatrix. The second because it's a great expansion of the canon story, as well as being interesting and capable of causing emotion.

I also read the first book of Norman G. Lippert's Albus Potter and co. series and, while I thought it was pretty good in terms of writing skill, I didn't continue reading the other books because there were too many americanisms in a story dominated by British characters, as well as characters that are Too Huge like Ben Franklin and Merlin. The attempt to fit electronics into a big role also took away a bit from the magical feeling of the HP universe for me. I don't mind US-centric stories, in fact I think they are a good idea with a lot of potential for innovation(Alex Quick is one and I loved it), but it might be a mistake to try to write a story situated in Britain while using the kind of expressions that simply aren't found there and impede on the reader's immersion.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird's Son]]: /Very/ AU, but well written. The second book is a WIP and updated fairly regularly.

** A few very good stories that satisfy at least most of your desiderata:

Taure's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]] is brilliant and is updating frequently.

Tinn Tam's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][The Song of the Trees]] is also very good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4930996/1/VINCET][VINCET]] by nos tres reges and sequel are very good.

Master Slytherin's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688693/1/What-Lies-Beneath][What Lies Beneath]].

** [[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/khk06/fan_fiction_how_to_separate_good_ones_from_the/][This is my standard fic rec comment (fanfiction recommendation):]]

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?chapno=1&storyid=619][After the End by Arabella and Zsenya]] - Definitely one of the greats. It was started after /GoF/ and the epilogue was published the night /OotP/ was released. It's twice as long as /OotP/. It's one of the most faithful characterizations I've ever come across and was a totally plausible ending for what we knew at the time. Brilliantly written and you fall in love with the characters again.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650][Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always]] - One of the best [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForWantOfANail][For Want of a Nail]] fics out there. It all goes horribly wrong by the end and the only survivors are Harry, Ron, and Ginny. Nearly suicidal in their depression, they find a way to go back in time to make sure everyone survives. Make sure you read Parts II and III as well, although III hasn't been touched in 2 years.

[[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HPATPS.html][Barb LP's Psychic Serpent Trilogy]] - Another post-/GoF/ that covers Harry's last 3 years, I'm hesitant to suggest this. It's wonderfully written for the most part, but I've always felt there was a touch /too much/ personal drama in the relationships, as if she forgot they were just teenagers. But where the series shines is how very /British/ it feels. You get a much stronger sense of the geography and culture of the British Isles that I feel makes it worth the read. Also her oneshots [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/MATB01.html][Mad About the Boy]] and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/barb/HAH01.html][Horntails and Hippogriffs]] are /delightful/ and give you the fuzzies.

[[http://www.phoenixsong.net/fanfiction/stories.php?psid=2422][The F Words Series by Antosha]] - Taking place and published immediately after the last chapter of /DH/ (but before the epilogue), these are some of the most amazing fics I've ever read. You get to see the characters pull themselves together again after the Battle of Hogwarts. The next time you finish reading /DH/, start reading the series and prepare to have the bittersweet feeling held at bay for a mite longer. Although really everything by this author is amazing. His characterizations are always spot-on and his Luna is probably the best you'll find aside from Rowling's canon.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5782108/1/Harry_Potter_and_the_Methods_of_Rationality][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]] - If you haven't read this, you need to do so immediately. The hands-down most hilarious and brilliant fanfic to come out in years. From the description: "Petunia married a professor, and Harry grew up reading science and science fiction. Then came the Hogwarts letter... " This should be required reading for everyone.

There are more that I could suggest but I think these represent the very best in terms of story, character, and writing. Plus it's hard to come up with these lists.

If you just type in "fanfiction" or "fanfic" or "fan fiction" or "fan-fiction" in the search reddit box to the right, you'll find more threads.

As far as sites go, I'll second the recommendations for [[http://www.checkmated.com/][checkmated]] and [[http://www.simplyundeniable.com/][simplyundeniable]]. I'll also add [[http://sugarquill.net/][The Sugarquill]] (one of the earliest R/H repositories), [[http://www.phoenixsong.net/][PhoenixSong]] (which rose from the ashes of the great GryffindorTower), and [[http://www.thequidditchpitch.org/][thequidditchpitch]]. Fanfiction.net is like youtube: 99% crap; but there are still some real gems in there if you know where to look. Usually you can cut a lot of the crap by fiddling with the filters (rating>all, books only, word count > 100k, character pairings optional)

[[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Harry_Potter][Also, here's a good overview of the fandom's history for those that weren't around for it.]]

Ninja edit: I forgot a really good one! [[http://mujaji.net/kia/][Know It Alls]] is a fanfiction recommendation site (fic recs) that's got consistently high quality links. You can even sort by pairings or protagonists or eras using the tags.

*** HPMOR is really for a certain type of people. I feel like it is mostly about how the author is the only sane man in this stupid world and we all just need to shut up and listen to him. He is also bad at writing children and prone to ranting.

** Hogwarts Battle School is actually really good.

Harry Potter: Game of the Year Edition is decent too!

The Prince Who Was Promised is a really good read. Cross over between GOTR and HP but author hasnt update it for a while now

Shifting Winds by vagrantboy is really nice read too. However too short for my liking.

My favorite one shot is Dearly Beloved by Digfruit. I like HP/HR lol

** Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness - It's a mostly canon-compliant 7th year at Hogwarts during the war. There is some love stuff, but no triangles, and I think it's well done.
