Basically what the title says. This seems a bit niche so I am not going to be picky at all. Unless it's actually too broad in which case I'll narrow it down when requested

*** Vikings didn't wear horned helmets as far as I know. And for the record, that took me way too long to understand.

**** Correct. Most contemporary imagery of them has them in pretty functional and simple caps with a nosepiece, and the only surviving example of a Norse helmet (the Gjermundbu Helmet, circa 900s) has no horns.

Honestly, I really want this too! A Viking age witch in particular would be really interesting, since they seem to have attached a hell of a lot of magical importance not just to the usual things like incantations or prophecy but also to some typically female tasks like spinning, and male magic practitioners are sometimes described in the sagas as somehow endangering their manhood by performing the role.

***** Their presence in England was dwindling by then, but Vikings in England would overlap with the founding of Hogwarts which adds a lot of fun options for historical context.

***** Right? I'm not the most informed guy on vikings as most of my knowledge about them comes from historical fiction so I don't dare to try to write it myself but this seems like something that could be really cool. I'm really interested in what you said about magic practices endangering manhood as most of the historical fiction I've read have a male stogi(?) with the group. Are they somehow different than magic practitioners?

****** Grave finds seem to suggest that male practitioners did exist, but there are notably more female examples, and most of the references in sagas are to women doing it.

There are some references to men who practiced witchcraft being subject to a social taboo, but I'm not clear on what that means in practice - they would be declared /argi/ or /ergi/, which means something like effeminate and is serious enough that in any other context it would be grounds for a duel, but...

** Would you be interested in a time travel fic where the trio somehow get pulled back to the Viking Age? I havent written fanfiction in a looooong time but I am a huge Viking/old norse society nerd so this may be enough to want me to give writing a try again.

But yeah this is a great concept about viking magic in the HP world!

*** Yes I would be very much interested in that. In fact, I would love it. Be sure to let me know how it goes.

** Because I think there is literally nothing out there coming close, I'll "self-promote" a bit by linking a little idea I wrote a while back. Just be advised that its unfinished and likely will never be continued, hence why its in my story dump on FFN.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028]] Helga Hufflepuff is a Norse v√∂lva. The author hasn't written a specific story set about her yet but she appears in most of the works in this series. The author has finished the backstory for Rowena and Salazar. Godric's isn't finished yet. There is also the general story that involves time travel. This series is such good writing, although the main pairing might not be to your taste.
