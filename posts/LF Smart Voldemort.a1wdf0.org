** linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Voldemort won AU where Britain isn't a complete hellhole after him winning. He runs things by being a competent leader who is clever and charming.

linkffn(Carpe Noctem by LeEspionage) A do-over fic that starts when Voldemort wakes up as Tom Riddle again after he dies. It's a work in progress with only 9 chapters so far, but it does look like it's heading towards him trying to take over while staying sane.

  When Voldemort died at the Battle of Hogwarts, nothing had prepared him to reawaken as Tom Riddle circa 1943, rid of his madness but left with a gnawing sense of defeat. Things may have gone wrong the first time around, but Tom vowed not to let the course of history run unchanged. He could do better, and this time... no one would stop him.

** /HPMoR/ has a great development of this basic idea that gets gradually revealed. Be warned however, that story isn't for everyone.

  Five years after his defeat the shade of Voldemort visits Harry Potter, and has a slight accident with one of his Horcruxes. The Dark Lord wanted a new body, but this isn't what he had in mind.
