:END:
Hey guys

Like the Title says i am currently looking for another specific fanfic.

i don't really remember the context but i believe that harry used a howler that instead of turning red turned black and was his very own "tactical nuke"-howler

​

does one of you know which fanfic that might have been?

​

kudos!!


** I remember one where he sent an overpowered Howler to Mrs. Weasley after she sent him a Howler. His broke the wards on the Weasley place, caused the DMLE to show up, and I think led to her getting arrested.

I think it was Daft Morons, but I'm not sure anymore.

** The one story that I read that had a black howler was called The Shock of it All by faewm. Since that's the only detail you gave I'm not sure it's the story you want but at least it's an option.

#+begin_quote
  A freak potion accident renders our hero without memory of who he is. Watch as the new Harry takes Hogwarts by storm. No one is going to tell him what to do. AU 4th year. Super!Harry. Unfettered!Cussing!Harry. Not a crossover, but with a lot of Sci-fi references. Harry's a bit of an ass.

**** Hmmm that might actually be the one i was thinking about

its just that i am reading another story atm and reached a point where i thaught the "Tactical Howler" would be a nice addition to it.

​

in general there are not enough "tactical howlers" in fanfics... WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM BECOME A THING!!!!

​

Just imagine...

-dumbles messes with harry -> tactical howler

-snape starts his first lesson with the classic 3 answers no one in first year should be able to know -> tactical howler

-lockhart....-> tactical howler

​

so many different applications, so many possibilities...

***** "Weaponized Howler" I think might be a better term?

** I remember at least one fic in which Harry recorded a mature Mandrake scream into a Howler to be used as a weapon. Another had Death Eaters dropping a Mandrake into Diagon with a Portkey, killing dozens.
