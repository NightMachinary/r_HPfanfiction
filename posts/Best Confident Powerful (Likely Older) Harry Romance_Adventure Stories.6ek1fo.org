I am looking for your best suggestions for HP stories that feature a very confident and powerful (magically and/or politically) Harry. A Harry in charge of his destiny and not beholden to anyone or easily pushed around or manipulated. Basically I have been reading a lot of stories lately where Harry is very much childlike and innocent, and lets people control or manipulate him. Its time for something different.

Any age although likely he will have to be older in the story (15+ age range). I am looking for mainly stories that feature romance and adventure and while they don't have to follow cannon, I am not looking for anything too crazy or crossovers or the like. Also i am REALLY hoping the fics recommended are more mature in nature, which would suit such a story.

Pretty much any pairings are ok, although I will openly admit I am not a big Weasley fan and hence not a big Ginny fan. Also no main character slash please. Lemons/Smut are fine, but the plot must be the focus.

Thanks everyone!


** I think you might be interested in [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]], which is Harry/Gabrielle, features a ludicrously powerful Harry who really doesn't enjoy being manipulated. It suffers, of course, from the same thing most powerful!Harry fics do- as much conflict as a wet paper bag- and a few more problems depending on your feelings about the ship, but it's quite well written and the plot is surprisingly interesting...well, until the end.

** linkffn(A long journey home by rakeesh), but it doesn't have that much adventure

linkffn(Browncoat, green eyes by nonjon), but it is a crossover

linkffn(Wizard from Earth), but it only has a /relatively/ powerful Harry. (Pretty much exact) same premise as long journey home.

linkffn(A black comedy by nonjon), but it's more of a crack story - it has a lot of action though.

**** Because powerful and confident outside edgy!indy!Harry is rare - especially if you want a different story than seven years of canon repeated.

That is why I recommended every single story with a big "But".

linkffn(Magics of the Arcane) is also there along with linkffn(By the devining light) - but they too don't. If I get any more ideas, I can add them.

However, the other recommendations by everone else in this thread also have similar problems. Hope by jaconais for example, has a confident Harry, sure, but there is little adventure and every problem is solved within twelve seconds, and the romance is of the forced kind (I don't wanna spoil it for you what exactly happened, and it's still a definitly readable story that fits your request!). Harry's power is important for like two scenes.

In short, these are all stories that I know that are

- well-written
- Do have a story outside of canon-rehash #3244737 - because it sounded like you don't want that
- Have a powerful Harry
- Have a confident Harry

I mean maybe you wanted something different, but you didn't even give one example of what you actually want. :)

***** Fair enough, although I will say that I said "while they don't have to follow cannon, I am not looking for anything too crazy or crossovers or the like."

I dont mind if they sort of follow aspects of cannon (Harry has to kill Voldemort, Dumbledore tries manipulating, Political scene is a bit of a mess... and so on). But obviously the main thing was a different Harry. One whos powerful (political/magical), confident, and isn't going to be pushed around, and is going to chart his own path.

As for examples, well to be honest I have not read anything recently that would be a good example, and the last "confident" Harry story I read was a bit different than what I was looking for (It was "The Ilvermorney Champion" i believe).

Again, I appreciate the suggestions and attempts, and it sounds like what I was looking for sadly is not super common.

*** Ok so I know very little about the Dresden files, but isnt Lady Summer's real name Lily? If so that's hilarious, regardless of if its a coincidence or not.

Also, I don't mean to doubt you, but I have come across other Dresden file crossover recommendations from people saying the exact same thing (that you don't need to know the series to understand). More often then not from my experience trying to read them... that's not true and not knowing the Dresden Files really hurts the story if you are reading it.

** off the top of my head I can think of this one by Athy linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/439865/chapters/749908]])

the only problems I guess could be that it's unfinished and hp/lv slash, but those parts are easily skipped/skimmed and the romance doesn't drive the story and is only regularly present in the later chapters (as long as you're chill with reading that). harry is definitely mature and powerful, knows what he's doing, and the politics and mechanics of magic are explored incredibly well and they are what drive the story most. there's also a tag for Dumbledore bashing but it's not at all outlandish or cliched and quite well justified within the story. I realise you asked this question about a week ago now but I hope this was helpful, if limited :)
