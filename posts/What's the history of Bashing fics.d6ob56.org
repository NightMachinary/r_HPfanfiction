** It's not unique to this fandom. [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Character_Bashing][Fanlore.org]] has an interesting article on the subject with examples of frequently bashed characters from many fandoms including /Naruto/, /Bleach/, /Star Wars/, /Star Trek/, /Xena/, etc.

*** Naruto is a weird case for Sakura, as she can't really catch up. Granted, taking pink-haired 12 year old girls seriously is something no one ever does.

Naruto and Sasuke end up being miles ahead of her in strength.

For the other characters, it pretty much mimics Dumbledore/adult from Harry Potter bashing.

#+end_quote

I believe it mostly came about because unlike Sasuke and Naruto, she wasn't shown doing much for a majority of the early series and when she finally did come around it was a bit too late (Chunin Exams was where it started, and it took until Shippuden for her skills to really shine and for her to be doing something besides training)... even when she did finally come around and was better than most she was still in the shadows a vast majority of the time.

Doesn't help that Kishimoto is just bad at portraying females in a good light and they constantly get overshadowed by their Male contemporaries. Konan is one of the more well known cases as she was killed off for very little reason and through the ever constant BS that is the Sharingan (literally rewriting History in this case to survive a series of explosions that lasted 10 minutes.)

There's also the Mob Mentality that could be likened to the Dursley Hatred. The sheer amount of stories that start with torture of a kid in both series could easily be more than a quarter of those written.

I remember being frustrated by that. I don't think he's good at developing any character tbh (imo few are well written in the manga and it's not even the main ones) and the female ones are especially terrible. But even with that, sakura's bashing has always been too intense for me. A little bit like the bashing of skylar in BB u know. I understand and see the negatives points of the character but there's also some interesting aspects that doesn't (imo) deserve all the hate.

Most just take one character's flaws and amp them up to such a degree as to be unrealistic.... and I've only ever seen one story actually address why the character acted that way without hand waving it away through mind control or some other such nonsense.

**** When a character is written wildly different from how they're described, that's bashing.

Voldemort, the holder of the most feared Dark Lord title, becomes a complete imbecile in book 7. TMR is described to be as brilliant as Dumbledore- but Voldemort definitely does not show anything remotely pertaining to that intelligent mind in the last book.

James Potter, described as a heroic father and husband, and someone who would literally move mountains for the sake of his friends, is portrayed as a "bully" in book 5. Voldemort mentions that James bravely fought him in Book 1 and 4 - Book 7 shows him getting one-shotted while being unarmed.

Bellatrix, described as the "most feared Dark Lord's best and deadliest follower" gets trounced by a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears teenagers - in spite of having superior numbers. Then she gets herself killed by a housewife.

Harry is described as being quite the talented student for defence, charms and transfiguration in book 5. Come book 6, and all that is gone.

Hermione isn't described as being a petty, jealous bitch. But that's exactly what she is in Book 6.

Cedric, Fleur and Krum are the best students from their respective schools. Their talents are mentioned enough times. But they all lose to Harry, who has 2-3 years less education than them.

Cedric gets wrecked by the dragon, in spite of going with his strength. Fleur, who faced the dragon as cool as a cucumber, has a complete meltdown in task 2, in spite of being prepared for the task. She gets taken down by grindylows, which are third year material. Krum, the guy from the school with the focus on the Dark Arts has no resistance to them at all.

Bashing is literary defamation. So saying Ron is a horrible friend because he argued with Harry, or saying Ginny gave Harry a love potion. Those are forms of bashing.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort, the holder of the most feared Dark Lord title, becomes a complete imbecile in book 7. TMR is described to be as brilliant as Dumbledore- but Voldemort definitely does not show anything remotely pertaining to that intelligent mind in the last book.

This is inconsistency, another form of bad writing, not bashing.

#+end_quote

Bravely does not mean well. But that's not bashing either. That is perspective. Just how people here will defend James's actions because he did them against Snape. It's a matter of perspective. He might have been a hero and a good father and husband, but that doesn't automatically mean he's immune to shitty behavior nor change.

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix, described as the "most feared Dark Lord's best and deadliest follower" gets trounced by a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears teenagers - in spite of having superior numbers. Then she gets herself killed by a housewife.
#+end_quote

Not bashing. Bellatrix underestimated her opponents, much like Voldemort himself. And just because Molly is a housewife doesn't mean she isn't also an extremely capable witch.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is described as being quite the talented student for defence, charms and transfiguration in book 5. Come book 6, and all that is gone.
#+end_quote

Not really. Only the DADA because he had a passion for it and received additional lessons from Remus. Charms and transfiguration, he got the same score as Ron, so unless you're going to point out Ron accidentally giving himself a pink mustache then you're being incredibly disingenuous. Also, they had moved up to NEWT level, which was harder and had much more coursework.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione isn't described as being a petty, jealous bitch. But that's exactly what she is in Book 6.
#+end_quote

Because she's also insecure, which /was/ described in a few of the previous books. She also has a hard time dealing with emotions and seeming weak, much like Harry and Ron.

#+begin_quote
  Cedric, Fleur and Krum are the best students from their respective schools. Their talents are mentioned enough times. But they all lose to Harry, who has 2-3 years less education than them.

But Voldemort is brilliant. He's shown casting exceptional magic and he instigates a coup to put himself in power, while at the same time is smart enough to hide behind the scenes, since he knows declaring himself openly would cause mass resistance.

#+begin_quote
  James Potter, described as a heroic father and husband, and someone who would literally move mountains for the sake of his friends, is portrayed as a "bully" in book 5.
#+end_quote

That's not bashing. That's showing how different characters saw a man. Pensieve memories are not easy to alter--Snape /was/ bullied by James and Sirius.

But James also stuck his neck out for his friends. He refused to shun Sirius for having a really messed-up family. He went out of his way to support Remus.

Characters are complex, and mean different things to different people. James Potter was a bully and a braggart, but if he decide to become your friend, he'd go to hell and back for you.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort mentions that James bravely fought him in Book 1 and 4 - Book 7 shows him getting one-shotted while being unarmed.
#+end_quote

Voldemort lied to taunt Harry--"Your father fought me, why won't you?" And facing down the Dark Lord with not even his wand to protect him /Is/ brave.

#+begin_quote
  Bellatrix, described as the "most feared Dark Lord's best and deadliest follower" gets trounced by a bunch of wet-behind-the-ears teenagers - in spite of having superior numbers. Then she gets herself killed by a housewife.
#+end_quote

When facing down Ginny, Hermione and Luna, the text explicitly states that the girls are "unable to finish her."

Every other Death Eater was taken down by either one or two people.

Bellatrix is outnumbered by a greater margin, but she shows no signs of actually slowing down. The fact that she can face three fighters simultaneously is impressive.

And those three fighters are not "wet-behind-the-ears," in spite of their age. They've been trained in defensive and combative magic for at least two years. Arguably three--I doubt Hermione stopped researching spells when the DA disbanded.

And for the love of God, */stop disparaging Molly Weasley as a housewife./*

There are few things greater on Earth than the love of a mother. Bellatrix is the embodiment of bloodlust and hatred. Molly Weasley is a nurturer.

And the text also states that Bellatrix briefly stopped fighting to taunt Molly, who was able to get her curse in precisely because Bellatrix let her guard down.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is described as being quite the talented student for defence, charms and transfiguration in book 5. Come book 6, and all that is gone.
#+end_quote

No, the text says that Harry excels at DADA. He's good in Charms--McGonagall notes that his grades are between Acceptable and Exceeds Expectations. But she also notes that he will have to work very hard to meet Exceeds Expectations in Transfiguration.

Harry struggles with non-verbal magic, and with the greater emphasis on such magic in Book 6, it makes sense that he struggles in these classes.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione isn't described as being a petty, jealous bitch. But that's exactly what she is in Book 6.
#+end_quote

Hermione is well-established as having a temper and she's known for holding a grudge.

This happens throughout the first five books--from her spitefulness in the first book to her leading Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest. The fact that romance motivating her pettiness in Book 6 does not cancel out these flaws as well-established.

#+begin_quote
  Cedric, Fleur and Krum are the best students from their respective schools. Their talents are mentioned enough times. But they all lose to Harry, who has 2-3 years less education than them.

Cedric used Transfiguration to turn a boulder into a dog, to use as a decoy. Impressive magic, but as Ron says the dragon changed its mind halfway through and turned its attention on him. That's not bashing. That's dumb luck.

And if it were playing to his strengths, then Cedric had the option to summon his own broomstick.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Her /baby sister,/ who can't swim, is all tied up at the bottom of the Lake. She's emotionally compromised and her meltdown is due to fearing for her sister.

#+begin_quote
  She gets taken down by grindylows, which are third year material.
#+end_quote

She panicked. And if there isn't a large body of water near her school, it's possible she's only read about grindylows, not actually studied them in her classes.

#+begin_quote
  Krum, the guy from the school with the focus on the Dark Arts has no resistance to them at all.

Learning about Dark Arts does not mean you're resistant to Dark Arts. The text repeatedly says that overthrowing the Imperius Curse is very difficult and Krum was only put under it on literally the last night of the contest.

#+begin_quote
  the text says that Harry excels at DADA
#+end_quote

Defence is not a core branch of magic like Charms and Transfiguration are. It combines those two, along with other aspects of magic.

In any case, Harry is exceptional at Charms. Unless, did you miss the Patronus Charm at age 13, and the incredible summoning charm a few months later?

Also, from having the mental fortitude to repel the Imperius curse at age 14 (from Voldemort no less), Harry is nerfed to the point that he's completely useless at Occlumency (which Snape tells is a similar skill) and non-verbal magic. Even at the last book, there's no mention of Harry doing anything non-verbally.

#+begin_quote

No, it doesn't. Students who were strong in an area don't suddenly become weak in it just because the matter got harder.

Character assassination and repeatedly kicking characters down /is/ bashing. Inconsistency, especially if it goes in a negative direction, is bashing the character.

Look, you're going out of your way to make sense of all the nerfing that's going on. Face it, Rowling got bored at the end, and turned it into bash-fest, along with several other head-scratching pieces of plot. She's not some great author capable of making work that we can oooh and aahhh at.

He doesn't need to be charismatic anymore! Voldemort effectively won when the Ministry fell. Hogwarts is the last line of resistance.

And looking at his past appearances, one would think the multiple Horcruxes splitting his soul took more and more away of his humanity.

The books imply this, specifically /Half-Blood Prince./ Riddle is noted as looking less human and more snake-like the second time he applies for the position of the professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts.

He lost his charisma with his experiments stealing his humanity.

Character assassination is not the same thing as bashing by the author. It's absurd that you could even come to that conclusion.

Character assassination is /malicious and unjustified harming of a someone's good reputation./

In-universe, Rita Skeeter participates in character assassination with her libelous reporting.

Snape's ranting of James and Sirius has a kernel of truth to it, but the text does show that they're still largely the biased memories of a petty, bitter man.

These are actions taken by characters /in the story./

He does extremely well during the Second Task, having only gotten a little lost in trying to find the Merfolk's Village, and reaches the surface only a minute after the time limit.

And in the Third Task, he does well too--he's confronted by an Imperiused Krum but he's able to withstand the Cruciatus Curse. He encounters a Blast-Ended Skwert and escapes with only minor burns. He comes out of the confrontation with the giant spider with fewer injuries than Harry.

  That's a lot of handwavium to explain why a final year student who's the best in her school can't perform tasks that 13 year olds can do.

Well, yeah. There's a big difference from reading about something and working with it in practical environments.

If grindylows are not native to France, then there is literally no reason for Fleur to have studied them extensively.

And on the note of age, I'd like to point out that virtually any thirteen-year-old in rural regions of my country could kick an urban-dwelling seventeen-year-old's ass in /any/ subject relating to the outdoors.

  Yeah, so there's a complete meltdown in this case, but absolutely no meltdown at the sight of a gigantic dragon that could roast her and have her for breakfast? Well, that's just odd.

Nobody she loved was in danger.

Also, she knew she would be facing a dragon--Maxine would have told her.

  Inconsistency, especially if it goes in a negative direction, is bashing the character.
#+end_quote

What the hell?

New information is not necessarily inconsistent.

A good character having done bad things in the past is not inconsistent. Done properly, it's complex.

#+begin_quote
  Bashing is not just the stupid stories like "Ron laid an egg while facing the dragon" stuff.
#+end_quote

I never said it was. I countered your point that canonical flaws were "bashing."

#+begin_quote
  Look, you're going out of your way to make sense of all the nerfing that's going on
#+end_quote

I don't need to go out of my way. This took much longer to type out than it took to think of the justifications, because they make sense on their own.

#+begin_quote
  Face it, Rowling got bored at the end, and turned it into bash-fest, along with several other head-scratching pieces of plot. She's not some great author capable of making work that we can oooh and aahhh at.
#+end_quote

Whatever my disgruntlements with Rowling, she most certainly wasn't "bored."

She's an excellent plot-crafter and inspired an entire generation.

I dare you to do better.
