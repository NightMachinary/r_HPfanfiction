Looking for fics with creative solutions to werewolves (that doesn't involve curing or killing them). On a more specific note, a user commented in another thread about a fic in which "Harry is so rich he hires a jet to keep lupin moving around the world in the sun so he never has to turn around the full moon time" but they couldn't remember the title. If anyone knows a fic that fits this description, I would like to read it.


** Options:

Move far north

Move far south

Destroy the moon.

***** There are apparently 120+ stories on FFN that are Harry Potter/Dragon Ball Z crossovers. Perhaps Harry does have Saiyan blood in one of them.

****** So instead of merely becoming a slightly bigger wolf he becomes an Oozaru every full moon?

That would put normal lycanthropy to shame.

*** Depending on just what ancient runes is, or how much fine tuning you can do to a spell... Why not just a massively overpowered stunning/sleeping charm that contingency triggers off the full moon?

Full moon: RAWRIMAWOLF!I'MGONNAEATYou... .... /nap/.

We don't know for certain, but it really can't be anything but rudimentary Latin, Greek, Agyptian, Sumerian and a bit of the old Germanic scripts. I mean, what else would it be?

***** It seems to be split between a class on how to read ancient "Caution: not only will touching this kill you, but it will hurt the entire time you are dying" signs and how to draw/carve runes that will produce a lasting magical effect.

Given that I really only recall it being brought up in canon as:

A class Hermione likes

A requirement for Gringotts cursebreakers

Both would be true in either case, so I don't think it's possible to say for sure. Though, there is merit to the argument that the latter would likely be called rune-working, or somesuch other thing that didn't require the adjective 'ancient'

--------------

The point I was aiming for though was more of the why not a powerful time delayed curse that induces sleep or unconsciousness during the full moon. We /do/ see evidence of persistent magic in canon, and lycanthropy itself is evidence of a curse working on a temporal trigger.

***** The only reason I even mentioned the runes class is that you could make it a big tattoo'd circuit if you choose to see them that way.

** I don't know if this exactly fits what you're looking for, but in Arsenic's [[http://tasteofpoison.inkubation.net/viewstory.php?sid=16][Care of Magical Creatures]], Hermione tries to make life better for registered werewolves and work toward wider acceptance from the wizarding community by creating a school--the younger werewolves (many of whom are abandoned by their parents) are required to go to the school, and older werewolves can opt to work there and have steady employment. She doesn't cure their lycanthropy (though Snape does experiment making improvements to the Wolfsbane potion), but she works with Remus and a number of well-written werewolf OCs to give werewolves steady employment, mentorship opportunities, and the opportunity to show the world they're functioning members of society.
