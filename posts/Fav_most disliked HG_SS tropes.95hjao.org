They are my OTP but I definitely see the tropes in their stories - curious to see what you enjoy or hate!

Enjoy: Time travel fics where H goes back in time to meet young S

Hate: when detention is synonymous with "hot date"

** Hate hate hate: Makeovers. For either character.

Hate: Sudden change of heart- agree with what Worlds_Okayist_Wife said- this pairing always needs to be a slow burn.

Enjoy: Time travel, travel to exotic places, ginormous libraries (lol), well-written character flaws

*** The Hermione-salivating-over-libraries scene is so clichÃ© but I honestly love it every single time ðŸ˜‚

** Yes to Hermione saving Severus in time travels.

Fuck those marriage law fics forcing them together.

** They're my OTP as well and tbh I love most of the tropes, total guilty pleasure! Marriage law, time travel, Hermione fixing Snape after being tortured, reluctantly collaborating on something for the war and getting to know each other, dark!Hermione, snarky banter, etc., I love it all!

One small thing I do dislike though just because I find it too cheesy and usually irrelevant to the storyline is in marriage laws (with any pairing, but seen it in SSHG a few times) where they each have to pick a ring for the other and they miraculously pick two paired rings. I wouldn't mind if there was some more significance to the rings but if it's just to show how they are "totally meant for each other" I find it quite cringy. I'd much rather have something different to show some sort of connection between them.

In terms of bigger storyline stuff... I guess I get kind of annoyed when stories start out during the war, but then the author ignores the war completely in favour of the romance and there's an eventual small paragraph about "Harry did something and Voldemort is dead". Nothing wrong with a romance-only story, I'd just like to know what it is to begin with.

** *Enjoy:* Unlike Dramione fics, where she tends to be a generally useless bookish ingenue, Hermione in Snamione fics is often portrayed as brilliant and powerful.

*Hate:* [[https://www.deviantart.com/zorm/art/Canon-Vs-Fanon-Snape-34384180][This phenomenon.]] Also, inconsistency in characters' stated and displayed competence when it serves drama and plot.

**** I wonder if there are any fics where Hermione gets together with Snape (by whatever mechanism), but insists that before they consummate their relationship, Snape must

1. take a bath;
2. get a haircut; and
3. drink Polyjuice of someone better-looking or wear a paper bag.
