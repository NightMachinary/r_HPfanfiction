**** yeah, which characters has she said to be gay, other than albus? this is a really weird narrative imo.

and there's clear canonical support for albus being gay, as well. it's just not spelled out with huge neon letters.

#+begin_quote
  ---“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips. “And a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. *Albus was heartbroken* ---”

  “*His heart wasn't the only thing*. Didn't Aberforth break Albus's nose halfway through the service?”

  --------------

  “He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.” Harry dropped his arms. *“I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me*. This isn't love, the mess he's left me in. *He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me.”*

  --------------

  However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it *lingering affection* for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was *once so delighted* he had met?
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  " And then, of course, he came...." "Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, *inflamed me*. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the revolution.
#+end_quote

I N F L A M E D ` M E.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, even after *they'd spent all day in discussion* --- both such brilliant young boys, *they got on like a cauldron on fire* --- I'd sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert's bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!”
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. . . . “So, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your journey was pointless. *I never had it.*” “You lie!” As Voldemort's anger throbbed inside him
#+end_quote

why would gellert lie to tom about having the wand? if he had any animosity towards albus at all he would just say 'yo, that dumbledore dude has it.' and then volde & him would sit down and have tea, and talk shit about other dark lords, and volde would talk about how useless wormtail is, and how annoying quirrel was, etc. how great a lackey lucius is, and how he has shared his secret conditioner recipe with him.

but instead he denies having had the wand /at all/. that can only have served to divert attention away from albus.

--------------

#+begin_quote
  seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. “Kill me, then, Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. . . . *There is so much you do not understand*. . .
#+end_quote

rowling of course keeps mentioning that love is the quintessential thing Voldemort doesn't understand. this can also be interpreted as him not accepting/understanding his own mortality, finitude & humanity.

#+begin_quote
  the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged at the summons he felt --- he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken . . . “Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not win, you cannot win! That wand will never, ever be yours ---”
#+end_quote

--------------

the way harry talks about gellert to albus:

#+begin_quote
  At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.” Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. “They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Voldemort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow . . .” “. . . *or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.*
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  Did I know, in my *heart of hearts*, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to *fruition*, all my *dreams would come true*.
#+end_quote

--------------

#+begin_quote
  “Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an *equal to talk to, someone just as bright and talented as he was.* And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans for a new Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, *and whatever else it was they were so interested in.*
#+end_quote

--------------

edit:

#+begin_quote
  “I thought you'd say ‘They were young.' They were the same age as we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in *a huddle* with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles.”

One does not introduce a character like this (in this particular setting) without being prepared to have them extremely flambouyant or gay. (just my opinion)

Still, the movie all but outright says it all the same, ("We were closer than brothers" and the Mirror of Erised is about as obvious as you can get) and both the director and JK Rowling have said it will be explored more in the other films, this was all setup in truth.

Leta Lestrange's father is shown directly imperiusing and raping Leta's mother, a black woman, despite 1920s attitudes towards interracial relationships. Clearly 19920s Wizarding World has very anachronistic views on everything yet somehow homosexuality is still taboo and hidden while these other things are not? Curious.

The cynic in me thinks that any obvious signs of their gay relationship will be shown in the last movie, when it can't jeopardize sequel success in foreign markets.

*** People have read Harry as bisexual for over a decade. There's plenty of evidence of him lingering over the looks of a few canonically handsome guys, and immediately associating them in his mind with how attractive they are, every time come up in the story.

.

#+begin_quote

  - Cedric Diggory was an extremely handsome boy of around seventeen. He was captain and Seeker of the Hufflepuff house Quidditch team at Hogwarts.

  - Cedric looked the part of a champion so much more than he did. Exceptionally handsome, with his straight nose, dark hair and grey eyes, it was hard to say who was receiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum.

  - He had been starting to quite like Cedric---prepared to overlook the fact that he had once beaten him at Quidditch, and was handsome, and popular, and nearly everyone's favourite champion.
#+end_quote

.

#+begin_quote

  - There on the threshold, holding an old-fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognised at once: tall, pale, dark-haired and handsome---the teenage Voldemort.

  - Half a dozen boys were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his, and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognised Riddle at once. His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boys.

  - The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognising as Voldemort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but all of this suited him: he looked more handsome than ever.

**** So any guy who thinks another guy is handsome is at the very least bisexual? That's a rather... dated mindset.

You've also listed only two people out of the numerous men that Harry has met and described. Incidentally, the fact that these two people were handsome was an intrinsic part of their character.

Cedric needed to be handsome to play his part, that of a tragic young life cut short with literally everything going for him: looks, smarts, charm, and personality. Voldemort needed to be handsome in order to be the foil to the future Voldemort, who lost everything good about him in his quest for power and immortality.

Now contrast this to Harry getting his first crush.

#+begin_quote
  Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their team. She was shorter than Harry by about a head, and Harry couldn't help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely pretty. She smiled at Harry as the teams faced each other behind their captains, and he felt a slight lurch in the region of his stomach that he didn't think had anything to do with nerves.
#+end_quote

Dude's dick was literally jumping up and down in his pants the first time he noticed a girl.

Then there's also the possibility that this is just a woman author unconsciously writing Harry's narrative as she would see it, and not a teenage boy. Even so, as a straight guy, whenever I see a guy that's just ridiculously handsome, I note that mentally. Not that they do anything for me, but the fact that I even notice that they're handsome stands out.

Really, it's way too much of a stretch to even think that JKR hinted that Harry was bisexual. She was too cowardly to put Dumbledore being gay in the books, she certainly wasn't going to test the waters by hinting that the main character was bisexual.

Regardless, when you're reading the story without knowing the meta details, Harry's narration makes him look like someone who pays equal attention and admiration to the looks of girls /and/ boys. I don't think it's a deliberate choice on JKR's part---as much as it was a deliberate choice to write Hermione as a race-neutral character.

That's why I find it pretty odd that some people in this sub are so adamant that Harry is straight and m/m slash with Harry is OOC and unrealistic.

  Grindelwald is rising. Europe is preparing to war. The prohibition is creating new underground's powers. The Great Depression will soon strike in the entire world. The ISS in threatened every day. The MACUSA is panicking. Albus Dumbledore is facing his old demons. Somewhere, the young Mr Riddle is testing his new powers at the orphanage, unknown to the wizarding world. A certain Obscurus is running around to seek safety. His Magicozoologist friend is running around for reasons.And Harry... Harry is trying to avoid the worst.

**** Honestly, those don't seem like anything concrete to base off of. For one thing, every quote you listed except the third description of the character's *handsomeness* I think can more clearly be read as a description from the narrator, not the inner thoughts of Harry.

​

A person being able to recognize other people of their own sex as classically handsome/attractive is not really an indication that a person is gay or bisexual. I think all those instances were simply to describe to the reader about the character's looks than it was about how Harry specifically views them. For one thing, it's kind of important to the plot that the reader knows how attractive/charismatic Riddle is, and to a lesser extent in book four, Cedric Diggory. It's reaching.

If JKR writes this, it's fanfic. I don't give a flying f*** if JKR says it's canon, because if it was, Harry wouldn't do this. Ron wouldn't now that I think about it, movie Ron maybe, but book Ron would never do that either. So JKR if your reading this get your shit together. Is this like a mid-life crisis, or something.

*** You didn't read the books (particularly the last) if you think it came out of nowhere. There were continued hints that Grindelwald was someone important to Dumbledore, that they had an intense connection upon meeting in their late teens, and Rita Skeeter felt confident enough to give "dark hints" at Dumbledore's relationship with Grindelwald and what that implied about his relationship with Harry all to be released in her upcoming expose. It didn't come out of nowhere, this is not like the tweet about wizards shitting wherever they were standing. Which didn't make sense as Dumbledore refers to chamber pots in the first book. Magical chamber pots that could vanish whatever was inside them is much more sensible.

***** Given that this is a fictional world, everything "came out of nowhere", nowhere being J K Rowling's imagination. There is in-text canon hints for Dumbledore being gay and having been lovers with Grindelwald. So this whole "Dumbledore being gay is a retcon" is not very accurate and the energy behind it online does seem to stem in some part from homophobia. There are a whole lot of retcons we can complain about, but Dumbledore being gay isn't it.

By your standards, the Deathly Hallows came out of nowhere, the Hogwarts statues animating and fighting to defend Hogwarts came out of nowhere, and Harry's defeat of Voldemort came out of nowhere.
