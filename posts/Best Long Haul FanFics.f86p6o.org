*** Anything where the driver cant do any other deliveries that day (MAYBE they can fit in a super local load), but can still make it back to the yard at the end of his shift. Anything longer than that is OTR.

*** I imagine for most people "long haul" would be anything over the largest word count section on [[https://FF.Net][F]]anfiction.net - 300,000 words. Any fanfic over this amount could be defined as long haul, I suppose. For me as an individual, anything that has a complex plot which takes a notable period of time to resolve. The longest fanfiction I've ever read was around the 3 million word mark.

** A Second Chance by Breanie. Harry/Ginny centric, currently 216 chapters (yes, you read that right - 216!) and updating weekly. A Howarts rewrite where Sirius was released from Azkaban and he and Remus raised Harry. Great writing, great reading

  What if Sirius didn't spent twelve years in prison, but was given a trial after four years? Follow the story of Sirius Black as he learns what it means to be a father/brother/guardian to his young godson & the story of Harry Potter, a young boy with a loving home who learns about the Marauders from the two men who should have raised him. Slow-burn Hinny. M for sex & violence.

#+begin_quote
  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

  In his several millennia of existence Loki Odinson, God of Mischief and Lies, had been many things; he had been a liar, a warrior, and a trickster, just to name a few, but never before had he been a loving father, he'd never been given the chance. However, the moment the tiny creature was in his arms, he knew he would do anything necessary to keep hold of what was his.

  Parts of souls do not go on alone. When Voldemort returns to a body he is much more sane than before and realizes that he cannot go on as he started. Finding some old laws he sets out to reach his goals in another way. Harry will find his world turned upside down once more and we will see how people react when the evil is not acting how they think it should.
