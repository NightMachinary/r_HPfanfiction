There was this one fic I read ages ago where Harry pretended to be insane so that Voldemort would think Harry was siding with him. I think there was a large emphasis on Harry staring emotionlessly at a brick wall?

Harry Potter has spent six years in Azkaban. Now, Dumbledore, Black and Lupin are here to retrieve him, now certain of his innocence. Will they be too late to save Harry's sanity? And if so, what does this mean for the world? AU after year 4.
