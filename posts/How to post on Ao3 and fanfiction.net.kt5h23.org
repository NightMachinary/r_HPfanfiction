So, I am currently writing my own Harry Potter fanfiction and font know how to post them! I have two problems involving two different fanfic website's.

Problemo 1: I can't figure out how to sign up to Ao3. I put my email in to get the invite thingy and then I click on the button that tells me where I am in the queue. I put in my email again so it can use it to search and it says I'm not the queue at all!

Problemo 2: How the hell do I post stuff on fanfiction.net?? I tried posting a chapter and I got a friend to find it to see if it worked. It didn't. They sent me a screenshot and the entire chapter was like 400 characters worth of random numbers!

Ps. If figuring out how to post chapters on Ao3 takes the same amount of brain power as figuring out how to use fanfiction.net does, please tell me how to use it!!


** I would recommend not spamming the sub. You're not likely to get more responses, and the mods are quite likely to get irritated with you and remove your posts anyway.

Have you looked up tutorials on how to post to either site? Both, I believe, have instructions on how it works available somewhere.

For example:

FFNet - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10057482/1/How-to-Publish-a-Story]]

AO3 - [[https://archiveofourown.org/faq/tutorial-posting-a-work-on-ao3?language_id=en]]

Also, it takes time for things to be processed, so you're not going to be instantly on the list. Give it a day or two and then try again.

** You need to wait till AO3 sends you an email with an invite I think.

Ffnet is annoying to post on. It's a two step process, which I find really frustrating, and you need to be careful to make sure there isn't any formatting on your text as it always fucks up and turns out unreadable

as the other commenter said it's probably best to search for a tutorial, because there are a few good ones

Good luck posting!
