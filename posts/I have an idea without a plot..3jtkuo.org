So, I'm a big fan of Slytherin!Harry, but I've only seen it done well a few times. Usually, I find some issue or other with it, either because I'm picky or just have bad luck in the fics I choose to read.

So I'm toying with the idea of writing a fic myself, but... I'm just not sure what the plot should be. I have a very clear idea of characterizations, relationships between people, what Slytherin-y traits I'd like to highlight in Harry and Slytherin house as a whole, etc, but I don't wanna end up doing "Exactly the same thing happens as canon, only Harry hangs out in the dungeons now."

Should I keep it to shorts? Just go with the canon story? What are people's thoughts on Slytherin!Harry even?


** Take your time, write notes about everything you want your story to have - not only in relation to Slytherin, but everything you want to see happening in the HP world. Open your mind to the possibilities, and plot bunnies would just... slither in. (he he)

If it's that hard to come up with a narrative, try going through books/shows/films you like, and think of how their narrative could work in the world of Harry Potter. It doesn't necessarily have to involve Voldemort. Results can be very interesting.

Just remember that you don't have to start the story in first year. This is a common mistake that many authors, including me, make. Writing detailed seven years is /hard/. Pick a period of time you want your particular plot to take place in, and squeeze in whatever general elements a story like this would have (trials Harry has to go through to find his place in Slytherin, for example). You can show background/earlier events through subtle references. Also remember that you can discard canon plots if you like. Lucius Malfoy doesn't have to unleash Tom Riddle's diary and so on. Don't let it limit you.

The concept of Harry in Slytherin is interesting, though it's usually poorly executed and overrun with horrible cliches. Please no ice queens or disproportional bad treatment.

*** Oh heavens no. I want to write the story exactly to avoid the cliches I keep seeing in these kinds of fics. Everyone's human (except, well, y'know, house elves and such), whether they're a hero, a bullying prat, or a Hufflepuff.

I think, maybe, I'll start off doing some short little bits. Scenes I'm imagining and such, taking place in the same AU. Maybe do a full-on plot-driven story once I've gotten a bit of inspiration. Not having to start at first year is good advice, though, I hadn't even considered that for some reason.

** The way I see it, you have two choices:

A) Come up with a plot.

B) Write a drama.

It's only really genre fiction that has a "plot" in the traditional sense. A lot of literature doesn't really have a plot as we'd think of it. Rather, it's a character sketch, a look inside the life of a person, the events that made them the way they are, often showing either a character transformation or an inability to change.

For examples of this, I'd recommend reading Slaughterhouse 5 by Kurt Vonnegut, or A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini, or The Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro. They're all fairly short stories that can be read in a day.

You could try to do something like this: a character piece showing a crucial part of Slytherin Harry's life, maybe even just a couple of days.

** Currently writing a fic where Harry's in Slytherin (and a whole lot more happens, it diverges a lot from canon after the second year).

You've got to work out the idea of /how/ he got in Slytherin in the first place. Did he miss the Weasleys on the train station? Is your Harry a lot more distrustful and independent than canon Harry, therefore not believing Hagrid when he talks about Slyterin?

Then there's Harry himself. I guess he doesn't make best mates immediately on the train, so he is very lonely. You could use this very well with the Mirror of Erised. Have Harry be completely starved for friendship the first months, so that when he sees his parents in the mirror, he gets a much stronger reaction.

In my fic, Harry gets bullied a lot by his fellow Slytherins because he is the Boy Who Lived and he's a half-blood. That makes Harry research a lot of spells to protect himself. He builds up a lot of knowledge, and I use this as a means to get Harry and Hermione together as friends in their second year, even though they didn't have the whole troll incident. They kind of become working buddies in the library.

As for relationships with the others, think logically. The Weasleys are completely out of the question as a surrogate family. They are fairly prejudiced (especially Ron, who has a temper to top it off) and Molly and Arthur are very protective of their family.

My fic does have Ginny and Harry becoming friends after the CoS and I use that as a sort of "forbidden friendship". Fun to write.

Snape is very important to get right, for obvious reasons. my guess is that at first, Snape is furious at Harry, but later on he starts to realise that Harry is not like his father. In fact, Snape sees a lot of himself in Harry: lonely, bullied, grew up in a hating environment. I don't think Snape would be forever a bully to Slytherin Harry.

As for Harry's dorm mates, it's Malfoy and his two bodyguards and two fairly blank sheets.

Theodore Nott is the son of a Death Eater and a blood purist, so I don't think he and Harry become friends, but Blaise Zabini is very blank. Do with him what you want, but I don't think he and Harry are best mates. Blaise is a Slytherin. He's not going to befriend the most hated person in his house.

Malfoy is still the son of a Death Eater and an arrogant ponce. Yes, he redeems himself (sort of) at the end of canon, but don't forget that he looks up to his father, who is a ruthless Death Eater. He'll probably instigate a lot of hate against Harry and rally Slytherin against him.

As for girls, well, you have Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode, who are not very nice in canon. Tracy Davis and Daphne Greengrass are two blank slates. Maybe have Harry crush on one of them?

Slytherin Harry is very interesting to write, because you have so much you can make up yourself, so many blank characters and divergence from canon. Just keep in mind that Harry still grew up with the Dursleys, and is thus very shy and distrusting.

*** ... Heh. Well, I can certainly tell that our fics will be vastly different. (Which is fine - to each their own and all that).

I actually disagree with a lot of that. First of all, I don't at all percieve Harry as distrusting. Rather, I see him as starved for affection and friendship, which is why he's so quick to open up to Hagrid (about a day) and Ron (half a train-ride or so), and even Sirius in PoA (immediately agreeing to go live with a man you only just found out wasn't a mass murderer). I'm also probably keeping his friendship with Ron, who I think is a reasonable enough person that he'd realize, if they got to talking, that Harry's alright. Obviously, it'll be a much slower process since they can't spend every day together in class and every evening together in the common room. Could easily take years. So yeah, no surrogate Weasley-family.

As for Malfoy, my Harry's gonna realize pretty quickly that he's all bark and no bite, so there'll be a lot less "Malfoy is up to something" and a lot more "Shut up Malfoy". They might have to come to some kind of grudging truce so their arguing doesn't disrupt classes too much or something. But yeah, I'm definitely not going the "Malfoy and Harry are bffs" route that I've seen some people do. 'Cause Malfoy's still a dick.

I might have to make up some older Slytherins who aren't quite as dickish as the ones in Harry's year, so there's someone who's at least reasonably polite around, even if they're not outright friendly.

Personally, my focus is gonna be how most of the wizarding community is incredibly spooked by Harry - there were, after all, a lot of people who thought he'd be a dark wizard even greater than Voldemort after defeating him, and being put in Slytherin is definitely going to confirm that belief for a lot of people. I'm also gonna have Harry learn, over time, that Slytherin isn't quite as bad as he thought, and that he can actually learn from his house-mates - putting a little bit of a damper on his hot temper, etc.

**** Interesting. It's funny that we've got such a different idea of a Slytherin Harry.

I think you've got some good points as well, but we have different purposes to the story. I want Harry completely isolated in the wizarding world, kinda like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4883260/1/Down-the-Rabbit-Hole][Down the Rabbit Hole]]. Putting him in Slytherin and thus getting rid of his Boy-Who-Lived title that made people see him as a hero came to me while writing and it works well. The same simple good-vs-evil worldview that made Harry a hero now makes him evil in the public eye.

***** Absolutely - but I'm gonna use it for Harry to find other ways of being his canon, heroic self; my Harry's probably gonna end up with an even bigger hero-complex to combat the presumptions that he's gonna be a powerful dark wizard.

** I'm not sure about what Slytherin!Harry is normally like because thats generally not my cuppa tea. But why not ignore cannon? Or just barely follow it, because while Grandpa whiskers may still keep the stone in Hogwarts, Harry and whoever his friends are may seek other ways to get it.

Maybe have it be more political? Make your own OC in an older year. Here's an idea that literally just popped into my head. Older Slytherins often mentor bright and promising younger students, to forge new connections. A tradition that Slughorn REALLY excelled at and one he continued on well later into life. Harry is the Boy Who Lived! Surely some older Slytherin would want to mentor him and train him up?

*** Well, in the stories I've read so far, Slytherin!Harry usually takes about five chapters or so to become a cynical, overanalyzing brat who comments on everything as though his internal monologue is being written by Malfoy. That or all of Slytherin house is whitewashed to be wonderful people who put up a mean exterior. I wanna do something where Harry is still Harry, and Slytherin is still Slytherin.

I'm not horribly keen on OCs, but I might do something like that, yeah.

*** Yes! Personally, this is my headcanon for Slytherin house - first years spend all year looking for a mentor among upper year students. They're encouraged to find someone that does magic that they're interested in, that they look up to, that has interests and personalities similar to their own. And it's a big deal. Mentors and apprentices ( I don't like "mentee") become close friends, and so do their families. Feel free to use this if you want.

No, it's because vast, vast majority of them are crap. Of course, Sturgeon's Law applies, and 90% of everything is crap, but the trouble with Slytherin!Harry is that, like 'shippy Harmony, Harlequin-style Dramione, indy!Harry, etc., it has a sizable constituency that will read/review/fave /anything/ in that category that is even remotely readable (and a lot that isn't), which makes it practically impossible to find the 10-20 fics from the category that are actually decent.

** Don't get caught up in pre-Hogwarts stuff. You don't have to go into detail into Harry's childhood to understand his sorting. 'Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness' is enough motivation for an 11 year old who has had a shitty downtrodden life, doesn't require expansion or explanation.

How you structure Slytherin is important. Fanon dictates /house rules/ of some sort, do they apply and how so. Harry's acceptance into the house is important as well.

If you're doing a first year fic remember they're 11 and 12 years old. Wizards have a very sheltered life and all they know if what their parents tell them, but they aren't evil. Draco is still a spoiled shit though.

Rehashing can be fine, so long as you fit an adapter well. However if the story is a rehash it has to be less about the events and more about the characters.

I love the idea of Ginny following Harry into Slytherin, if it fits your story of course. Even if that isn't an eventual pair or anything. Also Ron Weasley is not going to be friends with a Slytherin without significant events changing his opinion.

** Figure out what /would/ stay constant from canon and then just wind your characters up and let them go and write what happens. If Harry is a person in your head the plot should reveal itself as you go. So, assuming you don't re-write the past:

- Harry survived Riddle's attack as a baby. Assuming events with the philosopher's stone play out as they did in canon, wraith!Riddle is due to return with Quirrel in Harry's first year.
- Harry will arrive in a Slytherin House known as a celebrity, famous from infancy for somehow defeating Voldemort and the heir of a reasonably well-known old magic family (Though the vast Potter fortune, manor, etc. are largely a product of fanon). Though his mother was muggleborn, she was also talented and popular, and was Hogwarts' Head Girl. Even a bratty 11-year-old like Draco's first instinct was to try to cultivate Harry, knowing that he would have social cachet.
- Harry enters a Slytherin House run by Professor Snape, who presumably harbors the same canon grudge against james and by extension Harry. Their proximity will presumably exacerbate the intensity of their relationship; there are many different ways to play this both positive and negative.
- Canon Harry, while friendly, is not especially out-going and his friends are largely thrust upon him. Who in Slytherin will thrust themselves upon him in the absence of Hermione and Ron? (Many fics bring Harry and Hermione back together using the plausible if overly-convenient excuse that with Harry in Slytherin Hermione would be something of an outcast in her own House, while Harry would be the same in his, leading to them meeting in the library or whatever but you don't /have/ to do this.)

Obvious there's lots more you could add, and you pick and choose what you want to emphasize, but that's what I thought of off the top of my head. [edit for spelling]
