:END:
The fic I am looking for is ongoing and on AO3.

I think Harry gets taken in/adopted by the Malfoys. The scene I remember most is during a party at Malfoy manor where Harry gets cornered by a death eater with plans to hurt/kill Harry. Harry defends himself in a bloody way but the man is still alive. Harry is very freaked out and Lucius and others show up. Their solution to the problem of the bleeding, possible dying man in the bathroom (?) is to send in Greyback who eats him.

Hopefully someone knows where this is from!
