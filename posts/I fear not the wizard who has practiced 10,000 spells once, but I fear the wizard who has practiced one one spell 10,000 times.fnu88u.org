** I really hate that JKR made Expelliarmus his spell of choice. If he had to be a Master of One, why couldn't it have been transfiguration or some more complex charm so we could get some creative use out of it? There's literally no depth to it, and it would have made a nice contrast to Voldemort's usage of AK which is equally without depth. Could have used it so that his wins against Voldemort wasn't a complete Deus ex Machina, put his skills in Quidditch and fast reflexes to use too. I get she needed him to be Wizard Jesus, but honestly even Jesus had more than one trick up his sleeve and he was a well-spoken kind of guy, not an angsty teen.

***** I've heard a saying that "God looks out for children, fools, and drunks." I could google it, but I choose to believe no one has thrown enough of any out windows to make a proper study of it, lol.

Come to think of it, that's kinda the opposite of the HP reason kids survive. An untrained witch or wizard kinda grabs for their magic when they're distressed or want something very badly, thus why Neville's great-uncle was dangling him out a window in the first place, trying to scare him badly enough so that accidental magic happened. But regular babies (might) survive because they don't become stressed enough to tense up? I dunno, i can see it for drunks because their senses are blunted, but babies I'm not sure.

***** I think the knock back is strong enough to incapacitate or seriously hurt anyone who does not shield it as it is strong enough to hurl the target through wooden posts. Make sure they don't get back up. I remember some enemies sent falling down stairs in the final battle. Who knows how spells in Harry Potter actually works?

Till the Snape vs Harry fight in HBP I thought that Legilimency was a spell like any other that could be blocked with a Protego. The movies even support this. I also thought it was an extremely unpleasant if not painful experience. Then somehow Snape is inside Harry's mind in HBP without Harry noticing it.

Another example is to successfully cast Cruciatus spell you have to want to cause pain. Even Harry's white hot rage and hatred like he never felt for anyone before could not substitute the need for sadism in OotP. Then in DH we have students casting it on other students though we never see it. What we did see was Draco successfully casting it on Rowle because he was afraid. Like what?

The mechanics of spells seem to change over the course of canon. One of the biggest shifts took place from OotP to HBP in which you no longer need to know the correct pronunciation, precise wand movement and practice to be able to cast a spell as indicated by sectumsempra. What was the point of DA then? Umbridge was right that you don't need to cast spells before the exam to pass it.

****** Ah, okay. Sounds about right, from what I remember. I was more curious as to what the biggest/strongest effect the knockback could have. Like, could it throw you through a stone wall? That kind of thing.

Oh, not even Rowling seems to know for certain how spellcasting in the series works. There's bugger all consistency between books in regard to the spellcasting. Each book seems to mostly remain logical and consistent and semi-sensible itself (aside from shit like chaining up Pettigrew immediately after the whole 'he can turn into a tiny rat' conversation), but you're totally right in that there's little to no constancy of spell mechanics throughout the series as a whole and the semi-established rules are broken most of the time they're mentioned outside of the book that introduces them. Rowling really needed a better editor to get her worldbuilding in order. Or just a continuity director, at least. :D
