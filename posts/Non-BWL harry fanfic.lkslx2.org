** Tom Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism in linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense), so there's no Prophecy, no horcruxes, lots of people are still alive including all of the Marauders, and he doesn't call himself "Voldemort" - but blood-based discrimination and segregation are now legally enforced, with non-purebloods banned from Hogwarts and from holding government offices, and legislation is on the way that would forbid muggle-born mages from marrying half-bloods, thus keeping muggle influences on the fringes of magical society.

Harriett is a half-blood, like canon, but she's determined to study Potions under Professor Snape anyway, and plots with her pureblooded cousin to switch places at school. Shenanigans ensue, along with thrills, spills, plots, pranks, narrow escapes, and high stakes. Book four recently finished, book five is coming soon.
