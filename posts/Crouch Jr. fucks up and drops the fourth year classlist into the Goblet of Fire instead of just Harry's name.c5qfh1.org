Hermione in canon really doesn't do well without planning. It's actually one of my favorite character flaws. Harry meanwhile lucks into every situation.

For the best champion, Harry definitely fits the bill. He might even have fit the bill compared to the Cedric (not skill or anything, just the most entertainment I suppose. And Harry is more well-known).

That was something I noticed even after OotP but especially after HBP when you compare them with Snape's year. They've got 'OWLs were so easy I didn't need to study' James and Sirius who along with Peter became animagi, with Remus, they make a map of Hogwarts /that tracks students' identities and movements,/ PotionsGenius!Snape, and Lily who was supposed to be amazing at charms and that year's version of Hermione (or was that last part fanon?)

******* That depends entirely of the goals of the plan. Every thing about Voldemort down to his nom de guerre (which despite fanfics mocking it over the years means "Flight from Death" in the sense of "Flight /of/ Death" like William of Occam) shows that he feeds on fear. And pulling off a (seemingly) ludicrous kidnapping that everyone would believe to be impossible can instill that fear as an opening move of his return. Or to put it another way, this section from The Dark Lord's Equal by Lens of Sanity

#+begin_quote
  Still, this is not nearly as farfetched as my gut seems to think it is. I've been using the one lesson Voldemort really taught me, even if doing so was wholly unintentionally on his part; Play Big.

   

  Most people don't try to play in the big leagues because they're scared by the level of competition, or perhaps the higher stakes. And the one thing I learned from Voldemort is that when playing at the top, there is in truth far less competition, and doing things that are impossible is surprisingly straightforward.

   

  All it takes is balls.

   

  When I was fourteen I was kidnapped during an International Event, the Tri-Wizard Tournament. I was taken from a super-high security area, right under the nose of thousands of spectators, the entire British Auror Office, and the protection of Albus Dumbledore.

   

  An individual who, despite my personal feelings toward the man, is nobody's fool.

   

  Not only that but we were under the wards of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an impenetrable fortress, whose wards cannot be bypassed by any save the Headmaster himself. Well, strictly speaking there are workarounds, such as a Founder's Ring which must be specifically blocked, but none of them were used in the kidnapping.

   

  To add further complexity, the kidnapping had to happen on a specific date; the 24th of June, three days after mid-summer. This was necessary for a Ritual as it was the optimal date for rebirth.

   

  So from a planning perspective most people would say it too much of a challenge, and come up with an easier plan. This is fine. Easier plans are best. He could have found an easier target. He could have used a Ritual with a broader date range, and then ordered one of his people wait for an opportunistic moment and throw a portkey at me or something.

   

  But doing it that way lacks, zazz.

   

  It doesn't have the same impact, or air of impossibility which strikes fear into your enemies and leaves the ignorant masses gaping in awe.

   

  So you stop and think; okay, if I was me, how would I go about a totally unfeasible kidnapping? How difficult would it actually be?

   

  It helps that his minion's father was Head of Cooperation, and directly involved in the Tournament. Bam, Imperius Curse. You now have someone in authority that can nudge the schedule and have the third task on your required Ritual date. You do this months in advance of when it happens, so nobody will even notice anything has been changed at all.

   

  Next step is to get your target into the competition, hard. And have your target win said competition, harder.

  [....]

  Getting the target into the competition was the only part Barty had to achieve which was really necessary to the plan. Cheating to help me was nice, but fuck it I'm Harry Potter, I was always going to win anyway, it is who I am. And anyone with the 'Power to Vanquish' our chessmaster was clearly going to win a competition against bloody school kids.

  The winner of the Tournament is portkeyed to the centre stage to be named Champion, therefore the Trophy-Portkey is exempt from the impenetrable fortresses wards. Modifying the destination is so laughably easy that all it would have taken had both Barty Jr. and Barty Sr. been killed, was sending Wormtail to do it the night before.

   

  So the impossibility of kidnapping someone in the middle of an International Event actually only rests on two things, Bartemius Crouch Sr. being under the Imperius, and getting the target's name to come out of the Goblet of Fire.

   

  Doing it that way has zazz. There is no doubting that. All it takes it the balls to try something that most would write off as ludicrously impossible.

** I read a story with a plot very similar to this. I think it involved time travel or something. Anyway, Harry adds a bunch of names to the Goblet including Snape, Dumbledore and at least one of the Crouches and Tom Riddle. There is also a first year who shares the same name as a ministry official who ticked Harry off, so the goblet picks the first year. Deal is that not fullfilling the magical contract that you entered when your name was put into the goblet makes you loose your magic, so there is plenty of mayhem happening at the weighing of the wands.

*** No, it would not be easier. Crouch's method is simply adding to what is already there. Convincing the Goblet to choose Harry as Hogwarts' champion would mean interfering with the core enchantment and primary function of the Goblet.

Not only would that enchantment be extremely protected, it would be difficult to change and it would be catastrophic if it was done wrong.

The Goblet is a complicated piece of magic. Even Dumbledore didn't mess with the Goblet's enchantments, to enforce the age requirements, instead relying on the Age Line.

In order to change the Hogwarts champion, Moody would have to study the Goblet intensely, and figure out how the enchantment works, then override that enchantment to get his results. Depending on how the Goblet is enchanted or programmed, the Goblet could be running the same evaluation spell/process for each school, meaning if he changed the Hogwarts process, he could also be changing the other school's processes as well.

Instead of changing the process itself, Crouch changed the number of times the Goblet ran the process, which means the Goblet is using its own magic to select Harry as champion.

Crouch's method is actually far easier, quicker, and less intrusive than the alternative.

***** There was no age requirement enchanted onto the Goblet and there never has been. Students of all ages used to be able to compete. They only implemented the age restriction in the newest iteration of the tournament, and as I said, Dumbledore was wary of manipulating the enchantment of the Goblet, which is why he drew the Age Line instead.

** I don't think this would work. At best, someone else would be chosen, depending on the cups criteria for "best student" (i.e accomplishments vs academic scores, or some unknown measurement of magical power). Crouch would have had to add some 40 schools to the cup (if that's the Canon method he used, I can't remember) for this scenario to happen, which aside from blatant author bs I don't see Crouch doing

*** Well,this wouldn't be a serious fic and would be more crack. I personally envisioned it as Crouch's student list is on a small piece of parchment with the names being so close together it sorta confuses the Goblet into thinking it's one long name .And he also would put the class list in by accident (Moody's eye is messing with his vision so he accidentally writes the fake school name onto it as well)
