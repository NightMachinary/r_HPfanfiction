*** This one is seconded and has two sequels, although it will never be truly completed due to Author Existence Failure.

It gets quite political later.

  Forced to compete and abandoned by his friends, he steps from the tent with only one goal in mind, suicide. Instead Harry awakens a power that spans time and space and starts a war between the worlds.

  - At 14, Harry Potter really wasn't prepared for the Triwizard Tournament, but if he was forced to compete he was going to do his very best.

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan

** Does anyone know the fic where the dragon Harry faces in the TWT was actually a shapeshifting Japanese Princess who he befriended by speaking to her in Parseltongue? And I think Snape gets together with her friend that's a Kitsune?

Honestly prpbably not what you're looking for, OP, since I remember it being a comedy and not taken too seriously, but he does befriend a dragon and your post reminded me of it, just can't remember the name.
