*** I would disagree.

Her values much more align with Ravenclaw, valuing knowledge above all else. Look at her Boggart. Look at "or worse expelled". Does she have a few qualities that may align with Gryffindor? Perhaps. I would contend those are vastly overshadowed.

Her sorting into Gryffindor just shows how much JK likes good in Gryffindor, Villains in Slytherin, and the extras elsewhere. I would say that occured more so than her fitting the qualities of Gryffindor.

**** You're looking at this the wrong way. We can't argue that Rowling's Sorting was /untrue/. Whether Rowling convincingly /wrote/ her as a Gryffindor afterwards is another matter entirely, but she /was/ Sorted into Gryffindor, /therefore/ her core personality must be heroic more than it is scholarly, even if she exhibits scholarly traits more often than heroic ones in day-to-day life.

Point is, if you're trying to make a single-point-of-departure-from-canon type of thing, as OP seems to be doing, then if Hermione stayed the same, then the only logical outcome will be that she gets in Gryffindor again, for whatever reason landed her there in canon, /unless/ there has been a visible change in her personality from the canon one as a result of the point of departure.

***** I would respectfully disagree. The whole point of fanfiction is airing our "disagreements" with Rowling, whether it be in plot holes or characterizations (the sorting being one of these). In fanfiction /canon is not the holy grail/, but rather a reference material. I would contend that Hermione's sortings is one of those things that just doesn't make sense. Your progression of reasoning only is true if the sorting is infallible, which I don't believe to be true.

Surely Crabbe and Goyle were not the epitomes of Slytherin, of what little we see of them they seem more Hufflepuffish than anything. They may value cunning, but their loyalty is second to none regardless of what Draco does. The sorting is not infallible.

****** I think it's more likely that the sorting hat sorts you based on your values and who you want to be over who you are. Crabbe and Goyle may seem "loyal" but they grew up valuing Slytherin traits and people like Draco. Neville wasn't necessarily brave, but he wanted to be brave like his parents more than anything. And Hermione embodies the traits of Ravenclaw, but she's the first to know that knowledge is not everything because there's "more important things like friendship and bravery" which she longed for but didn't have at the time of her sorting.

To OP, aside from Gryffindor, I could possibly see Harry and Hermione as Hufflepuff since they both just desperately wanted friends...

****** That depends on the fanfiction. It's the whole point of /some/ fanfictions, but others are just what-ifs scenario that exploit the large sandbox of a universe left behind by Rowling, without really trying to /improve/ the originals so much as do something else with them.

And either way, I don't see Hermione's Sorting as that much of plothole /if/ you do work from the idea that the Sorting isn't infallible as you seem to contend. No offence, but your position is literally self-contradictory. Either the Sorting Hat /is/ infallible (and then if Hermione does belong in Ravenclaw as you argue, it's a plothole that the Hat doesn't place her there), or it is /not/ (and then it is perfectly normal if Hermione doesn't get in Ravenclaw under the same premise, and moreover there's no reason the Sorting Hat should work any /better/ in your story than it did in canon).

Are you sure of that? Regardless of the Sorting's debatable infallibility, the Crabbe and Goyle thing just gets repeated over and over and I just don't think it's true. Crabbe and Goyle may or may not value cunning, but they certainly like and seek out /power/ and think highly of their own abililties (note Goyle's hubris with the Fiendfyre).

Moreover, they're never shown to be that /loyal/ to Draco on a personal level; they're his "professional" henchmen, but as seen in DH, they're quick to run away and leave him behind if it's to save themselves. They don't at all seem to value hard work and playing fair, either. Overall, Crabbe and Goyle were sorry individuals not particularly fit for /any/ House, but I don't think they fitted in Hufflepuff /more/ than in Slytherin.

The first was after the Dobby incident (a can of soup as dinner, which has less than 300 calories instead of the 800 a meal for a boy in his age should have and he even had to share that with Hedwig) and the second was Dudley's diet, which might be fine for someone clinically obese but definitely not for someone who had been malnutritioned for a decade. 1/4 of a Grapefruit is 30 calories and that was Harry's breakfast (instead of the recommended 800-1000). That's 5% of what a fourteen-year-old boy is supposed to get. Gulag's serve richer meals.

*** I'll be honest. Really honest. This needs a lot of work. I've read through the first few chapters and then the last few. I mean, it needs /a lot/ of work. The grammar is, quite frankly, terrible. Really, the whole thing isn't good.

There are no paragraphs when there should be. Each new dialogue by another person needs to be on the next paragraph. Yours is all jumbled together and it makes for an incredibly difficult read.

You're also copying and pasting straight from canon, which is boring, unoriginal, and lazy. We've all read the books. There's no need to tell us all this information once more. There's no real difference besides the fact that Harry is now Ivy. Everything else is pretty much the exact same. It's not even worth reading as we don't get any new surprises, any new twists, or anything new at all.

And there are numerous capitalization issues, places where commas should be but are not, no periods where they should be, misspellings and etc.

I'm not saying all this to insult you. It's just really not at all good, mate. You didn't even try and it's obvious. Much of it copied straight from the book and seeing as you hadn't even sorted them ten days ago... well, that just means you "wrote" basically the entire thing in ten days.

Don't just put them in the same house out of convenience or a preference, actually think through if they are similar enough to warrant it.

I dislike that notion. I think it comes down more to what the person values in themselves. Hermione is a smart girl, sure. Both of her parents are doctors and presumably then intelligent. Hermione has likely been constantly around a group of people where intelligence is more assumed than an obvious value. But, despite all of that, she does not value intelligence more than anything. She's even fairly clear on that at the end of Sorcerer's Stone when she depreciates her own value in place of Harry's bravery.

I think, as a whole, Hermione values bravery and nerve more than she values intelligence. And thus, I think she fits more in Gryffindor.

I think the notion of the houses 'taking' people is backwards. Smart people do not necessarily value intelligence above all else. I think the house traits should more closely coincide with what the person themselves values the most.

IE: I'm a pretty smart person. I have multiple college degrees. I'm very well read. I can figure out and do just about anything with little instruction. I never had issues in school or after with anything like that.

I would hate being in Ravenclaw. I do not value intelligence and Wit over anything else. More often than not I find those traits to be more annoying than anything. I'd put myself in Hufflepuff because I value nothing more than the ability to bear down and do it. Hard Work, to me, is of a far greater quality than being smart.

In short, I view Hermione the same way. Sure, she's smart. But that isn't what she values more than anything else.

**** If canon hadn't placed her in Gryffindor no one would have bat an eye if she was placed in Ravenclaw. My issue isn't with the placement; I don't think Gryffindor would be a bad fit per se, rather it was because she was a hero and thus had to be in Gryffindor.

Her emphasis on exams clearly shows her value of knowledge, no one else around here comes close in the frantic level of preparation. She literally used a /freaking time machine/ in order to take more classes. Who does that but a Ravenclaw? Her devotion and valuation of studies is not in question. As to the quote in Book 1? On a singular occurrence she says she values bravery higher, but in her actions she shows what matters to her time and time again. Actions speak louder than words.

In general I certainly agree with your evaluation of houses not taking people, along with that smart people aren't necessarily in Ravenclaw. But Hermione isn't the stereotypical smart person. She doesn't learn for some ambitious plan to take over the world, rather she learns because she loves it, hence the book always in her hand.

#+end_quote

Multiple occurrences actually show this. While you use the example of 'or worse, expelled' that actually misses the point. Sure, she has a gigantic fear of failure, but that NEVER prevents her from following through on whatever actions could get her expelled. Which could be argued shows that she's willing to face some of her biggest fears to act how she deems necessary for the benefit of her friends. Which is an incredibly brave trait. And one that isn't often particularly intelligent.

Her frantic levels of studying also come off as more Hufflepuffian than Ravenclawian. She is willing to put in excessive amounts of hard work to achieve her goals. Prepardness is time and effort, not simply inherent intelligence. And her pestering Harry and Ron to study could also be seen as wanting them to actually put in the effort rather than worrying about if they're right or wrong. It's worth noting, I think, that she never has much of an issue correcting their homework AFTER they've made an attempt at it. But she wont just give them the answers. Her qualm is not them not understanding the subject. Her qualm is them not putting forth the effort to understand the subject.

And her fear isn't being stupid. It's failing. It's that after all her work, time, and effort, she wasn't good enough. That's a lot deeper than simply being an intelligence based line

As for the time machine? Again, that strikes me as a more Hufflepuff thing than a Ravenclaw thing. She is going through an incredible amount of effort to do so, to the point of adding hours to the days and exhausting herself. Someone who values pure intelligence rather than Hard Work probably wouldn't do that.

I think it's a gross simplification of her character to just say 'she's smart she must be Ravenclaw'. Almost nothing about her screams Ravenclaw except for the fact that she likes to study.

Hell, as for Wit, she doesn't banter with anyone and she's rarely particularly quick verbally. And of the three heroes, she's the one that quickly resorts to physical violence against Draco in PoA. Again, she's willing to attack three boys while outnumbered and female, PHYSICALLY when she's capable magically, to defend her friends. That's brave. That isn't intelligent.

Hermione is a Gryffindor. Hell, I'd probably rank her Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, Slytherin. And i don't even really like her character. But I feel the oversimplification of 'she works her ass off to be intelligent, thus she must be in Ravenclaw' ignores a lot of her character.

***** Irrelevant, but I would argue that your definition of "not a stereotypical smart person" sounds exactly like a stereotypical smart person - someone who learns because they love it. Your stereotypical smart person sounds like Voldemort..

I also think that Hermione isn't just learning to learn. I think she happened to be very smart and knew it and used it to prove herself as a muggleborn in the wizarding world. I think she put a lot of pressure on herself to represent muggleborns and to also cement her place in the Golden Trio.

And also you said it. Actions speak louder than words. Hermione is someone who ditched her 7th year of school and memory-wiped her family to become a war hero. Year after year, she could have hung back and advised Harry as a knowledge resource vs. getting physically involved in adventures and fights. And her end goal has always been heroism- save the house-elves, save Harry, save the Wizarding World.. She's not like Luna who wants to spend her life discovering new species for the heck of it. She is someone who knows she's smart and used her intelligence as a tool to fight for the causes she believed in.

I also think that one of the reasons Hermione was not a Ravenclaw is that it would have been too easy. She grew up with her nose in a book but she was friendless. She already knew she had intelligence, but she /wanted/ bravery. So she bravely stepped outside of her comfort zone, chose to be a Gryffindor, and became probably one of the notable figures in her house! So the hat did indeed do its job to sort her to where she could blossom most. Very little else trumps "helped save wizarding world"..

***** But by that logic, there's no way Peter Pettigrew could have been in Gryffindor, since his actions were cowardly and the exact opposite of what a Gryffindor should be, more cunning and ambitious like a Slytherin. Meanwhile, Luna certainly demonstrated all of the courage and individuality that Gryffindor exemplifies. And you could argue that any one of the main characters could have been in Hufflepuff because they were intensely loyal to each other. People may not always /act/ according to what they value. Maybe Pettigrew /wanted/ to be heroic and courageous, but didn't act accordingly when it mattered.

Hermione may, even subconsciously, value courage more than knowledge. Just look at her whole stance about Voldemort's name: "Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself." Granted, Dumbledore was the one who said it first, but Hermione really bought into it and took up that mantle. While the concept is analytical and rooted in logic, the entire point is to overcome fear.

The hat isn't simply boiling a person down into one trait and throwing them into the matching house. It's evaluating the person's character, values, and complexities and determining where they would fit best. Harry was sorted into Gryffindor and not Slytherin because he requested "not Slytherin." It's not all a neat cookie-cutter process. Hermione is more than just smart. Yes, she loves learning and clearly values knowledge, but there's more to her than that. She isn't afraid to break rules and charge headfirst into something stupid if she needs to. She works hard, putting more effort into her schoolwork (and other things) than she really needs to. She strives to always be the best and can get a little miffed when she isn't. She displays traits aligned with each of the houses. The hat decided that, based on the /combination/ of her traits and values, that Gryffindor was the best fit for her.
