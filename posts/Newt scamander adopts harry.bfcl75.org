I had an idea of a story to write, and was wondering if anybody else had a similar story or idea. Newt scamander finds an abandoned baby panther/kitten/other animal that has been badly abused. It turns out to be a very sick toddler Harry Potter who, in a powerful burst of accidental magic during a beating by dursley, transports himself to a time where he would be accepted for who he was, while also turning himself into an animal in the process. I think this would be an amazing story concept however I've tried to write in the past, and speech related grammar is very hard for me to comprehend. If enough people are interested in it though I'd be willing to try!


** I think it would be a great story. I'd read it

** I think there is one similar about Newt finding a obscurial! Harry Potter and adopting him, if I ever find the link again, I'll post it here.

  Newt Scamander finds a severely injured shape shifting baby animal on the streets of London. Unbeknownst to him, the animal is a very powerful and (was) a very powerful wizard in his own time. Featuring deaged!Harry. This is my first story so any constructive criticism is appreciated. Warning- contains flashbacks of abuse.

***** This is my first story. I just uploaded the second chapter which is hopefully a bit longer. I'd appreciate any tips to bulk out some chapters though

****** That first paragraph could be several paragraphs, each sentence could be fleshed out, what was foreboding, why was it foreboding... Maybe he was dreading it back in the common room, and he and seamus had a short conversation about it?

Tell us more about the painful injuries. Don't say they were inflicted upon him, let Harry stew on them who gave them to him, why they gave them to him, were they simply accidental, was Harry giving anyone any lip at the time (which he does), tell us exactly what sort of pain, and how it's inconveniencing him as he tries to griffindor it out. Don't tell us he's scared of Snape, because Harry never said he was scared, just that snape was scary. Let the kids bravado act up a bit, and then tell us how the two men are similar. Because as far as the reader knows, they're not similar at all.

How was Harry starting the wart curing potion? Why's Harry nervous? Who said something to change his personality and facade? That bit could be very interesting to explore as a conversation before he even got to the classroom. How much focus was he giving to the chopping? How did he know that Draco threw something into his cauldron? Give us some more foreboding before the potion explodes. Did the solution change colour? did the solubles start hissing, was there bubbling? Did anything start glowing?

When you say "The next moment was chaos." That should be on its own line, and then start a new line to continue on. It breaks the flow up and forces us to imagine the chaos. How do we know that Harry is now a toddler, rather than just shrunk? Expand on that a bit.

Asking questions about stuff that the author imagines, but the reader doesn't because the author never fleshed it out, is how you expand a few hundred words into a few thousand. A first chapter should be at least two and a half thousand words, not two and a half hundred. By answering all the questions I gave you, you should be able to do that.

*** I'm really considering writing it! Will update this post when I have the first chapter written. I have a few twists including a possibly female and deaged harry. I apologize if there are a lot of grammatical errors though!

**** I uploaded the first chapter! And I'm taking a huge step out of my comfort zone by writing a Male harry, since I feel like a female twist would get too much backlash.

** It sounds great. But I am a little concerned, I don't want to wait 3 years before the story is finished. Can you give me a time estimate when the story is finished? And an estimate for how long it will be.

*** I am making it up as I go along so there is really no estimate I can give you. But I do expect it to cover as many fantastic beasts movies as possible so it will be quite long
