I've been trying to get back into reading fanfic recently but I keep dropping stories with over the top bashing (weasleys stealing, dumbledore a master manipulator, etc.), Or secretly the main character has this god mode power and nothing can stop them... It's all just so.. meh. I'd prefer if Harry was the main character but at this point I don't even care as long as the story has good progression, makes sense, and the MC either is realistically badass or slowly turns into one. Thanks in advance!

  Ousted from Hogwarts by a gang of corrupt, incompetent officials, Albus comes to the understanding that Voldemort is not his only enemy. Now, fighting on two fronts against the Ministry and Voldemort, he finds himself in dire need of an ally. One who, like him, is a wizard of uncommon power and skill. Canon Departure from OotP. Gen.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path][Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path]] is one of my favorites, it is a bit OP and I think a bit of Ron bashing but it's not a focus if I remember correctly.

** linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

It takes 30-some chapters for Harry to gain "OP" status, he loses as often as he wins, zero tropes (no Black Library, no goblin inheritance, no Founders knowledge), kids don't brush off death and mayhem at the drop of a hat, adults aren't bumbling incompetent idiots, international travel, ancient mythological villain in addition to Voldemort, creative battle magic like you've never seen. If you read one action fic this year, make it ASAoV.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29158347]]) Really good Minerva's character study in a AU setting. You can see her character change gradually to the canon version of badass empowered Minerva over time. Warning for angst.
