** I think the use of 'headcanons' in your post might go some way to explaining why people can become so defensive about certain ideas.

Basically, I think /for the most part/ people are willing to live and let live when it comes to working with AU elements or extensions to what we know. This isn't a perfect system, as some people are simply dicks, and others regard fanfiction as a zero-sum game where someone writing about idea X is automatically someone /not/ writing about their preferred idea Y, but the vast majority are quite happy to simply pass on things they're not interested in.

Where things start to get hairy is in declaring things 'fanon', 'headcanon' or 'reinterpreted canon'. This tends to involve statements about how the books /actually/ work, which many regard as someone trying to impose their view of canon onto them.

Consider Luna. Some people regard her has merely being quirky, while others regard that quirkiness as indicative of something deeper. The issues start to crop up when people who have one view of canon are told by another that autistic!Luna is actually canon, so far as they're concerned. With how deeply invested fanfic readers/writers necessarily are in the fandom and their interpretations of canon, people have a tendency to react as if they're being personally attacked.

It's very similar to the backlash that Rowling often sees when 'expanding' canon through Pottermore or, even more controversially, tweets. Sometimes these additions will invalidate closely held beliefs of long-time fans, and they will lash out, because they feel like something has been stolen from them.

'This is an AU where Harry is definitely bi.' will probably be more likely to be positively received than 'I headcanon Harry as bi, so this is canon-compatible' for that reason. One is a limited statement that Harry, in the story the writer controls, is bi, while the other is a statement that the writer thinks that /canon/ Harry is bi, and, thus, that anyone who thinks Harry is straight is wrong.

It's not a good thing, by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not malicious. Except in the cases where it is malicious. But I still think those are pretty rare. It's mostly down to how people communicate their thoughts, and how people come to hold their personal interpretations as sacred.

But then I would think that, I've always had a bit of a tense relationship with concepts like headcanon, fanon or 'canon by implication'.

** My main issue with many of these is the concept of "no evidence" it "not canon". By definition most fanfics are non canon compliant. I suppose but the strictest sense if the word no fanfiction can be. I mean the very idea of fanfiction is that it deviated from canon at a certain point.

That people get so very angry about that kind of dumbfounds me. I mean I can understand not appreciating certain "genre" of fanfiction so to speak. Not everyone is going to like slash or a redeemed Tom riddle. So I have no answer for you really. I don't understand.

** I like Luna being schizotypal rather than asd but don't have strong feelings either way.

In my experience all Dra/Sna ships get full hate here regardless of how gay they are. Tomarry does a bit better than those two... Idk about Tomione. But yeah, Dramione and Snamione are definitely not loved around here.

Linkao3([[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/15465966]]) gets recced occasionally, iirc it features a bi Harry in a relationship with a dude. There's definitely prejudice against slash here but sometimes very cool stories can rise above it.

  -The mere prospect of Harry Potter being Bisexual. (How dare you! Ludicrous! No evidence!)
#+end_quote

This is a new one for me: I've read a few and somehow managed not to find any reactions of the type you describe. Though that might be because I tend to skip the stories that just rehash canon. Skillfully woven plot that results from changes done to a character is a beautiful thing to behold.

I still draw my line in the sand: Drarry, Snarry, LuciusxHarry... Most of the ones I have found to date are just poorly disguised harlequins, exploring the author's fetishes and nothing more. Some were simply uninteresting. The rest... Well, I need to restock on bleach.

#+end_quote

Well, I can understand not wanting your favourite character to be needlessly handicapped, as most of those fics do. Link me a work that has a plot that contains more than "Luna is now diabled, the end." That doesn't glorify disabilities. That doesn't soapbox (in an explicit fashion. Some leaks are unavoidable).

And I'll not only read it, I'll thank you and get to writing that Recommendation post in this sub.

  -The absurd notion that Tom Riddle is more than just a children's book\\
  villain- (HE IS EVIL! No redemption! Where are your Morals?!)
#+end_quote

That's a good one!

The problem with most of the "redemption" stories is that they do not actually redeem the villain. After all, to be redeemed, a character would need to examine themselves and their actions (either spontaneously or as a result of someone else's actions), see them as wrong and try to make up for it somehow. After all, Lord Voldemort doesn't hide his skeletons in a closet, he sits on a throne made of them, raised on a mountain of corpses!

Is the redemption still possible? Yes, certainly! But it would require years or decades of effort repaying his many, many victims.

This is not a problem that can be resolved by simply getting together by Lord V getting together with Harry/Sevvie/ReaderOC. Love does not, in fact, conquer all. You can't just flip a switch and say: "There, he's good now!"

It just doesn't work this way.

Redemption story does not need to actually feature the finally redeemed character, but it does need to feature the journey of redemption. The struggle. Facing of one's flaws, one's sins. Of making an active effort to do what is right instead of what is easy. Of tirelessly toiling not for the forgiveness of others, but to assuage the newly awakened guilt and to be able to look at oneself in the mirror.

Most stories fail terribly at this.

  -International education; canonically, American students attend Ilvermorny. (GATEKEEPING! Hogwarts is our home!)
#+end_quote

I honestly do not see what the issue here is. Regardless if we trust the canon on "Hogwarts is the best", it is never stated to be the only school. It's not even stated to be the only one in Europe. Since I don't remember any mention of American schools (or lack of thereof) in the original 7, the matter is fully up to the writer.

Illvermorny is, however, the fanon version of "Hogwarts but American". It shares many traits and traditions in the fics I have read, including a House system. It feels like a copout, an easy option - it's only natural people would dislike that.

After all, if the author goes to all the pains to move the action over the ocean, they should be arsed to at least pretend USA isn't Britain 2.0

Yes.

And in more detail, selection bias. By far the majority doesn't care (that is, they simply ignore it, because Simply Not Reading something is a thing -- people are inherently lazy). People just look at unrepresentative places and remember the outliers.

** I think it's more a case of things like sexuality clashing with the established characters from canon.

For example, Harry in canon is only portrayed as heterosexual. He does attraction to Cho and to Ginny most prominently, and notes that other female characters are attractive. He never displays any attraction to male characters, therefore it's classed as OOC if he's written as any other sexuality. If an author wants to write someone LGBTQ, great, carry on. But you may as well write an OC instead of changing an established character.

  He describes Cedric and Bill as being very good looking
#+end_quote

Speaking as a (heterosexual) man, noticing that another man is good looking does not mean any romantic interest. I mean, it's not like we are blind or totally unaware of the canon of beauty. It can be pretty shallow, but sometimes it can means something as simple as "He is good looking, he must have it easy with girls".

â€‹

#+begin_quote
  and people thinking they're het until they realize they aren't is super common
#+end_quote

While it may be true in the real world, I don't like this argument into fiction because, using it as a foundation, you can make absollutely every character Bi or Gay:

- Character shows romantic interest into a character of the same sex = he is gay
- Character does not show romantic interest into a character of the same sex = he is totally gay, he just doesn't know it yet
- Character does not show romantic interest into a character of the same sex, and is mocking any same sex relationships = He is gay, and acting as a homophobe because he doesn't understand he is gay yet

In fictions, I consider that a character can only be "canonically" what he is shown into the story. In the case of Harry, he only shows romantic interest to girls (Cho and Ginny), so he is hetero.

In the end, it doesn't really matter what Harry is since Fanfictions author are totally free to change it. But I think it's important to have a very clear understanding about what is Canon, and what is not (Killing Curse is, Magical Cores are not). People are free to have any Headcanon they want, but Headcanon are different from Canon and should not be presented as it.

â€‹

Basically, anyone is free to say that Harry is gay or bi in his Headcanon, and nothing should argue about that. But it's totally justified for people to react if someone tries to sell that as "Canon".

****** There is also a difference between something being possible and something being likely. Everything that isn't explicitly denied is possible. But since novels are novels, and not textbooks or encyclopaedias, and in the interest of having a reasonable, shared universe of Canon facts to build on, you add a cut-off when something is /too/ unlikely and declare it not Canon.

And to this category belongs Harry being attracted to men, Hermione being black, Snape being a vampire, Dumbledore secretly being Gandalf, and the whole of Canon!world only existing in Harry's mind. It's just common sense.

As for the rest, everything @PlusMortgage said. Write whatever FF you want, but to insist this is reality in Canon just leaves me hopelessly confused. What's the gain? Why does it matter? Is it some kind of need for validation? I'd hope people are more self-confident then that. I really don't get it ðŸ¤·

â€‡

*Edit:* Incidentally, where you easily see the difference is when you look at wikis and lexica. The HP wiki has a tendency to do precisely your approach, which is why it fails as a source of Canon fact checking when writing FF for me. I'm not interested in speculative answers, I'm interested in hard facts. Thus, the HP Lexicon, which limits itself strictly to that, is a much preferable source of Canon information.

And building on that, I then can add my own ideas into the story, exploring unexplained niches and blanks -- without insisting they'd be Canon. It's not a matter of "you can't do that", it's a matter of book-keeping.

** Hmm I haven't given much thought to these points except for the last one, but then again, I'm not that involved in the fandom. The only reason why I know about the slash point was because I briefly dived into the potterzone app for a couple weeks before deleting it.

Come to think of it, I don't believe that I have read many fics featuring bisexual Harry. Maybe you do have a point..
