Hey! Does anyone have stories in which Harry has a different Boggart than a dementor? Like the Cupboard Prompt posted earlier, the Basilisk or hell, himself?

Thanks in advance !

** Harry Is A Dragon, And That's Okay: linkffn(13230340)

Harry's Boggart is himself having gone full Smaug - gigantic, greedy and dangerous.

For bonus points, Neville's Boggart isn't Professor Snape either (because said Professor has been toned down significantly, so Neville has no real reason to be scared) - it's Bellatrix Lestrange.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

** I'll look through some fics because I can't remember the name. But a few instances come to mind such as Harry himself (being a pawn, being evil, being mediocre, etc), his friends dying (I think this was a time-travel fic), Vernon, and Lockhart (year 2 plot was not canon but I won't spoil it in case you read it). I'll let you know if I find them but I don't have high hopes because it tends to be a small part of the story. Though hopefully some other people remember these stories. You'll probably find this trope in a lot of Harry returns to his younger body stories.

** I can vaguely remember a fic where Harry's Boggart is himself but weak- he had broken glasses and he was cowering. Unfortunately I can't remember the fic name- it might have been a mentor Voldemort or a Voldemort/Harry fic (don't come for me lol), and he saw himself as someone Voldemort wouldn't care about, someone who could be easily abused by the Dursley's.

** Not a Harry story but if your looking for some interesting takes on Boggarts then TheDivineComedian does some fantastic stories

linkao3(Calibration by TheDivineComedian) in particular.

Also this one gave me literal chills. linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13823533/1/]])

  Remus's mind is usually a tidy place. The worst has already happened, what's left to be scared of? His fears are labelled, annotated, and most of all, archived. For one evening, though, he'll have to let them come out and play. (Remus prepares the Boggart for his lesson with the third years. Featuring Severus Snape as an unwanted critic, and Sirius Black as the elephant in the room.)

  What are you more afraid of: the Boggart itself, or the few seconds right before it picks its shape?

** I know of two of those; Riddle in the Dark by LeeASherlook linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13372427/1/Riddle-in-the-Dark]]), The Boggart by hypotemoose linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3894532/1/The-Boggart]]).

In the first one he sees Tom Riddle and in the second one he sees himself.

  ONE SHOT. Fifth year. Harry arrives late to potions class and Snape confronts him with a boggart. Why is Harry so reluctant to face it if his greatest fear is Dementors?
