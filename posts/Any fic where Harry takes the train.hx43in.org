I don't necessarily care if something happens afterward or not, I only want to read one in which Harry is so fed up with everything that he just jumps at the opportunity of an ending

Edit: ... For those that didn't understand I'm talking about the train to the afterlife in the 7th book


** And here I was wondering how harry would steal the hogwarts express.

  Fleur and Tonks' plans for the future get derailed. Now they are pulled into Harry's hunt for horcruxes. How will things go with an Auror and a trained Curse Breaker along? Rated M for language, mild violence, and sexual situations.

** I thought you meant he takes the train in second year, instead of being locked out. I was confused upon reading further.
