:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, as the title says. It's a fic where Petunia, while bitter at the wizarding world, isn't truly hateful at Harry, seeing him as a victim of 'stupid freaks with no commonsense'. By the time the letter comes for harry, he hates magic. And plans to destroy the magical peoples.

Are there any fics like this?

  What if Petunia put the blame where it belonged instead of on Harry? OOC Petunia Dursley Rating for mild language

*** The 3rd option. I find that the best way for Petunia to truly get back at the magical world would be to raise a magic hating wizard. With the wizard being harry, the boy who lived, aka, magical super jesus to the British wizards, along with being, by prophecy, the only one to beat Tom, would be an interesting fic.

I can see harry, with this mindset, sometime after 5th year using logic and reasoning against Dumbledore to explain why destroying all magic is the power he knows not.

Tom gets his personal power and his method of immortality from magic. By destroying magic, Harry defeats Tom and also succeeds in his personal goal. The prophecy doesn't specifically state love is that power. Sure, Tom's hate for all who won't bow to him vs Harry's self sacrificing love for all others are nice opposing beliefs. But Tom's belief of magic being his form of personal power vs Harry's hatred of all magic are good ways to envision the conflicting parts of the prophecy.

Thanks.

*** On the one hand, good on you for providing a link to a fic.

On the other hand.... bad fic. Technically, I guess, better than My Immortal, but at least My Immortal was original, or something.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

*** No, as long as the hatred was towards the magical world and not magic itself. A Harry not wanting to use magic wouldn't be able to do much. One using magic to destroy the magical world could be quite terrifying.
