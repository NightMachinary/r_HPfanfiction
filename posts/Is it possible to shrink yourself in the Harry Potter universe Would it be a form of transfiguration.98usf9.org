** No it's a charm. You've changed a property, not its nature.

Probably yes, but there is at least some evidence from canon that casting spells on oneself is generally more difficult than to other targets. Part of this might be psychological; wizards may subconsciously resist the idea of dramatically changing themselves with magic.

That's up for debate. From our understanding of biology and physics you can't just make a life-form infinitely smaller or bigger and have them still function the same. Heart rate would have to be increased at the very least if you make a human much smaller than what is normal human sizes (like an order of magnitude or more).

There's an interesting video by "Kurzgesagt" that goes into this at least a little bit: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUWUHf-rzks]]

***** Sure, I expected such a response. But if a human muggle or an elephant relied on science and physics and his biology to survive, but after shrinking him he only survives by the grace of magic, surely you changed his/its nature. Which is my entire point.

This is the HP universe, clearly I'm fine with Magic defying and contradicting logic and science. The only thing out of this I can see is that science as we know it doesn't exist or is entirely false in the HP-universe and everything is already magical.

******* So are you saying that a magical effect revamping how my entire being functions (body survival is now entirely maintained by magic) is not encompassed in "changing my nature"? What exactly does "changing the nature" of something mean then? Or do you have a different definition than "changes nature of thing" for transfiguration?

******** The thing is, it's superficial. Your body isn't changed, it's just taking up a smaller amount of space via magic. The abstract property of "size" has changed, nothing else. Transfiguration likely /would/ have to account for what you're talking about, because it's not changing a simple property, it's changing things on a physical and fundamental level.

Transfiguration seems pretty useless if you can just logic your way around having to actually transfigure something.

***** The thing is, JKR has explicitly defined transfiguration as a purely physical change. It takes magic to enact the change, but there's no active magic going on in the resulting object. So if you half-transfigure an animal and walk away, the new species of snuffbox-mouse you've created is staying alive entirely under its own power, even though half its organs are missing. Which definitely implies to me that there's magical elements of biology that Muggles are ignorant of.
