** There aren't many, tbh. I want to write a short fic where Hermione needs a date to a family gathering but she has a homophobic family so she's hesitant in letting fem!Harry do it. But fem!Harry tries to get some polyjuice with the hair of a celebrity or something, then have a whole scene where she tries to get Tom Cruise's hair or something silly --- so Hermione doesn't have to deal with homophobia.

But then, touched by fem!Harrys's effort, Hermione wants just her.

  Iris shrugged. “I'll be your date if you want.”

  “I ---” Hermione took a second to collect herself. “I don't think --- Iris, this is the muggle world we're talking about. You know that sort of thing isn't accepted like it is with wizards.”

  Iris frowned. “Would your parents be assholes about it or something?”

  “No --- maybe --- I don't know, but the rest of my family definitely would. They're just --- more religious.”

  “Ah.” Iris nodded to herself, then shrugged again and went back to her book. “I'll just take a Gender-Changing Potion then, call myself James Potter.” She held up a fist, not taking her eyes off the page she was reading. “One last night for Marauder glory!”

  Hermione gave a weak laugh, though not one of ridicule. It seemed she was seriously considering the idea.

  “You better let me get to second base, at least,” said Iris, turning a page.

In the end, Hermione asks her to go just as herself. Iris would be delighted, having loved Hermione for a long time.

  "I'll tone myself down, I promise," said Iris sincerely. "No shenanigans." She would not ruin this chance.

  "Nah," said Hermione, smiling. "Don't. Actually... dial it up."

  "I --- what?"

  "All the way up to eleven."

  Iris blinked, then her lips twitched, and a look of unholy glee came into her eyes.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.

  (She pops the cork, tips it back, and does her best to not think about the taste of pickled peppermint and concentrated lavender oil. A calming draught, taken once at breakfast and once at dinner, is enough to help.)Poppy Lily Potter reflects - in the early din of the morning - on who and what has brought her to where she is now, spending her eighth year in a school that saved and ruined her in equal amounts.

  "Charlie said that it was taken to a preserve in Ireland, but we should check on it anyway. To make sure it's being taken care of."Hermione, who has never had an encounter with a dragon in which she hasn't been scared out of her mind, doesn't agree. Harrie's experience with dragons has been much worse than hers, but Harrie's a different kind of Gryffindor. The utterly ridiculous, daredevil kind. "Go back to sleep, Harrie.""But the dragon."
