Hey guys, I read a fic recently called Taking Control by fake a smile on ff.net, and I quite liked it. Now I'm looking for other stories with a similar theme, where Harry doesn't follow Dumbledore and the Order blindly, but takes things into his own hands. I also enjoy fics where Harry is particularly powerful or intelligent. Not a huge fan of overly Dark!Harry, though.

Can you help a sister out with some recs? I'd be much obliged.

Ships aren't important, but I do prefer Harry/Ginny if it does come up. Absolutely NO Harry/Hermione.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle_in_the_Jungle_A_Harry_Potter_Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle: A Harry Potter Adventure]] By jbern and it's sequel.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/][The Denarian Renegade]] By Shezza, and both of it's sequels. It's technically a crossover, but it's all very well explained.

** how close to cannon are you looking? For some things completely off the wall try:

The Darkness Within: The Rewrite by Kurinoone

Growing Up Kneazle by Manatocfox

Growing Up Black by Elvendork

Harry Potter and the Wastelands of time and its sequal

Harry Potter and the Heartlands of time by joe6991

Building Bridges by Melethril

Prince of the Dark Kingdom by Mizuni-sama

I would have made the titles into links, but I am still pretty new at reddit and haven't really had the chance to look up how to do that.

**** Oh he's definitely still kicking. I believe he was last working on An Unfound Door as well as a [[http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=21776][collaborative anthology]] with some other writers, as well as an original fantasy work, as billthedoor has already mentioned.
