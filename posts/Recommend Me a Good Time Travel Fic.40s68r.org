This story is friggin' weird, and it's funky and way out there, but it has amazing action, interesting and unique magic and it's like nothing else in the fandom. Worth a read.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.

  Harry Potter is living an unhappy life at age 27. He is forced to go on an Auror raid, when the people he saves are not who he thinks. With one last thing in his life broken, he follows through on a plan for Time-travel, back to his past self. Things were not as they once seemed. Slytherin!Harry. Dumbledore and order bashing.

**** Until May of 2014 the author kept to a very frequent update schedule in the third story and its two sequels, with as many as 1 to 5 chapters per month. After that point it began looking like this:

Jul 2014 (Chapters 22-23) Nov '14 (24-28) Jun '15 (29)

The time between updates has become longer and longer, but I wouldn't count new material out entirely. The bigger question is if we'll ever see a conclusion to the series. Probably not at the current rate of progress.
