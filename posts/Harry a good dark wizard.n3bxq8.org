Hi, a while ago i was reading a fanfic about how harry spent some time in the library of the black family after hermione and ron ignored him over the summer. He started to read about dark arts und got later resorted into slytherin. He became friends with almost all slytherin. The dark magic called out to harry. They helped him on his way to become a dark wizard but not an evil one. Hermione tried to be supportive ron continued to ignor him. Sirius was alive and voldmort play an minor role other than that the slytherins wanted harry as a third side in the war. There was some dumbledore bashing but i dont remember the extent. I hope someone can find it. Its a rather long story and i belive unfinished. Its was either on fanfiction.net or ao3. And in the 5. year. Thanks :)
