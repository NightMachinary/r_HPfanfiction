Hi all, I'm looking for fics where the main character is handled as some kind of legend. You know people wishpering about him/her, there are some far-fetched tales and generally get awed if they meet her/him. And the standard "Oh my god it's Harry Potter" doesn't count ;)

Also the more of the following points the fic has, the better:

- fem Harry

- dark/evil

- powerful/OP

- no slash...at all (and MY definition of slash is M/M)

- preferably long (10k+)

Thanks in advance ;)


** I thought you wanted a fic where the main character was a legendary pokemon. Now I'm disappointed.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** I believe that Where in the World is Harry Potter linkffn(2354771) and it's sequels would qualify for this. Extra points for Harry hating it, and several characters annoying him with his fame.

  COMPLETE. PostOotP. Harry Potter fulfilled the prophecy and has since disappeared. Or has he? Tonks and Hermione are the lead Order members continuously hoping to track him down. The question is: can they keep up with him?
