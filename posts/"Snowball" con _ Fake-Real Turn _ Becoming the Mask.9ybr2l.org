Looking for fics where a character uses a fiction that then snowballs into it being self-sustaining.

The example reference I have for this is [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePostman][The Postman]], where a man in a post-apocalyptic world full of walled isolated states pretends to be a Postman from the 'restored states' in order to get food and shelter. He continues this con, setting up waypoints between cities visited, until he has ended up building a functional postal network (that then kicks off other rebuildings).

The key here is 1) A sustained con and 2) That con taking on a life of its own and continuing even after the truth is found out. (That is, not a /Catch Me If you Can/ fool everyone to get away) EDIT: 3) The life of its own can't be the original intent of the con.

I think there are a few 'pretend to be a student' ones out there (Sands in the Hourglass comes to mind), but I was thinking more of ones that effect change. Something like:

- Insert/Time Traveler/Muggle tricks his way into Hogwarts pretending to be a Safety Inspector / International School Standards Officer / Ministry Official. By the time they are found out, they have made such a positive impact on the school that the school continues the new post.
- Good/Evil infiltrating the ministry by pretending to be a new department, that at some point the Minister decides to keep on. (Character shows up one day and declares herself to be the head of the anti-terrorism unit and is so effective at it when it is discovered they are fake it keeps going)
- Hero's go to the international wizarding groups requesting help on behalf of wizarding britian, and when they are found out they are made 'official' to avoid scandal / because it worked.


** Bonus challenge: make it Lockheart.

(I really liked the Postman! Weirdly, your request reminds me of another fantasy story about mail - Going Postal by Terry Pratchett. Maybe try it if you haven't.)

*** I prefer Practice Effect or Startide Rising for my Brin fix, but Postman was fun.

Problem with Lockheart is he has had the con going for a while without reform when he appears in the book. Maybe if you had a fic that attached someone competent to him who made him do things right (A lovestruck student saves him from the Basalisk mindwipe and ends up following him around, getting him to do things right even though he is trying to just keep his con going?)

Or I suppose 'teaching' could be his long con. He is still the fraud monster hunter, but after cannon events he decides to write a proper monster hunting textbook and it turns out so good that all the real monster hunters use it.

**** I'll do you one better.

Make it Lockheart and 15-year-old Tonks. No love-struck girl, just Nym finding out his cluelessness and blackmailing Lockheart into becoming a proper hero.

I feel like this has potential. I might actually start drafting this evening. The voices will be very hard to get right, though.

***** Tonks would be... 19 at the time of chamber of secrets? An entry point too much earlier than cannon means massive divergence (he can't be as incompetent as he was in canon once you start redeeming him). Not really a reason for Lockhart to interact with a student pre-canon, not like this.

You could use a divergence point of the end of 2nd year. You could have her training to enter the auror acadamy at this point, thus she can have a change of plans without too much complications. Have her on campus for some reason and drawn into the end of year shenanigans. Ideally unable to get other professors to help so they still have to use Lockhart after learning of his fraud. Tonks blackmail to get him to procure a rooster before going down into the chamber changes it so he isn't mindwiped, and after she decides to take it further.

Alternatively, make her a year younger (I don't know if it is ever stayed if she is 5 or 6 years ahead of the golden trio). So she is a seventh year planning to become an auror. Then either do the above (participate in end of year shenanigans, end up blackmailing Lockhart to have her as his "apprentice" so she can follow him around and do good monster hunting

Or alternatively have the con be the teaching itself. Tonks finds out about it early and ends up coaching / effectively teaching DADA. Course at the end of the year the fame and name are so useful she continues to blackmail/train him.

****** I actually want it to be a massive divergence. Here's what I got so far:

It's January, 1989. The UK is still in shock from Lockerbie disaster, /Queen/ has just released /The Miracle/ to the overwhelming "meh" of the general public. And on the Wizarding side of the Isles, Gilderoy Lockhart is enjoying the success of his third book - /Break with a Banshee./

Nymphadora Tonks, home on a Christmas break, picks up this thrilling bestseller and soon realises that Lockhart is either an idiot or treats his readers as such. She quickly notices the inconsistencies in his stories and decides to investigate and confront him. Lockhart tries to Memory Charm her but Tonks quickdraws him and wants to call the Aurors when she sees the amount of letters Lockhart's getting. She realises that the Ministry is not the end-all and people need help from the more discreet sources. Lockhart has the authority and name, she has the skills... This might just work!

I'm not sure where this is going, but I am excited to see.

******* Eh but what is her motivation? She would be in school, would want to finish, has a support structure so isn't gonna drop out... Needs to be a reason right? Freshly graduated (and unemployed) Tonks would have some inherent motivation, but if you go pre-graduation or post-auror status you need a good motivator.

On a different note, another entry point (for my previous list) to consider would be Lockhart's hiring. Newly graduated Tonks could be asked to give the recruitment letter to Lockhart at the beginning of her first summer. Why? Eh, let's go with 'her parents knew him'. She finds out he is a fraud, and snowball from there...

******** I don't know, maybe I'm reading Tonks differently, but I never saw her as a government person. She is a punk, a rebel. She works for the Office because she can help people, but being able to help them directly would be much more preferable. Besides, their first case might be something short and urgent. How about a supernatural kidnapping of the actual kid?

As for the original investigation of Lockhart, she might think she is doing it for her future. Having a cracked case before she even applies to the Auror Corps would be one hell of a recommendation in a teenager's mind. And being smacked down by bureaucracy and coldness of the real Aurors might just kill any desire of actually graduating. She might as well just get her NEWTs and do her own thing.

*** Heh, that one is... interesting. Its the one where the mafia is convinced he is some sort of super-spy or something?

It doesn't really fit for this since it isn't a con that Harry is running that takes off, simply everyone around him misunderstanding forever.
