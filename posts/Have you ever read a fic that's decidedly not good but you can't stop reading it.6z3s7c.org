Edit: for me it's probably linkffn(7467796). Has a sizeable amount of grammatical errors and the writing isn't very good, but it's one of the few Ron-centric stories out there, and the premise is pretty unique, which keeps me hooked.

*** linkffn(Hell Eyes)

Writing's not the best but it's a decently nailed together story with an interesting and well worked out premise. Sometimes the characters are a little flat and the writing could stand to have a beta pass through it but the premise was so unique and interesting that I read the whole thing anyway (and the writing improves later on as well).

Kaleidescope of Magic linkffn(9109451) starts off terribly, the dialogue and characterization is complete shit throughout, his grammar is questionable at best, but the worldbuilding is pretty awesome, since he merged Dresden Files and Harry Potter together with aspects of Naruto, namely Sharingan and Mokuton.

Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches linkffn(11574569) is dumb as fuck but entertaining at the very least, which is the best compliment that I can give a harem fic.

Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235) is terrible for the first 20 chapters but I plowed through it anyways. Year two is some of the best fanfiction I've ever read.

Its... just... weird.

As in, the first 15 chapters or so aren't even close to anything Harry Potter related. It just makes you wonder why the author isn't just doing their own thing away from fanfiction. But with Harry in it it is just so... cringey, sometimes. But I can't stop.

That in itself is not a problem because you would presume that whoever reads it has knowledge of all the franchises involved and thus the basic idea what is going on, but as [[/u/yarglethatblargle][u/yarglethatblargle]] wrote it's kind of a crossover with a franchise that doesn't exist so you are left in the dark and if you don't get pulled in by the style the lack of knowledge of what the heck is going on can be really grating.

** I started a Tomione last night, and the writing is pretty horrid... but the storyline is brilliant. 38 chapters in and it looks like I'm going to have to read the whole thing. If only it was written, or at least beta'd, by someone with good grammar and a thesaurus handy!

I'm willing to forgive grammar and spelling errors if the plot is really good.

** i'm on chapter four of yet another 'super powered heir to everything harry' that I tripped over in the HP/Avengers crossover section. I'm not sure why I'm still reading it other than trying to figure out how the Avengers fit in.

** "The Brightest Witch of Her Age" by chocolateberrycake.

The story is riddled with so many spelling and grammar mistakes, while Hermione is portrayed as a huge Mary Sue, with even the professors pawing over her greatness. Yet, for some reason I can't explain, I read it until the end; I even knew the story was unfinished by still made it to the "end" anyway.

** I pretty much can't read anything that isn't of technical quality. It's just too hard to follow when somebody doesn't even know the basic forms of spelling and grammar.

I've read some mightily bad stories, however. Mostly they tend to be pairing fics and only then as a curiosity to see where it goes.
