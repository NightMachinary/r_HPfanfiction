Inspired by an element or two of this new Harry/Fleur fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13745570/1/The-Purpose-of-Wings]]

Basically, Harry decided to be a stay-at-home dad to raise his kids: his wife either works or does her own thing. They're quite happy.

When their kids start school, Harry meets the other parents -- or, more specifically, the mothers. Some of the mothers are single, and seeing a presumably single father looking after his kids? Yeah, they're eyeing him up.

Unfortunately for them, he's happily married to the love of his life (doesn't have to be Fleur, in this example), and the mention of the kids' mother causes ripples, and he ends up dodging the flirtations of the mothers/the kids' older relatives.

Odd stray thoughts that might be applicable, from Kindergarten Cop.
