*** I really wanted to like it, but the author did this thing that a lot of romance-focused authors do, where Hermione is introduced as this vicious superwitch assassin who leads Death Eater raids (that is, who has tortured and murdered people) and collaborates with Snape on Potions in her spare time, and then the moment she gets to Hogwarts, she becomes an ingenue with no personality and no clear idea of what she is doing.
