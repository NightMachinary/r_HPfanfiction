** JKR is a fantastic children's author, but she couldn't write a realistic adult/YA story to save her life (think about how absurdly convenient all of Book 7 was).

Or were you talking about fanfiction authors? No way. Needless drama.

**** Not made half the plot revolve around an invented deux ex machina, for one.

Not have 1/3 (maybe more?) of the final book - the one supposedly aboyt a wizarding war - be nothing but the three main characters arguing in the woods.

Not have parseltongue, this supposedly rare magical ability be usable by any yokel that hisses enough times.

Not skip the redemption arc for the racist attempted murderer (so Draco never faced any consequences for nearly killing two of his classmates, eh? Yea, that's a good motivation to stop being a genocidal racist).

Acknowledge that in real life, things are rarely tied up in a neat bow for a bunch of child soldiers.

I could go on, but i think you get the point. JKR should have written 7 children's books, or she should have brought on a coauthor to help her work out a YA plot for the last 3 books, since she was just not capable of writing plots that "grew up" alongside her audience.

****** I don't think Harry forgiving Snape is a bad or unrealistic writing. The way the ending of the series was written it was almost inevitable that Harry would forgive Snape. Harry is a forgiving individual as it is, just look at the way he needs barely a minute to forgive Ron or the way he accepts that Dumbledore was orchestrating his life all along. With Snape I think Harry may feel guilty. After all, he did spend seven years accusing Snape of all sort of notorious deeds while the man was protecting him all along (however vile his personality was). And Snape died before Harry may had made amends or reached any sort of understanding. I don't think Harry would have had quite the same opinion on Snape had he lived. But he didn't. The last impression Snape leaves on Harry is of a man unfairly blamed and ostracized. A martyr in /Harry's/ name.

******* I think she's said before she wished book 5 was more heavily edited/revised, not that she stopped using an editor altogether.

I think there's a trend in book series that get big that editors generally start to become more hands off as the series gets bigger. ASoIaF is another great example of this. Star Wars too. The author has made this great thing, let's just let them run with it! While neglecting that the author /and their editor(s)/ is what created this massively popular thing.

******* Sure, but that's a matter of subjective taste. I just meant it as a strong indication that her editor was less involved - editors tend to create shorter, tighter, more structurally sound books than authors do.

The bad comes mainly from the other things a less involved editor implies. More semantic mistakes (JK is famous for her worldbuilding contradictions and lack of internal logic - something an editor is supposed to catch) and technical mistakes (like the fact that one book went to print saying that Voldemort was Slytherin's last living ancestor, not descendent).

**** Imply that there is an actual war going on rather than Harry/Hermione/(Ron) camping in a tent, the Order running a radio show and a few muggleborn on the run. You could have provided so much background events through that stupid radio show, even if it was just an offhand mention that Ted Tonks died trying to free a group of kids caught by snatchers or that the Order had successfully killed 3 werewolves during the past week.

Also, Malfoy, at the very least, ends up in prison for life. Or you go full "France in 1945" and execute anyone who even looked like he was collaborating. Actually, that avenue would also imply that there was a clean up in the Ministry and not just everyone going back from deporting a people to cauldron bottoms as if that was just another task HR came up with.

**** I have a whole spiel about it if you want, but the main issue is the plot structure. When your characters are sitting around complaining that they have nothing to do and nothing is happening (the whole camping middle of the book), that's a red flag. When the impetus to move the plot forward comes from an absurd coincidence of random 3ed tier characters expositing the next plot point within ear shot of our heroes in a random forest in all of England, that's like 5 red flags.

Overall changes would be

Eliminating Hallows. They were sloppy last second world building and not needed for a good conclusion.

A more "therefore & but" plot. Example: They break into the ministry to steal the locket BUT Umridge gave it to Lucius THEREFORE they have to either take it from him BUT they can't break into Malfoy Manor THEREFORE they kidnap Draco to get info BUT Draco wants to switch sides THERFORE he gives them a clue on how to get to Lucius AND something he heard about where the Cup is ect ect ect Not saying this is a good plot, necessarily, but the point is the plot is driven by character decisions and a string of events with clear cause start to finish

The Cup and Diadem/last Horocrux would be in different and more interesting spots that would act as major plot points. These would have more connection to Voldemort than a bank vault he's never been to or a room he was in only once.

No Dues Ex Jesus-achina at the end. The conclusion shouldn't hinge on Harry being a jesus allegory or the fine details of wand lore. It should come from character motivation vis a vis Harry v Voldemort and what makes the different /people/.

**** That's why I made the distinction between a children's story and a YA novel. I don't expect a story aimed at kids between 8-12 years old to be the epitome of good plot development. Conversely, if it is a story marketed to late teens/young adults, my standards and expectations go up.

** In terms of fanfiction authors, I don't like to call people overrated because people read and write fic for fun, so if an author has a lot of views on their story, they must be doing /something/ right!

I do think there are some fantastic writers of fanfic who don't get the clicks they deserve. Check out *Slide, Myricle, LF74, sheriff1985,* and *Maverick Heart.* Most of these writers are unfortunately limited by taste, but they definitely all write stuff that should have more universal appeal.

*Inverarity* is a somewhat unique case who's well respected on this sub, but definitely doesn't get the clicks he should on FFN or AO3. *CeruleanSlane*, who has one incomplete Harry Potter fic, is better known for his Worm fanfic and original fiction, but Duplicitous Destiny is /really good/ and has a very low favorite count IIRC.

** Overrated: J. K. Rowling, it has to be said.

Underrated: Hmm, dunno, I haven't been keeping up, especially with lesser known authors even if they deserve to be better known. As a YA book I liked "The Neverending Story" much better than Harry Potter, but it's missing some important elements that make HP far more popular. E.g. it has basically a solo protagonist on a journey, rather than being about a school full of characters with complicated relationships.
