Hey Everyone.

I could be pretty wrong about this being a possibility cause I'm pretty new to the Harry Potter fandom, but I wanted to find a story where Voldemort destroys the Horcrux inside of Harry during their confrontation at the graveyard.

Thanks to anyone that could help me find something like this.


** was this the fic where he was hit with the killing curse and everyone got happy and he had the kings cross scene with someone (I can't remember who) else and they told him about the cup

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  The night in the graveyard, produces a very different result as Harry discovers things he didn't know about his heritage. Before he only had a castle, now he has a whole wide world to get himself in trouble. At least he has his responsible godfather along for the ride. That should help... right? Or not.
