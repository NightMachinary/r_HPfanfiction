:END:
The story I'm looking for has Harry learning after the war. That Sirius had a daughter in a orphanage in France. I can't remember the name, but I do remember it had Luna in a godmother role and that Andi and Cissy groomed her to be the heiress to the black family. Harry was also working for a the ICW in taking down the remaining death eaters due to some issue with Kingsley. Any help figuring out what story this is would be greatly appreciated
