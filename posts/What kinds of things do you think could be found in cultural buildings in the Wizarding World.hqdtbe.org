By cultural buildings I mean museums, art galleries, theatre houses, and the like.


** There's a painting of the very first wizard losing his buttock when he stuck his wand in the back pocket of his pants in the Wizarding Museum of Art. Albus Dumbledore initially wanted it hung in Hogwarts, but Professor McGonagall put her foot down. It used to be Mad Eye Moody's favorite piece of art ever.

** I've always headcanoned that there's some sort of Quidditch Museum, where they have the snitch that was caught after 3 months of looking for it, the first Quaffle ever played with, some Dissimulators left over from the 1974 Quidditch Cup, that kind of thing if you consider it canon.

** I headcanon that Magical buildings have "Genius Loci" born out of the spells woven into it's making as well as the "ambient magic" present by the casting Wizards, these Genius are semi-sentient giving each building (specially the older ones) a distinct feel (colder or hotter Air, a feeling of degradation or a happy sensation, etc) to those who inhabit them. Also, I picture the buildings having specific features like strong confundus making them hard to navigate (government areas or military installations), moving parts/signs/pictures scatered along the place. An art museum could have not only moving pictures but also moving statues, theathers could feature singing wall sculptures, the music present in them could also be "saw" as a stream of colour, etc.

*** Oh wow! I've been researching Genius and Lares for a while now involving a story idea where imaginary friends are an actual thing in the wizarding world, much like poltergeist and boggarts.

**** ... I always pictured imaginary friends being muggleborn Wizards/Witches or Squibs seeing ghosts. Imagine a muggleborn (or adopted) kid seeing ghosts but not knowing they were a ghost?

*** I have this too! Though I didn't have a specific name for it.

Expanding on the "ambient magic" the idea of dragons at dragon reserves drastically altering the ecosystem and weather around the reserve is really cool to me!

** If there isn't a garden where there is moving topiary I am going to riot.

But seriously, I think a botanical garden with different magical plants from all over the world would be neat. Like Tiger lilies that purr and grow. An orchestra of singing flowers. Quirky bonsai that are so old that they are sentient and like to do random things like soaking in ponds, throwing dirt at people, or jump scaring people.

I've been playing around with ideas like this and I wish there was more of random nonsense that make for neat world building.
