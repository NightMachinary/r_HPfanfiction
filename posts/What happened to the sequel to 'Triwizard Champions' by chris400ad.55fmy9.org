There was an authorised sequel being written, but its been deleted from ff.net. Does anyone know why, and does anyone know where I can find the sequel, if it is still on the internet?


** About a month ago, the author of /Champion's Return/ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4742980/][warchief]] has posted an author's note to the story, which read:

  OK, since I've been getting a lot of comments about whether this story has been abandoned or not, I'm going to clear them up now.

  I have not abandoned this story, nor do I intend to. However, I've recently switched jobs and am doing a lot more hours than I used to, plus uni work is starting to build up for me. I do have a plan as to where to take this, it's just a matter of finding the time to write it.

  A lot of people are going on about the inclusion of the UN into this. Firstly, this is fiction. The UN in this story doesn't necessarily have to be the same as the real one. I'm not going to make a big deal out of Harris, this is about Fleur and Harry after all, but he will have a part to play. I'm sorry if you don't like that, but I don't intend to change it.

  I'm not going to make any promises as to when the next chapter will come, but there will be one, and ones after that.

I'm not aware if he's changed his mind since then, or if he will simply re-post it whenever he is back to writing.
