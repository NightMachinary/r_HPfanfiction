Looking for some good fics on the general extended Weasley clan as the kids begin to grow! Don't mind if it's focused particularly on one family, already read things such as 19 years and GYWM etc. Please help!


** (linkffn)The Changeling and its sequel are great!

** 19 Years? Is it the one posted on hpff? Is it a good story not exaggeratedly fluffy or boring?

*** I love it but it is quite fluffy, it follows the whole family so can be hard to focus on single storylines but the story definitely gets better as it goes on!! If you read it stick with it. I think it handles the impact of the war quite well, always makes me sob
