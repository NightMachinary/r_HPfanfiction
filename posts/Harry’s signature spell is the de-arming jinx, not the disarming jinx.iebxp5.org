“Explode-your-arms-off!”


** "and now, I'll be demonstrating every duellers most important spell, the disarming charm! Why, with this spell, you won't even need to finish the fuel, as you'll have your opponent's wand!" Lockhart beamed at his captive audience, and Hermione swooned over his intelligence. Ron snorted at Harry, whispering to his friend, "even if he takes my wand, I can still punch the sod." Harry chuckled, but could see the practicality of the spell and paid more attention to the blustering buffoon on the dais.

"Now, my assistant and I shall show you how it's done. Professor Snape, if you will?" Snape shot Lockhart a look of pure malice, and stepped onto the dais. "Expelliarmus," he snarled, snatching Lockhart's wand from middair. Lockhart stumbled forward, reaching for his wand clutched in Snape's hands, jumbled nothing's about his state of readiness pouring from his lips.

"Well then, I'll put you into pairs!! Pick a partner from a different house, and if you can't decide then I'm sure Professor Snape will be happy to help." Lockhart's beaming smile was just as arrogant as before, his ego unmarred by the supreme ease with which he was just beaten.

Hermione paired up with a Ravenclaw boy she knew from History of Magic, while Ron and Harry stood as an awkward pair in the hopes their robes wouldn't be noticed. Luck wasn't on their side, and Snape dragged the boys over to some Slytherins: Harry paired with Draco, while Ron paired with Theodore. Draco leered at Harry, itching for a fight.

"The incantation is 'expelliarmus' everybody, and the wand movement is like so-" Lockhart wiggled his wand in a peculiar pattern and promptly dropped it. "My wand is a little overeager, oh dear. Let's try that again." Harry mimicked the movement without an incantation, but couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right about the swing of his wand.

"All right, now practise! I want all of you to be able to disarm your opponent successfully by the end of the club!"

Draco lunged at Harry, serpensortia on the tip of his tongue. Harry beat him to it, with a shouted EXPELLIARMUS! And a wand movement entirely unlike Lockhart's demonstration.

Harry didn't expect Draco's arm to fly into his hand, neatly detached from his body.

..........

Harry and his friends formed an inverted v, facing the death eaters filling the Department of Mysteries. Neville shook- though Harry wasn't entirely sure it was fear, and was suddenly glad that he wasn't facing Neville in battle.

It was Harry who cast the first spell, a silent expelliarmus with his signature slicing move. Bellatrix Lestrange could only stare at the lanky figure holding her wand arm, wand still clenched in her hand, and blood dripping from the end of her severed arm.

Harry couldn't get the sound of death eater screams from his head for weeks, not the stench of blood from his hands. But the hardest part was figuring out where the hell to put all the arms he collected.

.......

The Order of the Phoenix stood in the Dursley's living room, dropping hairs plucked off Harry's head into bubbling vials- the vials turned pale gold with flecks of green and orange, and Harry swore he could see snitches darting around in the potion. Before long, he stood surrounded by 8 other Harrys.

When they all left his house, Harry knew they'd find him. He held his wand ready for the few death eaters that still could weild a wand to try and blast the stain of his existence from the sky. Hagrid was crying on the motorbike he rode, soaring through the air, knowing that there was every chance Harry would be killed.

It was no suprise when Voldemort himself rode the wind and skies, an ominous figure rising through the clouds until he lay level with Harry- the real Harry- and smiled a vicious smile, teeth flashing in the dark. It only took a slash of his wand before Voldemort's arm too, was clenched in Harry's hand.

And rather suicidal to still chase Harry-The-Collector-Of-Arms-Potter after seeing their comrades getting mutilated. After the Battle at the Ministry, every DE with a functioning brain should've convinced Voldy an army of imperiused wizards is their best bet.

And maybe they do, everyone imperio a wizard to show up with the mask on for the attack, also polyjuiced as themselves in case His Noselessness ask to see their face.
