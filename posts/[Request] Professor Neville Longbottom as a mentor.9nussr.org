  'As wrong as this was, it felt right. I shouldn't feel like this but deep down I knew that it was out of my control. I was in love with Professor Longbottom.' Marcia is a struggling but talented Herbology student, who is also the famous girlfriend of Scorpius Malfoy - the snide and evil rich kid, but when things turn nasty, will the new Herbology professor come to the rescue?
