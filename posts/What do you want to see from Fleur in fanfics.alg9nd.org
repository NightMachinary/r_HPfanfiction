It is the sad reality that ~90% of all appearances Fleur makes in fanfics depict her either as pretty, nymphomanic human or go on a tangent about Veela mates, Veela life debts and similar fetishised concepts which serve no further goal than to utilise shipping. And if paired with Harry, she will be submissive as soon as he is not affected by her allure and he will dominate her, even if he has not even seen a nipple before. Throw in some arc about becoming a better student, because clearly, the way to defeat Voldemort lies in a Herbology essay. And let's not forget about her father, an important figure in the French MoM.

It feels like there is a real absence of stories where her Veela "heritage" is either fully embraced or plays no role whatsoever. There are almost no fics where she can turn into an avian form and uses that outside of the main plot (eg to fly because it is fun). There are almost no stories where her grandmother is pretty irrelevant (eg "So what if she was a Veela?).

So what do you want to see when it comes to Fleur?


** 1. The word Veela should appear a maximum of one (1) time.

2. She should be a bit of a bitch but capable of surprising kindness.

3. She should be glamorous yet surprisingly down to earth.

*** I'd argue that a bigger foray into non-humans would be interesting as well. Obviously, the fanon "Veela Mate/Bond/Life Debt" stuff is garbage to facilitate romance without real effort. But some "humanoid but different" elements could be interesting as well. Maybe she can turn into a bird and hurl fireballs (at will, the whole "angry veela transformation" thing should not be taken too seriously). I mean, you have pretty much all of the European mythologies at your disposal, and yet the only stories which explore non-humans are smut and modern werewolves (whose biggest issue is craving chocolate, not slaughtering entire villages)?

**** She's only a quarter-Veela, though. I don't think she should be able to have full Veela powers. The best way I've seen it handled is by a story (I think it was one of White Squirrel's?) where Fleur and Gabrielle could grow some feathers and make their nails more like talons, but couldn't fully transform into harpies like full-blooded Veelas.

(...It occurs to me as I'm writing this that the /Cursed Child/ Trolley Witch actually being a half-Veela might explain some things.)

******* I think this common assumption (that she is quarter-veela) is based on a fanon alteration of the real GoF quote. Fleur never actually talks about her heritage, but rather specifies that the core of her wand came from her grandmother.

  “‘An ‘air from ze ‘ead of a veela,' said Fleur. ‘One of my grandmuzzer's.'”
#+end_quote

If she had instead said something along the lines of “yes, my grandmother was a veela,” in response to a question about her having veela ancestry, I would agree that it implies that is her closest nonhuman relative, but as it stands she doesn't even really imply she's human herself. Her entire family could be veela and she just happens to use a hair from her grandmother---maybe that's a common tradition, or they're especially close, or something along those lines.

It's a lot more convenient to Apparate instead of finding an item, enchanting it and then teleporting yourself. It's faster too. Portkeys are only really useful if you want to transfer a large group of people at the same time.

******* Occam's razor is inconclusive because it comes down to statistic probability (number of wizards vs number of Veelas) vs familiarity (Veela should know more Veela, there should be a preference for the own kind). We simply know too little about their social structures to make an effective conclusion because a "human"-like approach would mean a tendency to stay with the familiar.

**** I think the Veela bond trope CAN be done well if it's used to facilitate conflict and growth instead of instant romance. Like a bad arranged marriage on steroids, since it's not like it was a conscious decision by any party involved. Sure, I like my happy endings and it should get there eventually, but there needs to be that clashing of personalities that allows real relationship development instead of “Guess we're Veela married, let's fuck”

Like that whole “they need physical contact at the beginning” part. Say Fleur and Harry were bonded as effective strangers, why the fuck should she be comfortable sharing a bed with him twenty minutes later? No, she's stubborn and refuses leading to whatever problems later on for her, and Harry's worse off because unwanted orphan PTSD gets set off.

Valid point.

However, check out the execution of each individual champion in the First Task. All of them have roughly the same timeframe to come up with a plan of action, since Harry, Maxime and Karkaroff see the dragons late at night - you could say that they inform their respective champions the next day, rather than wake them up at 12/1 in the night.

Harry certainly doesn't do any planning that night, anyway.

Anyway, on to the way the champions approach the task.

Viktor goes for the brute force approach, and is sort of unharmed, but his method causes injury to the dragon and destroys several eggs.

Cedric approaches with more finesse, using transfiguration to create diversions for the dragon, but gets a bout of flame to his face for his troubles. No injury to dragon or eggs.

Fleur does her thing, and the dragon snores flames at her, but it's mentioned that it only catches her skirt, and she puts out the flames quickly. No injury to dragon or damage to eggs.

Harry has the most simplistic approach, which is understandable. But he does get his shoulder injured thanks to the horned/spiked tail of the dragon.

Of the four, I felt that Fleur had the most elegant approach to the problem, followed by Cedric (even if he did get burned).

** People too easily skip over the fact that Fleur is intelligent and capable. As much of a fairy princess as Mad Eye Moody, so to speak. She is ambitious enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament. She is honest enough about her own strengths and weaknesses to take a job in the UK to improve her English. She loves so deeply that her sister is the person she would miss most in the world, and a life-changing attack cannot dissuade her from being with her fiancé.

In my head canon, Fleur has been told /you are beautiful/ every day in her life, and by late adolescence her immediate thought had become, /Tell me something original/. She's been admired and fetishized to the point where both bore her. She sees right through negging. She won't bother taking anyone seriously unless they step up and meet her mind-to-mind. Her Ravenclaw date to the Yule Ball was smart, but couldn't keep up with her. Then she met a handsome man with long red hair and a cool fang earring, and the first thing he said to her was, “Nice job on the Welsh Green.”

Bill sees her strengths. Bill values her intelligence. Bill knows that no one will ever tame Fleur, and that she will never respect or love someone who behaves like a puppy towards her (a healthy kink/BDSM relationship may or may not have her top, bottom, or switch. People can be into unexpected things). Bill earns Fleur's love by knowing her worth and his own. They are equal partners in life.

And Victoire is going to be a badass.

That doesn't mean much considering that they took Cho Chang for Harry and Hermione for Viktor Krum.

Also, most people who haven't yet gotten married or had children would have a high probability of their siblings being top of that list (doubly so if they're the older one so they view their sibling in a more protective light).

Just saying it's not particularly rare or noteworthy to love your siblings.

**** The took Cho for Cedric, and Ron for Harry.

The whole series is about love being noteworthy, even the most common kinds of love (parental, fraternal, platonic, etc). Some people don't receive love (like Harry, aged 15 months to 11 years); and some people don't give it (like Voldemort). Harry doesn't think his ability to grieve for Sirius makes him special, because everyone loves their friends. We can also argue that Lily's sacrifice for Harry's sake was nothing more than an expected duty, which James also performed. But these kinds of love are still worth mentioning and valuing.

Haughty, beautiful people like Fleur can easily be portrayed as narcissists. But Fleur does love. Personally, I think a well-rounded portrayal of her would have to include her capacity to care for others---not because it makes her extraordinary, but because it makes her more whole.

Yeah, thanks for catching the mistake. I did think the ones I'd picked didn't /quite/ right when I tried to envision them.

All that you've said is find and all, I was just pointing out that just because her sister was picked doesn't show that she loves deeply.

If /anyone/ was in that situation and you were asked to guess who'd be picked as the person they'll miss most in the world, one of the absolute top picks for anyone guessing would be a younger sibling.

It's not a noteworthy example of loving */deeply/*.

It shows she's capable of loving someone, but that should be the default expectation regardless unless she's a sociopath/psychopath.

Plus, we already know she's capable of love since she gets engaged to an enemy of the Dark Lord who later becomes a werewolf.

He got scarred a little and likes meat rawer. That's not exactly life-changing. And even becoming a werewolf is not that bad. You change during one night each month. Lupin suffers so much as a werewolf because he let it define himself and he has self-esteem issues he takes out on his wife and unborn child.

We're forced to acknowledge that, whatever our feelings, it /really, really/ is that bad. Wizard society in Harry Potter discriminates against werewolves something fierce. Lupin can barely hold down a job and is constantly described as having patchy, threadbare clothes. He's also one of the most capable people Harry meets at Hogwarts.

Plus, I think you're really underselling the transformation part of it. It's jarring, terrifying, and painful. Remember the Shrieking Shack?

Remus has a hard time getting a job, because of him being a Werewolf. His appearance is often described as shabby, with bad clothing.

James, Sirius and Peter transfer into Animagus, to help Remus out, so that he's not alone during his transformation. So I'm sure he just doesn't sleep through it, not even with the Wolfsbane Potion.

Bill, for all we know was the one that doesn't transform; he was still badly scarred though (Being referenced to looking similar to Alastor Moody several times).

Remus is horrified at the mere idea of having a child, afraid that he'd transfer his Werewolf side to his child.

People stayed away from the Shrieking Shack because of the horrifying noises; because of Remus' transformations. There's nothing to the contrary that Remus doesn't transform after taking the Wolfsbane potion, if anything he might have a bit more consciousness, than normal; or more likely; might not hurt as much (Though I imagine it still hurts) but he still transforms.

Bill wasn't transformed, because from my memory Greyback wasn't a Werewolf yet. He just attacked for the hell of it.

**** Fleur didn't know how little the attack would impact Bill when she declared she would stay by his side.

I did not say the Ravenclaw wasn't intelligent enough for her. I said he couldn't keep up with her. Intelligence is not her only quality, nor is it his. Hey, she even deemed him good enough to sneak off into the bushes with. But she didn't stick with him. In one way or another (or many), she found him lacking.

  Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting *a strong, silvery glow*. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.

i don't think 'a strong, silvery glow' was a figure of speech. it's a magical quality that veela have, and in the case of the wedding, altered the perception of those being viewed in the vicinity of the glow. whether fleur was doing it herself, or it was a property of something she was wearing/a charm is unknown

She's from the Continent. Voldemort's reign is largely confined to Britain. This isn't her fight.

But she stays.

She takes Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dean, Luna, Ollivander, and Griphook into Shell Cottage. She does not complain--except for the goblin--and is horrified when Harry mentions his intentions to leave.

********* Well, there are a few ways:

- The novelty factor. Given how people generally react around Veela (just look at Ron or Roger Davis), it is not unreasonable to assume that Harry not being influenced at all would be something interesting. And I don't mean that in the "he can resist the allure, he must be my mate" fandom interpretation. More like, Fleur finds it intriguing and wants to get to know Harry better. His ability not to drool is not the reason they get married but the reason why she would want to get to know him.

- Letters/Penpals after the tournament, Harry asking for advice, maybe somehow accidentally stopping the whole Bill romance. Fast forward to the winter or Easter holidays and Harry is his usual OotP, broody self. Fleur talks him through it, they get closer. Sirius dies, Fleur visits her grieving friend, they have a sappy moment where Harry pours out his soul and admits how much she and her support mean to him.

- Fleur gets fed up by Ginny's and Molly's treatment, confronts Bill about it a few times but he sees no problem with his family's actions. So Fleur calls off the engagement and picks the worst/best possible rebound. Harry. You can also shoehorn Tonks into this one on top of Harry/Fleur.

- Bill dies during the war, queue some hurt/comfort which slowly changes into a relationship which neither can nor is willing to define.

** Other people have already commented most of the general character traits which make her an appealing character to me (badass, attractive and knows it, proud to the point of it being a flaw), so I'll just throw out a few things that I don't see as often and common misconceptions.

- Despite apparently scoring poorly on the first task (she scored less than 40, and given Cedric scored 38 it's likely she scored the lowest), it's obvious if you read the descriptions of what they did that she had the best solution. She put the dragon to sleep and took the egg: simple and effective. She was quicker than Cedric (it's not clarified who was faster between her and Krum), wasn't injured unlike Cedric or Harry, and didn't massacre a bunch of dragon babies. Make of this what you will; it can be treated as an example of sexism, anti-veela discrimination, or just another JKR flub. I tend to think that Rowling just hates cheerleaders and made a fantasy race as a punching bag, only deciding later that she wanted Fleur to be a real person.
- Veela during the World Cup seem to at least partially rely on music or dance for their "allure." When i write distinctly non-human veela, I like to make their magic dependent on song or other arts.
- Fleur, on the other hand, never exhibits any evidence of allure (boys drooling at a hot girl is well within Rowling's usual range of comedic hyperbole). This could be because she is barely veela, she never 'activates' it, or some other reason, but in canon there is little evidence she has to deal with much more than any other extremely attractive woman. That's still enough to have a significant effect on her character, but I find it annoying when writers act like she's the only woman to ever have to deal with unwanted suitors.
- As far as we can tell, she really doesn't care about anybody other than her sister until she meets Bill. Obviously we don't see enough of her to know for sure, but she seems to not get along with her peers very well and she doesn't seem particularly alarmed by the animosity she receives from the Weasleys. She is not going to fall for the first person to leave her alone. /Cadmean Victory/ does a lot of things wrong, but I think that Fleur's relationship with her sister was done well and the fact it takes a while to get along with Harry was accurate. Then she angsts about her Veela Allure™ and moves in with a 15 year old, but whatever.
- I think we can learn a lot from the fact that she married Bill (ignoring the marrying someone ~7 years older just out of high school aspect). Bill is described as fairly stereotypically "cool," but he's also very intelligent and has a dangerous career. Ginny says that Bill likes Fleur because he "likes a bit of adventure" (HBP), but I think this is almost certainly equally true of Fleur.

I also think a lot of writers waste her mother's character (Apolline /is/ a canon name, incidentally, in case anybody was unsure like me). If you go with the usual fanon standard of Apolline being half-veela, she likely has had a very conflicted life, more so than Fleur.

**** Yeah, a romance between the two of them could be a great story. I keep wanting to write about Apolline leaving her mother for France (in my headcanon her veela mother raised her on her own in Croatia) and working to integrate herself in human society, meeting her husband along the way. But then that reminds me I want to write about Gabrielle embracing her nonhuman heritage despite showing it less obviously than Fleur, wearing feathers in her hair and being a professional duelist and traveling all the time and being generally awesome. The Delacours are great (in my 90% original headcanon, at least).

** An incredibly beautiful woman, protagonist in the dreams of a thousand boys, that when it comes down to it is also frighteningly intelligent and a skilled witch.

I think it would fit her to be a bit of a bitch when she wants to be. Snark, wit and banter turned to 100. I think she would be very much a "learn for a purpose" kind of person, rather than just generally interested in any- and everything.

The whole Veela thing... Well, if it has to be in there, I would like it to be explored more. If its a thing, don't just make it a boon without downsides. One of the easiest disadvanatges of a Veela partner is simply the threat of a continuous feeling of inadequacy.

But in general, I like it when Fleur has only ever inherited the looks from that part of her family.
