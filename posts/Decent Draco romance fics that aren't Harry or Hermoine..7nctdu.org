  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.

** [[https://dgficexchange.livejournal.com/99388.html][The Good People]]: Draco/Ginny. My favorite thing about this story is its uniquely engaging narrative voice that so seamlessly interweaves angst and misery and wry observations and its continuously dry humor. Both amusing and evocative, the story is about Draco's post-war struggles through his personal demons, addictions and the past that he can't run from.

The Malfoy Case - linkffn(10202355) - Draco/Astoria. Case fic, primarily deals with Draco's efforts to overcome his family's influence and stand on his own feet.

Within These Walls - linkao3(927466) - Draco/Seamus. Set in Carrow-era Hogwarts. A clandestine romance set in the background of so much fear and uncertainty, one of my favorites.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=14482&chapter=1][Better When We're Together]] - Slytherin Ron, Draco/Ron. Makes a reasonably convincing case for an out-of-place Weasley developing feelings for an obnoxious, petty, prejudiced Malfoy.

the albatross did follow - linkffn(11128944) - Action focused Draco/Ginny. Draco and Ginny are stuck in an oil painting in which they relive the same events over and over again. Ginny's gotta find a way to break the enchantment.

  Treasure. Secrets and espionage. A mysterious oil painting. Draco Malfoy has gone missing, and Ginny Weasley has been hired to find him. It's the perfect storm for adventure---one with a dangerous outcome that no one, not even Ginny, could have predicted.

  Torture, rebellion, war and Draco Malfoy. Seamus won't even know where to start telling this story if they all make it out the other side.
