Even assuming you can place spells on them to control them, and to help them find recipients, owls have a top speed of around 30 MPH to 40 MPH. By my estimate, sending a letter from Hogsmeade to the Ministry of Magic would be a 15+ hour flight. That's much too slow to be an effective form of communication.


** I read a fanfic that involved like them being able to travel via pockets of space-time or via magical ley lines or something. Can't remember exactly but it was cool.

** Anyone know why owls? Is there some folklore of witches using owls? Or of owls being able to find anyone they seek?

The only example in my mind is Archimedes in Disney's Sword in the Stone.

*** That's basically it. Owls are associated with Wisdom and 'Magic' in a natural sense rather than a man-made sense. They're not familiars, just omens and symbols. Also, JK thought they were cool. From the HP Lexicon:

Q: Why did you choose the owl as the animal messenger in your books? A. Because owls are traditionally associated with magic, and I like them. -- J.K. Rowling (Sch2)

**** Thanks for the answer and for the link (some interesting ideas there, none of which show up in canon).

***** Sure. I was curious myself and had looked it up before. It doesn't really appear as an obvious or natural choice, using owls as a postal service.

And indeed there are some interesting ideas! Though I have seen the owl egg curing alcoholism one in a fic once - Harry got drunk and Poppy crushed an owl egg on his forehead to sober him up. Drew out the alcohol through his pores and then she set it on fire to burn it off. It did burn like nitrocellulose, so he didn't lose his eyebrows, but it wasn't a cure I expected to read ever.

I really need to find that fic again. :D

** That's still faster than mailing a letter using the postal service. They can make calls using the floo if they want instant communication.

**** JKR (as usual) is terrible in math, so letters between Hogwarts and southern England often travel just too fast. Apparition is one sad attempt to reconcile this problem.

***** But I thought Owls weren't considered magical beings, at least at the time when the original phantastic beasts and where to find them was released that was canon

** Using owls as messengers were one of the things I found quirky in Harry Potter when I was a kid. I loved it. I don't think I would have been interested if the wizards used pigeons or falcons.

However, I do recognize that I too wondered how owls delivered letters and parcels. I think it was written that these were tied to their legs but I remember some illustrations of owls carrying things on their beaks.

Anyway, I always liked to think that post owls weren't ordinary owls. They were especially bred to have special attributes (fly faster? sense & go through magical wormholes?) and went to "owl school." Pigwidgeon is an obvious anomaly but maybe he was a "reject" of the school and turned loose when he didn't make the cut. Come to think of it, the Weasley family owl, Errol, may have been an almost-reject, so it's not only his age that makes him unreliable.

** I used the distance from London to the Scottish highlands of 430 miles. I divided by 30 MPH to get 14 hours. What values did you use?

The best actual postal service for mail in the UK, I found, only guarantees 1 day delivery. So owls seem perfectly fine for delivering mail. If it's truly urgent, one can floo, apparate, portkey, or send a patronus. And they clearly do work as an effective form of communication, given that we see wizards communicating just fine with owls.

Additionally, owls have an innate magical nature that allows them to track people. I wouldn't be surprised if that same nature conferred advantages with speed of flight.

*** Inverness, on Scotland's northeastern shoreline, is about 567 miles from London. Assuming you use a Great Horned Owl, which is considered the fastest at a top speed of 40 mph, you get a rough travel time of about 14 hours. However, that doesn't take into account any weather conditions or the stamina of the owl, so I added on a bit more, since a predatorial bird like an owl isn't going to maintain top speed that long.

I hadn't thought to compare it to the Muggle system. I suppose you have a point there.
