I'm reading and enjoying ffn(midnight blues by Zeitgeist84) right now, and was wondering if there are other fics like it. Really digging the Jason Statham-like Harry and the buddy cop vibe it's got going.

Basically, I want funny adventure fics that poke fun at canon/fanon. No serious stuff. Also no romcoms or mindless fluff.

**** As the bloke who wrote the fic you were talking about in the OP, I second the recommendation of A Black Comedy, it's half the inspiration for Midnight Blues (the other half being an eclectic mix James Bond, Archer, Guy Ritchie crime movies, every 80s buddy cop movie ever, and The Big Lebowski).

** linkffn(10287864) is a pretty unique comedy. I don't see it recommended very often. That being said, it's not a buddy cop kind of thing.

  AU Start to Sixth Year. What do you do to stop a genocidal dark wizard? Try appeasement. If it sinks your entire economy, well... That just makes things more interesting.

** linkffn(Phantom Limb by rbackwards) has a unique writing style and wacky sounding but really well thought out premise.

linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) is a super fem!Harry that nonetheless manages to be interesting. Its more serious sidefic linkffn(Elanor Potter and the Train Station called Purgatory) is pretty great too.

*** I don't think Phantom Limb counts as a comedy, much less the type the OP's looking for... It's really good in a Luna-ish way, but it's pretty serious.

  Lily is not quite a normal little girl. The Dursleys always say she's a freak just like her freakish parents, her uncle Death seems to be convinced she's the grim reaper, and her ever political and invisible best friend Wizard Lenin just thinks she should take over the world. On top of all that the secret society of wizards think she's Jesus. AU female!Harry among other things.

  Ellie Potter was never the boy who lived, she just happened to be in the same room at the same time, and yet she can't help but grow and notice that it is never Harry Potter who must fight his own demons. Side fic/Spin off to "Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus"

** I got about 3/4 of the way through chapter 2 before getting annoyed. It probably has potential but Ginny/Harry, even as i'ts written, really squicks me out, ESPECIALLY as Z84 mentioned the reason I hate them: That Harry and Ginny are the second coming of James and Lily. Such gross. So oedipal.
