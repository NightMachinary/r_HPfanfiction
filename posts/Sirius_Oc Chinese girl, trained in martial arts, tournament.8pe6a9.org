Hi All, desperately looking for a fanfiction that I believe used to be on hpff, was a Chinese oc who was trained in deadly martial arts (secret) who ended up in a hogwarts triwizard tournament kind of thing and I'm fairly sure there was a dragon. Sirius oc, used to be my favourite story. Thank you :)
