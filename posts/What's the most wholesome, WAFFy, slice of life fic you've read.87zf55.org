** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11289525/1/A-Good-Teacher]] Nice story where Harry apparently time travels to give young Harry and Dudley support while they're still in primary school.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild]] It's recced a lot, but red-haired Harry and Weasley family friendship.

Edit: Bot messing up, have links instead.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys][Dinner With the Weasleys]] is one of the most wholesome stories I know. This is the fanfic equivalent of the Sunday dinners at your grandparents' house after church.
