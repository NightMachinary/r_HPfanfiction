It is just such a widespread concept in the fandom that I got curious. Is it from some comment in cannon that I've forgotten about, some historical/cultural thing translated over to the magical world, or maybe even because Voldemort calls himself a lord or anything like it?


** The Black family self-style themselves as The Ancient and Most Noble, and some people copy that over to all the pureblood or Sacred 28 families.

I think they're missing the point, though - the styling is particular to the Black family and shows how /that/ family, as a whole, consider themselves superior to literally everyone else, including the other (possibly older, possibly purer) S28 families. Imo it also ties in to how they give themselves celestial names (naming themselves after literally the highest, brightest things in the sky) and might also have something to do with some sort of grudge/self-consciousness they might have about having a surname that's actually a common muggle name too.
