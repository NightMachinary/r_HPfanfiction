  Angelo Tobias Watson-Holmes has lost everything. His parents, his wife, his son, and his will to live. Filling his life with his work and his drinking, he has shut himself away. Then one dark and stormy night the Unspeakables came a'knocking with a question. A very important question that left unanswered could mean the fall of the Potter-Malfoy dynasty and the rise of a Dark Lord.

** If you're going to rename a story, take the old name out of the title and instead make a note in your first chapter's Author's Note that it's been renamed. Poor title choice will be an instant turn off to readers.

Your summary needs work. "Harry Potter does not live with his parents and older brother. Technically, he isn't even living. An ancient agreement made by the first Lord Potter with the ruler of all Vampires has led to him leading a different life than the one he might have had. He is not the fabled child of prophecy, his brother is. It is now time for him to be reintroduced to the Wizarding world."

The first two sentences are great. Succinct, yet intriguing. The third sentence is long winded, has too much irrelevant information in my opinion, is written in passive voice, and is redundant ("has led to him leading a different life"). The fourth sentence is grammatically incorrect and could be reworked. The last sentence is written in passive voice and therefore implies that Harry is a passive, reactive character- if he isn't, shift to active voice.

You need to mix up your long sentences with shorter ones. Most of your run on sentences could be at least two if not three sentences, and the descriptions of the potter manor are long winded and tedious. Your backstory would be more interesting if it took place through dialogue instead of an information dump. Try holding back on half of your backstory and sprinkling it throughout the story instead. You don't have to write down all of your ideas right in the story, it's more interesting to the reader if they find out what is going on through the characters asking questions.

Many writers have two documents: one is where all of the backstory is explained, and the other one is the actual story. You can draw on the first document's information whenever you need to, but the second document should be all about crafting a compelling story to the reader, not about writing down all of your ideas.

Generally, if your first chapter is just an info dump, no one will continue reading it, so I'd recommend ruthlessly editing your first chapter (and your title/summary) if you want more readers.

Happy writing!

*** Thank you ever so much. This is precisely the sort of feedback that I needed and which no one has given me until now. I see exactly what you mean, especially with the summary and the sentence length. Hopefully I will get round to changing these things in the next few days.
