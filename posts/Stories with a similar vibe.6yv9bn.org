Read linkffn(10772496) in 3 days earlier this week. I couldn't put it down! And I'm wondering if there are similar time travel to Marauders era stories, you know, the stories where you can help smiling and giggling all the time. I resisted reading this story for years but it finally won me over. I've read 90% of the Sirius/Hermione marauder era stories with over 100k wording, but I'm looking for others. The pairing doesn't matter as long as Hermione or the other time traveler is best friends/good fri nds with the marauders. But I would really prefer a Hermione story. And even if they try to change the future Harry has to be born. Over 100k wording and hopefully finished, but as long as it's over 100k it doesn't matter.

Thank you!


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10871795/1/A-Little-Child-Shall-Lead-Them][A Little Child Shall Lead Them]], linkffn(10871795), is not long, but by far my favorite Hermione time travel to Marauder Era. She and Dumbledore finished off Voldemort and Death Eaters in an efficient way, without all the angst and manufactured drama, but then had to face the real challenge.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

  When Hermione finds a way to bring Sirius back from the veil, her actions change the rest of the war. Little does she know her spell restoring him to life provokes magic she doesn't understand and sets her on a path that ends with a Time-Turner. [Currently Being Updated.

** You said you've read a lot of Sirius/Hermione marauder era stories so you might have read these already.

Roundabout Destiny Linkffn(8311387)

One Hundred and Sixty Nine Linkffn(8581093)

Sands of Destiny Linkffn(7218826) This is the best one imo sadly it's incomplete.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
