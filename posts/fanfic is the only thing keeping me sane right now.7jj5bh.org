*** Rock on dude!! Some of my close friends are volunteer firefighters- you guys do a lot of good work! They have trouble balancing it with their school but they're coming straight from high school, 12 years must be a tough gap to readjust. Read all the fanfic you need to get through!

**** Basic training was 2 days, machinists training 3 days, SCBA training another 3 and then there are monthly exercises in the evenings and a couple special trainings for us SCBA wearers on evenings and Saturdays.

Which country would it be? I'm in Switzerland and I know Germany and Austria also have volunteer firefighters (though each country treats them differently).

***** Thank for the reply!

I am from Russia. I just tried to google some information about it and there seem to have been one or two volunteer groups to put out forest fires in some regions. But I don't think there was such a training as you had.

I still think it strange that they allow just some people "from the street" with a week worth of training to come close to such dangerous situations. Or are there restrictions on the kind of work that you do as opposed to a professional firefighter?

******* If you have a written diagnosis of ADHD, that counts as a disability that your school should accommodate with extended exam time, test taking in a reduced distraction environment, and possibly note taking by a classmate. Just mentioning it because you sound like me prior to my diagnosis of moderate inattentive adhd at the age of 21, which is notoriously underdiagnosed and more common in women. Twice the time on exams was a godsend during my college engineering classes, since zoning out at the wall every five minutes is awful for solving math problems on a timeframe.
