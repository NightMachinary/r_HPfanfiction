*Prologue: The Attack On Godric's Hollow.*

It was a perfectly fitting Halloween night - dark, and while it wasn't raining there were definite thunderclaps in the distance.

For Lily Potter, currently of Godric's Hollow, these thunderclaps meant more than just atmosphere. It meant that, on the one hand, her house could be entered without her ever knowing - but on the other hand, it meant that the spells and potions she'd designed would definitely work even if she had to do the final steps alone.

Months ago, when Severus Snape unexpectedly contacted the Potters, a slight panic had ensued. For one, it was immediately told that Peter Pettigrew, their secret-keeper, had squeaked “like the rat he played at being”. The Fidelius Charm had fallen that night, and hasty protections erected to stave off the inevitable.

Mercifully, Snape then told them that Voldemort's plans were to attack on Halloween - when it would be easiest to subvert prophecy. This was good. This gave them time to prepare, to /maybe/ survive. Escape plans were made and discarded - Voldemort would be watching the cottage now, and with his spies in the Ministry he'd even know if the Floo was used. There was no safe way out, and the Potters knew it.

Eventually, a viable plan was made. Lily, with help of Albus Dumbledore, had set her talents in Charms and Potions to work, creating a combination - a ritual, though the Wizarding World didn't use that word often - that might work. Albus Dumbledore, with his political connections, also made good on a promise to let Severus Snape live in exile - preparations were made for the man to change names and move out onto the continent, far away from any reminders of his homeland.

Felix Felicis, or a version thereof, played a large role - while ordinarily the potion was decidedly unsafe for children, its effects were ideal for the circumstance. Magic, a slightly alive force, would not take kindly to the attempt to subvert prophecy - and Felix Felicis was a potion that let Magic “take the wheel”.

The potion, combined with saturating the ambient forces of magic and several spells layered on Harry Potter himself, were all meant to strengthen the prophecy - specifically, “but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not”. A spell was created to strengthen Harry's accidental magic, and then a variation of Felix Felicis would let it guide Harry instead of the other way around.

It would only last for a few moments, and given the unpredictability of accidental magic, it was a scary prospect. But, it was the best they had.

Lily took a few moments to comfort Harry. James was still out to fetch Albus - it would be easier and less risky for all three of them to work the spells, and to contain any unforeseen effects. In a few short moments, Lily would have to do all of that alone, and the spells would cause Harry some degree of distress as they affected the baby's senses.

All too soon, the clock struck - and predictably, the sound of thunderclaps became a loud banging on the magically-sealed door. There was no more time.

Muttering incantations, Lily kept her son in as tight a hug as she could, fueling the magic with her love. Just as a loud bang rocked the house, Lily finished the last spell, and quickly produced a baby-bottle laced with the altered Felix Felicis - Harry drank without noticing anything odd, at least for now. Just as Lily placed Harry back in his crib, the door to the nursery opened.

The last thing Lily saw was a flash of red - Severus had apparently made good on his attempt to get Voldemort to spare her, a last apology by her former friend, accepted by the Dark Lord under the guise of him wanting Lily for himself - before unconsciousness took her.

Harry sensed, rather than saw, the stillness in his mummy - and the decidedly malevolent energy from the figure at the door. In his childish mind, a lot of things suddenly felt /wrong/ - his Mummy was too still on the floor, he didn't know whomever this was, and the energy he was emanating was so foul it was hurting Harry just to be near it.

A sharp shock prickled the toddler, who responded instinctively by standing up. Just as he heard a strange word, “Avada -”, something shifted. Harry knew that he was doing something, but didn't know how to control it - even as it blew the strange man across the room repeatedly, the pale green light from his magic vanishing as the stick - no, wand - was pulled violently from his hand.

Harry vaguely realized he wasn't actually in his crib anymore. He was floating above it, still held in the throes of whatever this energy was. The man had long since gone even more still than mum - he wasn't even breathing anymore, whereas mummy still was.

At that moment, James Potter and Albus Dumbledore returned. Shocked, they both watched as Harry Potter floated above his ruined crib, everything else in the room whirling dangerously - Harry himself seeming to be as distressed as they felt, as occasionally a flash of light caused him to jerk around.

At that moment, Harry felt an intense double heartbeat. His father and the kindly old man who sometimes visited, seemed to have regained their senses just in time to witness this last surprise - Harry saw a vision of a small bird, and wanted nothing more at that moment to be that bird, to not have to worry about hurting his mummy, or his daddy, or anyone else.

As the whirlwind of energy and objects subsided, Albus and James were in for one last surprise, as little Harry Potter, all of one-and-a-half year old, did what they would never have predicted. Just as Lily woke up, she too watched as her little baby boy completed the Animagus transformation, a little gray-white owl chick laying exhausted and asleep in the ruins of what once was his nursery room.

--------------

There it is, the prologue chapter to my OwlAnimagus!Harry fanfic, which started because of this snippet: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/k4jckg/harrys_animagus_form_is_a_owl_hedwig_teaches_him/ge9d14j/]]

This chapter has rather a lot more action than the rest of the fic will have. As part of the AU, Voldemort never found out how to make Horcruxes - so his death will actually stick, but his followers are still around and cursed objects aren't Voldemort-exclusive commodities. I'm planning on mostly slice-of-life and mystery with relatively little actual /danger/ for the protagonist.

Also, outside of his Animagus form, the absolutely insane amount of power Harry shows in the prologue is temporary - I'm hoping I got that across in the chapter itself, but I know Super!Harry tends to be a turn-off so I'm also mentioning it here.

Please, offer critiques and improvements here. I'd want this to be the best it can be, before I put it on FFN for posterity.


** Some explanation about why Harry would like to be a owl of all birds specifically would be nice. Apart from that, nice prologue.

*** It's actually a version of the (Pottermore-)canon Animagus potion effect, which his magical surge is acting as a shortcut to/imitation of in that moment - that gives you a brief vision of the animal you turn into, after which you transform. Another hint to that effect is the "intense double heartbeat" that Harry feels, that's also how Pottermore describes the first transformation feeling.

Canonically, the Animagus potion doesn't really give you a choice as to "which animal do you end up with". If Harry had any control over that, I'd all but guarantee he wouldn't steer himself towards "owl" - in fact, in the brief scene that shows Harry's vision, I use the word "bird" to hint at the fact that Harry doesn't know which specific kind of bird he's seeing.\\
If Harry had a choice, he'd become an animal he immediately recognized - any of the stuffed toys in his crib, or a baby version of his dad's stag-form (which would more closely resemble the adult version than an owl-chick resembles an adult owl).

**** Well then, elaborating more on the brief vision would be good.

Harry would know that owls delivers letters at the very least. I mean, Harry is 1.5 years old and has been living in a wizarding family, he has probably seen a owl or two flying a letter home.

***** Those are adult owls, though - birds tend to have fairly large differences in how the baby version looks compared to the adult. Compare this...

to this:

I will be elaborating a bit more (specifically that it looks /somewhat/ familiar but not really) thanks to your feedback, but to a child of all of one-and-a-half those two might as well be completely different species of bird. Harry would definitely recognize the latter as an "owl" but /probably/ not the former.

If I changed that paragraph to the below, would that help?

--------------

At that moment, Harry felt an intense double heartbeat. His father and the kindly old man who sometimes visited, seemed to have regained their senses just in time to witness this last surprise - Harry saw a vision of a small grey bird he didn't quite recognize, but that looked kind of like a small, fuzzier version of the birds that sometimes brought his mum and dad things. At that moment, he wanted nothing more to be not hurting his mummy and daddy, to not be Harry Potter who was currently making a mess of the nursery. His mind latched onto becoming that bird he just saw, as a way to not be in the middle of whatever was happening.

****** I mean, Sirius' Pigwidgeon was basically a baby owl as well, right? Maybe have Sirius' usual owl be a baby as well. Have him introduce the owl to Harry before Potter Family goes to hiding (meeting of the babies, blah blah blah).

******* I was under the impression that Pigwidgeon was some species of Burrowing, Pygmy or Elf Owl, as they usually retain a small size. Baby Owls can't fly until they are fledglings at around six weeks of growth and are at full adult size around 8-9 weeks or thereabouts.

******** The Wiki has Pigwidgeon as a "miniature" scops owl, which is a genus that's on the small end of the spectrum to begin with - averaging 20 centimeters in height in the case of the (common) Eurasian Scops Owl.

For reference, the elf owl is the very smallest species at 12-14 centimeters. Hedwig, a snowy owl, would be at least 3 times as tall as Pigwidgeon from head to talons if we take the average sizes - male snowy owls averaging 60 centimeters, with females being a bit bigger.

** What I found weird was the shift of perspective from Lily to Harry. In the beginning it seems like the chapter is told from Lily's perspective, but with her getting hit by the stunner (?) we suddenly are being told how Harry feels.

Maybe just not go into what the characters feel, and just tell what is happening? Although then you'd have to pass on telling about the "intense double heartbeat"... Still that could be told in a later flashback.

Otherwise I really liked it! Good work.

*** It is, in fact, a Stunner she gets hit by. There's an explanation that will be pieced together over time for /why/ a Stunner and not a Killing Curse, but it won't be for a while - Snape's self-exiled, and Voldemort's dead. There's no-one they can question for the information at this point.

Thanks for the advice regarding perspective-shifting. Most of the fic will follow Harry's viewpoint exclusively, with minimal flashbacks or perspective-shifting and more forewarning when it happens - I couldn't write what I wanted in a way that avoided a certain degree of perspective-shifting here, though. Not without spending another month figuring it out, and I find my muse drying up rather quickly from writing-and-rewriting to that degree.

**** Counterpoint: the perspective shift didn't bother me at all. For me it read smoothly as an omniscient narrator.

My nitpick would be that Harry didn't notice anything wrong. At that age kids are very alert to differences, and the stress from Lily plus the loud noises would be noticed by Harry, and he would either be curious or scared (depending on how well Lily kept her cool).

Otherwise, it was great! Looking forward to more, and thanks for the reply to bring me here :)

I made one small alteration, to make it somewhat more clear that Harry doesn't quite recognize the bird he's turning into. The shifting-perspectives, while a valid criticism, would be another month of re-writing to correct - so I'm calling it good enough.
