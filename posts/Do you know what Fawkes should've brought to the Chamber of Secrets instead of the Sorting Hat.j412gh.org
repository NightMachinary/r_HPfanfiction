A rooster.

Just flame travel (or whatever it's called) to a farm, grab a rooster and travel back. /Violà!/ Dead Basilisk.

Even getting Dumbledore would've been more useful (assuming he wasn't the one who sent the Hat, which he totally was) instead of asking a twelve year old to stab a millennia old basilisk.

​

The problem is that the basilisk would be small and weak at the beginning and take a lot of time to grow up to a useful size... But a small one for testing purposes would be manageable, if highly illegal, endavour.

By definition, that makes it /poor/ character writing, not excellent. Well written characters actually drive the plot, instead of the /plot driving them./ It's what they do in situations that make them good characters, not the author telling us that they've so-and-so traits and qualities.
