It protects Harry and his 'companions', and Cedric and Sirius only die because they came along independently and completely of their own volition. Harry was protected from Voldemort/death eaters by something vaguely like Felix Felicis right up til the end of book 7.

This explains why Dumbledore didn't bother training Harry or anything, and just pointed him in the right direction and said "go".


** Dumbledore trusted that too much....

** My headcanon is that it's because of the prophecy. If Harry had died from a troll or a snake or a Dementor or something else that isn't Voldemort, it'd have made it impossible for him to kill or be killed by the Dark Lord.

*** Unless someone knows necromancy of course. Thats why its banned, it completely messes up prophecies when death isn't necessarily final.
