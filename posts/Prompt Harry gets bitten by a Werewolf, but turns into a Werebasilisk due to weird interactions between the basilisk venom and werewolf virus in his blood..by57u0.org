** Actually I think there's a story that's more or less this theme. Regrettably it turns into a Snarry by the end though. No werewolf involved but otherwise what you wanted. *pokes through favorited stories* . . .

Found it! linkffn(Unexpected Effects by made.of.bees)

Been months since I read through it, but I remember it being reasonably well written. Enjoy.

*** You had me until Snarry. Hate that pairing with every fiber of my being. It's such a useless, unbelievable, disgusting pairing.

**** I honestly hate the pairing myself, and generally do everything I can to avoid it. That said every so often I read something only to look at it months later and go 'I read this /why/, exactly?'

This is one such story.

#+begin_quote
  Two years after being impaled by the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, Harry starts noticing some...odd changes. During eighth year he can no longer pretend, and has to deal with what he's become. In order to do that, he has to get help from someone less-than-ideal. Over the years, Harry and Snape's relationship grows; now with an alternative Snarry ending. Rating to be safe.

** A sorta-similar story is the sadly-on-hiatus [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8106168/1/Weres-Harry][Were's Harry]] where the fragment of Voldie's soul interacts/fights with a Werewolf bite (pre-Hogwarts) to give Harry full Lycanthrope abilities (without the silver/moon downsides).

When Harry takes down the Basilisk, the aftermath involves his Were-form adapting slightly to give him envenomed claws (as some unfortunate Death nibblers discovered).
