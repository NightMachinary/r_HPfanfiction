During a class assignment hermione learns she is the sister of Draco Malfoy, abondoned at the age of one because they thought her to be a squib.

Draco tries to act all family friendly so she punches him in the face and says harry and weasleys are her family not some stuck up bigots. She still helps defeat voldemort and fight alonside harry and ron.

(it always annoys me that hermione immedietly goes dark in these sort of fics, why would she help people who want to kill her friends and wanted to kill her too?)

** I'll only accept this idea if Draco, who has spent his whole life as a sad only child on the Malfoy's vast but empty estate, is emotionally desperate for a sibling which makes Hermione the answer to his prayers. He spends the rest of the books following her around like a lovesick puppy trying in vain to apologize for his actions and profess his brotherly love for her no matter how many times she loudly rejects his offer of family and kicks him down one of the moving staircases.

Bonus points if in the process of standing up for his sister against those who still disparage her Draco becomes the wizarding world's greatest crusader for Muggle/house-elf/werewolf/nargle rights. This is what finally wins over Hermione, except that it's not sisterly love that she develops for her brave white haired knight but lustful teenage romantic love. Draco then spends hours repeatedly throwing up after his sister's declaration of forgiveness and chaste kiss turned out to involve a lot more forceful tongue and pelvic grinding than he'd expected between siblings.

"I don't know," Hermione admitted. "You?" His knuckles were white on his wand. "A sister," he said, his voice very low, "I'm hoping for a sister." Winner 2015 Energize WIP Awards. COMPLETE.
