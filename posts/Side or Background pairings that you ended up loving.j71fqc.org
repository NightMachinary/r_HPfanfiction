For instance (I can't remember the title, now, unfortunately). But there was a story I read, that was Padma Patil/Anthony Goldstein, in the background, and now it's one of my favorite headcanon type of stories.

Or Blaise Zabini/Susan Bones was in a side/background type of story (can't remember the name), but I really liked that, too.

There was also a couple of Percy/Theodore, a George/Draco and the like, that I really enjoyed.

Can be het/slash/femslash/threesomes or anything like that. Can be on any site/can be any length/can be old or new

Feel free to list as many as you want, as well as the story they were in. (Doesn't have to have been a side/background pairing). Just something random, not used in most stories, that you really loved.

Maybe others can also find you stories, with those pairings.


** Ron/daphne and hermione/tracy I've only seen them twice and once respectively but I'd like to see more

** There was Blaise/Susan in linkffn(Harry Potter and Dumbledore's Army) which I liked. Also not sure if this fits your request exactly but Theodore Nott/Hufflepuff OC in [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=1710&chapno=1][Distractions]] on the Sugar Quill. The latter sort of isn't background because the story is about them but it is set with cannon events of OotP in the background. It is AU after that because it was a written before HBP.

** I've seen Victor Krum/Millicent Bulstrode a few times, and thought it was fun. Hermione/Padma from FILFy Teacher was something that made perfect sense to me as soon as I read it.

X-Over wise, I thought a background pairing between Luna and Beast Boy was a thing of beauty.
