I know this is weird but i did some looking. I limited my fics to 60k plus featuring harry and no ocs. 90% were slash. The rest were totally crap. I dont really understand why... Help?

Edit. I am so sorry for the terrible grammatical errors in the title. I seem to be off my game today totally.


** Many Twilight writers are teen girls, because that's the target audience of the canon novel. Since once upon a time I was a teen girl... and many years ago I wrote a Twilight/Harry Potter slash fic.... I can tell you that most of these type of crossovers are the byproduct of hormones and wishful thinking. I think I remember personally wtitting my horrid fic because every Edward/Harry story I had found was poorly written + a rehash of the same plot so /surely/ I could do better! Obviously, I did not. They were kissing three chapters in and the plot was an after thought since all I /really/ wanted was to read about two cute boys getting their romance on.

**** Shrug. I'm a woman who likes men, and the only thing better than one dick is two dicks, in my opinion. I don't personally like femslash, but I'm not going to fault anyone for it or yell ew because it's not my preference.

** Terrible stories breed terrible fanfiction, and Twilight is terrible.

** Because Twilight is very poorly written and is mostly enjoyed by people with a similarly low reading and writing level. To be a good writer you have to challenge yourself both in writing and reading. Reading Twilight is in no way challenging.

Edit: To the people down voting me, I'm speaking as someone who read Twilight and Twilight fanfic as a teenager. It's junk food for the brain, nothing wrong with it, but it's no surprise that as a source material it doesn't produce good fanfic.

*** While I agree, I also disagree. I have read many well done twilight fanfictions and my guess, since you have read them too, is that you have read good ones as well. I sometimes feel like those novels that have a good premise but poor execution push the good writers to put something out there of value. Good and bad stories create both good and bad fanfics. Harry Potter is amazing and look at the garbage that comes from that!

I think you are right that it is the writers that are the problem. Most teenage girls are trying to write their first fic and aren't pros at writing so Twilight has a few more piles of garbage than others. (Not all teen girls mind you. Some have quite a talent)

**** Sure, I read some good ones. But they were extremely rare and full of smut.

And yes, the majority of Harry Potter fanfic is crap too. But the series teaches more in terms of character creation, exploring deeper themes and world building than Twilight, which is why you /tend/ to see better quality fanfic. At the same time, it's still not a challenging read, as much as I love it, which is why we still see a lot of crap.

** Ah, my friend, clearly you don't know about linkffn(6263067). Read the AN as intro to the concept, then skip to chapter 2. Thank me later.
