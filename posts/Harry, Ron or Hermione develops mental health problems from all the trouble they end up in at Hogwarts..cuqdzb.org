A big rampaging troll? A teacher being possessed by Voldemort? Man-eating spiders in the forest? A giant deadly snake stalking the halls? An innocent student possessed by Voldemort? A murderer who can go seemingly wherever he pleases? Soul-devouring monsters invading the Quidditch match? A harmless pet turning out to be a Death Eater in disguise? The existence of the Imperius curse?

It occurs to me that at some point, between various magical creatures invading Hogwarts, and various people (and in one case, an animal) turning out to be possessed or Death Eaters in disguise, one of the trio (or heck, one of the other students) might end up a paranoid wreck.\\
Can anyone recommend a fic where a main character ends up having a mental breakdown from one-too-many reveals, break-ins, attacks, bullying/hexes, etc? I already know [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10755544/1/Bowling-For-Hogwarts][Bowling for Hogwarts]]...


** Post DH Harry is suffering from PTSD, survivor's guilt and matyr syndrome. You don't need to search for fanfics. Canon Harry is a headcase. Don't know about Ron and Hermonie.

*** Post DH meaning Cursed Child?

Edit- Harry is plagued with PTSD from GoF onwards. It's what makes OotP so hard to read. I used to think all this while that Harry whined a bit too much in 5th year, but now I know it was his PTSD talking

Just a side question, unrelated, Are /mind healers/ mentioned in Canon? I may have missed it because the entire series, starting from Dursleys, have been careless in handling the characters' mental health.

***** I mean this is reddit. With a 2 sentence story people will list all the mental illnesses the person in the story has.

OP: So we charged this guys credit card 18 times in a row by mistake and he came into the store afterwards and yelled at us for no reason. He was mad even after i politely informed him "not our problem asshole, get the fuck out of our store" then my manager got all mad as well for no reason.

Reddit: Oh he must have been angry because he has Bi Polar Disorder, OCD and Locked In Syndrome.

Its annoying because mental health is a serious subject but any jackass who has been on the internet thinks they can diagnose it.

** Linkffn(The Arithmancer) has Hermione visit a psychotherapist after each year's crazyness, with somewhat edited muggle friendly versions of what happened. After year 7 there's a long talk about how things really happened and how to proceed with PTSD therapy after the huge battle of Hogwarts. It's only a small part of the story but one I liked very much.

** linkffn(Saving Connor by Lightning On The Wave)

*VERY* long series, eventual gay relationship, lots and lots of emotional damage and struggle to heal and learn to open up to people along the way. Also goes very in depth to pureblood customs and courtesies. You'll either love it or hate it, I personally think it drastically improves in the second book so if you can power through the first one it's worth it.

Edit. Rest of the series is on the authors profile. Might take you months to read, each book takes up 1 year just like canon

*** That's an excellent point. I don't know why you're being downvoted for having a differing opinion. In my case, I'd extend that to any kind of fiction or film. We don't need to be made aware of harsh realities through the medium of entertainment. Real life or, like you said, non-fiction is sufficient for that.

I've always found affluent people to be the main consumers of tragedy porn. They've themselves never faced the true meaning of grief, betrayal and never-ending struggle and thus have no problem in sitting through a depiction of such stuff while casually munching popcorn.

Yes, there's tragedy to be seen in the Harry Potter series - but there's a satisfaction at the end; there's an ending that gives meaning to all the sacrifices over the previous chapters and books. Compare that to something like the movie, Legends of the Fall, or even a classic like Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchaali. Both of them are incredibly beautiful movies - but, with both of them, you have to witness a family being completely destroyed and torn asunder for no reason other than the vagaries of life and then expect us to quietly accept this tragedy once the movie ends. Nope, not for me.

**** I'd actually like to say, I personally find reading stories that talk about sensitive topics relieving. Both because it normalizes the topic a little more, which is important because a lot of shitty realities of life are seemingly ignored because it's uncomfortable.

***** Oh, definitely. I never knew about Schizophrenia until I watched A Beautiful Mind in high school - and look at the kind of beautiful sensitivity the movie utilized to address the topic.

I personally find any plot-line dealing with a close family member's death very, very hard to digest, but that doesn't mean I've never found something that could keep me engaged in spite of that. I wept through both We Bought a Zoo as well as After Life. Both of them had some incredibly heart-breaking moments but at least there was some tiny sense of happiness at the end - and that made all that struggle worthwhile.
