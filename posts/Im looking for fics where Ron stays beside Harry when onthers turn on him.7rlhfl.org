I read one or two like that it was mostly when Harry was innocent but for some reason put in Azkaban but Ron believed in his innocence. They could be similiar or not just loyal!Ron

This one is Harry & Sirius centric, but it has a Ron who supports Harry fully, not that Harry knows it.

  Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot.

*** What do you mean? the only part where Ron shows any disloyalty would be forth year, after which both he and harry regret their actions and grow as people.

**** I just looked up the book and timeline; Ron didn't talk to Harry, because he was upset and jealous.

This state of affairs lasted for approximately three weeks (from the Goblet spitting out names to the First Task); aggravating factors were that he didn't know how dangerous the Tournament would really be, Rita Skeeter's article painting Harry as a glory-seeker (which even made up quotes from Harry), and that Harry was practically more antagonistic towards Ron than Ron was to Harry.

I will also note that during this time, Ron didn't do anything beyond refusing to speak to Harry; he didn't wear a Potter Stinks badge, he defended Hermione from Malfoy and Snape, and when he did talk to Harry the worst thing he said were a couple of sarcastic remarks about his publicity.

...Actually, re-reading the book, you know what I noticed? Hedwig was in a huff for that same time period too; she wouldn't take any mail for Harry. I wonder if there's any Hedwig-bashing fics?

***** Hedwig is obviously spying for Dumbledore, and she was promised the gold in Harry´s vaults, and she´s probably a Deatheater, who helps Ginny with her love potions and sells private information to Skeeter. It all makes sense now!

*** Well I don't want to sound rude but why did you answer my question then? I mean I asked for fics where Ron stays beside Harry,and here you are saying that you don't like fics out of character. Where did I ask abou that? Honestly sometimes I feel stupid because I can't understand people
