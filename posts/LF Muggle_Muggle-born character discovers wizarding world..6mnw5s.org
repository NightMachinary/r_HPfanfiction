** linkffn(Grow young with me) and linkffn(Behind blue eyes) both have Harrys gilfriend learn of magic in later chapters. Both stories arent really that great. Grow young with me is overall better however the introduction to magic for the muggle is waaay better in behind blue eyes, mostly because (atleast in my opinion) that was probably the weakest chapter in grow young with me.

The reason I stil recommend them both is because good written stuff like that is quite rare. Northumbrian has his linkffn(Remembrance (or, A Muggle at Hogwarts)) wich shows Colins wife years after the battle of Hogwarts learn of magic but it dosent really go into much detail.

Thats all I have for that.
