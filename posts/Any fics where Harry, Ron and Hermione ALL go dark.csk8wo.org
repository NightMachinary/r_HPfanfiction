I've seen Harry and Hermione on their own and occasionally together but never all three.

*** Ah yeah I forgot about that. Great fic, although it is more Harry going all out with the other two also there.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

***** I would like a humorous dark!Ron fic that's a homage to the criminally underrated Serial Mom

Ron is fantically loyal to his friends to the point where he bumps off anyone who wrong them in anyway

Crabbe shoved Hermione ? Crabbe had an unfortunate adventure with a mace in the dungeons

Pansy insults Harry's mum ? Pansy falls out the seventh floor window

Ron burns down the Dursley's house after picking Harry up in second year

Rita Skeeter is printing lies ? She and and her cameraman fall victim to a murder-sucide

****** So everyone is second year dies right? And then there's some Gryffindors left and a little bunch fro. Other houses. Snape is already dead, the rest of the staff get put down and now Ron is just trying to figure out a way to knock off Dumbledore

**** The story is definitely a guilty pleasure for me, It probably hits every bad or complained about trope at once.

(Death Eater Weasley's, Both Harry and Hermione have special powers, Harry has a unique and powerful inheritance (including being the heir to the British throne), Abusive rapist Ron, Super Seer Lovegood (though in this fic it is shifted to Luna's daughter), Hits about Every Trigger Warning you can think of, tons of discussion of sex and sexuality, Harry and Hermione being literally fated to be together, Narissa being the only good Malfoy, and Dan and Emma Granger.)

It does have some interesting ideas in it, and the writing is good even if the tropes aren't.
