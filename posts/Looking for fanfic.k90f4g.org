:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for this fanfiction where Harry was summoned to another universe where Voldemort rules the Wizarding World (because Harry was not born in that universe, meaning Harry didn't defeat the Dark Lord). There was a part in the story where Harry's friends (Hermione, Neville, Ron, Teddy and Draco were the ones, i think?) from his original world where looking for him but Draco spilled his blood on the ritual they found at Harry's house and also got sent to the universe Harry was summoned to.

In the fanfic, the other universe Draco was Voldemort's heir and there were some scenes where he and Voldemort were having sex. When the other universe Draco saw Harry, he was obsessed with him and he got his blood when they where fighting at the Malfoy tomb where Narcissa was burried (because she was dead in that universe) to make a spell that makes Harry obsessed with him. But the Draco from Harry's original world saw it and stopped him.

Also, in this story, Harry and the order was looking for Voldemort's hocruxes and they also realized that the other universe Draco is a hocrux. And they also destroyed the stage (was it a stage? Or a booth?) where Voldemort and Draco were sitting at a muggle auction (I don't know if it was called a muggle auction but I remember purebloods selling muggles and muggleborns) when they were stealing Hufflepuff's goblet.

This is also a Drarry fanfic.

Do you know the title or maybe the author? If you know please tell me. It would be appreciated! Thak you!
