I don't remember much but I think there was some sort of time travel used and harry used alchemy to make a weighted vest to work out with. Any help is appreciated!


** Does he get the idea to do the weighted vest based on kissing a musician after drinking?

If so it is Harry Potter and The Game by concept101

*** I'm pretty sure he gets the idea because he needs to practice alchemy and he needs to make his workout more difficult

** Possibly Harry Potter and the heir of Slytherin by The Engulfing Silence. He uses a time turner so no one notices he is missing when training with Flamel. It is the sequal toHarry Potter and the Gift of Memories.
