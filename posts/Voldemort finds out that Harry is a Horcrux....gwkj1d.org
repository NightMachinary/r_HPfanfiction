...now he has to do everything in his power... to keep Harry alive.


** He had locked and warded the room. He didn't want anyone to see him this way. With bags and worry lines decorating his face. His robes were wrinkled and smelt faintly of booze from when he missed the cup. The goblet had been discarded about an hour ago and laid on its side near the fireplace. It was dented from where the side had met the stone structure after he tossed it in a fit of rage.

When he first learned that the annoying child that had become the bane of his existence was holding a piece of his soul, he thought it was a twisted joke. There was no way he accidentally made a Horcrux, those things took careful planning! He tried to find some sort of answer but it all leads back to the same answer.

Then he was filled with unchecked rage. He had lashed out and threw hexes at anything that moved. Bella had tried to soothe him? At least that what he thought she was trying to do. It didn't matter, she lost her left hand and wouldn't come within a five-foot radius of him. /Good riddance/, he thought.

Maybe he could recruit a new member to just keep the boy out of his way. He frowned at the thought. He could kidnap the boy and lock him away? Unfortunately, the nuisance had made friends that would look for him. His mind started to wander to Severus but slammed into a brick wall the minute he remembered the boy hated his guts. Draco was also a no-go. What about Parkinson? He wandered to an empty room as he kept trying to find some sort of solution.

He moved past the anger and foolish plans and was now sitting in an armchair drinking straight from a bottle. This was the first time in a long time he felt out of control. He couldn't just command the boy to do what he wanted. He also couldn't leave the child to his own devices. The poor thing had the instincts of a squirrel on crack. How he wasn't dead yet was from divine intervention, he was sure of it. /Fuck,/ He thought somberly, /is my life going to resort to being his personal conscious?/ The thought brought on a new wave of depression, and he gulped down more whiskey savoring the burn. His plans were ruined. The boy was practically raised to oppose him at every step.

After finishing the bottle and smashing it into the fire, he crumpled into the armchair and just let his mind wander. This wouldn't be the end. He'll corrupt the boy. Twist his ideas to appeal to the boy and slowly taint him. He could do this. He just needed copious amounts of poly juice and a random muggle for a new appearance. He'll take up the Defense position, become a mentor to the boy, corrupt his friends, this could work. It was going to take much longer than his initial plan but it would work.

My inspiration was the five stages of grief if you couldn't tell.

****** 5 stages of grief model is developed by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. She developed this to explain what people experience as he/she is grieving and mourning, like for example, if someone has just found out being diagnosed with terminal illness etc. 5 stages of grief are as follows.

- Stage 1: Denial

- Stage 2: Anger

- Stage 3: Bargaining

- Stage 4: Depression

- Stage 5; Acceptance

  Twenty years ago, Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts. Eighteen years ago, Harry Potter disappeared, presumed dead. He only now resurfaces to guide the remaining resistance through the Magical Curtain that separates the rest of the world from Voldemort's empire, where magic is out in the open and wizards reign free. No prominent pairings. 5* from DLP.

  The Dark Lord divines what Harry Potter is in the Forbidden Forest, and revelations lead to incomprehensible consequences. Lord Voldemort has won... and the dystopia is damning. A tale of a fallen hero, dark desires, and a Dark Lord's obsession with something he has lost and finds himself unwillingly lusting after: a soul.

** I find these stories interesting but a lot of the time Voldemort and Harry fall in love or Harry becomes a consort. I hate Voldemort x Harry with a passion, why would you fall in love with someone who killed your parents? Anybody know any Voldemort finds out Harry is his horcrux fanfic without romance?

** Can't recall the name of it, but there's a fic where when Harry goes to the forbidden forest at the end of DH, instead of casting an AK, Voldemort stuns him. Several years(?) of torture and legimency later and Harry manages to escape, but everyone thinks he's been dead.

It was a fantastic read, and as far as I can remember it was complete
