What I mean by that is; what thing in fanfiction do you prioritise?

Is it that the fic is: Similar in tone to the original stories? The pairings? The fic does interesting things with magic? The AU is unique? Interesting prose? Humour?

Or something entirely different?


** 1. Talented Harry, ranging from a generous interpretation of his canon-self to Voldemort's equal.

2. Either complete AU or mostly canonical world. Not a huge fan of in-between - it tends to irritate me, as it's close enough to canon to jar against your sense of how things should be.

3. Magic that maintains the theme and tone of the canonical system, albeit not necessarily factually consistent with canon magic.

4. Either no romance, or Harry paired with someone I consider attractive.

Plus the three major absences:

1. Absence of angst/melodrama/armchair psychology.

2. Absence of Muggles and Muggle-related things playing any significant role in the story.

3. Absence of bashing.

** 1. Pairing: I probably care a little too much, but there are some pairing I just won't read and some that i'll overlook a lot of shit for

2. proper grammar and spelling

   - I don't need everything to be perfect. English isn't my mother tongue so I can look past quite a few errors but if you don't even bother running your story through a spellchecker, I'm not gonna read it

3. Is it abandoned?

   - if it is, i'll need several recommendations to even give it a try

I don't care about originality too much. I'd prefer if it did something different but in the end i just want something well written.

Edit: I could actually take your story as a perfect example. It's yet another 4th year AU, it does some things different, it has interesting magic, Harry is a little OP and I like all of those things but I really only read it because it was tagged as a Honks story. If you hadn't tagged Tonks or Fleur (which I think you added only recently? I might have missed it before) I likely wouldn't even have seen it.

** A believeble Harry. I'm not trying to live my life through him so he doesn't have to be godlike, or even magically strong. But he DOES have to feel like a real person.

Has a sense of plot and knows where it's going. Making things up as you it's not a good practice, doesn't matter what Stephen King says.

Alright prose. Doesn't have to be stellar, just not read like a report.

Believeble romance, with development, jealously and all that entails. Just don't make the characters fall in love and soul bond at first glance.

Must bring something new to the table. Anything is fine as long as it's new.

If I see you bashing any character, I'll close your fic. If there's any slash, I'll close your fic. If I sense you're pouring your political beliefs into it or using your characters as mouthpieces, I'll close your fic.

** Prose, certainly. If the story doesn't have a writing style I can immerse myself in, then I'm unlikely to be making it far into the story. I value emotional resonance more than anything else, and also look out for humour and interesting bits of magic.

Dyfunctional and/or unhealthy relationship dynamics that go beyond the typical "enemy to lovers" trope draw me in. I like unconventional relationship dynamics in general (Dumbledore/Snape is my favorite pairing, so yeah). I can enjoy fluffy stories and rom-coms on occasion, at least when they involve my favourite characters, but it is not something I seek out often. I enjoy coming-of-age stories, stories that explore sexuality, and general character studies of characters. Love large scale AUs with loads of wordbuilding, but there aren't many out there that don't suck.

I dislike character bashing, unestablished characters who obviously lecture through authorial voice and stories that disrespect the source material (deconstructions /can/ work, but it takes a really talented author to pull it off in a palatable way. Generally, adding and expanding is preferable to desconstructing). For romance I avoid excess romantic drama and angst. Marriage law stories, creature fics, indy!Harry.. bleh. Muggle-isms are generally a turn-off too - they almost always feel shoehorned in, and more generally I just don't care to read a mugglized HP world. It's lazy worldbuilding.

** I mainly look for fics with an interesting prose to it. I am honestly not very picky. Cannon, au's, crossovers, any fics that is good. Though I think I currently prefer stories that are not entirely romance centered. If it's well written, I'll go for it.

** 1. A likable, not edgy Harry

2. Believable politics if they are mentioned. It doesn't have to be A song of Ice and Fire, but adults bending over for an eleven year old is an instant no.

3. The right balance between plot and romance. No romance is simply unbelievable. Sure, the middle of a civil war might not be the best time to fall in love, but people do it nonetheless. And if they are unattached, casual sex or even a passing fancy should be mentioned. Something that shows the human side of the MC. At the same time, there should be an actual plot going on, not just shipping for shipping's sake.

4. Hermione portrayed like in canon. She is Harry's one unwavering friend, not a sex goddess or worse than Hitler. Also, she is very pragmatic and not a bloody saint. She led Umbridge into a gangrape, punched Malfoy, brewed polyjuice, helped to raise a giant and was the number two on Britain's wanted list. Stop twisting her into things she never was intended to be.

** Written from a female character's point of view. Failing that, written from the point of view of someone besides Harry. Failing that, a Harry that I don't want to punch.

The protagonist should try to accomplish their own goals. I've read stories from Hermione's POV where her primary goal was to help Harry. She didn't have a side goal of, for instance, getting eleven Os on her NEWTs. She didn't have a goal of getting rid of Voldemort. Her primary goal was to help Harry. That's inhuman.

** 1. I prefer canon pairings, but as long as a pairing is believable and in character I'll read.
2. Time travel.
3. No out of character characters.
4. I like dark fics; suicide, gore, ptsd, self harm, abuse, disorders, depression, injury, sacrafic, etc.
5. Good pacing! Doesn't drag on or too fast.
6. The golden trio acting like siblings/unhealthily codependent golden trio.

** For me, the most important thing is Harry being in character. But if possible, everyone else as well.

I also like when writers pay attention to details from the books, having the characters look and act like wizards.

Other than that, just good grammar, plot, a nice balance between things like angst, action, romance, humour, etc.

** Characters. I want characters that have distinct personalities, and remain generally true to those personalities, or grow in believable ways. I want them to be believable and interact with other people believably. I don't want them to be perfect.

After that, they need to be doing something interesting, so a good plot.

I'm willing to put up with a LOT when it comes to style of writing, but the first two are absolute necessities.

** To get me to read a fic, I require two out of three of the following:

1. An interesting summary.

2. Quality of technical writing.

3. interesting/good magic.

** Outside of the first item, in no order:

1. Pairing. A lot of the canon pairings annoy me, so H/GW & R/Hr don't do it for me. I generally prefer H/Hr, but if they're not prominent in the fic, at least don't mention the pairing of those two (unless it's completely irrelevant to the story, then I won't be irritated by their partner(s) being mentioned in passing).

2. Original stories are nice, but ones which do not stretch the internal logic of the series too far. This includes many Powerful!Harry stories, wherein a kid magically (zing) is as powerful as Voldemort after a bit of studying (guess Tom didn't read enough). Like honestly... Original stories which take the canon universe but have a really novel plot are awesome, like

3. If it's not an original story (or mostly sticks to canon events), I prefer when the author belabor on events that were already well explored in canon, and if possible, finds a way to have certain canon events happen through a different means. Like yea, have Harry, Ron & Hermione become friends in year 1, but something besides the troll incident be the cause would be nice.

4. Any smut either better be exceptionally well written (practically never the case) or it better be placed in such a way that I can skip over it. Seemingly 90% of FF writers insist on having their characters have ridiculous sexual prowess that I instantly suspect that they'v never had sex before, or if they have, they're either overestimating how good they are or showing how silly their idea of good sex is (especially first time sex, it's usually awkward as hell for the most part). I'm sorry, you ain't getting her into a massive orgasm after a few minutes of eating her out and then turn her into a babbling mess because your cock is godly.

5. Bashing can be acceptable (usually not though), but honestly I've had my fill of it. I don't like canon Ron, and canon Dumbledore was rather too manipulative for my liking, but the reaction many fanfics have to this is silly (Greedy Dumbledore trope is stupid, but Negligent Dumbledore is at least factual).

6. Fuck the overly angsty romance. Problems in relationships don't come down to "I don't deserve her...". Relationship problems involve your partner's problems and quirks and if you can accept them, and where necessary, help them work through their issues (and vice versa). It'd be nice for me, for example, to see H/Hr where they realize they each have problems they need to accept and otherwise work on, and then begin to deepen their relationship. It's just more natural and after a few hundred HP fanfics, well, that's nice to see.

** Believable romance with a Charlie Weasley/Hermione Granger pairing. And no, I don't mean when Hermione is an 11-year-old first year at Hogwarts. Also, I prefer stories where Charlie isn't a Christian Grey stand-in. There are far too few stories like this with this pairing. Recently, there's been a dearth is them.

** Consistent, believable multi-dimensional characters. This is the first and main point.

The story may have great plot, very detailed background and good writing, but if its characters can be described with one or two words or their behaviour contradicts the story before, it's a dead end.

Each character should be its own person with his/her own opinion. Therefore the iterations between them should be like between real people, not between Master/Mistress and his/her minions.

** 1. Something new. That's the most important thing I look for. I've been reading fanfics for two years now, so there isn't much that's new to me anymore...

2. Gen or any het paring /except/ Harmony or Snape/*. "Harry P., Hermione G." make me skip a story 9 out of 10 times nowadays.

3. Canon divergence, rather than full on AU that's pretty much Harry Potter in name only. Canon compliant stories are OK as long as they are post Hogwarts or end after Battle of Hogwarts.

4. Absence of overly cliched HP fanfic tropes that should have been retired in 2003 (glamours, lordships, wands with the Trace, etc.). Authors avoiding those seem to have a better grip on canon and characterisations in general.

5. Everyone being IC, unless their OoC thing is /very/ central to the plot and justifiable, but even then, they should stay as much in character as the plot allows. (Lucius Malfoy being remotely nice gives me he heebie-jeebies, though, and not to mention Umbridge... *shudders*)

6. No bashing. And no, if "you're calling someone out on their attitude", chances are, it's bashing.

** I absolutely love any story that has a talented Harry, bonus points if Dumbledore is a good guy, even more if he is characterised properly without being along the lines of "Everything I ever did wrong was a complete misunderstanding" (A.K.A any GoodSnape! fanfic ever)

Lack of bashing is nice.

I adore an in depth magical system.

I also love the fic being centric on war, or war tactics. I have never seen a fic apart from Emperor (absolutely amazing piece of writing) that includes war strategy in any depth. If the OOTP and the Death Eaters are at war, then where the hell are the battles? The strategy?

I also love when the main difference between Harry/Dumbles/Voldemort and normal wizards is not so much power, but knowledge and skill.

There are so many fanfics where Harry could wipe the floor with 20 normal wizards because he's as powerful as them all put together, and his reducto can create another Grand Canyon. I prefer his power to be knowing archaic magic that calls forth the elements themselves, creates earthquskes, etc.

** I look at the era and that Hermione isn't a listed character. I feel like I've read every possible version of Hogwarts and so I'm drawn in more by stories that dare to leave and venture out into the adult world of magic. That goes for cross-overs too, I'll be more interested if they're all adults. Other than that I'll read most genres and a lot of ideas. That's what it takes to get me reading. A decent, somewhat original story is enough after that.

** - A light-hearted, likable tone. Bad stuff can happen (hell, I love /Lady Archimedes/), but like in the original books, I don't want things to devolve into a gritty, edgy angstfest. Humor is always appreciated.

- I usually prefer single-points-of-departure to full AUs, but either way, yes, I do like worldbuilding, be it in the new way the plot moves forward or in new things worldbuilt about the magic, world and creatures.

- Please no prominent shipping. A romance subplot at some point is okay, and I don't much care about what the pairings there are, but I'm simply not looking for romance fics as such.

- I prefer Hogwarts-years things, preferably starting in first or second year, to fourth- or fifth-year. (Mostly because fourth-, fifth- or sixth-year stories have a horrible tendancy to veer off into either "edgy" or "angsty" or "shippy" territory even when the premise sounds fun.)
