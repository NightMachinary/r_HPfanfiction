**** Now, which road to take

The "do you know when she gave birth, professor?" Road,

Or the "yeah I'm sorry she's dead, do you have any idea how someone came to own my /diary/?" Road

** Well, I'm writing a fic which isn't this, but you /might/ like it since it involves a Professor Tom Riddle as well. linffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13586585/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Enigmatic-Professor-Riddle]])

The timeline here is a bit different - basically Tom didn't go straight into the Dark Arts after school, and thus Dumbledore gave him the DADA post. Now Dumbledore is dead and Harry is beginning his first year at Hogwarts. (Minerva is Headmistress)
