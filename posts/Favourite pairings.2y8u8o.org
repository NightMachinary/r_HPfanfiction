Just asking, for curiosity's sake.

Mine are many and varied - lately I've been experiencing some SERIOUS love for Bellatrix/Hermione.


** Harry/Tonks is my favorite.

Large enough age difference to be interesting without being /completely/ unbelievable. Tonks has more agency and can affect the plot more than someone Harry's own age. Plus Tonks is just one of my favorite characters in terms of personality.

** I generally like the idea of Harry/Hermione, but generally dislike Harry/Hermione fics. Delenda Est pretty much got me stuck on Harry/Bella and I've been looking high and low for quality fics. And I've recently been interested in Ron and pretty much anyone besides Hermione or Luna.

*** I think the idea of Bellatrix having some sort of manic-depressive disorder or schizophrenia, or both, explains a lot of her canon behaviour - so I was pleasantly surprised when THAW explored it. Does Delenda Est get into that at all?

**** That's pretty much my headcanon, that she's not evil per se but simply mad. Perhaps originally due to an abusive marriage with Lestrange, a man she was forced by her family to wed (an event which in turn spurred Andromeda to work up the determination and courage to go against her family lest she suffer a similar fate)? I like it since it's quite plausible and allows for a fairly agreeable Bella, personality wise, in fics that focus on her.

******* Earl of the North was a great fic for its time for like the first 15 chapters. Then Harry does nothing and it degenerates into kinda crap. That being said it was a pretty fresh take on Azkaban Harry and for its time period it was a great story. Now it may look cliche, but it kind of invented some cliches.

***** If you invent reasons to dislike something, of course you would dislike it. None of the stuff you wrote is even remotely canon.

Also, Ginny is a chaser in the Holyhead Harpies. She makes her own fame. If she does like her fame, its probably best for the Potter family -- at least /someone/ would know how to manage/manipulate the press.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1512196/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Black-Owl][Harry Potter and the Black Owl]]: Well hidden in the depths of time and no listed characters. The story is a bit simple, the 'twist' is basically obvious from the beginning and then the characters bumble about for ages but the I remember the Harry/Minerva stuff being OK.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7443406/1/Forever-is-a-Long-Time][Forever is a Long Time]]: Much easier to find as it's recent and listed as the pairing. It's actually OK.

- Here Where I Stand at the Turning of the Years: Sadly this one went away some years ago and I've never been able to rediscover it.
