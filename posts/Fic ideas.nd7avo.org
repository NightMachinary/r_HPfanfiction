So I'm looking for fics where James, Lily, Snape, Lupin, Sirius etc returns to life but in the future where Harry is an adult or married with his own family. I didn't have much luck finding those fanfics. More the merrier! Thanks!

Also, maybe fics where Harry's parents returns to life but he is being raised by Snape at the time. Thanks again!


** “Surprise!” by FirePhoenix86 linkffn(5253648), but it is really not very well written. Premise and first few chapters are nice, but then it falls apart.

  Now that Harry is free, he gets another Bombshell revelation about his past that was kept from him, and apparently everyone else as well. Can he finally live his life the way he's always wanted? Parents, his Godfather, and a real family? J/L, HP/GW
