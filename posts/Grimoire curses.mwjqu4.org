I'm looking for a fic, it's on FF

In it Harry gets his family grimoire, it's cursed so that non family members get cursed if they try to read

Of course even after being warned and setting off the lesser defenses hermione gets hurt, but is super self righteous about it


** Was it

*** It was not, thanks for pointing this out though, I'll have to give it a read

The one I'm thinking of, hermione actually tries to read it after being warned and is hurt because of it

** Was it his family Grimoire or merlins? In Runaway Wizard it's merlins and a devils bag?
