IE: Where Harry learns as much as possible about magic, because any child would be all "holy fuck I'm in a magic school magic is cool as fuck"


** That effect would last all of twenty minutes. Then you find out it takes a full hour to learn the most basic of spells, and you have homework, and bullying is a time-honored tradition, and there isn't so much as a television within twenty miles.

Boredom encroaches, along with a grinding moroseness resulting in part from culture shock and in part from the lack of entertainment.

Eventually, that bushy-haired teacher's pet starts nagging you to do your homework, and you /do/ it because it's /something/, but it only takes you a couple hours a week, so you decide to explore the castle, and you find oh fuck there's a giant dog with three heads and did I mention it's the size of a bus and if it even touches you you'll probably need tetanus shots. So that's out, but there's this thing called Quidditch that you can play. And it's a children's game really, chase after the shiny thing, but it's better than sitting around in the common room. And that takes up a few hours a week, which is nice, I suppose, but there are still giant gaping holes in your schedule.

And now you've had time to grow accustomed to Hogwarts a little and started talking to purebloods, and they tell you how they kept amused when growing up. Most of them went into the Muggle world for that. The people from families that make a big deal of being a wizard and living in the wizarding world, like that Neville kid, imply that the fun thing to do is read.

At this point, in your mind, reading == Granger. So you ask her for books to read, and it's like you gave her ten Christmasses all in a row. Now you're buried in books -- literally, but Neville's getting you out, solid chap him -- and while they're mostly school related, at least it's /something/, but you're having trouble understanding some of them, so you ask Granger, and now you've effectively got another fifteen hours a week of schoolwork. Except with Granger, you can actually understand how she explains things to you. She's a smart cookie, and she pays attention to her students -- not that, say, McGonagall doesn't, but the primary function of teachers at Hogwarts is to keep discipline more than to instruct, it seems, so you're grateful.

After a few weeks of that, you tentatively suggest that you stop going to class and just learn from Granger, but at her immediate horror, you backpedal, say you were just joking. You're not sure what you would do with twenty fewer hours of classwork anyway.

By winter break, you realize that Granger's brought you up well past most of your classes. You're still way behind her. You're not sure how she does it. Seems like even when she's teaching you, she's studying her own work. Doesn't really seem fair. So you branch out. History seems like a nice possibility. You find that Neville has an ancestor who was involved in pretty much any notable event, and that Weasley bloke isn't half bad at acting. You start turning history books into impromptu plays. It turns things from boring to kind of fun. Even Granger stops reading to watch, sometimes. You even got her to laugh.

Her roommates tell you she cries at night sometimes. You can tell she misses the Muggle world a lot. And her parents, but you can't exactly ship them up to Hogwarts, even if they live in Northumberland. So you get the acting crew together in secret and train for /hours/ (or at least /minutes/, but that's something, right?) and turns out Romilda Vane plays the oboe, and before you can say Quidditch you've got a band together to play [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4OS17lqHiE][a song she might appreciate]]. It doesn't quite work; she's swearing a lot more than you expect a kid her age to know how to; but next day she seems a fair bit more content. She's also humming that blasted song. Maybe it was a mistake. Then she looks at you and smiles, and you know that you made the right choice.

Over the summer, she mails you a book on linear algebra. Maths weren't really your thing, before, but you know that, if you apply yourself and get a little help from your friends, you can learn anything.

(By the end of summer, you realize that trigonometry is literally the worst math ever invented and everything after it is actually comprehensible. You feel vaguely cheated.)

**** Couldn't a lot of early video games be adapted to something like McG's animated chess set from PS?

I mean, think about the third floor corridor. Now assume that the architect is aiming for /fun/ not /death./ Tell me a wizarding obstacle course wouldn't be amazing. It'd be like a real life puzzle/platformmer.

If chess can benefit from animated pieces that yell advice and move themselves... imagine what the wizarding world would make of something like Warhammer.

**** The One True Ship.

I actually anti-ship Harry/Hermione most of the time. Harry becomes dictator of Magical Britain and Hermione has to take him down. Harry and Hermione grow up together and would never, ever think of each other that way. Hermione went back in time, but not with Harry, and the effective age gap is insurmountable. I have one on the back burner where Hermione becomes a Jedi before coming to Hogwarts, and that's not exactly conducive to dating, but she needs to work with Harry. (It's not that I like Harry, really. It's just, well, he's there and not objectionable.)

As for shipping in that drabblet...the participants are eleven years old. Yuck.

**** Linear algebra is not that hard (should be strudying it right now t.t) , a kid would understand it easyer than me. The problem aren't the concepits but the average attention span of a 12 y/o. When you get to affine geometry it's even fun.

***** I don't want to get bogged down in a debate --- the story makes sense, otherwise, and it was a small nitpick, in that the topic probably needed to be adjusted down, but, to elaborate, the notion that "a kid" --- again, learning in a few months, from a book alone, without being a prodigy or a savant --- would understand it more easily is debatable in the first place.

And, to be even remotely plausible, said kid would have had to master /and integrate/ myriad other concepts in the first place, starting with basic algebra in one and two variables, operations on fractions, powers, factoring, negative numbers, coordinate geometry, and all the other things that are so basic by the time you start on linear algebra that you don't even think about them.

Now, assuming that Harry was following England's maths curriculum before coming to Hogwarts, and assuming that it hasn't changed much since, he hasn't actually been taught to "solve for x" at least as far as I can tell from the UK government's site.

P.S. In case you're wondering, yes, fanfic characters in general and special-snowflake!Harry in particular insta-learning stuff that takes other people months or years are a pet peeve --- unless the author actually makes "/X/ is a genius" a part of his or her premise. Hermione, at least, has the latter excuse, to some extent.

**** Linear algebra was much easier for me to wrap my head around than trigonometry, and I was doing trigonometry around that age. But getting it from a textbook is rather unrealistic, even if learning difficult material solely from books is a standard trope in Harry Potter fandom.

If you don't mind my asking, at what age did you study which area? Most curricula teach linear algebra long after trigonometry, which could explain why it seems easier.

Ultimately, it's not so much about what's easier in a vacuum, but rather how Harry could have the prerequisites for linear algebra; prerequisites which he would have almost certainly not covered in a British primary school before going to Hogwarts, and which he probably did not study during his time at Hogwarts, what with all the learning magic and adventures and the band and all.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

For fandom, perhaps, but in canon, only for Hermione. Harry generally gets taught or tutored when he learns something. I could be forgetting an earlier instance, but I think that the first time he learns magic from a book is HBP.

True that. But this is not about motivation. This is about having the background to study the subject on one's own.

** It's not Harry who has this reaction to learning magic, but rather Xander in Tenhawk's [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Company]]. The story's a sprawling multi-cross (350k+ words, HP/Addam's Family/Buffy) but for the most part remains in the HP world, just with Xander and Wednesday added to the Hogwarts mix + events. If you don't mind a central character (Xander) who is a Gary Stu and slow updates (it went years between the penultimate and last update, which was a few weeks ago), it's a fair guilty pleasure fic.
