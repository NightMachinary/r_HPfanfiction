I've stumbled upon these marriage contracts and tonks is always left out.

Is that cause she's so rebellious? Would like to read one where she wants to bang Harry or Lupin right up until she's ordered to do it and then it's the last thing she wants.


** Ironically, an AFF story might be the best one of this sort of variety. Daye's /[[http://hp.adult-fanfiction.org/story.php?no=600025317][Desperate Times, Desperate Measures]]/ | linkaff(600025317)

The premise is that after Sirius's death, the Malfoys attempt to make claim to what's given out in Sirius's will---including 12 Grimmauld Place, the HQ for the Order of the Phoenix. To prevent this, Dumbledore proposes tying Harry more directly to Sirius's bloodline while also presenting him as the rightful benefactor of the will... by proposing that he marry Tonks.

The two of them have a shotgun wedding in preparation for the proceedings and neither of them want or are happy with this arrangement, but are willing to do so for the sake of the Order. In a nice subversion of this kind of story, Harry does not turn out to be a proverbial sex god when the marriage has to be consummated for the oaths to be binding. Here's a gem in the second chapter:

#+begin_quote
  “I said. Don't. Worry.” Tonks repeated, “It's not like I was expecting you to be some great lay, kid.”
#+end_quote

Harry's relative immaturity in the relationship rears its head several times and both Harry and Tonks fumble and mangle the relationship between occasional happy moments and lots and lots of misunderstandings. For all that, their relationship being portrayed as a struggle is a nice subversion of all the various lovey-dovey Harry / Tonks stories out there and the fact that the difference in age is a significant factor in the story is also great.

All in all, an interesting read, and ironically, perhaps the most realistic Hogwarts-era Harry / Tonks pairing. In general, I can't see Harry / Tonks working out while Harry's still in his early teens and his story seems to be a good argument for just exactly why. Sadly abandoned after ten chapters, but there's a decent stock of material to more or less satisfy your request.

** Tonks is the child of a muggleborn and a pureblood witch who gave up everything for love (including whatever marriage her parents intended for her). The only parents who are less likely to sign a wizarding marriage contract disregarding the express wishes of their offspring are the muggleborn grangers imho.

*** IIRC, there are a few fics where the contract is old, says something along the lines of "a girl from the Black family", and Tonks is just the only remaining candidate (aside from her mother and aunts, obviously*, but all three of them are already married to other people).\\
I agree about the rest, however.

*) note that most, if not all, of those fics would had been written prior to a certain unpopular recent statement that incidentally provided another possible candidate

***** The "statement" is the silly-bad-fanfictiony Cursed Child play, whose ridiculous plot (if I remember correctly) happened to involve [[/spoiler][Bellatrix having a daughter]] (note: slight Cursed Child spoiler).

****** I had known about her already, but I thought that she is non-canon because she is from a different reality?

But thanks.

******* The canonity of things in Cursed Child is ... a mess. As such, it's probably the least headache if you just make it into a Schroedinger's cat.

  At the reading of Sirius Black's will several shocking revelations leave Harry Potter and Nymphadora Tonks reeling. How will things change for them? And what about that crazy, drunken contract between James Potter and Sirius? What will this mean for Harry and Tonks? AU after Order of the Phoenix. Not part of the Professor Muggle series.
