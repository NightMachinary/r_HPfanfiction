*** I really liked the setup, but then unfortunately it kind of never develops any serious plotline (with Voldemort gone, and everybody happily alive, there is not much drama left), so it steps down to the Dumbledore-bashing, the cheapest excuse of all those who don't have any plotline.

**** I personally would love more fics like this, meaning with Voldemort dead. Most fics are all about fighting or politics instead of kids growing up with magic, which is honestly a shame given the opportunity this world gives us.

I know one fic that does this property, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12085137][Seven Normal years of Harry the Hufflepuff]].

**** Does it mostly stick to Dumbledore bashing? I kinda like that but I dropped the Robst I tried to read when he turned Ron into a rapist.

Like I'm ok with Ron bashing like "lol he likes to eat and hates to study" but turning him evil is just uncomfortable

***** Ron and Draco are sent to Hufflepuff and they both are rather disgusting persona, but nothing worse than that. I think Draco is slightly worse.

**** Agreed. Most of RobSt's fics are like that.

***** BTW, I really liked Voldermort not reading fine print. That was glorious. If the story finished right there, without any continuation, it would be rather good.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
