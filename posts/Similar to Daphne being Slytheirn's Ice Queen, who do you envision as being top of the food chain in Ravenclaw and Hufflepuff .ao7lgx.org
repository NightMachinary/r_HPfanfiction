** *RAVENCLAW:* Probably Penelope Clearwater or Cho Chang. Leaning towards Cho Chang due to her apparent popularity as of /GoF/

*HUFFLEPUFF:* For the first four years? Definitely Cedric Diggory. After him? No idea, given how criminally under-developed Hufflepuff House is in the series IMO(Ravenclaw actually has the same problem IMO

** Cho for Ravenclaw probably quidditch star and seemed to be very pouplar always with a large group of girls and for Hufflepuff it was Cedric for similar reasons probably, quidditch star and very popular well liked so on... they were a real power couple...not sure who would have filled cedrics shoes later.

** Always imagined Cho as a bit of a "queen bitch" in her clique of popular girls. And yes, I'm aware this has no basis in canon, and she's often depicted unfairly in fanfics.

*** This reading of Cho has always thoroughly annoyed me. Apparently having friends warrants you being labelled a queen bitch. It's like everyone forgets that after Cedric died she had all of one friend left, and that neither before or after is she ever shown being nasty.

*** Im sure lack of rereading and more bad fics lend me to remember that Cho was Mariettas friend who came together to the DA meetings. There are plenty of ways to make Cho "queen bitch" in that case.

**** Iirc they were, and part of the reason that Marietta sold out the DA to Umbridge was because of (perceived) threats to her mother's job at the Ministry; unless I'm misremembering the books too.

** I can imagine someone else ahead of Cho Chang. I felt like Cho thought about what others think too much to envision her as the head of the pack. I think she belongs in that clique though or wants to belong in that sort of clique. I also imagine a power couple of sorts haha as the top of the food chain for Ravenclaw.

For Hufflepuff its even harder for me to imagine since after Cedric, they never had one person that stood out which sucks haha cause I felt like Cedric was only written to stand out as best Hogwarts just to make Harry feel like more of the outsider in Goblet of Fire. I do feel though that this time its probably one of his friends, I assume that took on his role of being that older guy/girl everyone looks up to. Sorry I couldnt provide names! D:
