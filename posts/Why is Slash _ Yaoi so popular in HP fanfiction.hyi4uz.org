Alright, I understand that this is probably going to be taken down, but I am curious as to why Slash / Yaoi seems to be so prominent in the HP fandom.

I am not judging if you do like it, but for me, it's just not my thing.

If you can give your insight into why this might be the case, please let me know. I only put this question up because I've been searching through HP fanfics and I have found dozens more Slash fics than non-Slash fics.

*** I'll admit that, being a lesbian, slash put me off for ages. It took me a long time to realise that I don't dislike reading it, I just dislike the examples that fetishize it. I'm reading one fic that was written by two lesbians, and it was the best portrayals of an M/M relationship that I've seen in fic

** I am a middle-aged, straight female. I like cocks. Slash stories have more scenes of lovingly-described cocks.

Not to say that slash is all I read, but in this fandom that's where the best action is found, so to speak. To start with, I prefer Harry Potter stories with Harry in them. In my opinion, neither Hermione nor Ginny (the most common pairings), as defined by canon, are good matches for Harry. Hermione is the bossy older sister, not a love interest, and Ginny ... I really dislike Harry/Ginny as a couple because book Ginny is a poorly-defined "girl-next-door" character who only ever saw the hero, not the person, and movie Ginny was even worse. (And am I the only person to know that a hinny is a mule, except the horse is the father rather than the mother?) Why JKR is determined that Harry can only end up with one or the other of them, I don't know.

** I actually googled this recently. Quora had a number of good responses; basically, most of them said it was women writing slash fics. That they liked that men acted as equals with each other, rather than male/female power dynamics.

If I weren't on my phone I would track down the link for you!

** Slash is big in all fanfiction. It's easy to find a ton of professionally published stories (literature, film, TV, comics...) with straight romances, fitting any sort of paradigm you want (genre, type of story, tone, setting, etc). If you want stories with gay romances, there are pretty limited options there, or else they're very much sidelined compared to the straight romance in the same work. So there's a much greater impetus for people to write their own.

** Im a man and I read through a couple of Romance genre novels.

Something I noticed was that the female protag despite how competent they are always manage to get themselves stuck in situations where they need saving from a man. Like a knight in shining armor thing.

*** That depends I think on whether or not they get to save the male lead as well.

** This is explained pretty well in a fairly popular tumblr post/thread. Of course I can't find it right now, so I'll paraphrase/summarise it here.

The reason why Slash is so popular in HP (and in fanfiction in general), is simply the fact that the majority of fiction often has more male primary and secondary characters than female characters.

I mean just look at the character roster of nearly any TV show of Film and you're likely to see that most of the better written characters are men.

Even if you ignore the demographics, it's simple mathematics. If you have, say, 5 male characters and 2 female characters, the total possible ships that can come from that (ignoring any form of self-cest and poly ships) will by default be weighted towards more slash pairings than het ones.

** I personally like fan fiction for exploring avenues the original canon doesn't. HP like many other source materials doesn't have canon gay characters in important roles (JK's retconning aside). I'll read everything, gen, M/M, F/F, etc. but I'm most interested in what canon doesn't show.

Another big factor are the genders of the main characters in canon, take the original Avengers, 5 men and 1 woman, if you're interested in relationships between characters M/M just makes numerical sense.

*** Slash being popular in fanfiction is not specific to just the HP fandom, this is a wider phenomenon. Look at fandoms like Star trek, Supernatural, Teen wolf, the Marvel movies, Sherlock etc. Can you find the link?

***** Yes, most m/m slash writers and readers are straight or bisexual women. I don't find this surprising, just like straight men like lesbian porn, straight women like gay porn.
