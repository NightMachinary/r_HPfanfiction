As endless fics seem to attest, the Room of Requirement is pretty omnipotent, even if its use is generally confined to classrooms/and or customisable nookie chambers. My question is - have there been many fics which have used the Room as a mechanism to send its inhabitants somewhere very different? The closest I think I've seen is esama's DSS Requirement ( linkao3(D.S.S. Requirement) ) - which has the interior of the room link to a spaceship - but have there been fictions that use the Room to send people even further afield?

I have to admit, the question is partially prompted because I was so tickled by the idea that I've started to write my own version ( linkffn(12727179) ), in which the Room throws the DA 1800 years into the past to try and get them away from Umbridge (basically, I wanted to write Harry Potter and the Later Roman Empire) - but I'd be very interested to see any other examples in a similar vein that people know about!

  Faced with Umbridge's impending incursion, the Room of Requirement does its upmost to meet the fervent wishes of the DA and ensure that she won't find them - so, very suddenly, Harry and his friends find themselves a very long way from home indeed, with no idea how to get back. This might be a problem... (Group time-travel, with a minimum of bashing.)

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.

** I think there is a fic that use the room like the hyperbolic time chamber from dragon ball . And one that lets the user call up a copy of any wizard that has ever been in hogwarts to teach them

And my personal theory that the room of requirement literally helped Harry teach and that is why a bunch of student all managed to learn the Patronus charm when it is a beyond N.E.W.T level spell that the majority of adult wizard can't do.
