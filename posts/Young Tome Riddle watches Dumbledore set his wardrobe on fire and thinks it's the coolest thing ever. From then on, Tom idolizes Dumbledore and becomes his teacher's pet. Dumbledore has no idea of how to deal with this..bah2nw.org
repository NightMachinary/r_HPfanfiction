The original idea was posted by [[/u/naidhe][u/naidhe]] in [[https://ds.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ba2w2f/what_is_a_plot_idea_you_have_you_know_you_will/][this thread]], but I thought it deserved some more attention.

Basically Tom is still an evil little monster, but he adores Dumbledore and wants to be just like him. But he goes about it all wrong. Dumbledore has no clue of what to do about it. It would probably be a rather crack-ish fic.

Here's a little idea with this that I came up with:

--------------

Dumbledore smiled softly to himself as he watched the second-year Ravenclaw and Slytherin students file into his Transfiguration classroom. Teaching such eager, young minds was always a joy.

"Would you like a lemon drop?"

He turned toward the door to see who had decided to be kind enough to share sweets with their fellow students.

But then he did a double take, his eyes almost popping out of his head.

There was young Tom Riddle in the doorway - dressed in rather splendid (in Dumbledore's mind) purple robes decorated with orange stars and yellow crescent moons.

"Lemon drop?" Tom asked again, extending a bag of sweets to young Myrtle Warren.

The girl grimaced and looked at Tom with suspicion.

"What did you do to them this time?"

"Nothing! Slytherin's honor!"

"Hmpf!" Myrtle exclaimed before striding off to her seat.

Tom turned and his eye's met Dumbledore's, and huge grin broke out on the boy's face.

"Professor Dumbledore! Care for a lemon drop?"

"I... err..." Ablus stammered.

"I sent away for them by special owl order!"

"Mr. Riddle," Dumbledore began once his brain started working again, "what have you done to your uniform?"

"Well," the young Slytherin started, "after you taught us those excellent color-changing spells last week, I figured that I would make my robes into something more stylish."

"I see."

"That reminds me..."

"Yes?"

"How do I learn to make my eyes twinkle on demand? I think that might be a good way for me to sow confusion amongst my enemies..."

Dumbledore sighed internally.

"Please take your seat, Mr. Riddle."

** A few years later...

Tom sat upon his new throne, his eyes cast out among the witches and wizards who had just sworn themselves to his cause, who had branded themselves with his mark, who would now, from this day forward, live or die to further his will.

He smiled, this was truly a great day for Britain -- history would look back and count /this/ as the dawn of a new era...

“Ummm...”

Tom glanced over to Bellatrix Black, who was fidgeting off to the side.

“What is it, Bella?” he asked.

“It's just, well...”

“Spit it out!”

“Are you sure about these uniforms?”

“Yeah,” Rudolfus added, “wouldn't something like, I don't know, black robes with skull masks be scarier?”

“There's nothing wrong with pink and green!” Tom answered. “Some would say it's quite fashionable.”

“Only an idiot like Dumbledore would think that,” Lucius mumbled.

“What was that?!”

“Nothing!”

“And my lord...”

“What now, Bella?”

“The fake beards... are they really necessary?”

“I've already told you, once you've grown a beard long enough to be tucked into your belt, you can dispense with the false one!”

“But it's just going to get in the way of spell casting!” Lucius whined.

Tom narrowed his eyes in a glare.

“/Crucio!/”

“Gah!” Lucius flopped to the ground.

“Do not deign to question me!” Tom declared, rising from his seat. “I am Lord Alvus Preston Wolfgang Thomas Voldemort!”

Tom Riddle, of all people walks in and sits down.

''Lemon drop?'' They both asked momentarily

''Yes, thank you'' They also asked momentarily

''So, headmaster, i would like to ask you, how do you make your eyes twinkle like that?'' Asked Tom

*twinkle twinkle* ''That, my boy is a long and complicated process''

*5 hours, screaming, blinking, twinkling, and lemon drop eating later*

''Tom? Tooom?, are your eyes /twinkling/?'' The unnamed minion said after staring and blinking dumbly at Tom.

** "Mr. Riddle, would you please explain exactly /why/ there's a seventy-foot long basilisk, wearing darkened aviator goggles, residing in an unused classroom on the third floor?"

"Well, after Miss Warren accidentally died to it, I had to conjure the aviator goggles and black them out to prevent any further deaths."

"NOT what I was really asking, Tom, and I think you know that."

"Well, the basilisk is really only the first trial."

"First..." Dumbledore's face somehow turned even /more/ baffled.

"Yeah. I snuck into the offices for the Ministry's Department of Education and stole copies of this year's upcoming OWL and NEWT exams for every subject. I then let the rumor get around about there being a treasure beyond value, and it being hidden behind a source of certain death."

"You wha...?"

"So then I set up a series of trials that any really competent and/or inhumanly lucky student could get through. After all, to get past the snake you just have hiss at it in a mimickry of Parseltongue and you can stroll right by.

"Then there's the Brazilian Paralyzing Sporepod Tentacles that will kill you in twenty seconds, but that's not really much of a trial since you can easily subdue it with fiendfyre. After that a relatively simple flying challenge that only requires successfully executing 23 consecutive Wronski feints, followed by..."

Here Dumbledore interrupted, "...fiendfyre...?"

"Yes, sir, please do keep up, we're already past that. After the demonstration of flying skill, you can move into the next room where you have to play a flawless game of Go on a 29 x 29 grid. Of course the standard is 19 x 19, but that seemed a little too elementary for magicals. And to give it some zest, you lose a limb for every point you lose the game by. After that is the room with the dragon which I... er... liberated from Gringott's, followed by a simple logic puzzle involving the Traveling Salesman Problem, all wrapping up with a room containing a boggart, Dementor, lethifold, niffler, nundu, and a dozen red caps. It's simple, really, you just have to get the niffler to give up the little golden orb containing the stolen exams without letting the nundu eat the red caps, or else..."

"MISTER RIDDLE! WHY ON EARTH HAVE YOU DONE THIS?!"

Tom looked down, eyes beginning to tear. In a tiny voice he muttered, "because it seemed like something you would do..."

"My brother's not what you believe, boy," he tells him. "A selfish man, always thinking 'bout himself," he grunts.

Tom dutifully writes, 'be selfish, alway think about yourself'

"Went 'round with that other boy, planning stuff. Wouldn't tell me what!"

Tom notes down, 'trust few people, keep secrets.'

"Wouldn't help with family matters, left Ariana to me."

Tom nods sagely. 'Not even family should distract you from your goals'.

** (Posted first in the original thread) Dumbledore doesn't know how to deal with the psycho kid who's taken a liking to him.

"Can someone give me a non-ovbious example of an exception to Gamp's law of elemental trasnfiguration?"

Tom raises his hand high, eager to answer, Hermione Granger style. Dumbledore sighs.

"Yes, Mr Riddle?"

"A dead body, sir." At Dumbledore's confusion, he adds, "It is /technically/ food."

Class is dead silent. Dumbledore wonders where he went wrong in life. Is this karma? Is it because he almost joined Gellert in his dream of world domination?

Worst part, he has to award five points to Slytherin, because the kid's /technically/ correct.

** Dumbledore looked up from grading the abominable stack of third-year essays (Merlin bless the Hufflepuffs -- they tried... they really did...). Who would be knocking on his door at this hour---oh.

He sighed and waved his wand, opening the door.

“Come in, Mr. Riddle.”

“Professor Dumbledore, sir!” the handsome, sixth-year Slytherin said as he entered the room. “Thanks for seeing me.”

“You know I'm always available to my students,” he said. Even if they do insist on visiting three times every day! he mentally continued.

Dumbledore eyed the uneven patch of fuzz on the boy's chin. He was obviously trying to grow a beard, but like most teenagers who did so, he merely managed to look ridiculous in the attempt.

Tom glanced at the wooden stool in front of the Transfiguration professor's desk before waving his wand and transforming it into a comfortable-looking, stuffed, arm chair. Exactly like the one Albus was currently sitting in.

“Who taught you that spell?” he asked.

“Oh, you know. I just found it somewhere...”

Dumbledore narrowed his eyes. He'd invented the Comfy Chair Conjuration himself, and he'd never shared it with anyone. How had Tom managed to discern that secret...?

“Anyways,” the boy began, “I wanted to speak to you about something delicate.”

“Oh?” Albus asked as his bushy eyebrows merged with his graying hair.

“Yes, you see, I've been doing a bit of research you see, and I came across a term that I'm not very familiar with. Sir, do you know, what, exactly, a ‘horcrux' is?”

“Mr. Riddle,” Dumbledore said with more than a little steel in his voice, “where did you come across that word?”

“Just in some reading. No need to worry, I won't go blabbing about it to the rest of the students, nor even to any of the other professors. But I thought you might understand...”

Dumbledore closed his eyes and tried to stave off the headache he could feel coming on.

“Mr. Riddle,” he began after a moment, “horcuxes are one of the foulest, darkest works of sorcery to have ever been invented. Of all they ways in which wizards have tried to achieve immortality, they are by far the worst.”

“Hmmm...”

“Do you understand what I'm trying to tell you, Mr. Riddle?”

“I think so...”

“Good.”

Maybe the boy was /finally/ learning a bit of sense.

“In that case, professor, tell me about these /other/ ways of achieving immortality.”

Dumbledore closed his eyes and let his head fall to the desk in front of him with a dull thud.

Why couldn't the Riddle boy bother Horace with these infernal questions?

  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From then on, Tom idolizes Dumbledore and becomes his teacher's pet. Dumbledore has no idea of how to deal with this. A Crack!fic-esque series of short, comedic scenes.

  Young Tom Riddle watches Dumbledore set his wardrobe on fire and thinks it's the coolest thing ever. From that point on, Tom only wishes to become a man as great as his Professor. Dumbledore really, really doesn't know how to deal with the little psycho kid following him around.
