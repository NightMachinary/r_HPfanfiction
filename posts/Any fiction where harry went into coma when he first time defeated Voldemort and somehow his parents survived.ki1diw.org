Like I said any where harry just went into magical coma after getting hit by voldemort and miraculously his parents survived and take care of him later he woke up from his coma tho. For example ''/An Amnesiac Hero/ by Tony Samuels''. On the other note , if anyone saved /An Amnesiac Hero/ , can you pls share since author removed the story.
