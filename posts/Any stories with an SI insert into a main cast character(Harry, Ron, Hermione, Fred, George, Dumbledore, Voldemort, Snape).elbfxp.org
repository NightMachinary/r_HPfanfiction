I'd also prefer that it's decent length, say 40k+. I don't mind if it's incomplete, or complete. As long as there is a good amount to "chew on" i'm fine.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Evil overlord list has an SI esque voice inside Tom's head that stops him from making the stupid lapses in judgement he made in canon. He's more of an SI OC. .linkffn(10972919)

*** [[https://fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/][I Am Lord Voldemort?]] follows a similar premise, except the SI OC replaces Voldemort entirely. The translator mentioned that it's based on The Evil Overlord List. It's complete in Russian, but the translation to English is still underway. ffnbot!directlinks

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
