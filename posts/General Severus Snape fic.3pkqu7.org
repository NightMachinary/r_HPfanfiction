I'm hunting for fics where Snape is a major player, if not the main character. But I'm not a big fan of his personality being white washed into a bland sad hero. He was heroic but I love him because he's a mix of cruel and kind. Because he embraced his inner demons almost as often as he fought them. Any recommendations?


** linkao3(670548)

It's a little slashy, in some places and at the end, but it's just so good. And the slash is really very minimal. Truly a wonderful piece of work.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's always been known as The Boy Who Lived. Only Severus knows that this is a lie. (Or: a portrait of Severus Snape, in seven acts.)

  #+begin_example
      A/N: Originally written for the Severus/Harry Big Bang 2012 over at severusharrybb\.  To see the illustrations by , go to the original posting of the story\! Warnings \(highlight to view\):
  #+end_example

  Repeated major character death (don't worry, it doesn't stick!), bucketloads of dark humour, chan (one kiss at 15, sexual awareness from Snape's part ~age 15/16 onwards, but no actual underage sex), angst with the odd touch of horror, brief attempted non-con (not in Snarry pairing), suicidal ideation and attempt, moral greyness and flawed characters, wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey. Oh, and a decidedly happy ending. ;) This started out as a crack-fic idea. Then I started writing it, and it decided it wanted to be much more than crackfic---and much, much longer as well! The thank you list for this one is equally massive: first, to everyone at the severusharrybb community---thank you for the cheering, the pep-talks and the glimpses at all your WIPs; you kept me going when frustration with JKR's plotholes and fear of deadlines made it tough to keep going. To the mods for putting such hard work into organising this big bang, with extra special thanks to accioslash for much needed honesty when I was angsting over the ending of this which prompted the brainwave I needed. To my britpicker rycolfan for her reassurance, badgerlady for whipping my typos and M-dashes into shape, and abrae for a fantastic and thorough beta (the semicolon is dead; long live the semicolon!) and her immeasurably kind words. â™¥ And last, but not least, to my artist---I hope you've had as much of a blast illustrating this as I have had writing it!A/N 2: Any scenes/dialogue quoted and adapted from the books are JKR's property and used purely for transformative purposes; I lay no claim to them and make no money off them whatsoever.

** I have a few.

linkao3(Kestrel by lomonaaeren) Snape/Harry, 15 to 20 years after the war. Wingfic, sour angry brilliant Snape who makes prosthetic limbs as a profession. Harry's son James needs one, and Harry will do anything to persuade Snape to help him. Not very explicit.

linkao3(Black Story by jay tryfanstone) Snape/Harry. Postwar, pre-DH. A disillusioned and powerful Harry has made the wizarding world forget about the war. He works at Hogwarts as a squib. A horribly damaged and dying Snape shows up on his doorstep, and Harry saves him because simply letting him die would be too easy and he wants a more personal revenge. Contains disturbing material, violent imagery, child rape performed as a Death Eater activity. Harsh but ultimately hopeful.

linkao3(Father to the Man by delphi) Snape/Filch. A still-grieving early-twenties Snape tries to summon Lily to him using a restricted spell, and ends up pulling his five-year-old self into the present. Filch catches him at it. Snape spends the summer taking out his self-hatred on his past self, letting Filch seduce him, and poring over books to figure out how to send the boy back. Funny, poignant, with a gruffly likable Filch and an excellent double portrait of Snape as child and as a sympathetic asshole young professor.

linkao3(Snape of St. Brutal's by delphi) Snape/Filch, underage. A fascinating, eerie, non-magical AU that portrays Snape as a brilliant, slightly insane, potential serial killer, sent at age eleven to a reform school after he tries to poison his father. The bleakness of his home life, the detached analytical intellect of a very damaged child, and the fact that there's something obviously wrong with him are all woven together in a way that's compassionate one moment and disturbing the next. Snape thinks his attitude is a reasonable method of fooling his jailers and getting ahead in the world, but underneath it all is this scary, unpredictable capacity for hurting others. A unique fic, still a WiP.

linkao3(St. Mungo's Grim Reaper by emptyword) Snape gen. Written for the Bring Back the Bastard fest. Young Death Eater Snape working on assignment at St. Mungo's, competent, ruthless, horrible, but not entirely without mercy.

linkao3(Mutability by kelly_chambliss) Snape/McGonagall. A character study of Snape slowly spiraling into a sense of claustrophobic fatalism after Voldemort's return. Caught between Dumbledore and the Dark Lord, he seduces McGonagall on Voldemort's orders. Beautifully written, insightful, and rather sad.

linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi) Snape gen. Long, well-written, fascinating take on Severus' descent into and emergence from his Death Eater years. A fic that deserves far more attention than it has received.

linkffn(A Place for Warriors by owlsaway) Gen. Dumbledore locks Snape and Harry in the Room of Requirement to work out their differences. Loads of talk, but it still manages to be utterly absorbing. Feels a bit unfinished at the end, though.

linkao3(Playing for Keeps by vissy) Severus/Eileen Prince. Warnings for incest, obviously. Fantastic character study told from Eileen's POV. A detailed, spot-on imagining of life at Spinner's End, where a well-meaning mistake repeats history and leads to a stomach-twisting betrayal. A distressing and memorable backstory to Snape's anger that makes a horrible kind of sense.

Sorry if these lean toward angst, but they're some of the most interesting fics I could come up with.

ETA: the ficbot is having trouble with the St. Brutal's series, so here's a link to the first installment:

**** this is one I've enjoyed. [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=3393&chapter=1][The Red Right Hand.]] I like this post war Snape--cynical and conniving, though not as hopelessly dark as he's presented in some stories. The Harry displayed in this story is a little too happy-go-lucky for my preference, but the overall story is fun little redemption tale.
