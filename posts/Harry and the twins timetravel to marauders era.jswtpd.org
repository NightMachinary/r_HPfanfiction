Im looking for a timetravel fic where harry and the twins end up in the marauders era , they can be kids or grown ups, but I would love to see the three of them on that kind of adventure! Has anyone written anything like that?

**** It won't be anytime soon, since I'm still eyeball-deep in my current fic. But I love the Marauders (except for the part where they all die), and a Fred & George time-travel adventure would be a novel way to keep them alive.
