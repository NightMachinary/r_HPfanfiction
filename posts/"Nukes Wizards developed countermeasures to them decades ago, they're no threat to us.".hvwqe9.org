"For instance, if the Chinese muggle government used their nuclear weapons on the native wizard population, they would find their missile Transfigured into a very confused chicken just before it hit the ground."


** If you can cast a spell whose target is as abstract as wizards of certain age (Trace), or the knowledge of a location (Fidelius), or a specific occupation (DADA teacher), or a specific name being uttered anywhere in the country (Taboo spell), I certainly see no problem in a countrywide spell that transfigures missile-shaped object (or maybe just the concept of a nuke itself) when they enter England's airspace.

Grindelwald already told wizards about the dangers of nukes in 1927 (according to the crimes of Grindelwald movie), so they had a lot of time to come up with countermeasures.

As powerful as Voldemort may be I am petty sure that an entire Department allowed to use government resources and operate without the need to hide their actions, given ample warning before the danger was even invented and then even more time after having seen the weapon and it's effects in real life and with the resources and personal to not only get their hands on the public knowledge about nuclear weapons, but also all the secret bits they can just take from the minds of those in the know, not to mention also having support from similar departments in other countries would be capable of not only finding out how he put the curse on the position as possible also how to do a better version capable of stopping anything within the concept of “mass destruction weapon” from functioning inside the country.

How? The physical background was only discovered in the late 30s, and I doubt that Grindelwald was a cutting edge theoretical physicist. The idea first appeared in a Wells novel from 1914, but at that point it was as sci-fi as a death star is to us today. Winston Churchil wrote a paper about wonderweapons in 1924, which gives you an accurate understanding of how much was understood about nuclear weapons in the 20s:

**** By "dangers of nukes", I think OP means just that it's a bomb much more powerful than anything muggles have built before. Which is all wizards need to know really, a nuke will be devastating if the wizards are caught by surprise, but a bomber carrying one can be intercepted by one wizard on a broom, just imperious the pilots and have them ditch the plane in the ocean, are transfigure the bomb into something else, and then chuck it in the ocean. No need to know exactly how it works.

Obviously this gets a bit more difficult once people start fitting them to ICBMs, but someone can probably think up a method.

#+end_quote

No, it cannot. A WWII (earlier is irrelevant for nukes) bomber will fly at ~250 mph, give or take a dozen or two. A 1980s bomber (Tu-160) can reach 1380 mph and cruise at 600 mph at an altitude of up to 52000 feet.

The only speed for a broom we ever get is the Firebolt produced from 1993 onwards, which can reach 150 mph (possibly more, we know it reaches that speed in ten seconds, but trying to hold on at higher speeds will be infeasible, the air resistance will pull you off it.

And we know that the Firebolt flies circles around everything else available at that time. So there is not a single broom in existence which could match a prop-driven bomber, nevermind a supersonic one before the Firebolt. And that's not even mentioning that you would need some kind of guidance to get the broom guy to the plane, and wizards do not seem to have something equivalent to a radio, nevermind on-broom magical radar sets. Read about night fighter tactics of WWII to see just how difficult it is to get someone into a position where they have a bomber in their sights, and now try doing that without ground control (since you cannot get the information to the guy on the broom), searchlights, airborne radar and so on, nevermind that the only way you have any chance would be a head-on pass at a closing rate of between 300 and 1500 mph where frankly the wizard would probably just hit the plane and splatter on its nose rather than hit the imperius on the pilot, co-pilot, engineer and whoever else might be aboard.

But my point still stands that wizards have magic, assuming you can get them near the bomb or its handlers, either on the ground or in the sky, how much they understand of nuclear physics is irrelevant when it can be transfigured into a chicken, which you can easily transport somewhere safe, eg the ocean, and drop it in, where it doesn't matter if the transfiguration wears off.

As far RADAR and everything else you mentioned, yes, no equivalents exist in canon, but the Harry Potter world doesn't have the deepest lore when compared to some stories, and "magical RADAR" would hardly be the most egregious thing the fandom has invented.

I guess you could use one way radios for ground control, but it would not be as efficient as two way radios (which would have been useful at many points of the series but don't seem to exist), especially since an inbound Soviet air raid would involve a whole squadron and not just one plane, so you need to coordinate. And the Tu-160 can carry a dozen nuclear cruise missiles with a range of 2500 km, which means that they could launch their missiles off the shore of Norway. Or they load two dozen shorter ranged missiles each, with a range of only 300 km but capable of Mach 5.

Wizards are capable of stopping the launch order via imperius, but once the planes take off or missiles are launched, there's no stopping them.

You're also not accounting for the fact that the Firebolt is the first /Civilian/ broom of its kind. Military Tech will always be more advanced (especially in the MACUSA or allied forces during WW2) than whatever standard wizards have access to.

****** Yes and it's not that hard once you know how the pistol acts. Shouldn't magicals have enough practice with their wands to know how they act?

Plus the trick with firearms is to know/understand how gravity, wind, and distance impacts the round you fired. Magicals shouldn't have that problem as spells seem to be "light" and things like gravity and wind should have no impact on them (IMO distance does).

So if spells don't have an effective distance why ever would you risk your people. Just send 6 to 12 or so about a 100 yards from Hogsmeade with half of them at 90° (so the town is caught in a crossfire) and then just have them send multiple blasting curses and AK's. You're far enough away that unless you land on top of someone no one will hear the portkey/apparation so the first anyone knows about the attack is when the first volley of curses hit. Just rapid fire your curses and you have plenty chaos. One dark mark in the sky and everyone knows who is responsible for the attack.

******* Presumably because jkr doesn't want the horrors of an actual war being in her kids book.

However, in-universe it's a pretty good question so I'll try to answer. First, the pistol comparison was not a perfect example, merely one that a good chunk of people could understand. When firing a pistol your best bet for getting a hit is to do the same thing you did the last time you hit your target. This is not really true for wand users, where the movement of the wand is a core component of making a spell, and different for every spell used.

Harry tends to use only one spell, and because of that he got pretty good at hitting his targets - every new spell requires buttloads of practice to make it accurate at any reasonable distance.

Second is ideology. Voldemort based his platform on purging the unworthy, not on purging everyone. Massed fire from a distance does not allow for any sort of discretion, and would put off any of his followers who aren't in it for the fun of murdering people. This doesn't preclude wizards doing this to specific homes though, and I'm fairly certain that is how a bunch of the raids went down.

Third is the spell itself. We are told very little about how spells work when travelling, but are shown Snape blasting Lockhart off the stage with an 'overpowered' stunner. This means that not only is a single spell able to change power and speed, but also the way it works. If you have enough of the right intent behind a spell, it can physically change the results of the spell and how the spell moves. This precludes a user from being accurate without a lot of practice. Not only does being in a stressful situation make aiming harder, it actively changes the results of your spell.

Frankly, accuracy for anyone who is not a trained combatant is probably pretty good for two or three very practiced spells, and basically the same or slightly better, before an afternoon of practice, as the people who are shooting a pistol for the first time.

***** Petty sure it is Fanon. The whole distant enough to be heard thing could be explained by the same reason that shooters need especial equipment when they are shooting something far away, the farther the target the harder it is to properly aim the the gun and the easier it is to accidentally move a little your arm resulting on the bullet taking a wildly different path.

****** Which is why combat troops are trained with rifles where it isn't that difficult to be accurate out to 300 yards. Past that and you need better/specialized equipment for accuracy. There's a hunting philosophy when it comes to accuracy known as point blank range. That's the distance that if you aim your gun at the center of the vital area you will still hit vitals. For deer and humans that vital area is roughly the same size as a 9 inch paper plate. For a 30-06 round that distance is just under 300 yards at 287 yards. A distance that takes 3/10ths of a second for the bullet to reach.

Which basically takes any conflict to a speed/reaction game. How much time does it take for a wizard to apparate/portkey in, orient themselves, cast a spell, and apparate/portkey out versus how much time does it take for a soldier to realize a wizard has appeared, orient themselves, and aim and fire? Then add avoid the spell for the soldier who has at least one advantage that if the spell is cast from a distance away he may be able to dodge the spell.

******* Not really my point but still interesting, so thanks. I knew from physics that the farther the gun the more factors will influence the trajectory of the bullet, but didn't know the specifics.

Anyway, we have never seen in cannon a gun x magic situation or even had the matter discussed by any character, so no way of knowing for certain what would prevail. Furthermore, we don't even know for sure if the protective measures we do see affect magic only or also bullets, so while we could make an argument for things like the clothing the twins made which had an in-built protego we never were informed if it would work against guns.

We do know though that there was never shown to be a limit to how many spells a wizard can cast, contrary to guns and bombs which have the limit of how much ammunition the user has, and we also know that spells vary in how destructible they are, being the most dangerous we know of the Fiendfyre curse that Grindelwald planned to use to wipe out Paris, which has an area of 105,4 square kilometers. Assuming that he took account of the fact that even without Flamel's interference eventually the local government would take notice of the cursed fire and take their own measures to contain it and we can deduce that left alone this particular curse would be able to destroy an area even greater, and as muggles wouldn't be able to implement a counter-curse it stands to reason that In a wizards v muggles scenario wizards would have the advantages of being able to apparate away from slow-reaching dangers (Atomic bombs and misses included granted that the situation in question lets them detect them in time) and the offensive power ranging from almost none to the necessary to level an entire city per person (by all accounts Goyle wasn't a particularly powerful or smart wizard and yet he did manage to conjure Fiendfyre, so it makes sense that almost every of age wizard would be able to conjure the fire, even though most wouldn't be able to control it, this created the scenario in which each wizard would be capable as a last resource to use the curse in a Kamikaze attack that would equal to an atomic bomb).

And besides this we also have to take into account other means that wizards would have to strike against muggles. Assuming that they live in separate spaces (same conditions for the muggle government to be able to use the nukes in first place), then they could portkey mandrakes into closed spaces like metro stations, the mandrakes kill by sound, so anyone who hears it would die, depending on the intensity of the sounds, the specific place and the number of plants this could be not only the people inside the tunnels, but also the people in the streets over the tunnels as well. Theoretically with a great enough number of mandrakes it should be possible to completely destroy even big cities, like NY, Beijing or London.

Then there is also other beings show in cannon that could cause great destruction. Nundus for example are big cats capable of using a toxic gas that can quite easily drop a whole town dead. Guaranteed, finding one, not being killed, send them for a targeted town and somehow get it back could be quite problematic, but it would still be a walking mass killing weapon.

Basilisks were also shown to be able to affect a target even indirectly, while there is no way of knowing for sure if it could work as cannon never touched the matter, they could technically be recorded and have the recording exhibited in a tv program with international live broadcasting and many viewers. This could potentially be used to take out up to hundreds of millions, billions even, at a stretch. By far the most destructive attack in the whole history of humanity, made even worse because it wouldn't be targeted, meaning that it would hit randomly from common people walking around the street to get to their jobs up to world leaders, high ranking militaries, people essential to the maintenance of the infrastructure from anywhere from small villages up to whole countries. Beyond the deaths from the attack itself it would also slow down greatly the response-time of pretty much all governments in the world as they are forced to pass through the arduous task of finding out who is in charge of what, who died, what resources were compromised by sudden deaths, deal with the in-country panic of the survivors, dispose of the bodies, figure out how it happened and what would be a suitable response, deal with the many vacuums in power and the internal groups seeking to use the internal problems to seize power for themselves. And them there would also be the many deaths that would emerge as indirect consequences of the attack, such as a sudden drop in the number of medics, car accidents caused by motorists dropping dead, small children and toddlers locked up at home without any way of getting out on their own... while Basilisks were introduced in a relatively light-hearted way it could potentially get really dark really fast.

Then there are the dementors, which can only be driven away by magic users. We can't really make an estimative on how bad are their auras since everyone seems to be affected differently, but the reactions seems to range from sudden bouts of depression up to fainting, and considering that the only means by which muggles would be able to defend themselves from they would be physical barriers we can assume in a conservative estimation that they could affect parts of towns by kissing random people in the street, causing big car accidents as the drivers are hit with sudden, intense and uncontrollable depression and fainting while driving, deaths by getting people stomped over on the chaos to get away... it probably wouldn't be on par with the ones above, but it would still be devastating.

My take on the situation is that both sides have great destructive capabilities (I didn't focus on that but chemical and biological weapons would still be effective against wizards, and atomic bombs, even if not immediately damaging, would affect the environment around the wizards, contaminating water-sources, affecting the flora and fauna, killing animals In mass -thus compromising also food sources, besides any other kind of weapons or other means of attack that I didn't think about it don't remember). It could potentially become something like the Cold War, in which neither side could openly move against the other because the result would invariably be the mutual destruction of both sides, would even explain why in cannon both governments are seen to be aware of each other but neither is actively trying to conquer the other (Voldemort doesn't count as we get crazies who think themselves invincible in every society) if they are aware that moving attacking the other will result in either a devastating defeat with only a couple of survivors from their whole species condemned to live at the non-existent mercy of the enemy side or in a Pyrrhic victory with the survivors getting some small number of generations left to live in the burned-out husk of what was once called the world.

So if a handful of wizards can generate enough power to cause the wards/runes to fail then I can see a megaton nuclear warhead slicing through them like a red hot knife through butter.

Now you could say that maybe runes are applied to the missiles that activate when they are launched. The problem with that is wizards can't apparate or portkey into a place unless they have been there before. The actual missile silos are not open to the public so how would the wizards get there.

****** True but consider wards/protection charms/runes etc all seem to have finite levels of strength and area of effect. Then consider that a wizard can dodge a spell if he's quick enough and the odds of hitting a moving nuke are slim to none. Using the slower speed of 14,000 mph that translates to over 20,500 feet per second. No wizard or spell moves fast enough to hit that.

I can easily detonate a nuke 5000 feet and higher above the ground and destroy everything that's on the ground. No "ward" goes that high (that we know of in canon). If your AU has "wards" that go that high you would have to address how they don't impact airplanes etc.

There would have to be a couple of other major divergences from canon that your AU would have to address. The first would be that magicals would have to be much more knowledgeable about muggle technology and capabilities. If they just think a nuke is a big bomb their wards could be simply blast protection based and the massive radiation would still kill them.

The second would be that muggleborn and muggle raised would have to have a much larger voice in the society as the have more knowledge on technology (though not the intricate details on nukes).

It might be interesting to read a fic where wizards are much more aware of technology and how advanced muggles are. In many ways either you would have much more cooperation between the two or a lot more behind the scenes involvement with magicals cleaning up the environment, improving food stocks/growth etc.

Legilimency, Polyjuice, Imperio?

Confundus? Metamorphmagi?

Honestly our real anti-infiltration capabilities have little defense against people that can read minds, turn into perfect copies of others, or control minds.

Heck, they could just enter a facility, do whatever they need to do to neutralize nukes against wizards and then leave without anyone being the wiser. They can even edit memories.

****** Again all possible, the story will just have to address how the magicals know which people to go after, how they handle people who aren't impacted by the Imperius (remember not all are susceptible and if you are strong willed enough you can defeat it). Also, remember that there are squibs, muggleborns and Half-bloods that have left the magical world because they don't like the pureblood "rule" and many of them could be part of the militaries you are going against so your story would need to address those issues.

******* The whole matter of muggleborns abandoning the wizarding world is mostly a result from muggle-wank stories, we don't know how far exactly the magical government observes its citizens and what would be needed for them to let this muggleborns go, for all we know they have their minds wiped and their wands snapped (while something only really addressed in fandom and with no evidence in cannon maybe they even have some way of binding their magic), or they may not be allowed to seek jobs outside the wizarding world at all. We know they take the Status of Secret very seriously, I really can't see them just ignoring the risk of a rejected wizard deciding to expose them and using magic in some live national broadcast or something like this, so at least some degree of vigilance must be employed.

The only one immune to the imperius that we see in cannon was Harry, and even this can be attributed to the scarhorcrux more easily than to his own willpower being so much stronger than everyone else's. Remember that while we treat it with some disregard and it really doesn't play that big of a role in cannon the Imperus is still one of the unforgivables and one that is said to have affected a great deal of the population. We have no way of knowing one way or another how susceptible someone with a strong will but no magic or experience with the mind arts would be to the curse, so maybe it will affect anyone at the military.

As for knowing who to question (I personally don't know that much about military organization, but someone looking to make an attempt would probably do some research on the matter beforehand, so they would probably have a better idea of how to go about it), if I had to make a try I would start from the top, find a way of entering undetected the house of the ministers of security (maybe the former if it proves too hard) in the night, legilimize/imperius the Hell our of him to get the location or the name of the people who know, then obliviate him and go down the list he gave me until every nuclear weapon is nullified, probably there are better and easier ways of doing it, but this is how somebody with only superficial knowledge of the society and almost no preparation may do this.

***** Not necessarily, cannon never really went that far into the limits of magical protection, the closer we get on a confirmation of wards (basically just another name for magical protection spells like we see the trio doing during the Horcrux hunt instead of a whole new field of magic) being overwhelmed by power was Voldemort overwhelming Hogwarts wards, and even that isn't really conclusive, we don't know if it is because of how much energy he used, because it was an specific spell he knew or because it was magical energy instead of kinetic or electrical energy. For all we know when a ward is cast it will last forever no matter how much it's bombarded until a specific spell is used. Even the whole rune cluster deal is something that was never even implied in cannon, neither was having to charge or make the maintenance of wards, the whole matter was so underused that all we have was what was created by the fandom.

And then there is the matter that we were never told how much you have to know about an area to be able to portkey or apparate there.

We know that the person needs to have a destination in mind when apparating, but does it have to be the knowledge born from having been there before, a perfect image of the place -that can be obtained by picture or even a vivid description- or is it enough to have a vague sense -like up, far away to the left, or down-, maybe even just a name is enough, or knowing something about the place -for example, that person X is there.

Portkeys are even more mysterious, since the only instance we see of their creating was Dumbledore in OotP, who didn't really take the time to explain the process and is shown as too knowledgeable and powerful for us to get an accurate estimative of how easy or hard is the spell based solely on him making one targeting a place he knows intimately and must have targeted with others portkeys before. For all we know all a person needs to know to make a portkey to a certain place is how likely it is to be a bird in the location. Even in most fanfics somewhat accurate coordinates are show as enough to make one.

If the premier wizard can transfigure a literal animal into existence from random debris in a combat situation, a cabal of learned scholars can make a spell that transfigures nuke shaped things into chickens over a wide area.

Arguing semantics here. While the word "ward" is never used in canon, the concept of protective enchantments placed over a structure or an area of ground /is/, and when such enchantments are seen in other fantasy settings, they are given the nomenclature of "ward", as shorthand for denoting that the spells used are warding (aka guarding, protecting, etc) against hostile magics.

********* Not in the fanon sense though. The protective enchantments in canon are all interesting in their function and application. We have examples of powerful illusions, mental misdirection, and even bent space. In fanfiction, we have invisible walls that keep things out. Though, to be fair, we do see an example of that with the cursed barrier in HBP, which only allowed individuals who bear the Dark Mark through.

It's not that I have an issue with calling them wards. Rather, I have an issue with how insanely boring it is to read about the latest and greatest invisible walls that keep things out but can be brought down by breaking a fancy rune engraved rock.

Harry Potter has a (relatively) poorly explained magic system due to it having been a plot device in the books. Far from being a bad thing, this actually gives fanfic writers a ton of leeway to develop it in new and interesting ways. I personally do not see the aforementioned invisible walls to be creative, interesting, or imaginative.

The amount of vitriol against "Blood Wards" and how they weren't mentioned in Canon. If protective magic=ward, then protective magic based on blood= Blood Ward.

But it seems pretty well accepted here that its not real, and just poor writing and the sign of a bad fic....

****** And I disagree. I quite frankly believe that a true no holds bar battle between wizards (mostly purebloods and halfbloods) against muggles, (along with squibs, muggleborns and Halfbloods who have left the magical world) would be an unmitigated disaster for both. The shear numbers discrepancies, the amounts and types of weapons available and the capability to hit from distances that magicals aren't even aware they are there would be enough of a disaster that the magicals would cease to exist as a society.

Remember the majority of magicals are average and quite frankly are sheep. How else would a couple dozen deatheaters bring the magical world to it's knees. Then consider their numbers are so low that once you kill off enough of their population they can never recover. Now without a doubt the muggles would suffer as well (fiendfyre comes to mind) but the their numbers, variety of weapons, and the magicals that the purebloods pushed out of that world would tilt the battle in the muggles favor.

For instance, maybe the magicals who left that world and joined the military have put protection charms etc to protect against infiltration/attacks by other magicals. And would lead them to magical areas (diagon alley, hogsmeade, hogwarts etc).

Remember there are lots of magicals who the purebloods have pushed out of that world. IMO I believe the majority would fight on the muggles side countering quite a bit of the magicals advantage. Plus from canon there are lots of high level officials who know about the magical world. You don't think they have R&D departments working on detection of magicals.

We already know from canon that disillusionment spells aren't perfect and you need a few other spells to make it work. And it takes several years to train magicals properly in their powers while it takes roughly 6 weeks to train a soldier to use firearms.

Bottomline, I believe a full out war between the two groups would lead to destruction of both worlds.

  against muggles, (along with squibs, muggleborns and Halfbloods who have left the magical world)
#+end_quote

If Muggleborn and Halfblood join the Muggles, then it's not a fight against Muggles and Wizards anymore, it's a civil war between wizards with the muggle being turned into an allie/tool by a side.

All the fics I have read having the muggles "beat" the wizards either have a part of the wizards go with the muggle (making it a civil war) or nerf the wizard to the point where muggles could somehow win.

Also, it works both way. Either both side want to extermine each other and in that case, I don't know why Muggleborn would join the Muggles, since they would be the next "purged" after the war. Or the reason (and objectif) of the war is different, and in that case, I can imagine thousands of muggle running to the magical side to serve the "superior ones".

​

For the rest of your points, I'll just make a quick list :

- The average power of wizards does not really matter when they can all live under "perfect" protections (no muggles can find Diagon Alley, Hogwarts or any magical place unless guided by someone magical, which would defeat the point). You can just have some elite team read the muggle side to win the war, or just ignore them and continue with your life.
- disillusionement may not be perfect (unless you are a truly powerfull wizard), but Invisibility cloaks are), luckily they are a thing in the canon universe (and only become a bit blurry after years of use or a tear).
- It take years to train a wizard and only weeks for a muggle, but a wizard can kill hundreds, if not thousands of muggle by himself (it only take a spell as you said).
- If both side truly does not pull any punch, wizard have a magnificent spell called the "/Imperius/". Coupled with their other magical ability (apparition, invisibility cloack/ disillusionment, polyjuice . . .), they can turn entire army of muggles against each other in weeks, if not days.
- We don't know for the other country (though we can guess that they all have a pretty similar system), but in the case of the UK, the Prime Minister is letteraly the only person knowing about Magic. There are not secret service team or R&D department that monitor the wizards. Only the PM know anything about the other side, and only what the Minister for Magic decide to tell him. The only other British muggle who /may/ know about it is the Queen, and that is debatable.

In case of a war, with the canon magic system, I just can't see the muggles win.

******** I see where you're coming from. My point is that based on canon you already have magicals who have aligned themselves with the muggles because the purebloods have pushed them out of the magical world. So they identify themselves as muggles. So IMO it isn't a magical civil war with one side having muggles as allies. Rather it would be a magical vs muggle war with disaffected magicals already as part of the muggle forces.

According to canon Invisibility cloaks aren't perfect. You still have to remember to deal with sound, smell, heat, weight, etc. Of course, your AU may vary.

Again according to canon, the PM is the only one who is officially contacted by the magical government. But there is nothing in canon to suggest that anything was done to keep him from informing other government entities etc about magic. In fact, any parents of a muggleborn or halfblood magical who are in the military etc could easily become that task force to work on ways to handle a magical uprising. And that would not violate any agreements. And I'm sorry but no senior government official is going to not look into how to handle a population of individuals who could cause great harm to the country.

While a single wizard can kill hundreds so can a single soldier depending on the weapon used. Now one thing that is in canon (but never fully explored) is that places like St. Mungo's are hidden by muggle notice me not charms so the entrance looks like an abandoned building or not there. But they are physically there. So what happens inside St. Mungo's if I fire a couple of RPG's into that "abandoned" building.

If I remember correctly when stories about Grindelwald and WWII are discussed magical buildings were harmed/destroyed during the bombing of London. Even though the german muggle pilots couldn't see the magical area. If that's correct then all the muggles need to do is attack that general area with area effect weapons to harm magicals. And that knowledge can be gained by either a captured magical or a magical aligned with the muggles.

Imperius is a tough one and can definitely wreck havoc. On the good news on the muggle side not ever magical can cast that spell. On the bad news for muggles they have no idea who is susceptible or not and only those of strong will can resist it. So without assistance from other magicals this one is a tough one. Especially if the magicals start using it prior to the start of hostilities. If it is after hostilities start they may be ways to slow the spread (via limiting opportunities) eg., never being only, cameras, heat, motion, sound detectors etc. But without help I don't think you can completely stop it.

********* First of all, in cannon there was never any case shown of a magical abandoning the magical world. We don't see if the government would even let them do it, let alone what measures would be implemented to stop them from ruining the Statute of secret or of joining the muggles against the magic world, for all we know the ministry has a way of tracking the magicals who abandon there world and if they catch any spell cast by them without excellent reasons will immediately chuck them into the veil.

Next you are assuming that all muggleborns/half-bloods that may or not go into the muggle army will be competent enough to thwart the efforts of the rest. In the I WW it is said by Moody that there was no way of knowing if someone is or not under the imperius and we never see any method capable of breaking the curse, so there is no way for this possible muggle-sided magicals to help in this regard.

Besides that is the fact that the ones who stayed at the magical world will be the ones with training in their chosen fields while the ones who went muggle would be the ones who were denied employment, so only have Hogwarts level of formal training in magic, and by what we see Harry and Ron are slightly above the level they would realistically be at (having prepared for war), so they wouldn't be an army of Hermiones capable of rendering useless all the curses, spells, enchanted items, potions and transfigurations casted by the people who actually did study specifically in this subjects to be on a professional level.

Furthermore, assuming for the sake of argument and for the fact that this is the mostly used way in the fandom that wards are a separated field of study that must be learned by people who took runes, how would this muggle-sided magicals know how to cast wards that would mitigate the advantages provided by magic, like apparition and portkeys? If they had no specific training in the subject they shouldn't know how to do it as the average magical doesn't (even more so if runes are important to it and they didn't learn them or dropped the subject, or just outright forgot about it -god is witness that I forgot pretty much all the organic chemistry my teachers managed to force in my head during high-school- if it's not a subject you have to use for a long stretch of time it's normal forgetting the specifics). In a -admittedly not that good- metaphor it would be like taking a bunch of adults who stopped their education after high-school and asking them to make a heart transplant as well as an experiment doctor, that is, just asking for failure, which becomes dangerous if we consider that many fields of magic have to be taught because doing the wrong thing can cause disaster and there must be a competent teacher nearby to explain how to not start a zombie apocalypse while mending a bone, stop you from activating a volcano when you start practicing incorrectly how to mend a bone and closing the hole in the fabric of the universe that you opened while trying to mend a bone before Cthulhu manages to pass and end all life on Earth.

********** Well as you and I both know there are lots of things that aren't covered very well in canon. Now while it isn't stated directly by canon the disdain that purebloods show to muggleborns and halfbloods suggests that there isn't a lot of opportunities for them. So I can see them having to go into the muggle world to make a living and I can't see the purebloods caring that much that they are gone and "watching them". I can't see your "chuck into the veil scenario" especially when canon never did that to all the werewolves. And I'm not saying that the magicals are making some big public announcement where they state "I renounce the magical world" rather they just quietly decide that the opportunities aren't there for them in the magical world.

Now they are still magicals which means they can still get magical books and can practice magic in their homes. They just live and work in the muggle world.

As far as how competent they are that's a coin flip. They could have been very good students and talented magicals or they could be below average. But there is nothing to suggest that if they decide to live in the muggle world because they don't like how the magical world is run that they are all poor magicals.

IIRC in the GoF in the maze wasn't Krum's eyes "glassy" when he was under the imperius? If so, we now have conflicting statements on whether a person under the imperius can be detected. So who ever writes this new fic would have to decide what they want to include in their story concerning this.

Again there isn't a lot in canon to determine how you continue your training in the magical arts. For a lot of it just continuing to go through magical books should be enough to improve your skills. An adult magicals have nothing stopping them from buying books and practicing magic. Remember the trace is gone when you're an adult.

Ok your bone mending is over the top and I don't think that a competent magical with the right books couldn't learn the skills successfully without causing an apocalypse.

Wards would be similar. If you had the basic knowledge it shouldn't be that difficult with the correct materials to learn from.

*********** I guess it would mostly depend on how you would want to make the story go.

While I can the magic society being discriminatory against muggleborns and half-bloods to the point that in average they don't have many choices of employment consider this: you are someone in a first world country who dropped out of your studies at eleven (the idea of just picking it up after school would take years, just try to remember how much you had to learn on all subjects between the ages 11 and 17 and then consider that you will also have passed this time learning subjects which contradicts most of it and that you won't have a competent teacher to explain it to you, the result is that it would possibly take even longer than the 7 years it should). What kind of jobs would you have to chose from? Remember, the Statute of Secret means that you can't use any magic to help you on your job. In the average I presume that most would rather stay at the magical world, if for no other then because while neither job you would get would be something particularly good at least at the magical world you would get to use your magic and keep contact to the people you meet during school.

You wouldn't need to make a big announcement, it's an universal truth that governments keep at least some vigilance over it's citizens. You have documents of completing Hogwarts at the very least, as well as OWLS & NEWTS, the Ministry will want to know with what you are working, if for no other reason than to get the correct amount in taxes (in which the purebloods will be interested). If you have no lawful employment in the magical world the ministry will want to make certain that you are not practicing crimes or refusing to pay taxes (in which the discrimination would make the government look even closer than normal in the case of muggleborns and half-bloods). You will have to declare with what you are working and provide proof, in which case by showing employment in the muggle government will raise all kind of red-flags, then, they will know you are living primarily in the muggle world and feel the need (to satisfy international standards if nothing else) to take steps to monitor any magic you do in order preserve the Statute of Secret as you will be in an environment in which you could easily slip and break the law (again, this is a case in which the discrimination would ensure that the government is even harsher on the discriminated then they would otherwise be), eventually the restrictions could be so great that it would be easier to just give up on magic overall. This is how you could enter in the “chuck in the veil” scenario.

Oh, and while there was the whole glazed eyes thing I personally think it was more of Harry's personal opinion rather than a clue about the imperius, but I could be wrong. Anyway, still no way of breaking the curse or knowing when it ends, so going around thinking anyone with “glazed eyes” is under imperius would potentially end in even worse results than the intended ones. Besides if I'm not mistaken neither Plus Thickness nor Katie Bell were described with glazed eyes, so it isn't something that would happen every time.

It wouldn't be that they went muggle because they aren't good at magic, is that because they went muggle they didn't take the special training in specific professions that would make them above the level of an average graduate from Hogwarts. Let's take healing for example, this is something that I would never trust someone not trained specifically on it to do, and yet it wasn't taught at Hogwarts in any moment, so it stands to read that it is taught when the would-be-healer apply for the job given that they have the required grades, also with aurors, no matter how good you are with guns, fighting or laws, if you want to be a police officer you have to go to the academy and train to ensure you will know all the information and procedures a officer needs, no country in the world will let someone do self-study to join the police, it stands to reason that it is the same for aurors.

Learning a whole new subject from a book is quite different from learning it from a teacher while supplementing with books. To start without a teacher you will depend mostly on luck to find good source material, many of the books will either skip some details, explain something assuming you know a previous information that you otherwise could clarify with a teacher or use from theories that are either outdated or not contested by the majority of the specialists, to learn something from academic books you must have a good list of recommend literature given by someone who is knowledgeable in the matter, and then you also have to find a way to keep yourself with the new discoveries and changes in the field, many theories that seem to be ironclad today may be disproved or updated to include new facts tomorrow. Then there is the fact that you can't ask a book to explain a passage that you didn't understand, sometimes it's because the author wasn't that clear, sometimes it's a mistranslation, other it simply parts from the supposition that you already know something that would explain the matter at hand, with a teacher you can ask questions to clarify the subject and thus be able to move faster in your studies while correcting any mistaken assumptions you may make.

And this brings us to what is possibly the worse case, mistaken assumptions. Imagine for an instant that you studied medicine exclusively by books and is getting ready for your first operation, but in your reading you misinterpreted the little detail of from where the blood comes, and so instead of injecting the medication in the persons column you inject it in their neck, chances are that your patient is going to die. Now take into account that instead of a vanilla garden-variety human you are a being with command of a force capable of bending space, slavering time, deal directly with concepts, call upon soul-destructing Fire, animating objects that should have no way of moving on their own, give sentience to an inanimate object, affecting people's very souls and rewriting reality itself with transfiguration (don't feel like explaining needlessly, but the whole theory of changing atoms is either false or even worse than the alternative -like, an idiot making a H-bomb by accident level of worse) and then answer me this: Is breaking a piece of reality and inviting Cthulhu by accident really that over the top?

  But there is nothing in canon to suggest that anything was done to keep him from informing other government entities etc about magic

Harry Potter 6, Chapter 1 The Other Minister :

#+begin_quote
  /“The Minister of Magic only reveals him --- or herself to the Muggle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, poking his wand back inside his jacket. “We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.”/\\
  /“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn't a former Prime Minister warned me -?”/\\
  /At this, Fudge had actually laughed. “My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?”/

  /Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace, stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and realized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this encounter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?/
#+end_quote

Canon evidences seem to tend more toward "never told anyone" rather than "informed other government members". But since canon doesn't clearly state that he didn't do so (after his meeting with Scrimgeour), then to each his head canon I guess.

I . . . don't know what would happen to a magical structure if attacked from the outside. Potential protections aside, these structure have expanded inside, so what happen if you fire at one specific floor from the outside?\\
Still, one point that stand is that, from what we know, the 4 most important location of Magical Brittain are its Ministry, Diagon Alley, Hogwarts and St Mungo. 3 of these locations are in London, the capital. Muggle can't even see these locations unless guided by someone magical, and if they can locate them, they would need to prepare their assault.\\
Said preparation time would probably be largely enough for the wizards to prepare their defense or evacuate, not to mention that emptying the zone (London heart) from its civilian would take way more time that what the wizards would need. Can the Muggle tryly afford to make a true massacre to their own population (since they can't really be precise against their opponent) to attack an enemy base that can be easily evacuated, not to mention rebuild in mere days.

By "perfect" invisibility cloaks, I meant that they made the wearer invisible. Spells probably exist to take care of its failings (sound and smell), and even if there isn't any, Polyjuice is still there to save the day.

​

Anyways, while debating can be pleasant, I don't think any of us will manage to convince the other, so let's just agree to disagree?

** Another thing that doesn't really surprise me is that often in these muggle vs magical battle discussions it seems that those who believe the magicals will have a "cakewalk" always have the entire magical world against the muggles and I only see that in one scenario which is where the muggles with no provocation decide to wipe out the magical world. I don't see that as a likely scenario.

What I see as more likely is that the purebloods decide that muggles/government needs to go. That pits roughly 3000 purebloods (10% of estimated 30,000 UK) which would include maybe 100-200 aurors against roughly 150K UK military. That's a 50 to 1 advantage. Overall Population wise the muggles could easily handle 200 to 1 losses 66.5 million to 30,000 as they have a 2200 to 1 advantage. At that rate 3 million muggles lost equates to half the wizarding population gone.

Then if the purebloods start this war it would only take a handful of disaffected magicals to assist the muggles in making alliances. How about hey goblins fight for us against the purebloods and when we win we will tear down all their discriminatory laws allowing you full participation in our economy etc. And one of the first tasks would be for the goblins to protect key muggle personnel and facilities. And similar alliances could be made with other magical races that the purebloods had marginalized/pissed off.

The majority of the magical population just wants to live their lives and raise their families. So as long as the muggles don't start the war and don't try to exterminate the magical world the majority of magicals would be neutral/not fight.

Now it won't be a cakewalk for the muggles either (again think fiendfyre). But if the muggles don't start this conflict and the purebloods use something like that a lot of uninvolved magicals will be horrified enough to join the muggles in fighting.

Bottomline both sides would lose but due to the vast differences in population size each magical loss has a much greater impact then each muggle loss.

** Depends on how big an area they can ward with arbitrary spells.

In particular, nukes require a lot of things to go just right, otherwise you just get a regular boom (with maybe a tiny smidgen of extra oomph), plus a bunch of nuclear stuff all over the immediate vicinity.

Based on what I could find, nukes generally are set to go off about 2000ish feet up (I have a feeling the actual values are classified, all I could find in a cursory google was something from Oppenheimer in the 40s)

Thus, a bubble of a few miles radius around Hogwarts that did any of:

1. Used something like the Impervious charm, targeted at every atomic nuclei within its boundaries
2. Does something that screws with the timekeeping of anything that passes its boundaries
3. Does something that screws even very slightly with explosions (reaction rate, propagation of blast waves, etc.). Keep in mind that depending on the precise nature of your magic system, it can be difficult or even impossible to accomplish some of these without also screwing with the chemical reactions necessary for life (or screw with Potions). Experimentation in an isolated location is recommended.

On the other hand, the largest (non-classified) nukes in the US arsenal have a yield of about 1.2 megatons, the blast wave alone is sufficient to collapse buildings within 16 km of the explosion, and inflict 3rd degree burns on everyone in line of sight within 35.5 km.

Much larger bombs have existed, and in the case of a wizard/muggle war, could be assembled relatively quickly if needed.

As such, you would just need to drop nukes somewhere within several tens of km of a magical target to hit it quite hard (especially for targets in convenient valleys, where the mountains will contain the blast, and you'll get the blast wave echoing back and forth on top of everything else).

As such, you would need to construct these wards over a truly massive area around any location to be safe.

Furthermore, if we're already doing nuclear war, the muggles might agree to suspend Article IV of the Outer Space Treaty, and start working on Rods from God, which merely deliver a shit-ton of kinetic energy and will sap the strength of the wards like anything (I mean, if this happened today, you can bet Elon Musk would be all over the chance to live out another scifi nerd fantasy).

** In the end, it was Wizarding Britain that revealed the existence of magic to the world. And they did it in the stupidest way possible.

The wards they had placed across the British Isles were simple. Anything large enough, shaped properly, and coming in at a high enough rate of speed would be turned into a cloud of green vapor. The wards extended higher than any previous wards, given the nature of the threat. The unspeakables had even consulted with the muggle government, to make sure that they didn't catch aircraft in their net.

Britain does not have a civilian space program, nor does its military conduct space launches. the only incoming rockets would be nuclear missiles - which is what the wards were intended to stop.

Two Americans and one Russian were halfway to orbit when their rocket's engines gave out. Calmly, as if it were just another drill, the crew pitched their spacecraft forward and prepared to abort the mission. The crew would ride the now inert rocket most of the way across the ocean, before ditching near the Irish sea.

Alas, they miscalculated their speed, and their rocket breached the wards surrounding the island. With a puff, the three men found themselves tumbling in midair, their spacecraft gone in a haze of green. Fortunately, they were low enough to open their emergency parachutes, and all three landed without injury in an Irish pasture.

Once they explained to the very confused farmer what they were doing on his land, they were quicky retrieved. Following their debriefing, the Prime Minister summoned the Minister for Magic, and a very uncomfortable meeting ensued.

** The room was well-lit and well-furnished, which could have been a surprise: it was situated in the second basement of /The Crooked Wand/, a tavern with a ... reputation... in Knockturn Alley. But being on the run does not mean that one should give up on comfort.\\
Two dozens individuals had gotten together: witches and wizards, their faces covered but for three of them: Abraxas Malfoy and Lucien Selwyn surrounded the one that everyone had been promised, the Heir of Slytherin, and their guests had come today on the promise of a new Era.\\
The young man - for it was a young man they were all listening to, barely over 30 - had a gift for talking: he was, before them, autopsying the wizarding world. 15 years after the fall of Grindelwald, Dumbledore was reigning unchallenged, presiding over the destruction of their traditions, of their way of life, slowly but surely, all of them knew; but already, Abraxas knew, the Heir was reaching the most important part, the core tenet of the Knights, and soon they all would knew the rightness of the Knights of Walpurgis cause.\\
"And Grindelwad forgot it, enthusiastic as he was to recruit in the ruins of Europe: magic must be kept pure of muggle contamination, for they would burn the world we live in. We had to hide ourselves, we had to hide the majesty of Magic, we had to hide phoenixes and dragons, and it was not enough for they befouled the very air we breath; some brave souls helped them to clean it, and you could hardly breath again in London before their bombs destroyed half of it..."\\
One of the listener was wriggling on its chair and Abraxas started to dread: it could be only her...\\
"But if that was not enough destruction, enough savagery, they went even further. While we fought the remnants of Grindelwad empire, they decided that the fate of London and Dresden was not dire enough, and on Nippon they used apocalyptic weapons able to burn cities whole..."\\
"Well, we just have to put flame-freezing charms everywhere" It was her. Why, oh, why, had he decided to listen to Walburga: "She's your cousin" she had said, "She's pure" she had added, as if it was enough to mean sane!\\
His Lord was smiling, for he knew the answer to that objection, had planned for it maybe, and Abraxas could not interrupt him to warn him.\\
"We can. We already do. We know how to protect against their firearms, we know how to protect against their bombs and their gases. This is not it: as Prometheus before them, they are trying to reach too high, and these new weapons harness the power of the Sun not only to burn all, but to eradicate life at its most fundamental level..."\\
She interrupted him again. He was going to kill Walburga for pressing him to invite her.\\
"Well, we can always use Anti-sunburn charms, can't we?"\\
No one spoke. None of the proud (but masked) purebloods who were to join them. Not Lucien nor him. Not his Lord, for the first time unable to find his words.\\
Here went that recruitment drive.... he ought to have known better than to invite a Lovegood.

** Im super late to this and i am very confused as to how this devolved to a debate on whether or not wizards could stop the nukes while they were in the air??? While i do agree that the rules on magic are so loose in hp universe that it is very easy to imagine said barriers that could stop nukes from doing their innitial catastrophic destruction. But my real reason for even posting is how does "countermeasures" not cover a black ops style unit of wizards, aurors or not, that just absolutely obliterate any opposition. Muggles have no countermeasures to apparition so unless im wrong.. because essentially if the gov declares nuclear war on wizards thats basically genocide so why on earth would they not retaliate with their own lethal show of force. Which for the record could still be stunning spells. It makes no sense to me that this would not be included in" countermeasures" and finding information is as easy as picking strawberries for aurors or other powerful wizards.

Unite Apparate to target (can even do it while practically invisible) and just go ham show.. there is no possible way for muggles to combat this style of warfare. And hey if they got wise enough to it and somehow did come up with some miraculous way togetthe jump on wizards literally poofing up infront of them...just change tactics and mass produce polyjuicepotion.

Main point isthst countermeasures to someone nuking you would not be "hey lets try and stop these nukes while they are already airborn that would be fun eh" no. Someone declares nuclear war or worse just drops one on you (which i dont think i actually need to explain would never happen.... do i?) You would not wait for the next one to go off. It would be too easy for wizards to infiltrate top security government. Like who would seriously know if donald trumpo was being impersonated by a polyjuiced wizard who knew absolutely nothing about how to run a muggle country. Literally no one. Certainly not his supporters.

** Nuclear missile travel at about 5 kilometres (3 miles) per second. The optimum height of burst to maximize severe ground range destruction for a 1 kt bomb is 0.22 km; for 100 kt, 1 km; and for 10 Mt, 4.7 km (from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_nuclear_explosions]])

I don't think the wizards, most of whom can't pronounce electricity and still believe muggles use muskets, would ever establish a protection spell against bombs or nukes. The concept of wards are a fanon invention -- Flitwick had to CAST protection spells on Hogwarts before the last battle, McGonagall activated the armours! No one "turned on" the so-called automatic protection spells. READ Deathly Hallows!

So, it is HIGHLY doubtful that the wizards even know what nukes are, or have ANY spell set up and ACTIVE that would detect something coming down at 5 kps. And even if they DID, the spell would not expect the bomb (based on WWII experience) to explode so far above the target. A regular bomb would be useless at that altitude. Would it even be able to DETECT the bomb BEFORE it detonates 4+ kilometres up in the air? It would have to detect the bomb before anyone even knew it was arriving.

Plus, while a spell might stop a large object, it wouldn't stop LIGHT. So anyone outside when the blast went off would be blind. It might stop excessive heat, but we know spells shields are useless against fiendfyre, and a nuclear explosion is about 100,000,000 degrees Celsius, so I don't think a spell will stop it. Finally, we see severe storms at Hogwarts, so clearly there are any spells to stop the speed-of-sound winds at temperatures in excess of 1,000 degrees.

** Damn dude, if you think someone can cast at something moving multiple times the speed of sound, you've got some things to learn. Also, most nukes don't explode on the ground, they explode high in the air. Not only that, you have to deal with nuclear fallout for miles around.

Let's stop acting so condescending when you didn't actually think anything through. Aurthur can't even say Electricty, and he works with Muggle stuff as a career. You're nuts if you think a modern missile is anything other than armageddon for these people.

Lmao you're a fucking idiot if you think otherwise.

*** Ok, now this came across as condescending. The whole magical system at Harry Potter was barely explained and used more for plot convenience rather than a fundament for the plot itself, so while atomic bombs detonate in the air we have nothing saying that protective spells have any set limit on how high they can get, maybe this “wards” reach space?

Yeah, the fallout of the radiation infecting the soil, the animals and the water probably would cause great problems either way, but for all we know they could create barriers impervious to all effects from the bombs, from the radioactive isotopes, the heat, Kinect energy and even the things thrown at speed by the explosion and any other effect that I may be unaware.

This is a prompt, which means that it's an idea put forward to a possible fanfic, and honestly with all the muggle-wank we see in the fandom that puts atomic bombs as not only something that can be used with little to no problems at a moments notice, but also as the be-all end-all of any conflict with no possible response I, for one, think it's great to see an idea that breaks with this molds. Can you actually imagine what would really happen if the English government decided to drop an atomic bomb in the middle of London to commit genocida against a society that by all accounts is more worried about keeping secret them anything else? The immense amount of deaths, the contamination of air, water and soil that would last centuries, if not millenniums, and the political fallout inside and outside the country alone would cause no end of troubles, to say nothing of any response from magical governments.
