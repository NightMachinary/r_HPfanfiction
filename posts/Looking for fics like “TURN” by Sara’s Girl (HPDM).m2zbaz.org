I have never really been into HarryxDraco stories, but I just read [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1550773/][Sara's Girl]] and I thought it was so good.

I really liked how well written it was, how long it was, and how there was no bashing of characters (no Ginny bashing).

I was hoping other readers had recommendations of well written Drarry fics that I could take a look at.

I do prefer post war fics.

But for anyone who hasn't read Turn, I highly recommend it.


** Hello! Turn is so great and is a great introduction to Drarry! I went through my list of recs and this is what I came up with for Post War fics:

- Foundations!Verse by Saras_Girl: This is a series and it starts with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/879599][Reparations]]
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550][Running on Air]] by Eleventy7: I get teary-eyed just thinking about this fic. So melancholy but beautiful.

  - D/o you remember when we were eleven?/ YES, I DO! So sad.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082][Tea and No Sympathy]] by Who_la_hoop : Groundhog day fic/Time Loop! Nice and long!
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/717901][Coffee, Cakes, and Doorknob Snakes]] by Omi_Ohmy: Love this fic! I always get a nice little chuckle when I re-read this fic. Cute and heartwarming.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/846857][Marathon]] by Lomonaaeran : Similar set up as Turn except with a recently divorced Harry.

*8th year Fics (all post war)*

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966][Azoth]] by Zeitgeistic : LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Funny (Hermione is hilarious and Portrait Snape), CLEVER! (The Magical Theory detail is out of this world---literally) and beautifully written. I almost want to re-read this right now! I just may....
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23243857][Nice Things]] by aideomai: This is my most recent Drarry bookmarked fic- I love it. I love how organic the relationship between Draco and Harry developed. I love a good clingy Harry story. It's quite beautiful and the writing is 5/5.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4223940][It Takes a Village]] by Saras_Girl: I enjoyed this. I don't remember it but I have it bookmarked so I must have loved it. I'll re-read it and make sure.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234222][Then Comes a Mist and a Weeping Rain]] by Faithwood : Love this writer- can't remember too much about this fic, but once again- I have it bookmarked. I just remember there being a cloud over Draco's head....literally.

I'm really particular about the Drarry that I like to read, so I hope you enjoy at least one or two of the fics that I've listed. :D

*** These are great recommendations!!!! Every one of them is amazing.

To add to this, I also highly recommend checking out [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things by lettered]], as one of the best of the ship. Amazingly written. It's about a potion's accident that leaves Harry as his ten-year-old self while Draco tries to solve the problem while keeping him safe.

** Quick aside, I recommend you follow the [[/r/Drarry][r/Drarry]] and [[/r/HPSlash][r/HPSlash]] subreddits to ask about more fics like this! These communities are amazing for finding great recommendations!
