I read a short story that I can't remember that touched on this idea and found it interesting but I haven't seen it explored elsewhere.

The basic idea is the fan theory that blood is used to sign contracts to make them binding combined with the fact that harry wrote I will not tell lies (or something similiar unsure if it's the exact wording) hundreds of times putting him under a contract to do just that.

Anyone have stories that touch on this idea or something simiar?

** I second this request - just without seeing the "I must not tell lies" as a contract (being unable to lie would be bad in Harry's situation - hell, it would be bad, period! Why? Because there's little lies and half-truths we tell each day, not to hurt people but to smooth stuff out!), but maybe the blood itself (or the quill's magic) did something to him...interesting premise!
