all the time authors use rape as a way to show that people are bad but even worse to the point that they use rape to show slytherin house as evil. Children raping woman to show their strength or superiority at age fifteen to seventeen is disgusting and even worse it often goes unpunished. The idea of seventh years raping muggleborns to put them in their place is terrifying and it really isn't needed at all. If you want to show someone as a horrific person and rape someone at least show how bad it really is and not just pass it off as another crime in a long list.

Yeah, definitely not a fan of the Slytherin rape house trope. Pretty much every time I run across it it's a set-up for Harry to save a Slytherin girl from it and I can't think of a single time that it's actually stopped by anyone, though I stop reading fics if they are full of awful tropes (haven't read a Sirius will reading in years now, don't even make it that far on those fics if I even open them up).

Actually rapists tend to target all sorts of /people/, and even among women victims there is a diverse range in targets, including literal children. And they're certainly not all "attractive".

And this is precisely why I asked if you actually /read/ the argument rather than dismissing it out of hand because it's by a feminist and you think feminists have cooties. Apart from a handful of asexual people, we /all/ experience sexual desire, but we don't all go around raping people, so it's blatantly obvious already that /attraction/desire aren't */the/* cause/ - unless you'd like to argue that you rape people.

"Rape is about power" isn't a statement that [most] rapists don't experience sexual attraction to their victims, it's a statement that the violation of consent - doing something /to/ someone whether they like it or not, rather than participating in an activity /with/ them - is the actual end goal and not merely the means. And that's what /all/ rapists share in common - the disregard for and desire to override a person's will (plenty of rapists rape as a punishment, for intimidation, in cases where the victim isn't even the gender the rapist is attracted to, etc)

Saying a bunch of words and calling it an argument doesn't mean you aren't making stuff up. If rape were about power or intimidation, try and explain why reality is the way it is. It makes sense if you think rape is about having sex. It doesn't make sense if you think it's about power.

Identifying the notion as coming from a "feminist" is useful information because the reader can understand it's not coming from somebody such as a social scientist, who might be attempting to make their statements correspond with reality. The notion here came from an activist.

Let's do a thought experiment.

I was rather gently trying to point out that the onus is on you to demonstrate that the general target of rape is /young */and/* attractive women/.

In short, "I think feminists and activists are inherently unreasonable and I assume everyone shares that bias". To be blunt once again: that is ad hominem that doesn't actually address the substance of the argument.

And yes, the vast majority of arguments are just "making stuff up". Pretty much all of philosophy is just "making stuff up". Bluntness again: you only scoff at the "made up stuff" that /you/ don't agree with.

#+end_quote

Wow, I actually refuse to believe that you are /this/ bad at missing the point.

Literally nobody has ever said rape is not an act of sex. The point is that the end goal is to have sex with someone /whether they also want to have sex with you or not/, and that you cannot actually divorce that "consent is optional" predicate from the act of sex in rape. You are the one pretending like "whether or not" automatically implies "or not". To put it in other words, people who do not enjoy having power over someone else /don't set out to drug them in the first place/. I don't know what confession you'd like to make here buddy but I and many, many people have never been so sexually aroused by someone that we thought "hey, I'm going to drug them and then use their near-unconscious body".

To draw a comparison to another crime, it is completely fair to say that theft/robbery is rooted in (varying levels of) disregard for the norms of ownership. Retorting with "oh yeah? well people steal money because they have an inherent desire for money!" betrays a certain childishness of thought, because we /all/ want/need money but people who are not thieves by and large regard /other people's money/ as off-limits. Stealing at least has the caveat that you genuinely can be so hungry/broke/etc that your actual life is in danger, but even in that case that's simply a threshold where perhaps the ultimate desire - preservation of self - overrides one's regard for the norms of ownership (and /even in that case/, many starve or suffer bankruptcy rather than steal). Rape on the other hand has no such caveat.

**** slytherins publicly express their pride/ dignity together with their cunning/ ambition by electing the biggest and meanest in their house to play quiditch and encourage them to play as violently as possible. Some examples of prominent slytherin plots: 1. Meet me in the trophy room at midnight, unless you're scared 2. Bet you're to chicken to fight me in front of Snape 3. Hey look, it's longbottom, let's hex him in the back.

As far as I can tell they're a bunch of brutish bullies, some of which like to tell themselves that they're special, pure, cunning or whatever.

Although it's an uncomfortable topic and most stories don't benefit from adding it, I don't find it hard to imagine that rape is an issue in wizarding Britain/ slytherin.

****** Maybe it's because I actually attended a boarding school, but I find the essentialism people try to ascribe to Hogwarts' Houses rather hilarious.

They're eleven year old kids when they are sorted and shockingly enough like most children their character development is heavily influenced by the people they have around them, not by the whimsies of a freaking /hat/ that meets them once for like two minutes or the desires of founders that lived over a millennium ago.

#+begin_quote
  But that is my point, most Gryffindors in the books are actually brave even if they have their faults, Ravenclaws are nowhere to be found so I suppose they actually read all the time, and most Puffs are being Puffs.
#+end_quote

In reality, most Gryffindors in the books don't actually exhibit any particular amount of /bravery/ (as opposed to hotheadness and childish stubbornness) besides the ones that are obviously major characters like Harry or Neville, and they do so because they're /major characters supposed to be advancing the plot/ not because of their house. On the other hand, the Goblet of Fire considers Cedric brave enough (amongst other qualities) to select him for a tournament with freaking dragons and whatnot. Luna is as "brave" as any Gryffindor in the Department of Mysteries. And so on.

Most Ravenclaws are not actually going around calculating the date of the heat death of the universe or whatever. The canonical character who's obsessed with books and reads all the time is /Hermione/ and she is, shockingly enough, in Gryffindor. How many times is Luna shown to be reading something that's not the Quibbler? Are books even mentioned in relation to Cho, compared to her Seeker position and relationship with Cedric? Speaking of, that's one bit of fanon that flat-out doesn't make any sense: the whole "Ravenclaws are so bookish and nerdy and don't like sports". News flash - they (like every other house) have a freaking Quidditch team that plays games and takes them seriously.

Most Hufflepuffs are not actually the fluffly balls of goodness and cheer that people seem to think they are. Tonks is a Hufflepuff but Rowling could have said "she was in Gryffindor" without changing a single thing about her characterisation. I've already talked about Cedric. Ernie is more pompous than anything else (although he mellows out). Zacharias Smith is an annoying twit more than anything else (and doesn't actually seem to show loyalty to anything at all, not even the DA he's a part of). Newt is also a canon Puff but again could as well have been in Gryffindor without changing a single thing about his canon characterisation.

Why then would you expect Slytherins to behave exactly like a Sorting Hat song?

#+end_quote

I find it really interesting that you think "third-world countries" don't have boarding schools, when actually whether a country has a boarding school culture or not is more a factor of if it was colonized by Britain or not than of its GDP or alliance in the Cold War. For what it's worth, I'm from the "poverty capital of the world" and that is where I went to boarding school, and I guarantee you that many of the people I know that went to a boarding school are far poorer/more of a "pleb" than you are.

And yes, what you are doing /is/ ascribing essentialism. "These are the qualities the Founders drafted for their Houses, therefore children sorted into those Houses should necessarily be showing those qualities" is essentialism.

#+begin_quote
  What, then, are we even discussing? The hat is a big deal in the book. It's, like, omnipotent or something.
#+end_quote

But it very blatantly isn't. It's a hat charmed to be capable of Legilimency and that is pretty much it, plus it can be flat-out wrong about people (I don't care how many pretzels people try to twist themselves in to explain it, Peter Pettigrew isn't "brave" by any stretch of the imagination). It gets about a minute to read the mind of an eleven-year-old child and decide where they would best fit based off that and that alone - the point is not that it's "stupid" and "hilarious", the point is that one minute of Legilimency on a prepubescent child (that's even subject to challenge by the children themselves - Harry made the Hat put him in not-Slytherin, and he'd hardly have been the first or only one in a millennium to do so) will obviously be outweighed by the actual environment they end up entering and the sheer fact that children simply grow and change.

The point is that pretty much nobody is that brave or loyal or brilliant or ambitious at age freaking eleven, and moreover it makes no sense for the population to be neatly divisible into four along those lines. What /does/ make sense is that those traits are supposed to be */nurtured/* by the staff and students in the house you're sorted into - this is backed by the Hat itself phrasing its sorting as "you'll do well in X", not "you /are/ X". It's made pretty clear by the narrative that Slytherin House had drifted away from whatever hotbed of cunning and ambition Salazar might have initially envisioned to focus almost exclusively on his pureblood ideology during the time period of the books. And that's what got nurtured /by the actual people in the house/ instead.

#+begin_quote
  why do the books even have it and give so much importance to it throughout the whole thing?
#+end_quote

I mean, Rowling pretty much spends seven books /deconstructing/ the idea of Sorting, not holding it up as a perfectly working prescriptivist system.

Also tbh she's not that great at thinking through the implications of the stuff she writes.

For someone getting so hot under the collar, you do seem completely incapable of grasping the fact that I was talking about my own personal reasons for not being a House essentialist. You can continue to get as offended as you like over whatever imagined slight you think was involved there, but that really is your personal problem and not my business.

#+begin_quote
  That is how it should be, because the books are basing a lot on the premise that the "a mad old hat sees your essence and groups you with a bunch of similar people so you can reach your potential" system is not just Dumbledore having a giggle, right?
#+end_quote

Imagine arguing so hard that you're not being essentialist and then turning around and literally saying, verbatim, that "That is how [things] should be". You've spent paragraphs and paragraphs of comments effectively saying that there is/should be some essence to each House that people sorted into them should necessarily demonstrate - why, exactly, are you so mad when I summarise that train of thought instead of writing it out verbatim every time?

And like...I'm sorry but you keep doing this "if it's not a 100% working system then it's for shits and giggles" which does make it hard to take you seriously. Like, this can't possibly be the first institution you've encountered that doesn't work the way it's intended to.

#+begin_quote
  "You will do well in X" does not mean "I randomly send you to that house so they can make you brave/loyal/intelligent/Satan wannabe,"
#+end_quote

But that is precisely what it will end up being - because, again, the population doesn't magically fall exactly into 25% brave, 25% loyal, 25% intelligent and 25% Satan wannabe as completely dominant traits, /especially at age eleven/. A system that actually worked the way you want it to would have like three each of Slytherins and Ravenclaws and maybe five Gryffindors if you squint, with literally everybody else in Hufflepuff for lack of where else to put them. But the Sorting Hat still makes its equal quotas, so obviously it's mostly bullshitting for some kids, or (if you want to be charitable) making a deliberate decision about which [weakly] present trait they have that it should emphasize. And it's very easy indeed to make a case in hindsight that X was the right choice all along when a child has spent their formative years growing in X.

Plus I am not sure why you keep insisting on the omnipotence of the Sorting Hat. It's literally just a Hat capable of Legilimency (into untrained eleven-year-old minds at that), where on god's green earth do you read omnipotency out of that? Is the Fat Lady omnipotent because she can talk?

#+begin_quote
  So, in that case, the sparks of Slytherin nature the hat saw in all those kids got stamped out by their changed house values the moment they stepped foot in the common room? All of them? Not one kid with some cunning/ambitious potential chose their own way?
#+end_quote

You can exaggerate all you like for snark, but obviously this is a process that occurs over /literal years/. Full grown ass /adults/ get radicalized all the time by the /internet/ - have you /met/ eleven year olds? Children around that age are literally the most impressionable little shits ever.

Plus there /are/ Slytherin children in the canon timeline that "chose their own way" (which I assume here means pursuing ambition or indulging their cunning or whatever). You're just choosing to ignore them to be facetious. Not to mention - /why/ would any actually precociously cunning and ambitious non-pureblood supremacist eleven-year-old attending Hogwarts in the 1990s /allow/ the Hat to place them in Slytherin?

#+begin_quote
  Somehow Gryffindors are adventurous rule-breaking little bastards from the get-go, they don't wait for Percy Weasley of all people to teach them ways. Somehow the un-Gryffindorish prefect and strict McGonagall don't manage to nurture their nature out of them. It's only Slytherins, the most impressionable bunch of all. Makes perfect sense.
#+end_quote

Did...did you even read the same books? /Did you even read the sentence you just wrote/? Is Percy Weasley not a Gryffindor? Is Minerva McGonagall not a Gryffindor - the literal Head of House even? If even /she/ is not an "adventurous rule-breaking little bastard" - how on earth are you complaining that only Slytherins don't match their house traits?

Plus like...even among the people in Harry's year, how is /Neville/ an adventurous rule-breaking little bastard to begin with? Almost as if he grew into one because of the friends he made in Gryffindor. How is Dean one? Or Lavender and Parvati? Almost as if the characters we see as adventurous and rule-breaking are so because they're the main characters and they need to move the plot along, or as if the vast majority of people aren't actually particularly brave or intelligent or cunning or /anything/ really beyond perfectly average plonkers. Or as if we mostly see Gryffindor's antics because Harry is in Gryffindor, which is exactly why I mentioned myself attending a boarding school at first - quite a lot of the shit we see them get up to is pretty bog-standard boarding house mischief, albeit with magic thrown into the mix.

Like have you /met/ people? Most of them aren't actually shit.

#+begin_quote
  If the sorting is nonsense, do we get at least a couple of Slytherins who managed to think with their own head and not allow themselves to be turned into every other guy from their House--the useless bullying brat? Please don't say Snape.
#+end_quote

In Snape's generation (and these are the characters that were relevant enough that their Sorting is known):

- Regulus Black
- Andromeda Black (literally married a Muggle-born)
- Dolores Umbridge (think with your own head doesn't mean /good person/, and Umbridge literally plays her way to a near untouchable position after Voldemort's return despite not having credentials worth shit)

We barely know the Sorting of most of the adult characters, even in the Order of the Phoenix. So really your whole gripe is with Slytherins who are literally still lunkhead kids Sorted at a time when the House had been completely overrun by pureblood supremacists.

  Have you read the outlander books? Is it as much rape in them as in the series?
#+end_quote

I've never seen the TV show, but there is plenty of rape and dub-con in the books.

First book: One of the earliest protagonist sex scenes is dub-con edging reeeeealy far over the line into spousal rape. The narrative paints it as non-rape because they both exhaust their anger in the process and end up loving eachother more afterward. Compared to most mass-market romance novels, I'd say it's... not terrible, but it's still pretty iffy.

Also in the first book, near the end one of the main protagonists gets raped and is left with crippling mental trauma. The process of healing from that trauma afterward is a major part of the plot. The pivotal moment in that healing process is another dub-con sex scene imposed on the victim.

Second book: I don't specifically recall any rape, though there probably is some off screen (so to speak). There's one traumatic scene of dub-con near the middle that has a major impact on the plot, and once again an eventual scene of Sexual Healing™ makes things all better.

Third book: There's one scene of coerced dub-con near the beginning. There may be other scenes with rapey vibes, but that's the only one I specifically recall.

Fourth book: A relative of the protagonists in the first two books gets raped and later decides to keep the baby. There's probably other scenes with rapey vibes, but that's the one that stands out most in my memory.

Fifth book: A protagonist gets captured and is repeatedly sexually assaulted before rescue comes.

Also of note: The portrayal of homosexuality is overwhelmingly negative in the first few books, with the only examples of gay men being a pedophile and a sadistic rapist. Later in the series the author writes some gay men who are good people, but I don't know if that about-face is really enough to make up for the earlier issues.

Rape is treated as quite casually by many characters in the story but it is made very clear that this is one of the things which is so fucked up about the world in which the story takes place and it is something which the main characters are fighting to stop.

some other non obvious examples are love potion stories, typically Molly and/or Ginny are potioning Harry to make him Gin's boyfriend and He eventually finds out and gets angry at the Weasley family - any intercourse under such circumstances is definitely rape.

#+begin_quote
  The logic behind rape being qualitatively different from other crimes runs something like this.

  We have created a hierarchy of evil, based on what does greater or lesser damage to the social contract but mitigated by necessity. Killing another human is the most destructive and in pretty much every society therefore punished the most harshly. But it is possible that killing another human being can be forgiven from need; self-defense or the defense of others. Even the violent suppression of a rebellion or the killing of an insolent underling by a leader can be construed as attempts to preserve the existing social contract.

  People may:

  - steal to feed themselves or their families.
  - torture others to obtain information which can save thousands (although this one is a very dubious and questionable justification at best).
  - kill someone in self-defense, to preserve their own life.

  These are all actions which are normally punished if performed for their own sake, but which may be treated less harshly if performed "for the right reasons"---personal survival, the survival of another, or the survival of the group. Constructing a situation in which rape becomes necessary for personal survival, the survival of another, or the survival of the group is extremely difficult, if not impossible.

  It is in the top tier of the hierarchy of wrongs, because of its ability to have permanent effects on the victim and those around the victim, along with torture and murder. That also means that any attempt to justify it instantly begs the question of why the use of the other two, particularly torture since both leave the victim alive, wasn't a relatively superior solution. Also unlike torture or murder, it has the possibility to actually create an additional victim(s) of the crime (a female victim being unwillingly impregnated, especially if getting an abortion isn't easy for her).

What TVTropes doesn't mention is the psychological impact. Yes, being tortured is a horrific experience, but at least what your body is telling you matches up to what's being done. With rape, it /doesn't/ - it has the exact same purpose as cold-blooded torture (putting someone underfoot) but some part of the victim has no choice but to feel unwanted /pleasure/ in that moment. That's a /horrific/ mental violation with potentially longer-lasting effects than any amount of pain.

TL;DR From a societal standpoint, murder and torture could /in theory/ be justified (murder in self-defense, torture in the pursuit of life-saving information). There is no such mitigating cause for rape, and any attempt to do so would only beg the question of "why not just torture them?" - especially in the Wizarding World, where curses exist /specifically/ for the purpose of making torture easier. All of that makes it /very/ easy to see rape as the worst deed possible.

There are many historical examples of justifications for rape. To give one example, my history professor explained how Greek colonisation worked. A few hundred Greek men would get on a few boats, sail somewhere and start building a city. As for why they took no women with them? You could always find some "barbarians" (anyone not greek) and worst case, you forced them to have your children. It was systematic rape common throughout basically every Greek city.

The rape of the Sabine women would be another example of this form of "growth".

By modern standards, it is deplorable behaviour. But it used to be quite common, even amongst "civilised" people.

To put it in baser terms; Sexual crimes only have more power insofar as we give them significance. It IS because we worship the sanctity of our sexual places that society so demonizes rape. In human history rape was seen as much more peaceful action that maiming and especially murder and woman were much less adversely affected by it than now. Rape (and the servitude of women in general) was societally accepted at certain times (war, conquering, payment).

Clearly there is a huge society influence on how we view rape and how victims are affected - this is something we can change if we wish. And why wouldnt we wish it? Why give rape more power over us than it needs, when we have shown time and time again that positive thinking does improve our capacity to resist and recover from evils?

It's not about the damage to the body. It's

1) the mental damage like other torture. The loss of control the being at someone's mercy. 2) it's turning someone's body against them (the vigina that you are so obsessed will orgasm from physical contact wanted or not). Rape victims often feel betrayed and disgusted by their bodies bc they frozen in fear or their body orgasmed. 3) and it has no reason outside of someone being a rapist. If a bad guy needs info from someone he will do the bad guy thing and torture or kill to get it. Torture has a purpose to the bad guy - he can't kill the person with the info but he must give them reason to give it up. But choosing rape over torture is just because someones a rapist. Bad guys can kill and torture without enjoying it.

You can compare rape to the imperious curse, and it's close especially with the discribed floating happy feeling discribed in the books.

But no getting beat isn't worse than being raped. If given the choice I would much rather be shot or stabbed or beaten then raped.

The second doesn't seem to be that much more common than its use in media as a whole, maybe even a bit less common (since HP is a bit less dark than some media). True, in fanfiction it tends to be more hamfisted or under thought out, but that is sort of the nature of fanfiction....

You can't have it slice both ways. If it isn't a big deal, then it isn't needed and is just a lazy writing.

I personally feel one of the reasons for its prevalence is that most male writers only know that rape is bad but they've never been associated with the lifelong trauma that results from it. So it became a trope (and a very lazy one at that) because it was already used so much in fiction. It became shorthand to introduce both an evil character and a character with some nebulous trauma in the background. So thus you get legions of readers and writers that only know rape as this hazy bad thing that allows you to get tons of information conveyed without ever fully understanding /why/ rape is such a big deal.

As an example, mass murder and torture I rarely see used in a "cheap" way. When they happen, authors will take the time to talk about the consequences. The Longbottoms were tortured into insanity, so Neville grew up with no parents. Voldemort's a mass murderer, so he must be stopped. When they're brought up, it's because they matter to the story. Rape, on the other hand, is often just used as a prop, having little importance to the story outside of one or two scenes. This sort of writing is upsetting not because it contains terrible things, but because it contains terrible things treated as if they're really nbd.

** Considering Voldemort's hunger for power, it would not surprise me to have committed rape too.

** Maybe this is mind blowing but.... RAPE IS NOT PLEASURABLE. I've seen plenty of rape in fanfics that went well with the story and tons that haven't. Don't read the story of you don't like it or skip that part. The only ones I've read that I didn't feel comfortable with it were the abused Harry stories. The Dudley's sucked but they weren't that awful. Plus the stories usually do an awful job reflecting behavior of people who actually go through it.

With these stories I either dropped it or just keep reading. It's not the authors job to change the story to for your needs. 1. Tom riddles mom 2. Umbridge in the forbidden first

** While using rape for cheap angst and turning someone insta-evil isn't good writing, we have to remember that these are amateur "writers". Many professional writers have trouble doing this topic justice.

I think the glamorizing of Draco, Snape and Voldemort is way worse than casual use of rape. At least in the latter, most of the time the author is aware that rape is bad.
