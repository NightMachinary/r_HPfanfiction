Hi!

I'm looking for the best Harry-centric stuff out there!

I am fine with WBWL, Lord Harry, Azkaban, or any cliches.

Please no Slash. No hate, I just prefer non Slash stories.

Also, please no Hinny!

#+begin_quote
  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.

**** üî•üî•‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è1) The Eyes ¬ª Harry Potter saw things. Many things didn't gaze back. Harry Potter heard things. Many things didn't listen back. Five pitiful senses were not enough to gaze into the deep abyss, but with magic being magic a sixth sense is more than enough to see what humans were never meant to see. (Gen) (finished) Excerpt from the story:

The old man frowned. "My child?"

"They do not blink," Harry continued. "They do not breathe, drink, eat, properly talk or walk. They walk, but not well enough. They are not real. They are more than real. I see them," he whispered. "I see their shadows at night dance under the pale light of death's candle, and I'm afraid. Afraid..."

üî•üî•üî•üî•2) Blood Crest ¬ª Nine-year-old Harry accidentally apprentices himself to a necromancer. Things go downhill from there. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings. (WIP)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10629488/1/Blood-Crest]]

üî•üî•üî•3) Had I Known ¬ª After killing Voldemort during seventh year, Harry vanished without a trace. But now, 8 years later, a deadly secret forces him to return and it seems that only Snape will be able to save him. Snape Harry eventual friendship no slash. Deals with themes of ptsd (finished)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2544950/1/Had-I-Known]]

üî•üî•üî•4) Quo Vadis? by Ruskbyte (One shot very well written) (gen) (finished)

Summary: It is the greatest threat the world of magic has ever faced. It cannot be reasoned with. It cannot be bargained with. It cannot be hexed. It cannot be cursed. It cannot be stopped. It cannot be killed. And only Lord Voldemort stands in its way.

Excerpt from story: "No. Don't worry; we won't insult the clich√© of hero versus villain by ignoring your offers of power, glory and material wealth," said Potter as they approached. "So... please, begin tempting us."

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5614134/1/Quo-Vadis]]

üî•üî•5) The Sum of Their Parts by holdmybeer

The Sum of Their Parts ¬ª For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone. (Gen) (finished)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts]]

6) Albus and Harry's World Trip ¬ª After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information (Gen) (Wip) (comedic elements)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13388022/1/Albus-and-Harry-s-World-Trip]]

üî•üî•üî•7) Elizium for the Sleepless Souls ¬ª The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems. (Gen, Finished)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7713063/1/Elizium-for-the-Sleepless-Souls]]

üî•8) The Unforgiving Minute ¬ª Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6256154/1/The-Unforgiving-Minute]]

üî•9) Countdown Harry is alone. He has a bloody score to settle. And it is the day before the end of the world (oneshot)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5090849/1/Countdown]]

10) An Aunt's Love ¬ª Harry comes home from school and Petunia is upset at the change in her nephew. Petunia decides to do what she should have been doing all along. Dumbledore had better stay away. Petunia Dursley is upset. Warnings on profile

Very Harry-centric OP but generally well written and fun story

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2196609/1/An-Aunt-s-Love]]

11) Stinging Nettle and Milking Pails Oceanbreeze7

Summary: Are you a witch or Are you a fairy? Or are you the wife of Michael Cleary? ‚ÄúThe fairies will do wicked things sometimes,‚Äù Harry murmured gently, ‚ÄúSteal the milk when they get a chance, or skim the cream off the milk crocks.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo they ever steal anything more?‚Äù Luna asked him rhetorically. Harry couldn't answer.

Wrong boy who lived/ dark/ oneshot

12) Make A Wish ¬ª Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live. (Finished) (gen) (comedy)

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]

13) Quoth the Raven, Nevermore ¬ª The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU veeeeery slight hhr

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6652537/1/Quoth-the-Raven-Nevermore]]

14) Harry Potter: Master of Malicious Compliance Watermelonsmellinfellon (long oneshot)

Summary: Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21949021?view_adult=true]]

üî•üî•üî•15) Made of Common Clay Lomonaaeren Summary: Harry has reached a very bitter and jaded thirty. His efforts to reform the Ministry haven't lessened the corruption or pure-blood bigotry one bit. That's when he finds out that he's apparently a part of a pure-blood nobility he's never heard of before; he's Lord Potter and Lord Black. Unfortunately, that revelation's come too late for him to be a reformer. All Harry wants to do is tear the system down and salt the earth. And with a double Lordship, he just might have the power to do that. (Gen) very well written

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11699844/chapters/26343573]]

All of these stories are gen well written not an overdone trope of the dark lord potter stories. I would especially recommend bloodcrest for the world building and The eyes Though I think you'll enjoy ‚Äúmade of common clay‚Äù the most
