** /Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water/, linkffn(12076771): the pairing is similar with the canon Trio in a romantic relationship; the background story is similar as the Trio fought a brutal guerrilla war against the Death Eaters. However, the main story is about zombie battleship BismarckMort attacking Britain. Fortunately, HMS Hood also returned to face her nemesis one more time. Excellent fleet actions.

#+begin_quote
  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

** In what way? If you want a Harry that isn't 'evil' but just really motivated and unconcerned with morals, then The Birth of Evil [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil]] is probably good.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
