The man they met at dinner that evening, is a Wizard, an escaped Fugitive hiding in plain sight under a glamour as Marge Dursley's fiancé , who has a remarkable Understanding of the canine species.

Sirius can't stand his would be bride but he had run out of options with the Ministry closing in on him, the night he met her, he needed a place to hide Where no wizard would look, the horrible woman's farm in Wales was perfect if a bit overrun by sheep and Poorly socialized bulldogs .

So far he had managed to dodge her advances but he hadn't managed to avoid meeting her Equally detestable brother.

He nearly Fell to his knees and thanked Merlin when he was introduced to Marge's family , and He came face to face with his godson.


** Imagine if Harry finds out he's a wizard...

"There's this potion called the Draught of Living Death. Couldn't we adjust the recipe until it puts you in a coma instead of a near-dead state?" Harry asked his new Uncle Godfather.

"And we can fake bad seafood!" exclaimed Sirius.

*One month later...*

Dumbledore appeared at the door looking fairly rumpled, he hasn't slept in days while he was trying to uncover why the Dursleys are in a coma and having to obliviate as necessary. While out of breath, he demanded to talk to Harry's new Uncle. "Petunia will have to stay here. In the house. And you'll have to take care of Harry. When he isn't in school. What was your name again?"

"Issac Clarence Weiner. No, that isn't a joke. I have family across the pond, my cousin is a television reporter. I wouldn't mind looking after my nephew." Sirius replied.

*Later...*

"I can't believe that actually worked..."

"I C Weiner? Really?"

** I'm thinking that maybe Marge has some sort of magic-repelling Aura (like the step-father in Percy Jackson). And that Sirius seeks her out (and maybe confounds her a little) to convince her that they had this past and to "marry" him. which will give him protection from magical tracking/sources. And then when he has to meet her family, there's Harry.

** Is it bad that I actually felt sorry for Aunt Marge? As horrible a person as she may be, it's heartbreaking to find out the man you're in love with and want to spend the rest of your life with hates your fucking guts and is only pretending to love you.

Okay, so maybe I'm just projecting, lol.

But if anyone's interested, I know a fic where Aunt Marge actually marries a wizard (well, eventually). It's not quite the same as your prompt since the wizard is actually in love with her and she knows he's a wizard. linkffn(5358187)

*** While I loathe the cannon character, I recall a story where she winds up taking custody of both Harry and Dudley while Vernon and Petunia are arrested for child abuse, where she discovers what the kids are really like. She winds up despising Dudley. And while the truth of it is ambiguous at best, it shifts most of the blame for the abuse on petunia, with harry going along with it because he actually likes Marge. Also a vague memory of one of Marge's neighbors being a squib as well as a friend of her father's who leaks a lot of the details to the wizarding world.

As I recall, Marge was aghast when she saw Dudley kick a puppy and Harry took the blow instead.

******** They've had 16 years to get those 579 stories, but that's still just under one new story every 10 Days, and that's just to get the story count right. While not all that many of their fic's have multiple chapters, some of them do. Some are fairly respectable, in the ten to twenty chapter range...

I'm going to go with No. They never sleep.
