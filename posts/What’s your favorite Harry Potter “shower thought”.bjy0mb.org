** It's been a while since I've read the series, but the way Remus was written compared to every other adult always struck me as odd. He had a tiredness about him that went beyond Dumbledore's years of experience, far past Snape's long and silent suffering. It's like out of everyone, Remus carried the weight of Lily and James' loss with him as though it were still fresh and raw, even compared to Sirius.

*** This is interesting. It does seem that he couldn't accept their deaths, given how reluctant he was to talk about James and Sirius. But it might be that in PoA,at least, everything seemed very fresh to him because Sirius escaped and this sort of brought everything back. I was always rather surprised that 12 years weren't enough for him to resign himself to the fact he had to move on. But then, I've seen documentaries of the wwII and people they interview still cry when talking about it. I think that loss doesn't seem to be so painful to Remus in OOTP. Though many fanfic authors would disagree. But I think learning the truth helped him somewhat. At least his overall state seems to be influenced by other things later on. I don't know if this was what you meant but I think I understand where you are coming from because I got the same impression. Besides, Remus is known for feeling guilty about many things, this maybe was also one of them- he should have seen that Sirius was evil from the start and so on.

**** Thank you for expanding on what I was trying to say! I think guilt had a HUGE part to play in how I viewed Remus-- Dumbledore was always too focused on the end result to truly exhibit guilt (the goblet drinking scene in the cave was the most vulnerable I remember him being). Snape's guilt was purely based in selfishness (accidentally betrayed Lily, tried to save her by doubl-crossing Voldie, and she still died). Sirius had moved past his guilt (from suggesting that the Potters use Peter as a secret keeper instead of Sirius) by the time we "met" him, and was all rage.

What got to me, even after Remus' guilt over the death of his friends had been alleviated, he still carried a form of guilt with him-- the fact that he was a werewolf. That guilt was only somewhat lifted (in a way that the audience could see) when Tonks got pregnant. And even then... he was always so stoic and serious, because y'know.. war.

I loved the flashback (book) scenes, because you got a glimpse at the old Remus-- still stoic and responsible, but before those decades of life beat him down. His was the most polarizing comparison for me.

***** Thanks for explaining about the way other characters show guilt- I never gave much thought to this. Remus is known for his guilt complex. His serious personality isn't so well-liked for some reason. I have no idea why, because I just love serious people! I think even adult Remus still had his sense of humour. That boggart scene or the one with peeves proves it. There's also the fact that Remus's funny side is somewhat wry. He says he isn't a popular guest with most of the community and that it's an occupational hazard of being a werewolf. When he sees Peter in the shack, he says,'hello, Peter. Long time, no see.' Sorry, it's just that Remus is my favourite character. I just sometimes wish I had analysed him as much as other people have. And your post just reminded me of all those times people called him pathetic. It irritates me when people expect fictional characters to be strong and funny all the time. End of rant.

****** Rant away! I absolutely see where you're coming from. Remus did have a very dry, wry, underhanded sense of humor... but it was almost always self-deprecating (not a bad thing, but telling). I never saw him as being pathetic, though! Did I feel sad for him? Of course! But there's a BIG difference between feeling sad and feeling sorry for somebody.

Remus, as written in the books (I'm not really going into movie stuff with my opinions, cause I'm a bit of a book purist üòí), has been dealt the worst hand short of death by the time we meet him. He's disheveled and homeless in appearance, sleeping in a student car on the student train... but then he immediately shows how capable and intelligent he is, and suddenly the readers forget that he looks like a roadside bum. His personality, demeanor, and character demand respect.

If anyone calls that pathetic, they can suck on a slug hex.

******* lol suck on a slug hex. And you did say I could rant. What I meant was that they seem to think that Remus didn't handle things the way he should/they wanted him to. He must have been depressed after his friends died, didn't contact Harry, then didn't tell Dumbledore about Sirius and so on. I certainly won't argue about that part in PoA. But it sometimes seems they expect him to have started a werewolf revolt, to have invented wolfsbane by the time we meet him and it's a bit frustrating. to me because I think he really managed quite well considering he might have become bitter towards the rest of the society. He is actually the one everyone turns to for comfort- he comforts Molly twice, then after Bill is savaged by Greyback, Remus is the one with all the answers and he tries to convince Hermione it wasn't her fault Snape joined the battle. Everyone goes on about wanting realistic characters, but once they get characters who have actual flaws and issues, they aren't happy with it. Even if I sometimes want to tell him he maybe should talk to a psychologist but that's more out of sympathy.But I've seen only stoplightdelight or fernwithy actually trying to show how Remus thinks and that he has a lot of good traits.

** The wizarding world must have developed it's own unique accent, something that goes beyond dropping uniquely muggle turns of phrase, something that goes beyond saying things like, "Hold your hypogriffs!" Something in the cadence, something in the way they pronounce certain consonents or certain vowels, is unique to them, and if a muggle linguist studied this accent, it would be clear to the linguist that they are hearing an accent that was previously unknown to the world of muggle British linguists. Hogwarts has been gathering all these students from all across the British Isles, and even from other countries, and keeping these students somewhat isolated in the castle, for their entire school career, for hundreds of years. And then some of those students go on to become professors themselves, teaching a new generation. No doubt all these disparate accents from all these students from all these different places eventually got melded together into something that is unique to Hogwarts. And the accent wouldn't develope along any muggle lines, either. Being inside the wizarding world adds another layer of isolation from muggle speech, which means that a researcher would be hard pressed to identify which modern muggle accents bear a close relationship with the Hogwarts accent.

**** In my fic this is actually a fairly large plot point, all of wizarding westerm europe uses a standardized "magical" dialect of Classical Latin as a lingua franca to combat this exact issue. Muggleborns can learn it through a language potion (you can only take one every five years though).

Political organizations are largely categorized based on what lingua franca they use in their communities, which I've largely based on the dominant cultures around the time of my implementation of the statute of secrecy. For example, Eastern Europe was firmly Byzantine/Greek/Eastern Roman around that time, so their lingua franca is a magical dialect of Koine Greek. East Asia uses Middle Chinese, South Asia uses Sanskrit, West Asia uses Arabic.

Interestingly, because European wizards brought the idea of the statute with them to the Americas, the situation is a bit different there. North America, as you'd expect, speaks a magical dialect of Latin, just like the colonial wizards. However, because of the incredible amount of intermixing in central and southern America, Quechua and Nahuatl (languages of the Inca and Aztec) are the lingua francas of south and central america/mexico, respectivley. This isn't actually as unlikely as you'd think, it happened irl with Guaran√≠, an indigenous language and the lingua franca of modern Paraguay. In my mind, magic evening the playing field between the colonizers and natives makes a universal adoption much more likely among the centralized empires of the south and central americas, while the disparate and factional nature of Northern American geopolitics let the colonizers take over completely. Add that to the real-world reason for the disparities in assimilation of native traditions (English vs. Spanish colonial practices), and you have a definite split.

Would a grade school student who grew up with Yam-Yam need tutoring to comprehend teachers and classmates from suburban Surrey?

Hermione doesn't seem to have other female friends at all, and Ginny appears to be the only one we know from the Books. In HBP especially, Hermione knows lots of inside dopes between Ginny and Dean, and she actively ships Ginny with Harry:

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her.

  After several long moments --- or it might have been half an hour --- or possibly several sunlit days --- they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny's head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well --- if you must.

***** Fr. Maybe its been a while since ive read the books and ive just watched the movies too much, but Harry has some type of deep friendship with Luna. I think its cause of their Myers Briggs types. Luna is one of the few people at Hogwarts who understands anything about Harry. Its not romantic, but she looks through him like an X-ray and sees into his thoughts sometimes.

Hermione just gets on him about needing to do his laundry or something. Unless its book 1, where they have a moment at the end and she says "I think you're a great wizard harry."

In a really chill, no stakes setting like a reunion or something, 19 years later if they played truth or dare and asked Harry "who's your favorite, Mione or Luna?" Hed smirk for a second and have to say "Luna." Hed probably get punched in the arm for it, but I think it's the truth. That's just my HC though, other people ship hermione and harry and I totally get that too.

  Angry yells were filling the stadium. The crowd didn't want the veela to go. Harry was with them; he would, of course, be supporting Bulgaria, and he wondered vaguely why he had a large green shamrock pinned to his chest. Ron, meanwhile, was absent-mindedly shredding the shamrocks on his hat. Mr. Weasley, smiling slightly, leaned over to Ron and tugged the hat out of his hands.‚Äù

******* I... just don't know if I can agree with that, is all. I mean, it's a valid interpretation, but of the multiple times her allure is mentioned throughout that book, not a single female is described as being seduced. Only men seem to have been entranced at the cup. Harry notices only men following Fleur around. Only men who ask her to the dance.

You could say Harry is an unreliable narrator and, well, he is. But of all the male attention he notices she gathers, he never notices any females. What's more, he never overhears anyone talking about a female being taken in by the allure. Which would, you know, by kind of big gossip, you'd think.

Honestly, the idea that lesbian/bisexual women /would/ be attracted to Fleur totally makes sense but, honestly, I think it's just a scenario where JKR just wasn't thinking about females. She made a character who would make men drool and that's as far as the thought train went.

******** I think you're overestimating the effect of Fleur's "allure" on people, the amount of lesbians there would be at Hogwarts, the amount of boys entranced by her, and how many times Harry sees what you're describing.

Boys don't trail after her, drooling and unable to control themselves. And of those who are affected, it's really not that many. How many times do we actually see it happen? Not even a dozen times, I don't think. And of those times, how many boys /aren't/ affected?

So even if we give Hogwarts a generous fifty lesbians or bisexual girls, we should take out a good portion of those who won't even be affected by Fleur. And then note that most of those who would be affected wouldn't be so affected as to catch Harry's attention. At most, they'd just stare.

And then, even if there's a few left who would be deeply affected, who would ask Fleur out to the dance, who would be so obvious that not even Harry would miss it, then Harry would also have to be there at the exact moment it happens. And given that only a very few instances are described to us in the first place, it seems unlikely.

I mean, I agree that JKR probably wasn't thinking about women at the time, but it's not at all unlikely that Harry just didn't notice it. We're talking about a muggle-raised teenage boy living in the 90s, after all, whose only experience with homosexuality was likely just Vernon ranting about it. He'd probably have to be smacked across the face with it to see it.

It gets recommended all the time but linkffn(The Arithmancer) and it's sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes) are both really in depth about how arithmancy is used in the construction of spells, and the author tries to root stuff in real mathmatical concepts.

Another popular one, the linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series has a lot of magic exploration nestled in-between a lot of tropes that some people don't like, but the writing itself is good and I personally don't mind it at all.

** All of Trelawney's prophecies actually coming true in non-standard ways is probably my favourite. Related: Lavender's beloved pet being savaged by a fox as foreshadowing for Lavender herself being savaged by Greyback.

Dumbledore or Hogwarts repeatedly sending Tom Riddle back to an orphanage during the Blitz of London is another. No wonder he developed a hatred for muggles /and/ a desire to destroy the status quo of wizarding society, being so up close and personal with the horrors of war while being in a situation where he was made legally powerless /despite/ his heritage that should afford him protection, power, and perhaps even luxury. And that being enforced on him by wizards and witches in loco parentis and a position of influence and guidance over the young people in their care, who portrayed themselves throughout as benevolent and this as not a real problem.

Additionally, because its treated very casually in the books and iirc never referenced, I've always headcanoned that race and ethnicity aren't points of division in the wizarding world as they are for muggles.

** I'm always befuddled of how the fuck Remus didn't step in and take more of a part of Harry's life from the beginning. Like seriously, Remus is basically honorary godfather. His two best friends (James and Lily) get murdered, Harry is orphaned, real godfather (Sirius) is rumoured to have killed them and 4th best friend (Peter). Suddenly Dumbledore gets to call all the shots and sticks him with muggles that Remus perfectly knows being Lily's friend for 10 years- her sisters a bitch who hates magic. Seriously? No contact for 12 years and then it's only a couple of times in third year he deems to have a conversation with the boy before the truth comes out?

I mean like okay I get it, Remus lost all of his friends and family and yeah it sucks being a werewolf and unemployed constantly. But like come on dude, grow sone balls and put aside your self deprecating persona for the kid for a few visits. Maybe would have noticed malnutrition and abuse?? Maybe??

I've heard theories that Dumbledore made him promise to never reach out for fear of screwing with the blood protections or something, and not talking about his parents and reaching out as a teacher, but I still feel that something more should've been done on Remus's part. Just another case of adults being neglectful and stupid.

*Oh everyone thought Remus was the traitor so they pushed him away and he felt bad for not being there? Well it being Sirius (actually being Peter) kind of immediately fixed that, you can absolve yourself of blame Remus effing Lupin.

I LOVE Remus as a character- especially imagining him in his prime in the Marauder Era at school. but did he did a great disservice for his best friends he claimed to owe his life to. I can imagine Sirius getting settled after escaping Azkaban, sitting down with him and being like ‚ÄúTell me about Harry‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat have you been doing all this time mate?‚Äù and just not having the right answers...

This is more of a Harry Potter shower rant.... of which there are many. Stay tuned for why Hermione and Ron would've made a horrible married couple and JK Rowling buying into ‚Äúthe guy who pulls your ponytails and is mean does it cause he likes you‚Äù and ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù cliche and causing unintentional damage to the minds of young girls who believe it and get themselves trapped into the cycle of abuse, however minor it might be.

Oh and Harry and Ginny was a horrible choice too. Wizards just get married too young man.

** That, as well as being a story about the power of love, the HP series represents really well the process of making child soldiers.

A boy is told he's special, that the enemy he has no knowledge of has committed great crimes against him and others, and, while very young, faces escalating illegal commitments to oppose this great evil.

An authority figure (Dumbledore) could be seen to have shown great willingness to use school children / the very recently graduated to oppose the evil.

I'd like to see an HP parallel story set in DRC / Rwanda / Serbia without magic.

With only a limited number of teachers, Hogwarts must have a lot of free time. (Then I realized that I'm basing it in Asian standard where everything is packed together that it might be like that for Western style of school)
