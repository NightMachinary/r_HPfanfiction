Title: out beyond our mistakes

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/26465395/chapters/64486588]])

Summary: Pansy Parkinson is sentenced to one year of community service with a charity of her choice along with a donation of 10,000 galleons to the 'Ministry Recovery Fund'. Harry Potter, ex - Auror, is disillusioned with a government bent on making him a mouthpiece while disregarding his suggestions for real, concrete progress.

When Pansy chooses the newly-registered 'The Moony Project' to work for, she never expects the reclusive Boy-Who-Lived to be the non-profit's chairman. Worse, he is hell-bent on doing his best to make her resign.


** What exactly does she get sentenced for? Unless there was a law about "decomposition of military force" or the like (and it would be highly dubious that such a law would apply to a paramilitary resistance group anyway), there is nothing you can realistically charge her for without rolling out the chopping block for half of the Ministry. Or did you invent some transgression to get her sentenced?
