So let me start off with I know this has been searched before. I have done the search. I only say because most reference a single thread from over a year ago.

Anyways I actually just watched groundhogs day with my family tonight and realized I hadn't seen a fic in a while. I am curious as to what fics people know of. I don't mind if they're not HP of all that great. I'm just curious what all is out there. I've read the ones in the other thread I found and I'm curious as to what else there is.


** Doesn't reset each day, but each death. Similar concept.

  The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. slytherin!harry, dark!harry, eventual slash, lv/hp

My own review is [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=905354&postcount=539][here]]. To quote parts of it:

#+begin_quote
  The short of it: It's good, fun, and rather interesting. It's really enjoyable having our knowledge of the world slowly built up as the protagonist learns more and more about the world he lives in, and doubly enjoyable to watch the mystery of the circumstances around the time loop slowly unfold.

  ... it's the kind of story that sucks you in and makes you neglect the rest of your life until you've finished reading.

** Not sure if this was mentioned in the other thread, but I enjoyed "Getting the Hang of Thursdays" by Hayseed. It features Snape and Hermione but I'm pretty sure there's nothing sexual between them in the fic.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501&i=1]]

Opening paragraph; {Really, Severus should have seen it coming. His day had been far too uneventful -- not a single accident in his morning classes, not one inane comment from any of the staff at luncheon. He hadn't even given a single detention.

And now, his seventh year NEWT class. All in all, he was both surprised and resigned when it happened. While many of the tensions between the seventh year students had eased through the years, a classroom that contained both Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter was simply doomed to eventual conflict.

When Severus had initially looked at his NEWT roster, he'd toyed with the idea of assigned seating. Potter and Malfoy on opposite sides of the room, a handful of Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws between them. But he only had a dozen seventh years in his course this term, and it would be suspicious to treat such a small number that way. He'd simply sighed and known that it was going to be a long year. The numbers hadn't even been terribly split -- three from both Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, four Ravenclaws, and two Slytherins.

Unfortunately, with Potter and Malfoy in the same class, it wouldn't have mattered if they were the only people in the room. Disaster was only a hair-trigger away. }
