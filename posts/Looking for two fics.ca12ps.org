*** That's it! What's sad is that the fic was already in my queue to read, I just didn't remember reading it at all. Thanks!

** First one is definitely Fleur. He finds a mask and robes if I remember correctly. He was doing it to protect his family.

** The second fic u described sounds to me like Be the Death of me by Hweianime? Harry does keep the dragon figure and its quite a reoccurring thing. The only other ive seen where he keeps it is in The Inner Eye by jbern, where harry keeps it for just a while and frequently uses it as a weapon.
