This isnt like a shaming people for not liking slash. I know alot of people have a self insert aspect to romance. So if you arent gay slash isnt appealing.

I can get that theoretically. Im more focused on like character dynamics and story telling and self insert in romance on its own is honestly a pretty big turn off for me personally so gender dynamics ( aka if its m/m or f/f or m/f ) dont make a difference to me.

But I do understand the appeal of that aspect and I can see why slash wouldnt be appealing to people who like romance for different reasons than I do.

But somewhat recently I read a comment talking about slash which i sadly lost, it said something along the lines of I have no problems with m/m in stories but i dont like slash. Which was confusing since I assumed any guy on guy romance was slash. Am i missing something? Are there other connations to slash apart from it being a gay relationship?

So if you don't like slash why not? Is it just guy on guy romance is something you aren't interested in? Or something else? Also to people who dont like slash does this extend to femslash?


** For one its simply that I‘m straight, so when I read romance slashfics will hardly be my first choice.

More important though is that in HP fanfiction male slash will be either Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape or Harry/Tom. I don‘t like Draco as a character so thats out and the other two are just gross considering canon behavior and more important age. I dont like those three in nonslash romance either, anyhow.

*** I don't find many male characters in the HP universe interesting. There's Harry, and that's it in his age group. So slash is not really an option. Everyone else is either boring or has been ruined by the fanon for me (eg Neville). James, Sirius, Moody and Grindelwald aren't what I would consider shipping material and Edward Tonks is interesting for his chosen partner (Andromeda) and their dynamic, which prevents other romances.

And Grindelwald is only interesting for his potential as either an antagonist or a Vader-esque fallen hero (that plot requires Gellert/Arianna and one-sided Albus/Gellert though, and Gellert blaming Dumbledore for her death before he descends into madness driven by grief and a desire for vengeance).

***** Daphne and Luna are the only ones I'd consider ruined by fanon, Susan Bones is reduced to a plot device to get her aunt involved, maybe the perfect depictions of Ginny and Hermione.

You are left with a large selection of female characters to whom Harry has some kind of connection to choose from, be it Lavender Brown (her loving nature would proably be heaven to Harry), Padma Patil ("sorry for the Yule Ball set-up with Ron") or Katie Bell (team mate). And that's not even considering the complete name-onlys, like Lisa Turpin or Tracy Davis.

****** Well, I would certainly not characterize Lavender as "loving". At least certainly not before "clingy", which is something I don't see Harry enjoying. I certainly agree with you on Katie Bell and have been hoping for more with her for years.

As far as males ruined by fanon, I would say only Draco and Ron are ruined by fanon, though Neville fanon characterization is all over the place so he could be a bit ruined for some people. And I think Ron is characterized fine in fics that aren't Ron-bashing, just like Ginny and Hermione are usually characterized fine in fics that don't treat them as flawless.

However, Dean, Seamus, Cedric, Oliver, Fred, George, Lee, and Roger Davies are all valid options for Harry. Some, like Oliver, Cedric, and Roger are best suited for after-Hogwarts fics, though I see plenty of during-Howarts Harry/Tonks fics... Not to mention the name-onlys (or sparingly characterized) like Anthony, Terry, Michael, and Wayne Hopkins.

******** I don't understand why you are giving Lavender a pass for her age-16 behavior but are not willing to give Seamus a pass for his age-15 behavior and Dean for his age-16 behavior. Both of them also fought in the Battle of Hogwarts and may have done some maturing then. Plus Dean had to live on the run for a while, which tends to mature you if you want to survive.

I don't see how what Fred, George, and Lee did was any worse than what Hermione did than what she and Harry and Ron did to Crabbe and Goyle in CoS with the Polyjuice Potion. Or how Hermione seemingly permanently scarred Marietta Edgecombe in OotP without warning anyone that there was a hex on the signup list. Not to mention Hermione putting a memory charm on her parents without their consent (implied) in DH, and trapping Rita Skeeter in a jar for days.

As far as Oliver being a "horse girl", I will admit that made me laugh. He's certainly a one-note character in the books. Then again, so is Lavender.

Anyway, I just feel like you have different standards for the male characters than you do the female ones.

They were trying their own inventions on first years out of commercial interest. Hermione used a sleeping draught on people who were the minions of the guy advocating racial cleansings and celebrating the recent attacks. And after brewing a perfect polyjuice potion on her first try at age 13, I have a lot more confidence in her abilities than in whatever the twins manage to complete through trial and error.

Dean did nothing wrong, it's his history with Ginny which makes it uncomfortable. Especially since Harry accelerated their break-up while under the influence of the luck potion.

And Lavender also did nothing wrong. Curb the silly nickname, and you have a perfectly fine girlfriend if you are serious about the relationship.

Personally, I am of the opinion that the actions of 15-year-olds don't deserve permanent disfigurement. I'm of the opinion that she figured that the worst that would come to the DA members was suspension or expulsion, which makes her decision understandable, though still the wrong decision. It's especially understandable since she had no way of knowing that there was a curse on the sign up sheet. Which is particularly reprehensible by Hermione: she intentionally made the curse not a deterrent, but a punishment.

All indications from the text are that the majority of the twins' testing was done on themselves and perhaps Lee. Only after they got it working on themselves did they pay others to test them, which carries considerably lower risk. I won't argue that what they did was particularly moral, but I say it's more moral than what Harry, Ron, and Hermione did to Crabbe and Goyle.

You can justify nearly any action by laying blame to the authorities. Even disregarding that, Harry, Ron, and Hermione had no evidence that Draco was the Heir of Slytherin aside from his attitude and the fact that they didn't like him. There were plenty of other less problematic methods they could have tried first before resorting to what they did.

There was no evidence that Marietta actually believed that Harry was not lying and that Voldemort was back. OotP says in the /In the Hog's Head/ chapter, "Cho had just smiled at him and sat down on Ron's right. Her friend who had curly reddish-blonde hair, did not smile but gave Harry a thoroughly mistrustful look which plainly told him that, given her way, she would not be here at all." We also know that she was reluctant to join in the first place, as the text in the same chapter also says, "...Harry saw Cho's friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her own name."\\
Later on, in the /Dumbledore's Army/ chapter, Cho says, referring to Marietta: "'Don't mind her,' Cho muttered. 'She doesn't really want to be here but I made her come with me. Her parents have forbidden her to do anything that might upset Umbridge. You see - her mum works for the Ministry.'"\\
At the very least, Marietta was there under duress and therefore was coerced into signing the parchment containing the jinx.

Granted, Marietta was 16/17, so obviously no execution, but I feel as if she got away too lightly for whom her actions helped (Umbridge directly, Voldemort and you can even put some blame for Sirius' death on her as she was the catalyst for Dumbledore being driven out). If she had betrayed a Quidditch squad to a rival team and all that was lost was a trophy, Hermione's actions might have been questionable, but given what was at stake, she was either justified or too harmless IMO.

Marietta was not a knowing accomplice of Voldemort. She was a knowing accomplice under duress of a grossly corrupt government administration. I certainly think that Marietta should have been punished with expulsion at the very least and arguably a fine as well, but I also think that Hermione should have been punished as well. You can't have students taking punishment and retribution into their own hands. After all, isn't that what the Inquisitorial Squad did? Hand out detentions? Hermione was a prefect, too. Her actions were certainly grounds for being stripped of that honour as well as a series of detentions. There's a reason that the power of the prefects is very limited, and Hermione overstepped that by a mile.

And you are expecting that the same authority whom Hermione was opposed to would punish her for resisting them. What are you smoking? And again, the entire series is the result of Harry and Hermione breaking rules because the authorities are worse than useless, and you want to punish Hermione for that one instance? Why not incarcerate her and Harry for saving Sirius? They broke the laws on time travel and interfered with a Ministry execution.

Being a prefect is irrelevant to this situation as their power was invalidated by Umbridge and the official Hogwarts policy was one of torture.

That's the main reason why I don't seek out slash pairings for HP myself. The only one of Harry's dorm mates I like is Neville, but not so much that I want a whole story with him starring. Draco and his crowd makes no sense, and most every other named male pointed out is a romantic rival at some point or just disliked. Fred and George are great, but they work best as a unit and then you'd have to get into a whole bother can of beans for that. Cedric in GoF I could see working, though I imagine it's like with Fleur fics: many authors stumble on making the relationship organic, and not just ‘oh hey there's the person I'm paired with this story!

** Want to add my two cents that a lot of people who read put themselves in the role of the protagonist.

With that said, if the protagonist isn't usually in their demographic it can be hard to 100% commit to what you're reading.

I am one of those people who thrust myself in that world like that.

That's not to say I can't read slash/femslash or opposite gender stories and enjoy them but it's going to have to have topics and plot points I personally enjoy to really get into it.

And as for the HP series, I'll reiterate that it's hard to like Draco and while I love protagonist/antagonist find love in fics, Harry with Tom or Snape is not my cuppa.

Now there have been plenty of stories with side character slash who isn't the protagonist that I've read and wouldn't mind at all to read in the future no matter the subject matter of the story.

*** This has always been a little interesting for me Im a girl and im straight. Most of my favorite stories had male protagonists and pretty much all of them were interested in women. Anytime they were interested in romance i just got so bored because I could care less about their crush. What i could care about was their actual relationship if it was actually explored in a similar way as i cared about their friendships actually. I could relate to caring and giving a shit but not relating to having a similar object of desire. So having the protag have the same romantic desires as I do being a selling point to a good romance is a criteria i kinda get but only theoretically.

So in a way any time its a gay protag i can relate a little more actually since at least i can relate to liking men.

**** Of course my personal ideal isn't going to be the universal either so I get what you're saying. Like I said I do find myself sometimes reading outside of my demographic but it's hitting on topics I enjoy and it's extremely engaging.

With fanfiction itself, that can be hard to find something engaging outside of my demo for someone like myself as there are plenty of tropes that just make you want to be done with reading FF altogether. Then there are those stories riddled with errors. Something that's already rare for me to engage in, those types of issues can pull me out of it so fast and they are quite prevalent.

And I could easily see women enjoying stories with a non-demographic protagonist simply because they tend to be more empathetic which makes it easier to relate. Of course you don't need to be more empathetic but it likely makes it easier. It's pure conjecture on my part but it does fit with your being able to relate to a gay male character easy enough because you can find your same thoughts and feelings in him.

A more likely explanation is that women grow up reading and watching a lot of fantasy/scifi with male protagonists, because the majority of mainstream western fantasy/scifi best sellers have male protagonists. Thus, women are already accustomed to viewing fantasy worlds through the lens of a male character and are less likely to be put off by the protagonist being a different gender from them. Male readers on the other hand have less exposure to female protagonists, so they are more likely to have problems empathizing with one.

****** As a guy, I don't mind female protagonists. If given the choice (eg in video games), I even prefer them because they are something different, refreshing compared to chunk of muscles no 28455. Maybe it's because badass females are rarer, but, for example, there is just something intriguing about FemShep battling her way through hordes of aliens that the male Shepard doesn't have.

However, sexual attraction is something where I have a strong disconnect if the protagonist is into men. Because, to put it bluntly, why would you want to sleep with a man if you could sleep with a woman instead? I mean, have you seen women? They look better, they smell better, their voices generally sound kinder and their skin is delightfully soft.

For example Daphne and Susan were fleshed out a great deal in fanon and paired with Harry.

** For me, there's a number of things. Firstly, I'm ace and aro. Romance doesn't do /shit/ for me, and 90% of the time when I see a fic labelled as a "Slash fic," that means the relationship is going to be a major focus of the story. Secondly, it's because in many stories, the character's sexualities are changed with no explanation and no further impact on the character's personality. And oftentimes it's done solely for the purpose of a specific, particular ship. Fourthly, it's because a /lot/ of slash fic is outright porn.

That said, I /have/ read a handful of slash fics that I consider to be well done. I don't object wholly to relationships being in a story at all, I simply have no interest when it's the absolute forefront of the story. And I don't demand that one's sexuality be an all consuming part of their personality, but it should definitely have more impact than just "Oh, X is a viable partner now," especially if the protagonist is Harry, who grew up under the abusive thumb of the Dursleys. Changing such a major personality trait for a specific ship is a bit harder for me to overcome, I'll admit- I'm one of those people who gets twitchy when canon is ignored without an explanation for /why/ that is AU, and combined with my bias against romance-focused stories, the two elements are hard for me to break past. And porn- be it het or slash- is a solid dealbreaker.

*** I mean, they're teenagers who've hardly even had an opportunity to explore their sexuality, what with impending war and all. Plus, if you don't go with Harry being straight just because being straight is what is default, one can make a pretty strong case for a canonically bisexual Harry, for the sole reason that his POV is voiced a writer who is male attracted, and doesn't seem to be able to write attraction to females very well. Harry is far more eloquent about the physical attraction of other men than he is about other women, even those he's in relationships with, and while I doubt that's in any way intentional, it's still evidence on paper.

** I don't like romance at all. I can deal with having it around as paet of the story, but if it takes centre stage I just get incredibly bored 90% of the time. My dislike for romance extends to slash.

Additionally there are several pairings people write about in this fandom I just find creepy or wrong for non-gender-related reasons. Harry/any-one-of-his-enemies, for example. Most of those pairing happen to be slash.

I prefer the good characters we could pair up as friends. Like, Wolfstar can be cute, but I like the Marauders dynamic as soley a group of friends better. And Harry and Ron I see as chosen family, brothers in all but blood.

** I read very little slash for 2 main reasons:

1- I mainly like canon compliant stories or at least canon compliant characters. I most often read stories that are Harry, Ron, or Hermione centric. For the most part, they have strong romantic interests in canon that have been imprinted into my brain. I'm unlikely to read a H/Hr fic for some of the same reasons.

2- I don't like Draco Malfoy, Snape, or L Voldemort in romantic relationships, esp if it's with Harry, Ron, or Hermione. Racism is not sexy! Hatred is not a good foundation for a healthy relationship! Neither is generational differences between partners (at least when one of them is a teenager). I don't think of Draco Malfoy as a character that can be reformed enough to be in a relationship with Harry, nor do I think Harry would forgive and forget if he were. If I'm on ff.net or ao3, those 3 are in the most common slash pairings.

So I have read some Remus/Sirius--to me, that often adds an extra layer of tragedy that I sometimes enjoy and sometimes want to avoid. I've read the occasional Harry/Ron that have been good, but while that seems to me far and away the most likely slash relationship of the main characters, it's not something I see often. I'd read Dean/Seamus, except that I don't usually prefer to read Dean or Seamus centric fics. I am currently reading a wonderful story, The Second String by Eider Down, that is Harry slash. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in time/dimensional travel. Good characterization, pacing, and good romance.

So if I have a request and add 'no slash,' at the end of it, that's why. It's also followed by 'or Hermione/Malfoy, please,'. Maybe it would be better and more correct to give a list of parings I'll like, will try, and those I won't read at all, but this seems easier and less likely to turn into a long debate on how awesome Harry/Malfoy really is.

And by story I don't mean how the main couple met, their first kiss etc. I mean events happening in their universe (like in any book/film/tv show), how the characters manage it, and in the background their relationship naturally evolving around those events.

While when the romance is about straight men its about you winning a romance. Your have some kind of romantic interest and then being able to succeed in getting their attention by growing as a person and therefore developing a relationship.

My idea of romamce is being able to grow a friendship based on mutural values and friendship which is romantic in nature while living your own life. Between the two the romance you get with the straight man MC is the closest i get to what i want to read about it gives the MC more agency too. But im not interested in women.

Slash fic has those aspects of romance with a male lead but often plays up that bond aspect that makes me like all romance and is played out with my favorite characters which often end up being men ( there are just more male characters in my fav stories) .

** It's down to two factors. I find characters attracted to women a lot easier to immerse myself into and there are not many male characters which I find interesting. Out of Harry's age group, he is the only one.

Next-Gen is out of the question as I dislike almost all canon pairings which produced those children. In the Marauder era, James and Edward need to be straight in order for them to have the plot arcs which interest me (James growing up and Edwards massive balls while eloping with Andromeda). Moody and Grindelwald are interesting for their battlefield powers and adventures, not their conquests in the bedroom. Sirius, well, there is no partner for him who interests me. I hate Lupin, Snape and Pettigrew while James needs to be straight (or you write Sirius/Lily which eventually results in Harry, but that's not slash either).

And that's it. I mean, if I would have to pick a gay paring for Harry it would be something along the lines of Harry/Anthony Goldstein or Harry/Wayne Hopkins (basically a Muggleborn or Half-Blood background char), but even then my first point still stands that I find MCs attracted to women more relatable.

A lot of the pairings are weird as fuck like it would take a pretty big AU to make even Draco work, but no y'all wanna ship Harry with snape and Voldemort too.

I'm also not gay which makes it harder to relate to a protagonist that's dealing with their sexuality.

** Fanfiction has a much higher ration of shit to gems, easily 90% is mediocre to aweful. (Makes perfect sense, with the lower barrier to entry vs other sources of stories).

However, what it means is you got to find something that interests you enough to Wade through the bad. You got to enjoy it enough when it is good.

For example, I usually wade through the H/HR fics, where there are a lot of just aweful fics, because when the pairing does work I thoroughly enjoy the story. I'm also a fan of in-universe gender bending, future knowledge / Time travel, and animal transformations (I blame growing up on animorphs books for that last one)

Further, there are a few popular slash tropes that I actively dislike. For one, I like my characters to at least try to stay in character for the books. That means:

- I dislike death eater pairings, as they are mostly irredeemable in Canon. You would have to deviate so far in their past to get a believable character development. I know of a couple of fics that do that development well, but the norm is to just skip that part.
- Similarly, I generally don't like gay Harry, Hermione, or Ron. It just doesn't fit up with Canon. Bi can work,but it usually isn't handled very well. I've found that when it is characters whose lovelife was not spelled out in Canon (Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, OCs) it works much better...

Anyway, I view it the same as why I avoid Anime based in a high school. There are some very good ones, including my all time favorites, but in general it doesn't appeal to me. So I let people who enjoy it Wade through the mess and check out any that rise above the crop.

In my experience het fic is written as a extension of plot or character growth.

So something like as Harry grows as a person he gets more charismatic and as a result gets romantic attention from people he respects and is attracted to.

While in slash romance is written similar to a friendship seeing the characters getting closer by bouncing off each other.

Personally when it comes to romance i prefer the way slash is written because it makes it seem like the romance has a point and had effort put into it. But it also makes it more likely that a story might just focus on the romance not just as a side plot and give you fewer distractions from it. So if the romance isnt well done there is less of an escape unfortunately.

But personally id rather have no romance if you dont really feel like you can pull one off in your story. To me when done poorly its a pain to overlook.

Not exclusively. For one thing, HP fandom isn't a single community; it's a lot of different communities clustered around various platforms and archives. Teenage writers may predominate on Wattpad, for instance, but FFN is clearly a mixture of genders and ages. I started out on LiveJournal in Snape fandom in 2005, and the vast majority of writers were women in their 30s and 40s, some of whom had been in fandom since the days of Kirk/Spock and Star Trek: the Original Series. AO3 was founded by women in their 30s, and many of the writers who migrated from LJ were among the first adopters.

Of course, as the HP canon has trundled onward, new waves of young fans have hit the internet. Due to the mainstreaming of Tumblr, they've made rather a splash. I should add that HP slash fandom has never been solely straight; my circle was and is very LGBT, including a fair percentage of lesbians who preferred reading and writing m/m because straight-up (so to speak) romance wasn't necessarily the goal. Also, the recent influx of young fans reminds me of this sub in how heavily they project onto their favorite characters, identifying with the protagonists in ways that lead, as usual, to ship wars and headcanon spats - the difference being that these particular fans don't identify as straight.

*** In contrast, I've found better quality romance by writers who write m/m as well, as opposed to those who only write het, and there are plenty of quality writers around, especially on ao3. I like that they don't let cliché gender roles of the kind present in the worst of my mom's bodice rippers get in the way of good characterisation and plot.

So for example Harry starts excelling in school making connections gaining confidence and therefore ends up attracting the attention of others who are charmed by him and want to help him including getting romantic attention from someone he respects and looks upto and finds attractive.

In comparison most slash fic i read establishing a romance is like establishing a friendship it happens as a result of characters bouncing off each other getting to know each other helping each other even in the abscence of personal growth.

To me the latter is more appealing the former makes the romance seem almost unnecessary to me and is maybe a bit too wishfullment for my tastes. This isnt always true some slash fic are like the first scenario and some het fic are like the second scenario. But this has generally been my experience.

Having an relationship as "reward" or endgame is not what I'd consider good writing. Hell, I'd take a drunken ONS over a 100k slow burn when it comes to relationship starters because the interesting part is not getting together but being together. Getting a date is not the difficult part, maintaining a loving relationship in the face of fate and time (and the plot) is.

But in my experience the shitty slash in shitty in different ways than het . At least in the hp fandom. In slash the emphasis on the romantic couple being emphasized might come at the expense of everything else and with little other things to turn to. And is just as prone to be badly written or paced

Het on the other hand in my experience when shitty romance in het comes up by putting in a romance which doesnt make sense with little time devoted to justifiying its existence.

Its both awful in different ways.

But if you are putting in a romance i at least expect you to make it actually be explored so i prefer the shitty slash to the shitty het.

Again this is my experience. For slash and het i do look for specific kinds of stories that could have an influence on what i find.

**** It really comes down to personal preferences. I have read some works by the slash authors you mentioned but I didnt care much for them. Overall I still find het romance writers to be much better at writing romance than slash writers.

For romance though I prefer slow burn plot focused fics where the relationship comes out naturally out of friendship among character development and personal growth (and be believable). Almost all slash fics I have attempted to read either make characters way too OOC, go way too far into making one of them be submissive/feminine or put way too much focus on romance and getting them together instead of having romance be part of a subplot. I also really don't care for reading all about homosexuality views of society and the main character questioning their sexuality.

I do prefer gen fics over romance though. There aren't any pairings I care for in Harry Potter fandom so I rarely seek out romance focused fics unless the plot sounds interesting.

Because even child-friendly relationship acts with men are not appealing to me. Stuff like cuddling or soft kisses. If I am close to another guy (eg my best friend), I want to hang out and get drunk with them, or play video games, as that is the limit of my interest when it comes to men.

Well then here's a thought: it's still somewhat unusual to see gay relationships just happen in mainstream films and such. When there's a gay protagonist or even just a female one, we still make a big song-and-dance of it. Perhaps the average person, without being homophobic, just instinctively associates gay relationships with porn, because that's where they're most likely to see it.

Assuming we're not all dead by then, it's be interesting to ask the next few generations of fully internet-savvy apes what they think of slash.

We're starting to see gay couples in mainstream media, but I've yet to find much where main characters are "casually gay" or whatever - gay without it being a major plot thing (not their relationship, but the fact that they're gay). Buffy's got it's own fucked up ness around sex and people's sexes, but major props for Willow and for Tara (minus the later on ridiculous magic addiction thing they added with the only man to use magic, and also later on the whole modifying your partner's memory thing)

Maybe once writers/producers/whatever realize people can just be gay without being "the gay one" we'll get a lot better representation and people will stop going straight to gay = porn (and whatever other overdone tropes/stereotypes/whatever)

Its just a thing thats more normal in the wizarding world or something. So their relationship is explored but any issues that might come from them being gay isn't necessarily. And thats nice in a way. I dont have a problem showing homophobia in stories or showing obstacles gay people would face. But sometimes you want the focus to be on other things. So its nice to see this alternative in fics . I would get tired if every narrative where a woman was important had to focus sexism heavily or if every narrative with an non white person had to go into racism heavily. So similarly i get kinda tired of homophobia being necessary in every narrative about a gay character or couple.

I can understand disliking romance as a driving force especially when there hasnt been enough build up of a romance to make you care about it. And using a canon romance doesnt necessarily help in this aspect.

To be fair thats not just true for romance its for all relationships but in my experience friendship people make more of an effort to make you care while in romance its expected to have importance simply by being romantic so shorthands are used more.
