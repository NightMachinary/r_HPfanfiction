** Educating Hermione fits your bill almost perfectly. She is a little passive, but it makes sense in the context of the story and its about a lack of experience, not submissiveness.

Linkao3(4429775)

There's some more femslash which would fit.

Linkao3(1114406)

There's also Statistics, Hermione/Cedric, experimenting with anal.

  Millicent doesn't know what boys do -- what they do with girls, that is. Her sexual education has been glimpses of messy snogging, Lavender Brown's tongue plunging into that Weasley's mouth, for instance. She's also tried ordering from Muggle book shops for romance novels in which men's 'members' thrust mightily in between women's legs, and there's moaning and some sorts of explosions of stars and such.Something's always been missing, though

** My 23-chapter Pansy/Hermione fic would seem to fulfill your needs, but maybe you've already read it, considering that it matches them so well!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6339199/chapters/14523508]]

Hermione does begin as the submissive one between them, but as their relationship evolves, it's becomes much more equal between the girls, with Hermione becoming the more dominant one as the story continues!

  As per *Subreddit Rule 5*, fics containing sexual or suggestive content involving minors cannot be recommended.
#+end_quote

Due to that rule I can NOT recommend any fiction by Mist of Rainbows, also known as Mist of Shadows.

That is all.

** You could try linkao3(Love in the Eye of a Storm by rattlesoft) - it's a post-war Hermione/Narcissa fic wrapped around an island mystery.

Not to be outdone (especially since it was written earlier), there's a Hermione/Pansy post-war island mystery story by Inell called [[http://inell.avada-kedavra.net/viewstory.php?sid=397&ageconsent=ok&warning=2][The Island of Second Chances]].

I guess the trend here is 'mysterious Hermione is domme Hermione'.

  After the war, Narcissa Malfoy spends all of her time holed up in Malfoy Manor. Growing more and more dissatisfied, she takes a holiday to a mysterious island that promises no contact with the outside world. There, she encounters someone else in similar circumstances and a threat straight from her nightmares.
