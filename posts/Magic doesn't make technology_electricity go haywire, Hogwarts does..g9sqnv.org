I've seen this idea a couple of years ago and I think this should be brought up. What if magic makes technology go crazy was just a real conspiracy made by the old guard? What if they had put charms around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade so that modern technology which isn't supported by magic or is mechanical doesn't work?

People have brought up that Diagon Alley is right there hidden in the middle of London and all the magic made there doesn't appear to mess with the electricity nearby. There's also the often brought up point that the human body is able to live because of electricity. Almost every witch and wizard spend their formative teenage years in Hogwarts and an arguably important number of wizarding children would live in Hogsmeade, two places where in this theory magic does in fact stop technology from working.

I know the original theory explains it better than me, and unfortunately, I cannot link it because I'm going off purely by memory, but I just thought this should be brought up again.


** This is canon. Not the bit about it being a conspiracy, or the result of a deliberate charm - we are literally told by our reliable narrator (Hermione) that it's a result of too much magic in the air. But the bit about only Hogwarts meeting this "too much magic in the air" standard is canon.

Everywhere else, magic and technology get on just fine. Mr Weasley repaired an electric fire in GoF, for example. I have no doubt that you could "alohamora" an ATM or someone's Gmail account.

*** *Response to a deleted comment asking if the effect would be present at Malfoy Manor*

I think if Diagon Alley is fine, then Malfoy Manor probably is too.

Whether or not Diagon Alley is fine is a matter of debate. We never see a Muggle device used there, successfully or otherwise, so it's a matter of speculation.

On the one hand, you might say that the lack of impact on the surrounding Muggle area indicates that the "anti-technology" effect is absent.

On the other hand, you might say that magic generally treats places not strictly as physical areas, but as plots of land in the same sense as real estate - it is perfectly possible to place spells on an address rather than with reference to a physical area, for example. So there's no reason to believe that the anti-technology effect would "diffuse" through to Muggle London. If the effect is a result of a specific place being full of magic, and Muggle London is not full of magic, then there's no reason for an anti-technology effect to occur there.

So canonically, I think the jury is well and truly out. We know the extreme cases, Hogwarts and Privet Drive, which give us the rough outline of what occurs, but we don't have any intermediate cases. Which means in fanfic you can do more or less what you want with those intermediate cases, even where you are wanting to stick to canon.

Considering that the freezing charm works on a burglar alarm, this seems likely.

** If I remember correctly the Ministry of Magic is in the heart of London and a muggle office building sits on top of it with several office buildings surrounding it. And as far as we know their devices have no problem operating (if they did the office buildings would be empty (as you can't run a modern business without electric devices).

I'll try to find it but there was a fic (maybe a couple) that had a past Headmaster cast a charm over Hogwarts to ensure that electric devices won't work. After 7 years of being told muggle devices won't work they don't check etc once they leave Hogwarts. Because everyone knows Electricity doesn't work around magic.

This story shows that electricity does work at Hogwarts. It was just the earlier versions that didn't. But after devices had more shielding etc it would work but magicals never checked again (of course this story doesn't explain why muggleborn didn't keep trying.

linkffn(13032752)

Harry Potter and the Four Heirs by Sinyk has a past Headmaster setting up a charm to keep electrical devices from working because he believed electricity was Dangerous.

linkffn(9048823)

I think there are other stories where complicated electric devices work just fine if you don't send spells directly at it or if you did it wasn't "plugged" in when you did so.

Most of these stories commonality is that the characters suddenly realize that muggle areas adjacent or on top of magical areas seem to have no problems operating electronic devices.

** We know that electricity doesn't work at Hogwarts. We don't know the exact cause, and I wouldn't be surprised if the wizards didn't know it either. Could just be a really clever anti-lightning charm that Rowena came up with that prevents the build-up of high voltages, and nobody even knows it's there since the Hogwarts enchantment system is a centuries old mess of hundreds of different enchantments by dozens of wizards with absolutely no documentation.

Imagine trying to fix a bug in a piece of important software written in COBOL-85 where you don't have the source code, only a decompiled binary, where the company that made it went bust in 1998, oh and you're working in Production with no backups.

***** Indeed. This is probably the thing fanon most frequently gets wrong about her character - the idea that she identifies as a Muggle still, or has some greater loyalty to the Muggle world than wizarding world.

It's similar, I suppose, to how authors frequently depict Fleur as viewing herself as a Veela rather than a witch.

** There's an HPMOR offshoot where Harry makes a working crystal radio from scratch, uses it to play to morning (muggle) news in the middle of some class, and discovers that the magical world uses anti-lightning-charms, that disrupt all electronics, in the general wards of every magical building in the world. But non-electrical muggle tech works fine.

I forget the exact fic, though.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.
