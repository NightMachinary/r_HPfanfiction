Im after fics where the teenagers are well teenagers. They party, aren't afraid to curse, aren't always plotting shit and just having a good time. Having them heavily involved in the war without shit tons of angst is a bonus but i realize that i am stretching the request a little thin at that point.


** linkffn(The Life and Times) apparently does teenagers exceptionally well. I have not read it, however.

  She was dramatic. He was dynamic. She was precise. He was impulsive. He was James, and she was Lily, and one day they shared a kiss, but before that they shared many arguments, for he was cocky, and she was sweet, and matters of the heart require time.

** I'm just recommending this all over the place tonight. I cannot say that it lacks any angst, because it has teenagers. Being teenagers. Slight spoiler, they are Slytherin teenagers, but it's one of the more believable depictions of Slytherin teenagers I can recall.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
