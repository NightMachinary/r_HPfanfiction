I'm gonna be honest, I have no idea if it's good or not, it's just bothering me that I can't remember what it's called. I only read like one or two chapters, mostly because the formatting was really off putting (lots of bold for emphasis.) The things I do remember, though:

I think it's one of those OP harry stories

Ginny is super salty because harry has like, a pet runespoor with a nickname?

I think it starts with him saving Daphne Greengrass during the battle of hogwarts

I'm pretty sure it's a crossover, or kind of a pseudo crossover, but I couldn't tell you what with.

I think it's meant to be, or tagged as hp/dg but it starts hp/gw

I know that's not a lot to go on, and I don't know if this is even worth looking for, but I'll try to remember more if nobody comes up with it.
