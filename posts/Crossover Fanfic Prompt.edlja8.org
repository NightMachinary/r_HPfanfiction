The Dursley family get a daughter named Daisy shortly after taking Harry in. But unknown to them Daisy is a witch. Seeing her accidental magic the adult Dursleys, thinking Magic is a sort of infectious disease, try to kill both children before their 'precious Dudley' catches this 'infectious freakishness'. in mortal danger, things happen.

A. Lily's blood magic deems Petunia unsuitable and trys to find someone else as guardian.

B. Trying to escape into the world of 'monsters' adult dursleys constantly speak about, the children's accidental magic explodes.

As a result, the children, as well as some members of the first Order of the Phoenix, some Potter house elves and Caradoc Dearborn, who in this fic wasn't dead but was changed into some sort of magical creature during battle, apparates into some place no other has known before.

Of course Albus Many Middle Names Dumbldore (He isn't bad here) quickly learns that Harry has gone missing after a magical explosion and properly punishes the Dursleys courtsy of angry Amelia Bones. at first he thinks the children were killed in that explosion and his mission had failed. Then Sybill makes a new prophecy - something related to the place, life and power no other has known before that can defeat Tom Riddle. Albus realizes the missing people are there and desperately searches for them. Hoping he can reach them before the evil does.
