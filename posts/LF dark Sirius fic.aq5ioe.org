I read a fic awhile ago that was pretty short. It was an SI into Sirius Black. The mc was a sociopath and he showed up in Azkaban. His cell was across from Bellatrix and he slowly started to brainwash her. It was a pretty dark fic and I've been having trouble finding it. If anyone has a recommendation of something similar that'd be awesome. Sort of a linkffn(Malicious, Magical, Malfoy) or a linkffn(I am Mr Five) kind of feel.

  People often complained about a lack of birthright. Being reborn as Draco Malfoy meant I had the opposite issue. So many new things to take into account. Politics, magic, family traditions, the wizarding world and this odd new power that insisted my new reality was a game. What's a Gamer SI to do. Semi-inspired by "Magical Player", "In Bad Faith" and "Puppet of time"

  In one world, a villain whose powers should have made him a renowned world terrorist fades into obscurity after suffering defeat by the Straw Hats. In this world, someone else takes the reins earlier and brings about an age of pirates that has absolutely nothing to do with adventure and nakamaship. "Rape. Pillage. Burn. T'is a pirate's life for me, savvy?" SI-OC as Mr. Five.
