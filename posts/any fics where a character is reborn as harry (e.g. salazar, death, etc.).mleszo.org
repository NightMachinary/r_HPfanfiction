preferably not an OC, but crossovers are welcome. please no harry x harem though, that trope really puts me off. thank you!


** Yeah! There's one I read a while ago with Dumbledore as the one resurrected. I think it's a great read and a take on Dumbledore I don't think I've seen again.

** here's one where salazar is reborn as harry! it's still in progress, but it's at nearly 230k and being updated regularly. lots of druid magic and great worldbuilding imo

  Salazar Slytherin woke up in the body of a three year old boy with the most ridiculous head of black hair & a runic scar craved into his forehead. The last thing he recalled was dying. Now it is over 900 years in the future. There are a million things to deal with between new inventions, lost knowledge, missing spirits, & parasitic dark lords.

** Oh hey, I was actually thinking of writing a couple of fics with this premise! No OCs, but not HP characters either. One would have been a Warhammer Fantasy character, the other Joan of Arc.

I've set them aside for now, cause I have other, more fleshed out ideas I'm working on, but I'm glad I'm not the only one who likes that idea, and I hope you get some good recommendations!
