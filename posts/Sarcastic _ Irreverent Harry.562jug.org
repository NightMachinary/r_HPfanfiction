  The sequel to ItMoaS. Mad scientist Harry Potter, now twenty years old, is sent to the SGC to half-join SG-1, accompanying them on missions.

** linkffn(Illusions of Grandeur) is a crossover with Supernatural which has a very snarky Harry. :)

I know I have more, but I can't think of them right now. After some sleep I may add some more.

**** Not at all. I think I've only seen up to episode 3 of the first season myself and I followed along just fine. So long as you know the premise of the show, you should be okay. If you're really curious about a reference or character, a quick wiki search would be all you need to do.

**** I feel like I missed a little bit too much when reading it. It probably would have made more sense if I had seen the TV series, but I understood enough to get by.

As a note though, this is more angry / frustrated harry than it is sarcastic / irreverent harry

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

Hmm, have you read linkffn(A Black Comedy)?

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
