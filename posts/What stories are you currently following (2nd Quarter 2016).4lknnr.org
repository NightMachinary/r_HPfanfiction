I did one back three months, can't believe how fast time flies: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/43enl7/what_stories_are_you_currently_following/]]

Some of the fics in the link were done, some of them still ongoing, and I'm following those in additional:

*The Dark Lord Never Died*, linkffn(11773877): A smart and cunning Lucius Malfoy managed to outmaneuver Dumbledore and seize the Ministry after Voldemort's first defeat in 1981. Almost 20 years later, Voldemort finally managed to get his body back, but Malfoy wouldn't give up power, and Dumbledore and his exiled Order were lurking in the shadow. Caught in this three way war were Ron and Hermione on two opposing sides. This is one of the best Ron/Hermione romance I've seen.

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994): written by the same author of the above story, still in early stage. After Voldemort's return at the end of year 4, the Ministry decided to appease him to avoid open confrontations. It enacted discriminatory pro-pureblood laws and increasingly persecuted muggleborns. Hermione quickly saw chilling parallels to the 1930s Nazi Germany, and began preparing. The story feels brutal, grim, and realistic, as things about an underground resistance should be.

*Justice, Justice Shall You Pursue*, linkffn(11961978): it's going be only three chapters, but looks promising. The first chapter has nice takedown of the Goblins by prime minister John Major.

*Applied Cultural Anthropology, or*, linkffn(9238861): Slytherin Hermione, can also be seen as 'Rise of the Dark Lord Hermione Granger'. Currently in year 3, Diary Tom liked her, and Draco was already under her thumb.

*[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]*: non magical AU, and 007 James Bond was real in this universe. [[/spoiler][In fact, the 007 in year 1981 was none other than James Potter]] Hogwarts was a school for the British elites that trained their kids in strategies, combat tactics, and spy crafts, but children from commoners who were especially talented and/or vicious were also admitted, and Hermione was one of them. I greatly enjoy its plot, characterization, and writing. It's also interesting to read how various canon events could be translated into a non-magical setting. The story is now in year 7 and still has 24 out of 200 chapters to go.

*Call Me Moriarty*, linkffn(11602420): dark fem!Harry/Hermione. I would say this fem!Harry is pretty evil and overpowered, but the story is bloody fun to read. On hiatus until July.

*The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond*, linkffn(9818387): Soul bond fics often involve Harry and Ginny after the CoS incident, and then these two would be so much in love and engage in adult activities (snogging at least) at tender age of 12/13. Well, this story still had them forming a soul bond after CoS, but this didn't mean they had to like the effects, especially not when the girl was having her period.


** Ahh the curses of WiP. Currently there isn't that much. The one where I wait most anxiously is linkffn(What you leave behind) though I wait for quite some time. Or basiclly anything by [[/u/Lane_Anasazi]].

Some more recently updated ones are linkffn(The Changeling) an instresting story centred around Ginny in Slytherin, even thought I didnt really liked some things in the last chapter.

linkffn(Grow young with me) with the very best oc ever and a very vulnerable but understandable Harry.

and linkffn(The Black Prince) They only good crossover I ever read (if you exclude the denarian series, which I would). But this story is really more a GoT story with a bit HP than vice versa.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition.

** Like [[/u/silver_fire_lizard]] and [[/u/BigFatNo]] , I'm following [[/u/floreatcastellum]] 's The Aurors. I'm also waiting for Northumbrian to update anything, but that's it. If you haven't checked out The Aurors, I highly recommend taking a look! Consistent updates, fantastic characterization, great plot, realistic dialogue, no complaints about it.

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

#+begin_quote
  Sirius is dead, and Harry has reached his breaking point. A chance meeting with a pale girl and her family moves Harry's life in a new direction. Rated M for macabre themes, and later on suggestive adult content.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things.

Winter is coming, but magic is might.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
