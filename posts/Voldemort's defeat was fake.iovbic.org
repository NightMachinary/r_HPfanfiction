** In response to [[/u/inquisitorcoc][u/inquisitorcoc]]'s now deleted comment on the prophecy being a rule of canon:

I don't think the prophecy was actually a canon rule.

#+begin_quote
  *“No, it doesn't!”* said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now. Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, *“You are setting too much store by the prophecy!”*

  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! *But not because of the prophecy!*

  *Would it have meant anything? Of course not!* */Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled?”/*

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.” “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that ---”

  “But Harry, never forget that */what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so./*

Prophecies are just a sign of what /might/ happen. People just put a lot of stock into them in the Wizarding World. If Voldemort could get the spheres they use to record them and plant a fake prophecy in the Department of Mysteries, it could work. I see issues with the prompt, but not because of the prophecy.

And remember, Dumbledore is how JKR communicates magic info.

  Absolutely right, I find that all the time in the book, if you need to tell your readers something just put it in her. There are only two characters that you can put it convincingly into their dialogue. One is Hermione, the other is Dumbledore. In both cases you accept, it's plausible that they have, well Dumbledore knows pretty much everything anyway, but that Hermione has read it somewhere. So, she's handy.

  Oh yes, very much so. Dumbledore often speaks for me.

*** Prophecies are like guidelines to achieve a certain ending in a videogame, except you don't know which ending, what will happen during the playthrough - you just know the key parts.

So yeah, 1/5 would not recommend.

** Interesting idea... A sort of a reversal of linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died by Starfox5): rather than faking Voldemort's survival, he instead fakes his death.

How do you envision Snape's role in all this? He was the one who had delivered the prophecy to Voldemort in canon, and since the prophecy is made up, how does this change? Then, Voldemort kills Lily, so Snape would be trying to bring Voldemort down.

The last bullet point is kind of cringeworthy. Harry having to deal with the fact that he had been a decoy all along makes for interesting character drama. Shoehorning him into some kind of a leadership role when he has less basis for it than he did in canon seems pointless; and making him "much more capable and smart than in canon" sounds like a personality rewrite that would cheapen the whole thing and artificially inflate his importance.

How do you envision the story ending? Is the last bullet point showing the last days of the resistance to Voldemort's reign before the world is plunged into eternal darkness? Or are the good guys going to pull off a victory? How?

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

**** Harry of canon wasn't stupid. He was significantly above average.

That said, barring a personality rewrite, he works better as a figurehead (in canon, where the prophecy is real) and maybe as a tactical leader of a small squad. For anything bigger than that, he is impulsive, easily manipulated, can't plan ahead, and probably wouldn't be able to make decisions involving risking other people's lives. (Recall: he was fairly good at the tactical stuff in the Department of Mysteries, but it was also his "leadership" that got him and his friends there.) But, changing that results in yet another Harry In Name Only.

*** To be fair this is a prompt and OP said that in this universe the war wasn't going Voldemort's way at that point (plus we barely know anything about prophecies from cannon, so no reason to think Voldemort wouldn't be able to fake it). I would probably read it because of the novelty of nothing else, I mean, we have Harry powerwanks, Hermione powerwanks, (some) Dumbledore powerwanks, muggle powerwanks, ministry powerwanks... but I think this, surprisingly, may be the first idea of an actual Voldemort powerwank I've ever seen.

**** Yeah, it probably is falsifiable. Even in canon, the prophecy was something that a seer came up with that /could/ happen. The ministry just happened to record them and happened to put too much stock in them along with the public (Daily Prophet, Scrimgeour). But as Dumbledore says, they're only signs of what might happen. Many prophecies go unfulfilled.

Also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort]] is a nice self-insert into Voldemort powerwank fic. It has a very different magic system but you might enjoy it.
