It's a story I read some time ago, I think it was at ffn. In this when Hermione had Harry's firebolt confiscated he got much angrier over her taking so much freedom with his belongings and treating him like a child. They had a big falling out, then Ron went to try to convince him to make amends saying that Hermione does know better and this resulted in Harry also distancing himself from Ron. I remember he ended up making other friends, in particular I remember he became friends with Terry Boot and in a scene was talking with him and someone else in Ravenclaw's common room and Terry was denying wanting to be a lawyer but Harry said that he always read first the transcript of trials in the letters his father sent him.

  After McGonagall's dismissal of the first divination lesson Harry decides to change elective. In the process Harry starts to understand that he can do things without Ron or Hermione and that their yearmates are worth getting to know. A different take on PoA and on. Rating's for safety. Not a Ron/Hermione bashing story.
