In the highly enjoyable "The Arithmancer" by White Squirrel, everytime Hermione's parents are referred to as Dan and Emma Granger, I wince internally. The whole Dan and Emma Granger thing is a staple of bad H/Hr fanfiction and became hugely popular as a (slightly creepy) wish fulfillment when Rowling shot down H/Hr in Canon. Has this ever happened to you while reading good fics?


** Now I finally get it... Daniel and Emma...

geez, I'm an idiot.

I think my favourite cliche is the "lemon drop". Mentioned maybe 1 or 2 times in canon, I read fanfiction with at least one mention of them per chapter.

*** There was one ff that had ancient, enchanted lemon drops. When the last lemon drop was voluntarily taken, something good was going to happen.

Of course, if you tried to vanish them, they doubled in number. Which happened several times. I think they gave them to Grawp in the end.

Can't remember which ff, though.

**** I really don't know. Maybe because I always saw the movies and the books as two different things? At least that would be one possible explanation. While I only watched each movie once, I read the books several times (the most being GoF with 6 times). Also, Daniel Radcliffe never established himself as "the face of Harry" in my mind. Emma Watson came closer to how I imagined Hermione, but even here the years blurred the image.

I also don't really read author notes, so even if authors explain their choice of names, I wouldn't know of it.

So, in the end, Dan and Emma were perfectly normal names for me.

In some way I gotta say: FUCK YOU OP!

Now I'll always think of this when I read those names.

***** I don't know if this makes me a horrible person, but I've got this deep urge that started after I took a crack at the recs on a different thread. The recs turned out to be about how, after Voldemort won the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione tries to run and/or hide but she obviously can't succeed on her own merits, so a NotEvil!DeathEater hides her in his domicile, things happen, she becomes pregnant, and sits the rest of the conflict out... The urge is therefore to read /just one/ fic where Hermione finds herself pregnant in the middle of a war, decides that it's not a good time to be pregnant or have a baby, casts /ABORTIFACIO!/, and moves on.

** I always cringe at gentleman/chivalrous/classy!Snape. I understand that for most pairings (including many of my favorite pairings) the characters will be a little OOC just by virtue of them getting together but with a lot of Snape/Anyone he becomes a completely different person. And it's always done in the most cringe-worthy ways. He's always all the sudden this amazing dancer who pulls out chairs for "his woman" and dresses in Hugo Boss/Armani/something else super fancy and enjoys candle light dinners and walks on the beach. I guess the real issue is that I see a whole lot of fics where Snape becomes "generic!Tall-Dark-Handsome Romance Novel Man" and it just makes me wanna roll my eyes out of my head.

The other one is the "Slytherin Sex God" trope (and this applies to Snape too!). I don't really see it as often anymore and I'm sure plenty of Slytherins are great lovers but I've just never seen this written in a way that didn't remind me of a cheesy porno!

And finally, any detailed description of what a character is wearing. Mention them throwing on a Weasley sweater? Alright. Go into detail about the micro-mini chrome halter dress with cutouts, fishnet tights, and platform heels Hermione is wearing? Please, no. The worst offender of all this, of course, is all the "Golden Trio (Minus Ron) Goes Goth" fics I used to read when I was 11...

Almost never does Harry rage, feel betrayed, or just accept that he is a criminal. He imediatly asks about the trial, even though in real life I have never heard anyone do that. It usually plays across as:

"You remember that guy Cliff from high school?"

"Yeah, how is he doing?"

"Well, he got caught dealing cocaine and is in jail."

Never once is someone's first response: "What are the details of the trial?"

*** The 'magical core' thing really puts me off when it is portrayed as some sort 'glowing anime light in their chest.'

I think a magical core (which definitely needs a new name as to not be mixed up with the one I described above) should be a bit like a muscle, you can excercise it by using it often and it will become more powerful, you barely use magic and it will gradually weaken. Also, maybe casting magic is a good way to burn fat and that is why you barely ever find overweight wizards and witches. Slughorn and Neville were the only two I remember as being even slightly flabby, and Neville had thought he was a squib up 'til that point and Slughorn makes a lot of potions, so maybe he doesn't do as much wand magic?

**** The muscle analogy is too one-dimensional.

I think that a better analogy (which I can't take credit for, but I don't remember the source) is that casting a spell is like playing a piece on a musical instrument, but the instrument are the wand and the wizard's mind.

There is no "musical core", but different musicians have different degrees of talent (physical and cognitive) and skill obtained by practice, and they have some control --- within the constraints of their skill --- to play the piece to slightly different effects, and even improvise and modify it on the fly.

Learning to play a particular piece does not contribute to a measurable "skill level", but it does help learn more complex pieces, particularly those that are similar, and this also holds for spells. A sufficiently skilled and talented musician might be able to sight-read a sufficiently simple piece, and a sufficiently skilled and talented wizard might be able to look up a spell description in a book and cast it on the first attempt.

Dark Spells are a bit different in this respect, since they /want/ to be cast and require a merest excuse to cast, which is a part of what makes Dark Arts tempting and dangerous.

As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  A Slytherin does not cavort around the school with idlers and troublemakers. A Slytherin carefully plots and plans. A Slytherin judges others based on the quality of their minds and the content of their ambitions, not their blood. Harry is a very good Slytherin indeed. But not all is well at Hogwarts. First year one-shot, possible future story seed, SlytherinHarry, soft AU.

******* I've heard that, but I don't think Jane was ever printed in the books, it was just something Rowling said at an interview. Jean is the only one that is canon. I think "Jane", to JKR, represents a straitlaced person who has a great respect for rules and authority.

No, because if they use them then they're no longer good. They're tolerable.
