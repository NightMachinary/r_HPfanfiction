Looking for fics wherein polyjuice + animal, particularly a magical one, is used or abused, either on purpose or by accident.

(It seems so risky, yet so useful, I'm kind of shocked that LV didn't pull an Orichimaru with it. Or maybe that's why he looks the way he does...)

** I don't know about polyjuice, but my headcanon has always been that Voldemort looked like a snake because he was cursed by the unicorns blood from the first book. I like to believe that unicorns blood curses your body to reflect the state of your soul, so Quirrel, an otherwise normal guy with a parasite wraith attached to his soul began to sprout Voldemort's face when he began drinking unicorns blood. Similarly, Voldemort was fed with unicorns blood before the climax of the fourth book, and the baby creature that he was possessing looked like a scaley, raw evil abomination, almost identical to the appearance of the Scar Horcrux, and bearing eerie similarity to Voldemort's ressurected body.

*** On the Quirrell point: Wasn't Harry getting pain in his scar from the back of Quirrell's head being pointed in Harry's general direction before the unicorn blood drinking? That implies to me that Voldemort's face was already being freaky.

*** Voldemort most likely already looked like that before his first defeat. There are two hints in canon that point this way:

GoF Graveyard scene: The Death Eaters recognise him immediately, and Voldemort tells them:

#+begin_quote
  "There was no hope of stealing the Philosopher's Stone any more, for I knew that Dumbledore would have seen to it that it was destroyed. But I was willing to embrace mortal life again, before chasing immortal. I set my sights lower ... I would *settle for my old body back* again, and my old strength.“
#+end_quote

And in OotP Fudge, who did everything to deny Voldemort's existence, takes one look at him at the Ministry and knows he is back. He doesn't think it might be someone else, or some weird creature, he recognises Voldemort.

**** We have canon evidence that Riddle was physically twisted and deformed from dark magic use, but it was more waxy pale skin which looked off, rather than scales. That said, the way he phrased it is that his intention was to go back to his old body. We don't actually get told that he looked like that.

Next, both instances of recognition may simply be educated guesses. I would imagine that the Inner Circle would have some inkling and rumor of Voldemort's ambitions for immortality. Combine that with them being summoned by the Dark Mark, which burned black, and ending up in a graveyard with a pale dark wizard with red eyes, I think that even the dullest amoung them could fit the puzzle pieces together.

As for Fudge, he saw a pale, red-eyed monster who was dueling Dumbledore to a standstill, and this is after a full year of being told by Dumbledore that Voldemort was back. This, combined with Lestrange, should be enough for anyone with any critical thinking skills.

I am not saying that you're wrong, just that there isn't enough evidence that I am.
