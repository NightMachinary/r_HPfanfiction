You're the head of the Potter Family or you're Harry. You have three kids. The eldest gets the invisibility cloak.

What would you give the second kid and third kid?

It needs to be a magical item. Something special from a father to his children. Preferably one of a kind. Rare.

Basically if you were a potter and had to give your kid a magical item before he went to school and the invisibility cloak is out of question, what do you think would be a gift of equal value?

I'm not going to be including the remaining deathly hallows.

Not the multi-apartment trunks or save you from anything enchanted rings/jewelry.

Not including passing on of titles or lands etc.

Marauders Map is not included for the purposes of this discussion.


** Hmmm... not quite sure if this is what you are looking for because they aren't one-of-a-kind magical items, but, these are items intrinsically linked to Harry

1) the snitch that dumbledore left him

2) his firebolt

3) the Half Blood Prince's textbook

4) Dumbledore's pensieve

5) maybe harry somehow manages to restore the two-way mirrors

6) a Dumbledore's Army coin

7) Fawkes. He never returned in canon but maybe does one day?

** Well that depends on the time period. Traditionally, the eldest as the primary heir inherits the bulk of the estate, with younger siblings inheriting a small provision of the wealth. It depends on how wealthy/ ennobled you are. If its a matter of titles, and if there are multiple titles within the family, like for example the ‘Moncreiffe-Hays'; The eldest, Merlin Hay became the Earl of Errol, from his mother and his younger brother Peregrine Hay, became Peregrine Moncreiffe of that Ilk, a lesser title from his father, as the Lord Lyon in Scotland no longer recognises double-barrelled surnames as legitimate way of inheriting titles from multiple families so to speak. This means that specifically under Scots Law a name like ‘Black-Potter' doesn't have any legal standing for inheritance.

The primary heir gets the main title and the next youngest may inherit another possibly subsidiary title and so on, should they take the appropriate name.

This way the eldest would inherit the invisibility cloak, but we don't know what other magic items the Potters in this case, actually own. If he retains the resurrection stone, it could potentially go to the second child. Inheritance for younger siblings is likely to be something more sentimental. Harry for instance might bequeath Fabian Prewitt's Watch to a younger child. A daughter, traditionally might get some piece of sentimental family jewellery. Signet rings wouldn't be bequeathed to younger children as they are a deeply personal means of heraldic identification, so it would go to the eldest.

Without knowing what is in the Potter Estate for this example, it's difficult to say how it might be split, except to say splitting an estate equally is generally a bad idea. Happened with my Great Grandmother, who had a very valuable set of china, and instead of choosing one person to inherit it fully, she split it equally amongst her grandchildren and it lost all of its value.

*** Thank you. That's a very informative answer. Didn't know much about Scotland but I've always wanted to know more. My brother and I visited Inverness a few years back and we loved it.

I'm focusing more on magical items, as to what we would expect or suppose would exist in the potter vaults and what is likely to be passed on to each child.

I'm not writing an aristocratic AU. Simple well off harry. He needs to give his kids something because he's passed on the invisibility cloak to his son. In cursed child he gives Albus a blanket and Lilly fairy wings or something? Not sure. So I'm talking more in that sense.

It's more of "what do you think is there to give/ what would you give"?

**** Well, it likely wouldn't be an old wand, as those are according to canon, either buried, burned or broken with their owners, but it depends on how much of an AU you are doing. It might be that Harry, or whomever the testator of the will is, might have invented a device, like Dumbledore's deluminator, that is a one of a kind magic item.

Outside of very generic items, its kind of complex to make a magic item of the value of the invisibility cloak, without knowing more details that fit your story. I mean if its Pottermore canonical, then there might be the original recipes of ‘Skele-gro' and ‘Sleekeasy's Hair Potion' to inherit, which are not inherently magical, but they are certainly one of a kind.

If Harry's original Firebolt survived, that might be a good piece to inherit, but nowhere near the value or rarity of the cloak.

** I honestly don't know. But the invisibility would never go to the eldest in my household. That's reserved for the youngest.

** A cool one to give to someone would be an old family wand. Maybe one that's especially powerful, and with a rich history......

Or maybe a magic ring. Not a signet one like some have; but like one with actual magical properties. Maybe the ring's stone could create illusions, or raise the dead......

If only it were Cannon.....

**** Harry may decide to keep the Resurrection Stone and give it to either Albus or Lily but alas, Harry was idiot enough to throw it away.

***** The problem with the stone was it was harmful to the user. It's very easy to be fixated on a person you've lost, and not move on, which is dangerous and unhealthy. It was better to get rid of it.

And the elder wand and stone always brought problems to the people who possessed them. I don't see why Harry would give that burden to his children.
