And Regulus lives stories about him bonding with Sirius that are also long fic

I also look for that sort of fic. Most of the non-romantic examples are either mentor!Voldemort, have him as an antagonist, and/or are heavily AU. I've read some great fics in that vein.

What I really have a hard time finding are fics set during Tom Riddle's journeys outside of England. To me that seems like an untapped goldmine, to explore what he learned of other magical cultures outside the land of his birth, and what forbidden magic (aside from horcruxes) he might have uncovered during his pursuit of power.

Most fanfic authors seem to gloss over that period, probably because there's so little in canon to hint at events that might have transpired. Fanfic authors would have to weave their stories out of whole cloth rather than borrowing from what's been done before. Very few authors seem comfortable with branching out that far.

*** That would actually be very interesting to explore I think. I understand why it would be intimidating to write but i would love a fic like that.

What are your favorite Tom Riddle MC fics where he isnt in a romance? If there are any about his adventures out of England id love to read it.

**** I've only read one fic that focuses entirely on Riddle's time outside of England, but it's just a oneshot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7452468/1/The-Children-of-Set][The Children of Set]]

Here are some Riddle-centric fics I love that don't have romance:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11358664/1/Warning-Signs-Read-Desolation][Warning Signs Read Desolation]] - An unfinished (but substantial) mentor!Voldemort fic

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088810/1/Carpe-Noctem][Carpe Noctem]] - One of the very few 'Voldemort travels back in time' fics.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/683603][The Wandering Devil]] - A great AU trillogy that focuses on Harry and Tom as reluctant allies. The third fic in the series focuses on Tom.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC

And honestly yes. I always had an issue with the fact that so many of these characters commited to a relationship with highschool romances. And had kids so young.

In fairness, she actually has a (platonic) relationship arc with him in the stories, going from thinking of him as a 'little boy' to watching him get a higher score than her on the First Task, then having him save her sister in a rather dramatic fashion. They don't really interact much for the rest of the year, but by the time she shows back up they've got a mutual respect for each other. She's really one of the only people outside of Ginny and Dumbledore that have a substantial change in dynamic over the course of multiple books.

I could see an author milking that respect for something more. Ships have been built on less.

**** And that pre full moon stuff is nearly in every fic. I had no idea something could be that pervasive. Like, I thought this was some teenage fantasy thing, but then I saw adult women writing it too. I suppose that means it's popular, though it's a mystery to me as to why that might be. It's not even funny now. I usually just skip to the middle of the fic to see if that idea is used and just give up on it if the author uses it.

** There are plenty of stories focusing on Harry being reunited with his parents (resurrection, dimension travel, time travel, WBWL, etc.). But very few of these actually focus on the Harry/Lily relationship. Harry/James interactions are a bit more common, but I think that Harry more than anything would want to connect to his mother.

Harry/Hermione time travel is a thing I really enjoy as it places my favourite pairing into a whole new world away from the standard cast. I would especially like to see them warped to marauder time as a couple (or develop the relationship in the new time) while building up a friendship with the marauders.

There's never enough Harry/Fleur in the world.

Non Ice Queen Daphne is a bit of a rarity. Just not using the phrase Ice Queen of Slyhterin would already be a step up.

**** I love almost all the Daphne characterisations where she is a major character. But too often it's the Daphne where she has this "persona" to protect herself. Don't get me wrong I still massively enjoy these stories, but for a character that is such a blank slate (from canon) there is so much more that can be done with her. Astoria for instance actually has far more diversity in her characterisation while being a character that we see way less off.

Two of my favourite Daphne's (although I can't immediately recall the stories) are one where she actually really is the Ice Queen (not just a persona) in a post Hogwarts crime noir story and another one is on the other side of the spectrum where she is a witch of average intelligence who constantly swears (and actually not one of her standard fanon looks) which is in one of the marriage contract fics iirc. Although I cant recall the fic names from the top of my head the stories have stuck with me because of their distinctly different characterisations of Daphne.

You know this.”'Harry inhaled so sharply he choked on his spit. He hurriedly turned away, hacking and wheezing as he nearly asphyxiated on his own saliva.“Yeah,” Moody grimaced with a slight disgruntled noise hidden in his tone, “that's a problem.” Tom Riddle, 15 years old, in the middle of the London Blitz suddenly finds himself in a future with no allies, resources, information, and everyone he knows treats him with enough restraint to not murder him on the spot. It takes a lot to truly ruin a human being, to rot them so thoroughly even fruit flies avoid the stench. Tom doesn't want this bullshit, Tom only wants to- 'Please God, let me live.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.

**** There's a really good Snape/Hermione one called, ummm, Pride of Time? That does this. She's wearing the time turner for some reason when the DA gets discovered and falls and somehow goes back in time to the Marauder's era, with no way to get back, and yet it still follows the established "you can't change the past, because whatever you do, it already happened," kind of rules from PoA, even after she catches up with herself. It's really well done just for that aspect alone, IMO.

**** HPMoR had a little like that, where Harry first experienced the results of the time travel and then traveled back to cause them. For example he got rescued by himself, then rescued himself later. Unfortunately there were only a few scenes like that.

** Stories covering the later years of Hogwarts using the themes, tone and established structure of books one and two;

A sassy Harry going to school, learning magic, exploring Hogwarts, solving a mystery and going on an adventure with his friends to defeat Voldemort's latest scheme at the end of each year.

Then a mad rush back to their dorms before they are caught out after curfew by Filch and lose the house cup.

No angst, no politics, no accounting and definitely no death. Just some good friends going to magic school, growing up and occasionally getting up to some mischief along the way.

** Same about the Tom Riddle stories. I'd really like there to be some where maybe he comes to the present and helps Harry or something like that but most are time travel where Harry or Hermione come to the past and they fall in love.

Maybe it's how I'm looking but bashing fics that bash Lupin and Sirius more. I usually see Hermione, Weasleys and Dumbledore which is fine, I like those but I wanna see other people bashed too

Stories where Seamus has a major role that isn't Deamus (Seamus/Dean). I don't read slash and that's what most fics for him are or he's in the story but a minor character

** Stories with Winky in romances with a human. Fleshed out Winky in general. House elves are mostly used as just plot devices or tools, in fanfic as much as in canon. I want to see house elves as full out characters, with their own dreams and plots and stuff.

*** Ya house elves were a bit confusing what their deal was and why they were the way they were. Like Dobby was the only one who wanted to be free and paid. Was that just a result of brainwashing? Or like is there some kinda magical reason they dont want to be freed? Id love to see that concept explored.

**** Dobby was the only one we knew of, but I'm sure there were others out there. And others even before him. I think it's literally just brainwashing and slavery stockholm stuff. Dobby was fine and happy after being freed; if it had any magical consequence or something they would've shown it.

It's just horrible slavery of a whole species. And I don't like fanfics that try to go all mental gymnastics to justify it.

***** But it was horrifying that even after he was free, he still felt the need to punish himself when he said something negative about the Malfoys. He even said he'd jump off astronomy tower if he failed Harry in HbP. What have they done to him? And I bet this behaviour isn't something cured easily.

While I doubt we'll ever get a fully satisfying answer from any official source, I still feel that some understanding of the how's and why's of House Elves can be gleaned from their folklore counterpart, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownie_(folklore][Brownie]].
