I know I'm going to be shit on by both sides, but hear me out:

We all know about the standard Harry/Hermione fics. Harmony gets together, Ron/Ginny/Dumbledore/Molly gets bashed, love potion plot, unblocked magical cores, big trunk/bank account/wand(s), good goblins, etc etc etc. It's nothing new.

But here's the deconstruction: Instead of showing (mainly) Harmony's POV, how about Ron's? Maybe in 4th or 5th year Harry and Hermione get together (Yule Ball, after the Ministry battle), and Ron is understandably upset and feeling betrayed...but instead of bashing him to kingdom come, we see how he would realistically react to it, how he feels about his best friends hooking up, dive into his psyche a bit. He's bitter about the situation and makes the characteristic rude comments we all know for the rest of the school year (maybe a fight or two as well), finally takes a step back during the summer and channels his anger into something productive, maybe learns fanon curse breaking and/or runes from Bill and develops interests beyond Quidditch and chess, and comes back in 5th or 6th year with some distance from Harry and Hermione, makes new friends, discovers himself and eventually gets over Hermione.

(Insert quip about Indy!Harry clichés here.)

On the flip side, we see Harry and Hermione's POVs, how their relationship are going, how they feel about Ron's anger, distance and the effect on their friendships, his behaviour, new friends, etc. It wouldn't be the main focus of the fic, maybe once every four or five chapters, but often enough to get the gist of their side of things. Is their relationship as great as it seems to Ron? Do their canon personalities butt heads and they argue/avoid each other all the time? Do they break up? Do they fight with Ron after the summer and split their strained friendship further?

Meanwhile, canon events happen in the background and we see how the fractured Trio handles it.

Can it be done? Should it be done? Any fics that have this plotline? Thoughts?


** Amazing idea!!

In general I wish there were more Ron centric fics. Something that deals with his characterization and eventual development.

I really like these type of “introspective character analysis” fics. The ones that focuses more on a character's thoughts and emotions

** Related to that is my prompt, which I have also never seen written well: Ron when staying in the Hospital Wing has a lot of time to think about his actions, and he comes to one overwhelming conclusion: his relationship with Lavender was a disaster. And not because he should just drop her and pick up Hermione, but he should stop being a pick and start treat Lavender as his potential life-long partner, and start their relationship better. And thus the story continues as Ron/Lavender done well.

*** Yeah, I don't see Harry and Hermione working out long-term. They'd start out okay I think, but Hermione would get pissy that Harry wouldn't share everything with him, and Harry would ignore, deflect and eventually snap at Hermione when she inevitably bothered him too much. They care for each other but canon-wise it's just not a good fit. Ron and Hermione wouldn't work either, but they're at least friends-with-benefits/fling worthy.

Ron would have a better time away from Harry and Hermione, and his character could be so much more than the average Idiot!MoRon or Supportive Friend trope that is constantly put on him.

  Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class. “It's no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she's a nightmare, honestly. ”

  Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face -- and was startled to see that she was in tears.

  “I think she heard you.”

  “So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must've noticed she's got no friends.”

  Hermione laughed unkindly at Ron's disastrous first attempt, during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache; Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGonagall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again. She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron's just now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her.

  He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls' bathroom on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood, who was patting her vaguely on the back.

  “Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eyebrows is bright yellow?”

  “Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”

  He held out her books.

  “Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her eyes on her pencil case.

  “This whole tournament's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them!” said Hermione hotly.

  “No it isn't!” shouted Ron. “It's about winning!”

  People were starting to stare at them.

  “Ron,” said Harry quietly, “I haven't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum -”

  But Ron ignored Harry too.

  “Why don't you go and find Vicky, he'll be wondering where you are,” said Ron.

  “Don't call him Vicky!”

  Hermione jumped to her feet and stormed off across the dance floor, disappearing into the crowd. Ron watched her go with a mixture of anger and satisfaction on his face.

  “Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,” Harry said, looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet.

  “I can't, Harry. I've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read!” said Hermione, now sounding slightly hysterical. “Anyway...” She glanced over at Ron too. “He doesn't want me to join in.”

  There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn't just been eaten, he could have had some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them ---”

  Hermione burst into tears. Before Harry could say or do anything, she tucked the enormous book under her arm, and, still sobbing, ran toward the staircase to the girls' dormitories and out of sight.

  “Can't you give her a break?” Harry asked Ron quietly.

  “No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was sorry --- but she'll never admit she's wrong, Hermione. She's still acting like Scabbers has gone on vacation or something.”

  The Fat Lady and her friend Vi were snoozing in the picture over the portrait hole. Harry had to yell “Fairy lights!” before he woke them up, and when he did, they were extremely irritated. He climbed into the common room and found Ron and Hermione having a blazing row. Standing ten feet apart, they were bellowing at each other, each scarlet in the face.

  “Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?” yelled Hermione; her hair was coming down out of its elegant bun now, and her face was screwed up in anger .

  Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater's bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with an icy, sneering indifference.

****** I don't care enough to go pick quotes from canon again, but I'm pretty sure you are nitpicking. All the quotes you took are from scenes where Ron and Hermione are having their worst rows.

Outside of these, there are a lot of moments where they are arguing about minor subjects and where their friendship doesn't seem to be at stack at all. When Ron express his preference on girls in GoF, when Hermione express her disapproval of their Divination homework, or when she argues with him about how he broke the mood between Harry and Cho because of /Quidditch/.

******* The idea that a couple enjoys rows is the result of media where it's a cheap and easy tool to add drama. IRL the benchmark of a good relationship is the ability to solve disputes without having to raise your voice, nevermind having an actual fight. If you ask the people with good relationships, they have fewer fights in a decade than we see Ron and Hermione have, if any.

******** I think "rows" is a term too strong for what Ron and Hermione do most of the time. I won't deny they have some of them (see the scenes quoted by KonoCrowleyDa), but outside of them, they mostly squabble.

Also, I don't think people should use canon events to judge their married life. Canon show their teenage years, where they have to learn how to deal with feelings and hormone, they are supposed to keep growing up even after the story end.\\
Ron actions in GoF can be forgiven when he is a teenager, but an adult doing the same would be a man child at best and not someone positive to spend time with. In the same way, it's one thing to forgive a 17 years old Hermione after what she did in HbP, but any adult acting the same should be put in front of a judge because she technically assaulted him.

Finally, I just want to point that the reasons for most of Ron and Hermione rows, or at least their worst ones (if we ignore Scabbers situation that should never happen again), is their difficulty to deal with their feeling for each other. I doubt adult Ron would be jealous about anyone taking Hermione to a ball (especially since he is supposed to be her date for all of them), and I doubt Hermione would have to deal with another Lavender Brow (especially because it would become cheating). So there is no reasons why they should have others "rows", though squabbles are fine.

But with all the rows they would still remember, I don't see them staying together because there'd always be the subconscious "what if that kind of thing happens again"? And the "dealing with feelings" was often one-sided. Hermione felt nothing for Ron in GoF and he obviously had other priorities (Lavender) in early HBP.

You mean like cheating on your driver's exam by using magic illegally, and apparently /lying to your wife/ about it? Because that seems quite childish and is basically the /only/ thing we know about Ron from the Epilogue. (CC doesn't do Ron many favors either.)

#+end_quote

I hear this argument sometimes (and I don't disagree that Hermione's actions are nasty), but her actions need to be seen in context in the Wizarding world. HBP is also the place where we see Ron /throw a knife/ at Fred for joking about Ron's inability to attract women. And when Molly calls him on it and basically says, "Stop throwing knives at your brother!" Ron says she'll never /see him/ throw a knife at his brother again (implying he'll keep doing it). Violence is clearly quite common in the Wizarding world. In a place where healing spells can undo a lot of serious physical damage rather effortlessly and quickly, people sometimes take more extreme actions against each other. I think your idea that Hermione would be "in front of a judge" is clear hyperbole, as there's no evidence such actions would be taken in canon for such minor violence.

Again, not saying what Hermione does isn't nasty -- but it needs to be read in context of canon.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Ron gets jealous and really acts awful in HBP because he finds out Hermione kissed Krum /two years earlier/. That's not normal jealousy. That's a level of rather obsessive possessiveness that /could/ lead to an unhealthy adult relationship. Sure, maybe he grows out of it, but canon evidence is Ron has rather irrational jealousy around Hermione. In DH when Hermione gets upset once and Harry seems like he's going to comfort her, Ron bounds up and snags his arm around her first, and then later he accuses Hermione of "choosing" Harry (with clear implication, based on the later Horcrux vision), even though the two of them have done nothing.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I have no idea how adult Ron would behave. CC implies Ron is still very much in love with Hermione, but he also admits there that he got so drunk on his wedding day that he doesn't remember saying his vows. Is that a one-off event, or could it become a pattern? People who get that drunk can behave erratically. We also have the setup for a marriage where Hermione is likely incredibly busy professionally (eventually becoming Minister) while Ron seems to have a much more lax work-schedule around running a joke shop. Aside from Hermione's excitement when Ron executes the basilisk teeth idea at the end of DH, there are precious few times in canon that we see Hermione actively praising or proud of Ron. JKR herself has said Hermione would have to work on being "less critical" of Ron in their relationship, and Ron would have to work on self-esteem.

You know the kind of relationship where cheating is likely? When one person doesn't appreciate the other so they go looking for affection elsewhere and where the first person is preoccupied with things like work while the other has the freedom to... well, do other things with his time.

I am NOT saying Ron would cheat. I'm saying the canon evidence we have and JKR's comments around their relationship kind of set up a scenario where cheating is more likely than in a more healthy equal relationship.

Again, to be clear, /maybe/ all of this could be worked out as adults. But I think you're significantly downplaying the potential red flags.

I feel JKR did him no favors in his portrayal as an adult in the epilogue and in CC, which makes me disappointed. But it's what we have as evidence of Ron as adult, so we have to deal with it.

And I also am not a Hermione-defender. I repeatedly said her actions were "nasty." Ron and Hermione were both horrible to each other on quite a few occasions. I'm just trying to provide canon context, which I think is necessary to interpret actions.

But whatever. Downvote me to hell for providing canon evidence and JKR comments to back up my assertions, rather than meaningless speculation like most comments. Feel free to disagree and provide your own context if you'd like. I'm not saying mine is the only interpretation.

******* I'd never date my best friend in the first place, but I don't like the trope of "friends always argue or banter". I have my best friend who I've been in one fight with from age 12-20. 8 years, that's more than Hogwarts' time. Of course we don't always agree on everything, but we are extremely compatible hence being best friends. What we never do is scream at each other. Never have I once yelled at her or vice a versa. The one fight we did have was due to lack of communication when my dad was in the hospital dying and I felt like she wasn't there for me emotionally, but I was so upset I didn't even ask her for help I just talked to her on the phone for 2 minutes, said thanks, and hung up. Then the next day we cried in the school guidance counselors office together.

​

However, I do/did have another friend that I argued with all the time. We argued/bantered in good nature almost every day just like Ron and Hermione. In fact, my other friends have repeatedly said that we remind them of Ron and Hermione. Except the fact that neither of us would ever date because I would off myself if I was in a relationship with him. We've stopped talking recently and we had a huge huge months long argument over the new year that was just resolved in April which was very similar to Ron fighting Hermione about Scabbers or the Firebolt. But, we aren't the same as we used to be before that fight and I know that fight will always linger in our minds. This is most likely the same for Ron and Hermione. Who wants to argue and fight and scream at their friends or loved one? No one! And Ron screams at Hermione for no reason constantly, and then she cries and yells in retaliation. Of course Harry also raised his voice a few times in canon, but he's extremely mentally ill and no one ever recognizes that.

​

Long story short, in my opinion Romione will never work out in the long run due to lack of trust, anger issues, and how both sides get so worked up with each other. Sounds like a shitty relationship to me. (I don't ship Harmione either, so don't come at me for that.)

****** Actually there is a lot of evidence suggesting that they actually enjoyed their bickering.

Most people associate arguing negatively, I mean and rightly so, shouting at each other isn't that romantic. But some people are just argumentative by nature, and enjoy a good debate, I know I do. And Hermione did too. Hermione is always seeking a good verbal spar; always picking fights wether it's over Lavander over her rabbit, Luna over her theories, Umbridge over Ministry rules, Professor Trelawney over Divination, Parvati also over Divination, and basically everyone over house elves. Because Hermione finds a good debate mentally stimulating, a way to use her intelligence, and a good, albeit not very productive, way to blow off steam and pent up anger.

Ron is also very argumentative. As he grew up with a big family, he doesn't necessarily associate arguments with negativity, unlike Harry who, growing up with the Dursley's, most definitely does. It's safe to assume that Ron's childhood was filled with him having to argue to get attention.

As for the evidence they enjoy their fights? Well it was said by Harry that they were constantly bickering, but most of the time, despite their constant bickering, they are fine in each other's company, remember when Ron and Hermione went to Hogsmede alone in the Prisoner of Azkaban and they returned 'looking as though they'd had the time of their lives.' and how whenever Harry would come back into the common room they'd always conveniently be sitting next to each other.

It's only when the argument hits close to home that they gets mad, and most of their squabbles would be like oh orange juice is better than apple juice or you should put the milk in before the cereal ( you should put milk after you weirdos, fight me ) and yet we never see them arguing over such trivial matters in detail, because those fights don't turn into screaming matches. Because most of their fights had no real anger behind them. So it is very likely they argue simply because they enjoy arguing.

Plus when Harry snaps and tells them to stop fighting they 'both froze, looking angry and offended.' Angry, not at each other, but at Harry for interrupting their fight, because they were enjoying it.

P.S : I don't ship Romione, I don't think they'd work in the long term, but not because of their arguing, but rather because they're both to stubborn and passionate.

#+end_quote

Just wanted to say that I've heard this interpretation of that scene several times, and I think it's really reading a lot into the text. Ron and Hermione are clearly mostly angry and offended because their best friend (Harry) suddenly yelled at them to "shut up." That's not a nice thing to do, and they're both a bit shocked. That's probably the most reasonable /surface level/ interpretation of what the text says there.

I think it's reaching quite a bit to claim they're offended because they were having a wonderful happy time, and I think it's often only an argument made by people who want to soften the negative interactions between Ron and Hermione. Sure, they may have fallen into a /bad habit/ of bickering, and they don't realize how annoying it is for others to hear. (That's certainly true of most of the bickering couples I've encountered.) But it's a quite different thing to say they /enjoy/ it.

Some people enjoy /debate/. That is, /respectful/ argumentation. Ron and Hermione are rarely very respectful to each other in their arguments, even when they're only having a "bickering" debate -- Hermione throws quite a few insults at Ron over the course of the books, and both tend to get testy. I know lots of people who enjoy a good (even heated) debate; I don't know anyone who /enjoys/ "bickering." (The dictionary definition of the word "bickering" carries with it a connotation of disrespectful quarreling about trivial things.)

But I agree with your post that JKR wants us to understand that Ron and Hermione clearly must enjoy being in each other's company. We're just very rarely shown why that is in text, while instead we see an emphasis on somewhat negative interactions.

** I think this is a very good idea, actually. Unfortunately, I don't know of any stories like this. I'm currently writing a Harry/Hermione story right now that takes place after Deathly Hallows (ignoring the Epilogue) in which Harry develops feelings for Hermione during Order of the Phoenix but doesn't act upon them until years later. When Ron finds about Harry's feelings for Hermione, he decides to leave England for Paris, and in doing so, gets over the up-and-coming relationship between Harry and Hermione. The story, however, isn't told from Ron's POV, but Harry's instead.

** Things like this have been done from Ron's POV, though usually with Ron either clueless about what's going on with H/Hr or overly supportive of them (rather than more realistically jealous). And quite a few Harmony fics over the years have emphasized Ron's perspective, even if his viewpoint isn't the only (or most prominent) one in the fic.

One somewhat decent one that comes to mind is [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/9101]["Whatever I Am To You" by Aeryn]], a longish one-shot that begins with Ron's POV soon after the final battle in DH, then moves to Harry's POV, then Hermione's.

I feel like I've read some other ones that were also more neutral with Ron's POV (i.e., not making him too OOC), but they aren't common, I agree.

My only other main comment is:

#+begin_quote
  We all know about the standard Harry/Hermione fics. Harmony gets together, Ron/Ginny/Dumbledore/Molly gets bashed, love potion plot, unblocked magical cores, big trunk/bank account/wand(s), good goblins, etc etc etc. It's nothing new.
#+end_quote

If this is your perception of Harmony fics, I think you may need to read around more. I know you are presenting a stereotype, but I personally quite dislike bashing fics. I think love potion plots are stupid. And the rest... has nothing to do with H/Hr. I almost exclusively read H/Hr these days, and I was actually quite shocked the other day when I got partway through a story and saw a love potion plot device appear -- I have so rarely seen a fic recommended by other Harmony fans that involve these that I haven't read "one in the wild" in quite a few years. (Maybe there are teenagers still writing these regularly with bad grammar/spelling or something and posting somewhere, but I don't read trash.)

And bashing is a matter of degree, but I personally can't stand the more overt ones (as I actually like all of the characters, with all of their good and bad). Yet still I have found hundreds and hundreds of great H/Hr stories. I'd say the majority of stories that I have seen highly recommended on [[/r/hpharmony]] don't involve significant bashing.

Which all is context to say that *Ron* */can/* *be presented with nuance in Harmony fics and sometimes is/./* It's more rare to see his POV, but I've definitely read quite a few fics with him as a major secondary character who reacts in something like the way you describe.

**** Now, Harry/Hermione is not my cup of tea(sometimes because of the reasons you expounded) but I enjoy the odd gem here and there.

Many of the good ones have no bashing. And in many Ron is the supportive friend.

Ron is loyal to Harry, he would get sad, grumpy, but it would not stop him from helping Harry.

It may have made him more vulnerable to the pendant Horcrux though.

***** What the stans don't get is that Harry and Ron would still be friends, but when Harry and Hermione hook up there would just be too many snide comments and arguing between them that'll strain the bond. Over the summer Ron will come to his senses, pick up some new hobbies and distance himself from Harmony, make some friends and re-establish his friendship with Harry. Kind of like the fourth year fight, but a bit longer. He'll become more fleshed out that way.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yup, if he's not based or treated like an idiot, he's supportive and endlessly kissing ass. He's allowed to be angry and hurt for more than a chapter or two. Ron puts in a lot of effort emotionally in his friendship with Harry, and it's never really appreciated by anyone in-universe or out. That's why it's Ron-centric with a dash of Harmony. I want to see Ron's POV.

***** Ron getting over someone who he's been crushing on since at least CoS (facing his greatest fear to save Hermione) by 4th or 5th year "quickly" is just not in-character. Ron's not the type of person to get over something quickly. He was hurt/angry about Victor nearly two years after he and Hermione went out in HBP, and most people with crushes that last longer than a year don't get over it fast (<6 months). If you are, kudos, but let's keep Fanon!Ron perceptions out of it okay?

+(It's also funny that the same Harmony stans that think Ron would "get over it quickly" are the same ones who like and favourite fics where Ron potions Hermione/fights with Harry for months on end. I really love the hypocrisy.)+

Only when you want to make a point, it seems. 🙄🙄🙄

Ron puts way more emotionally into the friendship than Harry does. When Harmony becomes a thing, Hermione can shoulder all Harry's needs, Harry can try to get past his abusive upbringing, and Ron can do his own thing and develop more interests away from them, and in a way flesh out Dean, Seamus, Neville and others.

******** The big issue with this is that if both parties develop themselves into different directions, you end up with less and less of a friendship. There are other friends you'd rather hang out with, non mutual interests so you spend less time together - Basically, this is how a friendship dies in most cases. Not with an epic fight, but it simply fizzles out.

** heck yeah it should be done. In this fic, who would become Ron's new confident? Neville? Dean? Someone outside the Griffindor house? How will this new friendship effect Ron's outlook/beliefs/values? When/if he is ready to move on romantically, who would he be attracted to? Lavender? Susan? Luna? Pansy? (I once read a fic that had a side of Ron/Pansy and it one of the few times I didn't despise Ron's character in fanfic).

So many aspects to explore --the 'revenge scenarios' dreamed up by Hurt!Ron. Friends taking sides (and the one's who don't take any side).

<EDIT>

Basically, someone based a self-insert fic on one of RobSt's fanfics, where he ends up inside Ron's body.

  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.
