**** For the sake of the frivolous coupling and sex-ed talk, you might enjoy the side story linkffn(Holly Polter), wherein the fem!Harry protag hooks up with Harry from canon. Chapter 4 in particular covers Harry's first time(s).

#+begin_quote
  Pre-5th year, Harry is visited by a woman claiming to be his magical Aunt Holly, except that she can't cast spells... or keep her hands off of him... or stay out of trouble. Holly/Harry/we're not sure what'll happen. Not just naughty- it's knotty (as in subject to entanglement).

*** I'm reading /Princess of the Blacks/ right now, but I'm getting some Sue-ish vibes from Jennifer Potter as early on as the second chapter. "Being the only known person to survive a certain ritual", anyone? Or "Sonar-like magic"? It's otherwise decently written, but there seems to be too much that happens off-screen, resulting in too much exposition / "telling" the reader what happened.

** In one of my stories, harry's already had one sex talk snd he'll get one or two more before from his godfather then there'll be a 'class' that's rather prudish on it before he and his then-paramour lose their virginity, likely in fith year but maybe summer before.

Why don't you check out the sword of gryffindor? It's an erotic comedy, though, might be too comedic for what you want,
