Harry is still tempted to reunite it instead of the Horcruxes at some point.

He finds he has the +emerald eyes+ Triforce of courage

Voldemort has the +ruby evil eyes+ Triforce of power

Dumbledore has the +sapphire cobalt azure eyes+ Triforce of wisdom

​

Also, there are no Horcruxes... Dumbledore actually tells Harry the true path to defeat Voldemort is awakening all of the sages of Wizarding Britain.

​

Hagrid, the sage of the forest, representing the giants

Charlie, the sage of fire, representing the dragons

Fleur, the sage of water, representing the veelas

Flitwick, the sage of light, representing the goblins

Lupin, the sage of soul, representing the werewolves

Snape, the sage of shadow, representing the gloomy bat-like people


** Gloomy bat people. Love it

** Why do all the others get an actual member of their species (or at least a half-member) to represent them, but the dragons just get a normal-ass human who likes dragons?

Does this make the Sword o' Gryffindor the Master Sword?

*** Giants aren't really forest people, though, they live in mountain ranges. Hagrid is definitely the Forest sage by being Groundskeeper in this. If the sage had to be a representative of a forest race, it'd be Firenze, or, for shits and giggles, Aragog.
