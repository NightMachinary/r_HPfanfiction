Does anyone have any recommendations for resources that might be helpful when writing Harry Potter fanfiction?

There are the obvious things like the various wikis, of course, but I've been looking for other aides. For example, I was going over the fourth book in preparation for a potential fic that completely ignores canon beyond GoF, and I was surprised to discover that Harry only learned the Stunning Spell and the Impediment Curse shortly before the Third Task. And Harry was practicing I've been reading fanfiction for so long that I never really paid any attention to some of the smaller details like /when/ Harry or the other students learned spells. Do any of the writers among our numbers have suggestions for resources that discuss the smaller details? I'm trying to be fairly close to canon -- or at least, I'm trying to avoid using too much fanon -- so knowing what is or is not canon is very helpful.

I personally tend to use the [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page][Harry Potter Wiki]] when I need to look something specific up, but it does seem to sometimes have trouble distinguishing between the movies and the books at times.

I think I used to use the [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/][Harry Potter Lexicon]], but I can't seem to navigate the site nowadays.

And of course there's [[https://www.pottermore.com/][Pottermore]], which is great if you want to explore with some visual inspiration and a little background information, but not exactly helpful when you need to look up something specific.

Oh, and [[http://potterwords.livejournal.com/9493.html][Potterwords]] has been very helpful for remembering exactly how Rowling's various made-up words are spelled and capitalized.

And I've recently discovered the excellent [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Muggles%27_Guide_to_Harry_Potter][Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]], which has a wide variety of information, including when spells were first mentioned in the books.

And finally, I also recently found/rediscovered TVTropes's [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FandomSpecificPlot/HarryPotter][Fandom Specific Plots]], which is basically a list of some of the many, many tropes in our fandom across the ages. (It's kind of interesting to go through it and see which tropes have faded away and which are still going strong.)


** Not /Harry Potter/ specific, but some basic British English resources are always useful:

[[http://www.boredpanda.com/british-american-english-differences-language/][British vs American English, illustrated]]

[[https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/quick-grammar/british-english-and-american-english][Quick grammar comparisons]]

Wikipedia's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English][Comparison of American and British English]], which also has some helpful websites in the external links section.

** Adding to this, if you liked the old Lexicon format better, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2zol6h/hp_lexicon_archive_for_offline_use_download/][here]] is a link to download a copy.

*** The old Lexicon had better info. I think they're still moving a lot of the older stuff over, but I could be wrong. The new one is very lightweight in comparison.

**** Everything from the old site is now on the new site, with the exception of the calendars (huge tables don't translate easily, we're still working on it), the atlas (my project this week), and the timeline. That last is proving to be trickier than we thought. We have every event entered in the database but it's surprisingly difficult to chronologically organize events which don't always have set dates or the same level of precision. Where exactly do you place a set of events which might have 1) only a year given or 2) events that take place "in the spring" or 3) others for which we can determine to be in, say, the first couple of weeks of December, etc. We have a system now that we think will work, but it's still a work in progress.

***** Really? Because I was using your "Potterwords" page for awhile before it disappeared, and it disappearing from your page is part of why I said I was having trouble finding stuff. (Though the post announcing it still shows up if you search for it: [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2005/10/15/october-15-2005/]] )

And yeah, I just about gave up on trying to figure out exactly when canon events happened. I'm sure someone is going to call me out on it if I ever manage to post my fic, lol.

****** Potterwords was created by someone else, who gave us permission to place it on the Lexicon. Some time ago she emailed me and asked that I remove it from the site, which I did. She didn't give me any explanation. Sorry about that!

***** Oh, wow, thanks for the thorough explanation. Did not expect that. My original comment sounds jerkish/unappreciative, now that I'm looking at it again -- sorry for that. My only excuse is that I /really/ miss some of the older pages (no other site is as good a substitute).

Thanks for the hard work you guys do.

****** I didn't take it as at all jerkish. I completely understand. I'm just glad that the Lexicon is useful to fans. That's one reason why I took advertising off the site -- I find all the ads on the Harry Potter Wiki to be distracting, and I figure as long as I can afford to pay for it myself (with a little help from Patreon), I'll keep it ad free.

*** Hey! Just FYI, it is actually illegal to download an entire website without permission from the website owner (violation of copyright law). However, you could always ask. I understand that the guy who owns the Lexicon is pretty strongly pro-fan.

**** It's /rude/ (using up someone's bandwidth), but I don't think it's illegal. Copyright is about distribution, not copying for one's own use.

Are you by any chance affiliated with the Lexicon?

***** Yep, I'm the guy who created the site and I'm still the editor in chief. There's currently an international team of fans who are working on the Lexicon, which in its old form was hand-coded in 1990s and is now basically impossible to edit. We had to do something to make it usable on smaller screens and edit-able. Our big projects right now are improving search and re-creating our timeline (I created the original Potter timeline that's now used by Rowling etc. as canon).

The Lexicon has always been by and for fans, but until the new site came out it also had to have some advertising on it to help cover the costs. That means that if you archived the site instead of using it live, you took away our income, and that would have been slightly problematic. However, when we created the new site, I decided to just pay for it myself and get rid of the ads. I have a Patreon page and get a little bit of income from that, but that's not even close to being enough to pay the bills.

So if you use an archived version of the Lexicon, you're not taking anything away from the running of the site. It's out of date and incomplete, but I'm glad it's still useful to you. The text is protected by copyright, but if you're not redistributing the site or claiming it as your own, I'm not fussed if you use your own copy.

I hope you do give the new version a try, though. It has a lot more functionality and it's fanatically up to date. The search will be getting better and better, and we're adding features all the time. Since there are no ads, this isn't a sales pitch. We're just twenty fans who would love to welcome all Harry Potter fans to enjoy and benefit from our work, and to use the Lexicon as their starting point for researching Potter canon on the web.

** [[http://www.accessdenied-rms.net/guide/fwg.txt][This]] is easily the best guide I have ever come across. It starts as a general guide, then gets into Potter-specific stuff a little later.
