  In J.K. Rowling's first draft it wasn't Hagrid that found Harry Potter in Godric's Hollow, but a lowly dentist named Granger. What if he had? Harry Potter is brought before the muggle authorities, an apparent orphan. With Daniel Granger named the child's temporary guardian, he disappears into the muggle world. LittleBro!Harry, BigSis!Hermione. Not a HP/HG Ship. Canon Pairings.

*** It's slow. 1.4mo words just to cover the space of a single year. There's a lot of drama that, like romantic or sit-coms, could be resolved if the characters had just talked. The story does not wrap everything up. It has a good ending point, like the end of any of the first six Potter books, but there are loose threads.

For all that, it is one of the best written pieces I have read. It is meticulously researched (I've learned a lot from his chapter notes alone). I found all the characters to be in character. I enjoyed the slow burn romance. It's definitely not for everyone, but I liked it a lot.
