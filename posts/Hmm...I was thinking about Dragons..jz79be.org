We all love dragons. Stories including these giant, fire-spitting lizards have been around for centuries. Every culture has its version of them, there are all sorts of varieties and they cannot be missing in any half-decent fantasy novel. The thing is...I do find them lacklustre in HP. Yes, I know, they aren't the main theme of the story, but still.

So, I was thinking, and I feel like Harry Potter with more dragons has a nice ring to it. I'm sure there are a few fics involving more dragons, but something more dystopian is what I crave.

So, as a prompt, maybe even an inspirational nudge, I offer this:

Area 51 does not hide UFO remains, Alien technology or the dead bodies of alien life. Area 51 hides a monster wizardkind has long forgotten. A destroyer of worlds, this monstrous dragon has been under a stasis spell for centuries, but it is wearing thin. Dumbledore knows this and is searching frantically for a way to deal with it. Then, during the first task/of the TWT, he sees something incredible: Harry Potter is not just merely the Boy-Who-Lived. He is also the Boy-Who-Speaks-With-Dragons.

*How did the muggles get that dragon?* Maybe they stumbled upon it. Maybe top-top secret union between super important muggles and wizards.

*What is so special about that dragon?* Dunno, I just watched a clip of King Ghidorah from Godzilla: King Of The Monsters and it looked so cool and I figured that something like that would make for a more fun and world-ending threat than Voldemort. Like, a three-headed, electricity-spitting dragon-monster-thing? Hells yes. I always liked it when dragons, or dragon-like monsters, had more to them than just spitting fire. Like, something elemental or so. Imagination is a wonderful thing.

*Why is Harry able to communicate with dragons?* Why shouldn't he be?

I hope some of you guys find this prompt interesting!

  A grim, realistic take at what might happen if Harry were to actually try speaking Parseltongue to the dragon in the First Task. Warning: Dark.

** I don't remember a name, but there was this story where Hogwarts had a Dragon imprisoned inside it. Some kind of pocket dimension prison, I think. Said prison was weakening.

Seems to fit.

*** Can you read this as a stand-alone? Or do you need to read the sequels? I see the author sadly passed away, so the last book won't be finished.

**** Hmm I think the story doesn't really resolve if I remember correctly, it's more like just an unending explanation of the politics of trying to actually set up a dragon nation on Earth.

** In breath of the inferno by primordial vortex Harry is a dragon animagus but more of a Tolkien dragon like Smaug, and is much bigger than the regular HP dragons

Sadly the fic is kind dead and the author has stated they lost interest in HP FanFiction to the point of only considering Harry going off worlding with different crossovers.
