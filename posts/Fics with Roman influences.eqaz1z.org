There are a number of fics where old druidic/Celtic/viking magic is performed or rituals conducted, or holidays celebrated. Looking at canon though, with the latinish spells and the heavy Roman influence names, it seems like if witches and wizards in England were to hold to any religious heritage, it would be Roman. Are there any fics where this is capitalized on? Preferably no Percy Jackson crossovers.


** Would be a cool concept if there were 4 different types of purebloods that had different beliefs from all the different invasions. Each of them would have 7 families as part of sacred 28.

1) Celtic 2) Nordic/Scandinavian 3) Romans 4) French/Norman

You could expand certain powers or family traits with different families.

**** If it actually worked (which apparently it doesn't right now :( ), then there is a bot which goes through all new comments on this subreddit and fills in the extensive additional information about the story. See for example [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/eppr91/character_goes_to_university/felfjpd/]] If you look at the URL of that story, it is =https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2870133/1/= ... that first number after =/s/= is the story ID on [[http://www.fanfiction.net][www.fanfiction.net]]. So, if I write here linkffn(2870133), then the bot should find this and the information you see below that comment of mine. =linkao3()= does the same, but for [[https://archiveofourown.org]] (where, =https://archiveofourown.org/works/14078862/chapters/32436069= gives the story ID 14078862 and linkao3(14078862) should make the bot to provide additional information).

When it doesn't work (beacuse the bot is broken, it happens too often), the reply to that message of yours with the one which has only =ffnbot!refresh= as a text, and the bot should retry.

** Britain has always been very... blended. Half our culture is brought in by others coming in or stolen when we went to them. Most likely, we'd end up with some people being Druidic, some Wiccan, some Norse, some Roman, some European Variations, etc.

I don't remember any fics taking advantage of Roman Religions, though. Christianity being adopted by the Emperors in the early Hundred-ADs kind of kicked most of the older Religions to the curb and stole their ideas to better integrate their believers. Since magicals would still be mainstream at that point (pre-Statute and all), it'd be quite likely they'd convert from whatever cult, mystery, or school they'd been in before.

It's a shame that it hasn't been used in more fics, really. The Greco-Roman views on Religion were really interesting. Check out the wikipedia article on 'Greco-Roman mysteries', if you're interested in reading more. I've only scanned it briefly, but it seems surprisingly accurate.

  It was a great honour to carry her Lord's issue, and she will be further rewarded when her unborn daughter will be devoured by the Dark Lord to free himself from sleep. The mere thought of her blood flowing through the Dark Lord's veins made her weak in the knees. However, Bellatrix Lestrange's family begs to differ.
