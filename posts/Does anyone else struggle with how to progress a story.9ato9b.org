For a few years now I have considered writing fan fiction and the only thing holding me back is figuring what to do after the beginning. I can write 10-20k words that introduce the setting and start the story, but run into a virtual brick wall of what to write after that.

Does anyone else have a similar problem or any advice on how to solve/bypass the issue?


** In you don't already outline your stories beforehand, you probably should.

A lot of the time the problem is that authors don't actually plan the actual direction the story is supposed to go in, which leaves them stuck after reaching a certain point.

*** Hey, /I/ don't really have an outline save for a very vague years-skipping plan of things I want to see happen at some point. I just make things up as I can go along and it's been serving me well.

Mind, not everyone's like that.

**** Same. I once did a detailed outline for all seven years of a Slytherin Ginny fic, and never wrote more than 2000 words of actual story. Knowing where the story was going actually just bored the crap out of me when I sat down to write it.

** I'm a seat of the pants writer. Usually I come up with the beginning idea and ending idea and then I sort of faff around until I come up with a middle and get the two ends to meet.

I find that coming up with the end resolution is key. It doesn't have to be super complicated--it can be a very simple concept, say, Harry and a Thestral yearling become best friends. Now you can brainstorm ideas about how that comes to be. What sort of obstacles are there to Harry befriending this young Thestral? How are those obstacles overcome and how do Harry and the Thestral change and grow in the course of the story? These are all things that go into the middle, meaty part of the story.

I'm working towards becoming less seat of the pants and doing at least a rudimentary outline with the broad strokes of the story I want to tell. I also try and note down goals that I want to achieve in each chapter. Sometimes those goals are met, sometimes they're not or some goals get moved to new chapters.

Also, make sure that you're honoring the plot of the story. Go over your writing with an eye to what moves the plot forward and what doesn't. Maybe try writing a one-shot with a strict word limit so you get used to the concept of moving things along. I have some one shots that are 10k words and some that are 2k, but they are each complete stories with a beginning, middle and end.

** I recommend checking out [[https://jimbutcher.livejournal.com/][Jim Butcher's livejournal]] and doing a CTRL+F to find his writeup on "The Great Swampy Middle". I'm not at all a fan of the Dresden Files, but his writing advice is on point.

** Don't feel like you have to write "linearly". Write whatever idea you have at that moment and piece it together later. For /Second Best/ I've written my 4th year, then I wrote my 3rd year and now am playing around with year 1. Like you, I tried to start year 1 and only got around 20k words in. I found it helped a lot to just jump later on and just write whatever I felt would work, even if it was far in the future.

Editing will let you make it all line up and work out, don't feel like you need to write part 1 --> part 2 --> part 3. It's ok to start with part 3. It's already been said, but outlining helps a lot, and if you don't have a good outline it becomes ten times harder. Best of luck!

** Ask yourself, what would Harry do? Or any other character that has a stake in the story really. Something happened in that 10-20k words you got down, and people react to events, so put yourself in their shoes. What do they know or not know? Are they upset or emotional in some way? How would they respond? Then it's a set of dominoes. If that character acts, someone's going to be impacted and how will they react.

If it's the writing itself that's problematic, then relax and write something bad. It can be down right horrible, but as long as it moves forward in some way, either towards an idea or fleshing out a character, it's enough. Then look back at it and decide what made it bad. You now have a better clue about what to avoid and what is good. You can review your own work and prune until it's not even recognizable as that initial bad draft. Don't be afraid to throw out crappy parts or to rewrite a scene.

** I generally don't start a story (past the prompt/snippet) unless I have the ending in mind and a rough outline of how to get there. That gives a direction. But when I write, I tend to follow the "action-reaction" method - I let the characters act and react to the situation at hand and the actions of others. That often leads to some unplanned detours, but makes writing the next chapter easier.

** Yeah I think that's a very common problem. I think a huge amount of story ideas start with a single scene or chapter (for HP it was the epilogue, for ASoIaF the scene where they find the Direwolves).

Coming up with a coherent plotline from that is IMHO quite hard. I think it's easier to start with an idea for a basic plot, but in my experience that's rarer (though some people work like that).

** No I do not have this problem! :) My advice is yes write out the whole story before you make it!!! :) :) I got my whole story written by chapter, with important plot stuff written out and smaller stuff listed too, so that I do always know what to write in every chapter and how it will all fit as a whole! :) The only thing that is crap is if I get newer ideas or something because then I have to rearrange plot events and stuff to make some stuff make sense with other stuff. :)
