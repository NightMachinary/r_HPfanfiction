A while ago a read a fanfic I enjoyed, but i forgot to save it. Now when I try to search for it, it keeps taking me to Technomage which i have read and know it's not it. The story I'm looking for is a Harry Potter fanfic where Harry's brother is named the BWL and Harry gets sent away. Harry later ends up with the Fantastic Four where he is adopted and has all the powers of Franklin. Harry later teams up with the Power Pack under the name of Tattletale. As Tattletale he even has a run in with the Potters and the Weasleys. Any help in finding it would be great.
