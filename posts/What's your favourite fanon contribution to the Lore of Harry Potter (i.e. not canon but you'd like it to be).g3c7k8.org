For me it's wards and how people approach arthmancy/runes.

Wards are such a staple of magic in fantasy but it's not a thing in the books which I find surprising. There are wide ranging protection spells, but they aren't specifically called wards. I like how writers have described construction, types, influence etc.

And Arithmancy in real life is a sort of type of divination but I like how some writers have taken this and developed it into a really well defined type of magic relating to either spell creation or methodically predicting the future (like a really complicated magical probability).

What do you think?


** I've loved a number of the course syllabi some people have created to give more structure to Hogwarts courses and what is learned each year. Specifically for Defense Against the Dark Arts.

1st Year: Running away, defense against muggles and animals. Spells and jinxes learned are designed to help a small child escape from a dangerous situation and get to help. Things like the leg locker and jelly legs jinxes should be more than enough to incapacitate a muggle or mundane animal so the wizarding child can escape.

2nd Year: Magical pests and creatures like doxies should be covered this year, X and XX magical creatures. More difficult spells still suited to helping a child escape a dangerous situaiton.

3rd Year: Dark and dangerous Magical Creatures, XXX class in practice, XXXX and XXXXX in theory. How to deal with things like hinkypucks and grindelows as well as what to know about creatures like werewolves and dragons. Continuation of spells to escape dangerous situations, preparing for confrontations with wizards.

4th Year: Knowledge of curses and hexes. Practice with counter curses. Spellwork designed to help a teen escape from a dangerous and more experiences adult wizard.

5th Year: Continuation of fourth year spell work regarding confrontations with other wizards. Prep for more advanced spellwork to help stand your ground.

6th Year: Dealing with and escaping XXXX and XXXXX creatures. Spells and spell work suited for situations where incapacitating an attacker is more important or feasible than escape. Silent casting.

7th Year: Continuation of 6th year. Development of skills needed for DMLE employees, Aurors, Curse Breakers, etc. Point casting. Special projects related to Defense.

​

I like this syllabus because it implies that each of the professors Harry had made at least some attempt at matching the standard syllabus for their class in their own way, with exception of 5th year for obvious reasons.

​

Seventh year brings up a couple other fanon things that I like. Point casting as the next step in spellwork. Wand, Wand Movement, and Incantation are all components to help cast a spell. As proficiency is increased wizards can begin to cast without them, resulting in Silent Casting, Point casting (just point or wave the wand generally, no movement required), and wandless casting. Also, Seventh Year projects. I like the idea that seventh years undertake a final project of their choosing under the supervision of the professor in each class they pursue through NEWTS.

**** I've got a potions syllabus too. Well, its a potions syllabus that I think should be the standard. Not one that Snape followed. Its not as interesting as the Defense one in my opinion as most years are just "more advanced potions" but I'll go ahead and post it

​

Year 1: Basic ingredient reactions. Safety. Prep work skills. Basic potions with minor effects that can introduce skills in small batches. Eg, cover proper slicing in lecture, make a simple potion that is a mix of sliced shrivelfig and whole newt eyes stewed for half an hour. Term 2 is basic potions combining different skills.

Year 2: Reiteration of basic ingredient reactions. Brew work skills. Basic potions using skills such as proper stirring, heat management, timing etc.

Year 3: Secondary ingredient reactions. Potions with larger amounts of ingredients utilizing multiple levels of ingredient interactions to generate desired effects.

Year 4: More advanced potions.

Year 5: Tertiary ingredient reactions. Ingredient nullification, reaction nullification, antidotes.

Year 6: Dangerous potions covered, potion creation basics covered.

Year 7: Advanced potions, potion creation details covered. Final projects include potion creation or successful brewing of a highly advanced potion.

***** I built myself a custom NEWT once, for Healing. It would cover 5th to 7th year, and get people ready for an apprenticeship with a healer.

Year 5: Anatomy, diagnosis. Learning what parts of the body do what, how fibres and bones and nerves fit together and interact. Diagnosis charms for various things - general health, bodyparts, specific organs, specific networks. When to use which charm, basic ingredient reactions that accelerate healing.

Year 6: Targeted human transfiguration and charming - melding blood vessles or curse wounds together, mending bones and shifting pinched nerves through transfiguration of the surrounding material. Specific countercurses, variations of the breaker charms (Finite Incantatum, Finite Maledictem, etc), numbing charms.

Year 7: Form restoration, scar-healing. Complex medical potions. Prophylaxis and detailed diagnostics. Freeform diagnosis, unknown curses and new afflictions. A part-time internship with a master that eventually transcends into an apprenticeship as you take your NEWTs.

I had the med student become essentially fully versed in theory and basic praxis first, and then apply their knowledge in the real world, gradually, under the eye of a healer. Once your master deems you worthy, you gain your title as Healer and can either keep working for them or open an independent clinic.

Lockhart only has a degree of familiarity with household pests (he wrote a book that Mrs. Weasley swears by, though the boys think it's garbage), Lupin focused on creatures for everyone, according to Crouch/Moody, and C/M is obviously most familiar with curses and Dark Wizards, both as part of his cover and from what he actually knows.

** I think there's nothing from fanon that I'd want to be /universally/ put in - just because a large appeal of the setting is that it's so vague in a lot of ways, and letting people have freedom in it.

However, I do like Runes and Arithmancy actually being useful and forms of magic and spell creation, just because they're things that make a lot of sense to have in a magical society. Better - and more detailed - forms of magical theory in basically any field can also be very fun to read.

Sometimes, little details from fics really stand out as making sense. I think Blood Crest is the one that really made me think that the most - where the author tries to stay close to canon, and a lot of the little additions and details just seem very natural. There's a lot there with magic and schooling and the like - but off the top of my head, one little detail I really enjoyed was with Harry opening up one of his potions books and reading it - and hitting all the questions Snape asked about, essentially in the first few pages. (Since aconite, asphodel, and bezoars are all at the start of the alphabet) - turning it from a cruel joke of a question that could never be expected to have, into a demanding teacher checking if you'd even opened the book. That's not something every fic could include, but it was a neat detail that's stuck with me.

*** Going off of the idea that Snape's question was a basic one from the start of the book, two of the most important basic skills in chemistry is knowing how to use wash/safety stations and knowing what you're working with.

I can definitely see bezoars and aconite/asphodel/wolf's bane being used as examples in those lessons (these are basic cure alls, and here's am example that some ingredients go by different names, with the name the potioneere deciding to use giving hints to how they used it).

*** Personally I dislike any approach which turns Ancient Runes, Arithmancy or Divination into classes which are so useful that they should be core classes.

The electives are electives for a reason - they should be additional extras, not essential to your understanding of the fundamental nature of magic or providing the underlying theory to your core classes.

For me, a perfect treatment of Runes and Arithmancy is to strike the fine balance of making them interesting and unique without overstating their importance.

**** It's certainly a personal thing - though, I'd note that making them useful doesn't necessarily make them widely applicable for everyone.

After all, we don't all need to take civil engineering classes to know how to use a bridge - not everyone in the wizarding world needs to take any courses on spell creation if 99% of them will never care or use it, and if it's a giant pain in the butt to use.

For runic magic, I like an interpretation of it that stems from a series I came across at the same time I started reading Harry Potter (it was decently popular in France at the time I was growing up) - but the gist of it is that wand magic would be significantly easier in terms of learning and having a bunch of varied spells quickly, while runes might have an edge in terms of letting one adjust 'spells' once you know it, and in making more permanent enchantments. As an example there, someone using runes might need to spend a half hour carving or painting runes into a teapot, so that warming it up just takes a tap on a central rune - whereas someone using a wand could just easily cast a warming spell every time. When it's that convenient to use a wand, most people won't need a more strict/slower way of doing the same thing - basically, anyone using rune magic in a story has to explain why wand magic is the default.

Edward the Elder (899-924) had to fight a civil war to take the throne, fought back the northern Danelaw, fought off an invasion from Brittany, and conquered much of southern England.

Æthelstan (927-939) conquered the northern Danelaw, then fought wars against the Scottish and Irish. And when he died, the northern Danelaw fell back into Viking control.

Edmund (939-946) spent almost his entire reign at war before being assassinated.

Eadred (946-955) then reconquered northern England and fought the Scottish.

Æthelred (979-1013, 1014-1016) spent his reign desperately trying to stave off the Vikings, and ultimately lost his throne.

*** One of my favorites. I like the idea that the "pipes" the basilisk moved around in were not related to plumbing at all, but the original design for the basilisk to move through the castle, with enchanted one way mirror type walls periodically through the castle, allowing the basilisk to incapacitate invaders without risking permanent harm to the students. The chamber "entrance" was a hatch to release the basilisk into the halls once the students were safely out of the halls.

My preferred "good Slytherin" fanon is that his main worry was a muggleborn conditioned into religious hatred of witches would reveal the location of Hogwarts in a self destructive attempt to root out evil. His son Salazar the Second was the racist one and was the one driven out of the school for attempting to subvert his father's basilisk to purge the school, his father dying in the process. Time ending up merging the two into one historical figure.

My preferred Tom Riddle aspect is that the true entrance to the Chamber of Secrets rejected him when the enchanted stone serpent guardian of the chamber sensed his heart and desires. Hence why he had to enter the chamber through the escape hatch. The basilisk was forced to do his bidding through his blood relation to Slytherin, his parseltongue, and spells that Tom cast to bind its will, but rejected the control as much as possible. The reason that all the attacks except Myrtle were petrifications rather than killings was that the Basilisk was doing everything it could to keep students safe from itself while still following orders. Frustrated with its lack of cooperation Tom broke the enchantment that lured wildlife into the chamber from the forbidden forest in order to try to break its will, hence its words in the wall that Harry heard.

Best part is, all those could be a combination of small, otherwise benign jinxes, and as such unlikely to be detected.

Comparing to that, using basilisk as a weapon that was supposed to move through tight corridors and could be cornered, cut off and made victim of a cave-in wuld be stupid. In the open field, in target rich environment unprotected against it however... Much more reliable and cost effective.

I imagine that he hid the diadem on his way up, and then in his rage and frustration he stopped by again on his way down and cursed the professorship, anchoring the spell to the diadem. It seems more likely that he did that rather than going out of his way to get to the trophy room to place the curse.

Also, I personally feel that the award was more likely to get removed. Dumbledore knew who and what Tom was and could have, at any time, decided to remove that reward. Whereas Voldemort considered his Horcrux completely secure with secrets of Hogwarts that no one else had found, and would be unlikely to want to remove it, as he'd like to always have a piece of his soul in the place that was his first real home.

***** Makes sense, especially for young adult Tom. Also, I find it funny that Dumbledore didn't remove it - either officially or via an accident (or prank). He'd known who Tom Riddle was, and when Voldemort went public... Yeah.

Nice Batman gambit on Voldemort's part, banking on Dumbledore's secretive MO.

*** See, I always wanted the curse to be anchored in one of Dumbledore's little trinkets. I can see Tom picking up something and "fiddling" with it during his interview, then setting it down when he is rejected and leaving it in Dumbledore's office. It would appeal to his ego to literally leave the curse right under Dumbledore's nose.

To have it anywhere else would mean he'd have had to wander to whatever it was AFTER the interview. Plus, if it was in one of the trinkets, then maybe Harry accidentally broke the curse by literally breaking the object it was anchored to, at the end of 5th year.

The muggleborn and muggle raised half bloods could have wanted a bigger say in wizarding politics and the old families could have had harder times putting retainers in positions in the government or whatever. The whole pureblood problem could have been in reaction to Grindelwald. Fannon could be that Grindelwald thought it was us(anything and anyone with magic) against the muggles(non magical people) maybe Grindelwald tried to bring the magical population together and the purebloods complain it was the muggleborns reason we lost.(initially started just as a blame game)

** So there's a fanfiction called “Innocent” by MarauderLover7 that expands on the world in amazing ways.

- The wards: it starts with the fact that house elves can apparate through wards (as we can see in canon) and it gives an explanation for that. Basically the wards are not fixed in place but instead are fluid and therefore leave some spots open. House elves are able to see the wards, and wizards can too with a spell. (This entails Kreacher teaching Harry how to apparate, and the whole thing is pretty amazing).\\
  Plus, the spell (“Ostendere Me Omnia”) allows you to see all the magic, including magic signatures, and is used in incredible ways throughout the whole fic.

- Auror training and structures: the fic follows Tonks through her training and later through her work, and it expands a lot on how it's set up. It explains Auror partners, mentors, how the department works within the DMLE etc. and it even makes up an instrument, the Sidekick, which is a sort of communications device for Aurors.

- Possession: both in the first one with Quirrell, in the second one with Ginny and later with Harry, the fic goes into detail on how possession works, how it transfers, what it entails etc.\\
  Especially concerning Ginny's possession by the Horcrux, it expands so much and it's so interesting to read. I can't say anything more without spoiling things, but it's really well executed.

- Various potions and their effects, including but not limited to the Dementor's Draught, Wolfsbane, Pepper-Up, the Animagus Potion and others. Again, I can't really say any more without massive spoilers though.

- Occlumancy and its usages beyond just protecting your mind from Legilimancy.

And a lot more.

All in all it's a really incredible fanfiction which for some things has almost replaced the canon in a way.\\
I really advice everyone to read it if you haven't already.

** I like the idea of there being more electives, and of astronomy being actually relevant to anything. I made up a few for a story I wrote back in the day.

One was Ghoul Studies, which I have no idea where it came from. Chosen in third year, delved deeply into the topic of death, undeath and co, and was a general philosophy course as well. Often joined by people seeking closure, it was basically a support group and philosophy club with a focus on the topics of Death, identity, souls, the afterlife and existence.

Lore was another, essentially a club led by one of the teachers that spent a few hours every week in the library, combing through the extensive collection for scraps of arcane knowledge and such. Later years would scour the restricted section as well. Mostly borne from the thought that a 1000 year old library would be ginormous. They would essentially form a dedicated helpforce for Pince, sorting books and removing duplicates while searching for lost knowledge. They occasionally discovered really, really powerful spells or lost techniques, some of which were quickly locked away by the Headmaster or the unspeakables. (not before they shared them with the group, though)

I also made a few more electives that basically only ran NEWTs.

Healing was one, taken by people who want to become healers. It covered medical charms and potions, as well as methods and knowledge needed.

Curse-Breaking was another, taken by people who wanted to get into the field. Essentially a mix of DADA, focused on curses, and Archeology.

Enchanting, which covered permanent, complex charms weaved into objects. The end project of each student would be to something large, impressive. complex /and/ useful. I had Molly Weasley take this course in my story, with the Clock as her creation.

Spellcrafting, which covered creating new spells from old ones, or nothing at all. The end project would be the creation of a new spell, regardless of function. Snape took it in my story, with his project being Sectumsempra, a non-dark spell built to emulate a dark cutting curse without the taint of hatred needed to cast it.

Wasn't George (Fred?) the Secret Keeper to... Seashell Cottage? Was that it? And from memory he was living there.

The Fidelius is simultaneously the most powerful and most useless spell in the entire setting. It /should/ solve a good deal of problems, but no one ever explains how it works.

Have a magic rock you need hidden? Fidelius.

Got a safehouse that the enemy shouldn't know? Fidelius (what happens if you Portkey into a Secret Area anyway?). Admittedly they actually /do/ this one.

Got a child saviour that you want watched after so they can be protected from terrorists? A nice place out in the country under Fidelius.

** The stuff from the Prince of Slytherin! There are so many fun ideas there! But to list a few...

Pareseltounge being an actual language that one can learn. It's just the direct descendants of Slytherin who can speak it naturally.

The Basilisk being made 100% to be a defense, and modified to be like that, like taking away the death stare and have it petrify normally.

The expansion to the Death Eaters! This one is a personal favorite. It turns what was essentially a pack of racist cultists into a proper, scary terrorist organization.

Expanding on Occlumency and why it's so rare. For those who haven't read it (and you really should), Occlumency can cripple you emotionally if you use it wrong, basically turning you into a sociopath

The idea of wizards separating from muggles due to wizards with noble heritage trying to take over other nations (the best example is a Spanish descendant of Slytherin trying to conquer England)

That the Statute of Secrecy isn't just a law. That it's a massive memory charm that wiped all mentions of magic from history and that if too many people learn about the existence of magic that it would collapse and expose them to everyone.

** Anything that flushes out Snape more fully and we get to see plenty of him outside of the Mean Nasty Teacher Harry-vision. AKA a Snape that is flushed out and much more like Alan Rickman's performance and less the one-note screaming caricature of nasty we get in the books. Also, any fic written before book 7 usually has Snape who switched sides for better reasons than “I loved Lily” nonsense. I have read some fics that do the “I love Lily” reason but they do it correctly. It's his starting reason, but not his only reason for switching sides, and the love for Lily is genuine, not creepy, stalkerish, or obsessive, like the books imply. Basically, fanfic fixes all of the stupid implications that I think JKR didn't really intend to imply, but happened anyway because of less than stellar writing. Hence why she loves Alan Rickman's performance of Snape, even though it is extremely inaccurate to the books. A more nuanced Snape, a more complete Snape, and that really goes for all of her characters. Fanfics raising the books up from their black and white childish morality to more nuanced and complicated characters. Even characters as evil as Voldemort are capable of more nuance in fanfic. And there's no such thing as a “good” character anywhere. While Sirius may have said “the world isn't split between good people and death eaters.” I think the books do a terrible job of showing it. They also automatically brand all death eaters the same level of evil with that statement. Zero nuance.

** Runes and Arithmancy as actual magical tools is the best, but there are some little fanon things that I like.

Parseltongue-speaking dragons. Totally not in canon, but it could be argued that the one Harry faced in his task was just bellowing and not talking, and the one in Gringotts had gone mad.

Wards are not specifically mentioned in canon by name (until one of the video games), but they're a staple of fantasy books. The "protective spells" they put around their tent fit the general definition of wards. A ward is a spell that defines an exclusion: what or who to keep away. So the Muggle-repelling charm is a ward, and the charm Dumbledore put at 4 Privet Drive is clearly a blood-based ward.

Hermione's dad being a retired SAS officer tickles me. (Sadly, it's too often used with the "Hermione's dad threatens Harry's life for daring to think he can be her boyfriend" trope, which I despise.)

The Veil of Death in the DoM being used to dispose of the bodies of those who've been Kissed. What do they do with them, if not? I mean, it seems they congratulate themselves on not having a "death penalty" per se, but Kissing seems worse than death.

Actual definitions of Light and Dark magic, outside of what appears to be the Ministry (and/or Dumbledore) declaring anything they don't like as Dark. For example: Light Magic uses only the caster's magic, while Dark Magic using ambient/environmental magic. Or Dark Magic uses emotions while Light Magic is merely rote (note that, by this definition, the Patronus is as Dark as the Cruciatus).
