I remember the tickets revolving around a book, written secretly by Albus Dumbledore, being found by Harry and Hermione. I think the book was called Power. It basically says what Dumbledore cannot due to the numerous oaths that were practically forced on him.

Thanks for the help!

**** I read the first chapter. I may finish it later. I will have to read it pretty slowly, the story doesn't seem to follow normal development of any kind. It got a little...strange after the dragon task.

** It's a fic with an interesting premise, but with one critical flaw: the author had mixed up who the good guys and the bad guys were.

If there is a small group of people who, through accident of birth, get to rule over everyone else through force and terror; and another group of people working to stop them from running roughshod over everyone else... The second group is probably the good guys.
