** I'm pretty sure its not the stories you're looking for, but your points made me think of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8197451/1/Fantastic-Elves-and-Where-to-Find-Them][Fantastic Elves and Where to Find Them]] and its WIP sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/651163/evansentranced][The Handbook of Elf Psychology]], by evansentranced.
