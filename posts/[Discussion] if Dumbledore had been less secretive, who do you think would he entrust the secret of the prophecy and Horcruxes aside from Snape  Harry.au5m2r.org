In the books, Dumbledore did not fully trust anyone. It feels like Snape just got into the picture because he heard the first part of the prophecy and his guilt over Lily's death. And Dumbledore just gave Harry enough clues to go on a wild goose chase.


** Sounds cracky, but I'd say Grindelwald.

The dude mellowed out after 50 years in prison, and up to the end kept Dumbledore's secrets and respected his memory when Voldemort broke in for an interrogation. Grindelwald is enough of an academic and expert in Dark Arts to be able to offer advice and intellectual discussion about Horcruxes, and the theory behind creating and destroying them. The Fantastic Beasts universe also makes him a Seer, so he'd be an expert on interpreting prophecies as well, on top of his knowledge of the Elder Wand and the Deathly Hallows, which Dumbledore wanted to pass to Snape.

Grindelwald has also been locked up for so many years, without escaping, that Dumbledore would feel safe that his secrets wouldn't leave Nurmengard.

**** If Grindy still had any spark in him, he'd try to manipulate Dumbledore in exchange for his help. First he'd share a few authors and books to look for, and ask for new parchment, his bed to be transfigured with nicer pillows, a warming charm for his slippers, because the nights are cold in the mountains. (wink, wink)

Then he'd ask for more and more favors, humble-bragging about his expertise at tracking down rare magical artifacts and dark objects, trying to convince Dumbledore to break him out.

****** Ordinarily, it wouldn't. In McGonagall's case, I think it is different. She does have a role outside of ‘just a Professor' and clearly knows more than someone like Sprout or Hooch. She is a member of the Order of the Phoenix, and knows everything a regular Order member would know. The thing is, she's portrayed as more than just an order member. For the most part, she's portrayed as a strong supporter of Dumbledore and very close to him both personally and professionally. With Harry too young to take on the role of leader, it looks like she would be perfectly positioned to take over when Dumbledore died, as she would be able to run both the school and the Order.

The other option would be Shacklebolt, little as he is seen, because he is a senior Order member and a senior law enforcement member.

Both, however, are completely lacking in knowledge where it counts. They both have the basic information that the entire order has access to, but were never informed beyond, ‘Must protect Harry!'

Personally, I see this as either:

- An issue with Dumbledore himself, that he gave the information to Harry and Snape, yet withheld it from both of his two possible replacements,

- Or a shortcoming of JKR's, in that she may just have forgotten or not bothered to make sure that Dumbledore had told someone else. She may even have done it deliberately to create drama and stuff without thinking of or caring about the implications.

******* The last two points are something that always bugged me about Dumbledore and how the Order was handled in general. It seemed that there was no order of authority, Dumbledore should not have been keeping so much to himself because there was no guarantee that he would always be there. If he had died, say for example at the DOM then what would have happened?

** Moody, definitely: clearly too paranoid about his own safety to be tempted to make one himself, and good luck weaseling the secret out of /him/.

He might also tell Nicolas & Perenelle Flamel. If the Flamels kept the recipe of the Philosopher's Stone under wraps for 400 years, I think we've established that they can be trusted with dangerous immortality-related secrets. And Nicolas's magical advice would surely be invaluable.

I also commend [[/u/4ecks]]'s suggestion of Grindelwald, too.

How many times does Harry ferret out vital information which Dumbledore would know if he chatted to each of his immediate subordinates once a month?

Sure, but this is all about a potential AU anyway; the Flamels might well survive. Besides which, without being sure, Dumbledore also suspected Voldemort had Horcruxes /before/ 1991. It is after all to protect the Stone from the shade of the Dark Lord that Flamel had Dumbledore protect the Stone at Hogwarts in the first place. You could well imagine Flamel asking Dumbledore, "by the way, /mon ami/, zis Voldemor' who is threatening my Stone, wasn't he supposed to be dead?" and Dumbledore explaining his theory to him in reply.

** I always felt like Dumbledore was humbly arrogant. He recognized all his faults, but he saw everyone else as having more faults them himself. He was wise, he must protect them from the truth, let them live a happy lie as long as possible, etc. Everyone is flawed, but he is less flawed than the others. Nothing evil or wrong about it. In fact, I think that idea even has some merit.

A defining traits of Dumbledore was being secretive. I think there would need to be a significant event that directly connected the horcruxes to that person. One example immediately springs to mind: Neville Longbottom. If anyone would be told after them, it would be him. Just as Harry told Neville in a roundabout way before he went to his death via Voldemort. There would need to be a chance Harry was not the chosen one for Dumbles to do this. Next would be McGonagall maybe.

**** Young would be the proper word. Harry had a lot of responsibility, but he was still young. The end of OotP was proof enough of that. Although, that tantrum likely helped Dumbledore trust him oddly enough. I don't know how Dumbles saw Harry, but I imagine it was a very much "If anyone else could, I'd get them to" situation. Dumbledore would have let Harry live without knowing a single thing about horcruxes even though he had one within him if at all possible.

And if you can't tell when someone's been replaced then there's clearly merit to maximum secrecy (if Harry is replaced all is lost anyway, and I think he would know if something happened to Snape).
