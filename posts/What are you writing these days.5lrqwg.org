** My Lupin fic but yesterday on the train I randomly started writing a one shot about Harry losing it when toddler!Teddy has a temper tantrum and shutting him in the pantry for a bit. It's pretty angsty and a lot of Harry beating himself up so I don't know that I will end posting it anywhere, but it's kind of fun to write Harry not being a perfect father figure.

** Bloodmoon Rises and The Salem Settlement go slow and very fractured. Both the interactions of Harry with Bellatrix and of Harry with Piper are pretty tough to get even close to right. Bellatrix is in general a hard character to get somewhat right, and I need to be in the mood for Piper's snarky and sarcastic way of speaking.

I also write a ton of ideas that come to mind, but will never see the light of FFN. There is a fic with Bellatrix and Sirius being forced into a marriage, then there is a fem!Harry thingie and a Harry in Azkaban kind of fic. But again, they're all just to empty my head and to have a fun time writing. I'll probably post them on my "Unfinished Ideas" story on FFN.

** A fanfiction of another fanfiction - The Firebird Series. I've found the world building awesome in this piece of work, however during the earlier Hogwarts years (Years 1-3) it had me frustrated because of the lack of deep characterization and huge amounts of information of how magic and the world itself works being left off. So i've decided during my free time to take this one a go. I have no plans on posting this one, but if i do end up doing it i'll ask for Darth Marrs (The original author) for permission.

** A Master of Death fic, which I'm experimenting with a bit to see if I can make it completely original. Since it happens after the epilogue and most of the stuff is non-canon/fanon I'm hoping it's do-able.

** I have two main Potter fics now.

Trolling the Toad is pretty much Harry deciding that he's no longer taking shit from Umbridge and driving her nuts in any way possible.

Scarlet Fox is a Miraculous Ladybug crossover fanfic featuring a Fox Miraculous!Harry. People who don't know Miraculous should be able to read this and understand it, since it doesn't get too into the Miraculous side, apart from how Harry acquires the Fox Miraculous. You also learn about the Miraculous and how they work along with Harry, so if you didn't know before, you'd learn as you read. It's basically a Superhero!Harry story that doesn't make him /too/ overpowered.

** Mostly lore for the world of my original story. Some unrelated snippets from time to time too (2 during the last seven days, for a total of ~3k words) though I'd been too busy to release them on time so they linger in my snippet folder, but mostly the lore.

If anyone is curious why I am doing just that, this is because I finally have the basic rules of the language used in-story and thus now know what phonemes and in what combinations I can use for the names of mythological stuff, which means I can finally write a proper version of the lore rather than an abbreviated one with placeholders all over the place.

** I've been working on a story, pretty much slice of life, set in Hogwarts five years after DH. All OCs except some of the teachers, basically. The main character's parents fled to America before the war started in earnest and are only now returning to Britain. Because of paperwork related reasons, Patrick couldn't study in Ilvermorny and had to get private tutoring. He is a Ravenclaw, a Charms prodigy, above average in Potions, terrible in Transfiguration, and more or less average everywhere else.

It's fundamentally slice of life, dealing with everyday conflicts like getting used to Hogwarts, relationships, etc, but also touches on the almost forced unity between houses in the aftermath of the War, the hate Patrick receives from some people (cough Gryffindors cough) because his parents ran away, etc.

Unfortunately, I am a /terribly/ slow writer, and college sucks up a lot of free time and motivation, so it goes at slower than a snail's pace. I can only hope that if I get into a routine sometime in the future I can spend a lot more time and energy on the fiction. It's pretty tough realising that few people will ever read your fic because it has just OCs, but that's part and parcel of fanfiction.

...Also, I need to figure out a decent title before I submit it on FFN or somewhere.

**** Haha, thanks. I've only written about 10K words so far, and I'm just up to the first day at Hogwarts. Obviously the pace isn't going to be this slow throughout, but you need some time for worldbuilding. But 10K words is pretty shameful since I've been working on this for about half a year.
