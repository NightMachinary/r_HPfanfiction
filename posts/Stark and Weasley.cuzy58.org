Just think about what would happen if Tony Stark and Arthur Weasley were put in the same room for an hour


** I feel like Arthur would end up infuriating Tony with his habit of mispronouncing Muggle Words despite being corrected multiple times. Tony would then go on to purposely mispronounce every Wizarding Word as an attempt to spite Arthur.

*** Arthur wouldn't catch on - he's so excited to meet Tony and doesn't want to think badly of him.

*** Yeah. For all the weird science, Tony Stark's universe isn't nearly surreal enough to ignore the fact a grown man can't seem to learn to properly pronounce electricity, or even understand the most basic kindergarten-level non-magical science.

I'd still love to see this meeting, but it's gonna be a disaster.
