Tired of fics with misspellings and horrible grammar. I've read most of the popular ones but link any you like!


** You can see my favorite stories and browse through those I have some long, well-written ones in there: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4542446/]]

My favorites of the really long ones are probably A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles and a WIP going on right now, Divided and Entwined.

I could probably do with some cleaning up of my favorites list as I have not enjoyed all of these but just never got around to removing them (such as Marauder's Plan, initially liked it but it really dragged and I just finished it because I like to see things through but many other fics I'd recommend before that one). Ask me about any others if you want any reviews.

** Top 3 Long Fics:

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin):\\
What happens if you start with every clich√© ever and turn it into a fantastically written fic? The author does a huge job of making everyone act logically, and fixes so many of the issues I have with canon. Why are all the 11-year olds so smart? Why did literally no one else think Remus was a werewolf? Why are the aurors never called?

It's one of the best-written pieces of literature I've read. But if that doesn't sway you, this fic has Competent Lockhart.

linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided):\\
Great fic that captures the feel of the first 3 Harry Potter books (before it all got so dark and angsty). Teddy goes to Hogwarts, finds a couple friends, and they go about having their own adventures. Great fun and surprising emotional depth. A major plot point is that the Sorting Hat and Headmistress are upset the 4 houses are so divided.

linkffn(Exile by bennybear):\\
Draco is convicted after the war and as punishment is forced to live in the Muggle world without Magic. He spends the next few years gradually overcoming his prejudices and becoming a better person. The hallmark of this fic, imo, is that Draco's character arc is very realistic. He doesn't just go from mean shithead to super cool smart and good overnight.

linkffn(Elizium for Sleepless Souls):\\
Are you a fan of thrillers? Or movies/books where you start with limited information and figure it out piece by piece? Then this is the story for you. Umbridge sends Harry to Azkaban and he wakes up there, but things aren't all that they seem. Can Harry attempt a jailbreak while trying to figure out what is going on?

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/205025][Island of Fire]]:\\
Great worldbuilding. A bunch of Hogwarts kids are shipwrecked on an island and need to figure out how to use magic to survive. One they realize no one is coming for them, they struggle with creating their own civilization. Great idea and well executed.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
