Ones I personally hate with particular intensity include Dumbledore bashing (way to ruin the most nuanced character in the franchise), and any and all attempts to handwave, downplay, or excuse House Elf slavery.

And the term "wards". Mostly because it doesn't exist in canon but is absolutely ubiquitous in fanfic.

I understand that you would not like the idea, I'm not a big fan of that myself. But the "wands under sleeve" is technically canon. But hey, in the same book, Rowling manage to keep wands inside pant pockets, so let's just say "/Magic/".

Personally, it's mainly the "Wand Holder" fastened to the arm that I hate, especially when it's "enchanted for a quick draw".

(I know it doesn't matter /at all/, I know it's easy to fix by saying "magic!", it's a completely irrational pet peeve. Still makes my brain twitch every time I see it, unless, course, it's mentioned that their robes are charmed so that they can or something like that.)

***** I'm sorry but how would a wand not fit up your sleeve? It may not be the greatest storage solution or anything but there's nothing wrong with it as a concept. Also wand holsters, while fanon, are one of the least obtrusive fanon additions.

As for wards, if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck.... just because they don't use that term in canon doesn't mean that that genre of magic doesn't exist in canon.

******** How long are your arms?! I can't do that for anything longer than 11 inches 😳 Honestly, if my arm is bent, 9 1/2 is a more realistic limit. I have a ruler in front of me. I tried it: [[https://i.imgur.com/xUaO9SD.jpg]]

I have it jammed uncomfortably in the crook of my elbow, and the end of a 13 inch ruler is still sticking out to where I have to hold it with my fingers. So I suppose I /could/ hold it there, if I didn't use that hand for anything...

I guess I'm not understanding what you're trying to explain, because I have tried a billion ways to get any of my wands to fit up my sleeves, and I've never found a way that works.

Again, I'm not disputing that it would work with magic, or that it's a stupid pet peeve, or that it's irrational to get so annoyed about such an insignificant detail. I am aware that all of these things are true. I'm just saying that without magic, wands of the average dimensions used in the HP books are longer than most people's forearms and so you can't just "stick it up your sleeve."

Harry goes to see the goblins because they're pissed that he hasn't contacted them to get his ring of lordship and finds out Dumbledore's evil and horrible and left him with his extremely abusive aunt and uncle who beat him mercilessly all day and all night and is manipulating his life so he'll die and Dumbledore can be the hero again and live forever...

Because Dumbledore is the true dark lord and wants to live forever, which is why he allowed himself to be killed in half blood prince. It makes perfect sense, really, if you don't think about it.
