*** Unfortunately the idea that this is normal for some women to bleed after their first time is the problem. It is such a widely spread misbelief that I almost don't fault people for believing it from the off.

It comes from the mistaken belief that the hymen is some barrier that must be 'broken' during intercourse. It is this same belief that allows nonsense like tests of a woman's virginity to still take place. The whole thing is medieval.

The bleeding is sadly a result of lack of adequate preparation or foreplay and the skin within the vaginal canal being torn.

Sorry if this sounds like i'm ranting at you, I'm not, this is just my biggest bugbear with how we teach sex ed.

**** The amount of people who understand what a hymen actually is is damn depressing. Women included.

**** It's just misinformation. But yes some women do bleed after their first time, no matter how well prepared they are.

My first time with my current girlfriend (virgin at the time) we were ultra-prepared and careful. Lots of foreplay, lubricant, took it very slowly, etc.

She still had a small amount of blood afterward. It's perfectly normal to bleed, or not bleed for your first time. But preparation will ensure that it is painless, and minimal.

While the hymen is not a barrier to be “broken” it can absolutely be torn during sex if it is still of a comparably large size.

** I always skim through sex scenes unless I'm reading a PWP. Most of them are really, really cringeworthy - dialogue copy-pasted from shitty porn, 12-inch horse penises (only okay if Firenze is involved), anal sex without lube or prep... Yikes.
