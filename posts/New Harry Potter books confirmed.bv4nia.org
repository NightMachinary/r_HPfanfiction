** Reading through this news it's certainly not clear to me whether these will contain any new/original material.

Does anyone else have a good idea about it? Can we expect something that's not already known, or is it just a compilations of little canon facts?

**** Ah yes, I saw that. I meant if they'll contain new facts, which may be interesting or amusing, or if the content will be mostly old (like, just a compilation of facts on each subject that have appeared already in the original books).

Though I guess maybe we won't know that until they're out.

***** I think it will feature some new facts, but that's only a guess. Do note, new facts do not equal good. Summoning charm at the speed of light anyone?(refference to Rowlings statement that the charm summons things at the speed of light, which directly contradicts book 4 and all sense of logic)

****** I like to think that the spell /propagates/ at the speed of light, then drags the object through space at a more conventionally human scale speed.

As an example if you word to someone something from across the planet then the spell would only take 0.04 seconds to latch on to the object, which world then travel to the summoner at something closer to 100km/h.

#+end_quote

Meta: Still the same problems apply. It's leaving Harry's wand at the speed of light. No sacrificial mother protection will protect him from this. Furthermore, JK Rowling says that your therory is wrong. I quote:

"While people or creatures may be indirectly moved by ‘Accio-ing' objects that they are wearing or holding, this carries all kinds of risks because of the likelihood of injury to the person or beast *attached to an object travelling at close to the speed of light"*

It's still traveling at the speed of light even towards the caster

******** I'm not sure I buy into 'Word Of God' explainations when the contradict how the summoning charm works in the actual books.

#+begin_quote
  He waited, every fibre of him hoping, praying ... if it hadn't worked ... if it wasn't coming ... he seemed to be looking at everything around him through some sort of shimmering, transparent barrier, like a heat haze, which made the enclosure and the hundreds of faces around him swim strangely ... And then he heard it, speeding through the air behind him; he turned and saw his Firebolt hurtling towards him around the edge of the woods, soaring into the enclosure, and stopping dead in mid-air beside him, waiting for him to mount. The crowd was making even more noise ... Bagman was shouting something ... but Harry's ears were not working properly any more ... listening wasn't important ...
#+end_quote

So it clearly doesn't even break the sound barrier as he can hear it coming, limiting it to less than 343 m/s

#+begin_quote
  Mrs Weasley pointed her wand at George's pocket and said, ‘Accio!' Several small, brightly coloured objects zoomed out of George's pocket; he made a grab for them but missed, and they sped right into Mrs Weasley's outstretched hand.
#+end_quote

Here George even has time to react to it leaving his person and moving his hand in pursuit of it /before/ they reach Mrs Weasley's hand.

#+begin_quote
  The words were hardly out of his mouth when the female Death Eater shrieked: ‘Accio proph---' Harry was just ready for her: he shouted ‘Protego!' before she had finished her spell, and though the glass sphere slipped to the tips of his fingers he managed to cling on to it.
#+end_quote

Here we see Harry intercept the spell, but has to do so */before/* the spell is cast.

#+begin_quote
  The scene seemed momentarily frozen. Harry, Ginny and Neville and each of the Death Eaters turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank as a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish...
#+end_quote

Here again, people have time to turn and see the subject of the spell travel.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Accio glasses!' Although they were only around a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom towards him, at least until they poked him in the eye.
#+end_quote

Here we see the subject of the spell doesn't even have the the momentum to puncture a human eyeball.

#+begin_quote
  ‘Hagrid!' Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life, ‘Hagrid -- accio Hagrid!'...

  ...And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him...
#+end_quote

Here we see that the Accio charm likely doesn't work on *Magical* people, despite being able to summon fish in book 7, and Hermione stating that distance and size don't matter in book 4. So Harry would never be in any danger of being summoned.

Why are you even arguing this? Your argument is based on her "WoG" statement that you edited to fit your narrative. And, yes, I do know it contradicts the books. I pointed it out myself.

I never said he was, did I?

Edit: link to my comment you replied to that mentioned the contradiction:

I think it will feature some new facts, but that'...

I have no idea how this quote implies that Harry could be summoned as per your words:

" So Harry would never be in any danger of being summoned."
