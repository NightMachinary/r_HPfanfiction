:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
With the surge in interest for a competent antagonistic Dumbledore, I also remembered reading once a fic that made him the final antagonist. I think it was written pre-HBP and at the end Harry finds out that Dumbledore had invented a spell that could absorb the soul and the magic of the victim. Over years he had groomed several people for that purpose, including Grindelwald. Voldemort's and Harry's souls were the last pieces of the puzzle before he could become a godlike being who would bring about the salvation of humanity.

He is really powerful and can turn into multiple deadly creatures and also combine their deadliest aspects into one shape.

The situation looks really dire but Harry's advantage is that Dumbledore doesn't want him dead but he wants his soul and a certain ritual must be completed before the said spell can be cast which gives Harry some time to think. Dumbledore also had invented a spell that could temporarily switch the body of the caster with the target so Harry manages to trick him by casting that spell on Dumbledore and apparating himself (as Dumbledore) on the moon or something. At the end it's heavily hinted that Dumbledore is alive and ready to continue hunting for Harry and Voldemort. Unfortunately I can't remember for the life of me the name of the story and I don't know if there was a seventh year sequel.

Edit: updated a bit the grammar for my description to make sense.


** Good news - You want Harry Potter and the Ring of the Ancients (part 6) which has all the plot points you've mentioned.

Book 5 was still called Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Not sure where to find that book.

â€‹

Bad news - There isn't a book 7 and book 6 ends on a fucking cliffhanger.

**** Mine too, dude. Mine too. I LOVED the subplots and the magic even if in hindsight it was CLEARLY written by a creative person who hadn't written much before. Crestfallen that book 7 didn't exist.

*** Thank you! I skimmed through it and it seems that the plot is not entirely as I remembered it but I think that's the one I was looking for. It was a really cool story and, now that you mentioned it, so was its prequel. But then again I must have been 12 or 13 when I read it and was the first fic where Dumbledore turned out to be evil. I remember that I was really sad about it.
