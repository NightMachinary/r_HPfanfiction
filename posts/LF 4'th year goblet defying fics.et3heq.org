Any (good?) Fics where Harrys name comes out of the goblet of fire, but he doesnt have to compete. Such as 'can't be entered against his will/the one to put the partchment in is bound' and any such happenings where Harry just isnt BOUND to the goblet, and therefore happily says no thanks, and ruins everyones plans. Bonus of he tells off the teachers for trying to make him compete anyway.


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5402315/1/Can-t-Have-It-Both-Ways][Can't Have it Both Ways]] is a RobSt fic so there's a lot of bashing, but it's still well written.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13277595/1/][Extradition Escape]] is also pretty cool, Harry gets the fuck away from England.
