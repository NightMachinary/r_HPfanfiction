I think we've all seen to death super!Harry, nice!Draco, evil!Ron and wimpy!Hermione, and the students changing characteristic doesn't really do a whole lot on a plot level unless they're a central character, but I had the thought it would be interesting to read a fic where one or more of the teachers was VERY different as this would potentially shift their relationship with the students.

Preferably not Dumbledore unless it's unusual, as he's another central character that is often these days portrayed as one of two extremes. Besides that, happy with any kind of weird twist or unorthodox choice/interpretation, and whatever age rating too! Cheers


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)

Instead of being the stuttering fool that nobody takes seriously, Quirrelmort is a complete genius and the best DADA teacher hogwarts had in a long time, as well as Harry's effective mentor. He's still evil AF, but much more effective and dangerous.

Linkffn(When in doubt, Obliviate)

Lockhart raised Harry and is a bit more competent as DADA teacher. He's still a fraud, but he's much more competent at hiding his incompetence.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent)

5th year fic written before OOTP was released, so no Umbridge or Luna. Instead, the DADA teacher is the real Moody, who is significantly different from Crouch's act.

Linkffn(The Arithmancer)

Professor Vector, the Arithmancy professor, plays an important role as Hermione's mentor.

Linkffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7)

Harry is raised by Sirius and knows Remus very well as adoptive uncle by the time he becomes DADA professor.

Linkffn(The Daring Win)

Harry raised by Umbridge.

** linkffn(Stages of Hope)

A likeable Snape that wears Burgundy, isn't in love with Lily and is best friends with Sirius, who's also on a rotatiing schedule with Remus as the DADA professor.

linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

McGonagal is a taskmaster when it comes to training, Snape, while still being a dick, is extremely funny with his acidic sarcasm and remarks. Dumbledore is the pretty much one of the best "true to canon" Dumbledore's there is all fanon. He's powerful as fuck, is old, flawed, trying to win a war by using all the tools and people available to him, and is trying his best, while being fairly humourous. Not a GG/Dumbles, actually useful and good Dumbledore. Moody is vicious as fuck as a trainer too, but that's usually what happens. Also one of the best Remus/Tonks fics, even if they aren't the major focus (i'd say 10% of the fic is dedicated to them).

linkffn(The Art of Self-fashioning)

Best McGonagal-mentor there is, imo.

linkffn(Fraterculus; Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin)

completely different Lockhart. In one, he's, well, not what it seems. In the other, he's done exactly what he says he's done in the books, so he isn't a fraud.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
