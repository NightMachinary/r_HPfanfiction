I forgot the title so I hope that someone knows the story that I will try to describe.

Remus and Harry try to flee from the order, because they are the bad guys (?). Remus gets killed and Harry thinks he is at fault. Like Remus told him he flees to Fenrir Greyback, but the pack thinks he killed Remus and because of that they do not treat him well. He becomes a werewolf and has to spend his time in a small hut as a punishment. He gets pregnant by Fenrir who has the feeling that Harry is his mate but ignores it because he does not want to admit it and does not want Harry to be his mate because he killed Remus. Harry bears two pups, boys and both are taken from him the second they are born. I remember also that there are two Submissive wolf who want to help him because they pity him. Can anyone please help ?
