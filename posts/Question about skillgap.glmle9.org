A comment I've seen repeatedly is that Harry could never be as skilled as Tom, given the fact that Tom had a 50ish year head start.

If that is the case, why was Tom on a level where he rivaled Dumbledore? Dumbledore had a 40 or so year headstart over Tom, was a Transfiguration instructor, and ultimately had control of the Elder Wand...yet Tom was able to repeatedly fight him to a stand still.

Leaving aside Tom's aptitude and studiousness while at school, I see no reason why it wouldn't be possible to close that skill gap over time (though not in the course of a Hogwarts education).


** Well, isn't the point that Harry (during his time at Hogwarts) would never be on par with Tom? That's why JKR had to write Tom pretty much doing himself in. The comments are probably pointing out that Powerful!Harry fics are unrealistic unless some other explanation is crafted. Of course, he could catch up to Voldemort given a few decades after graduating.

As for Dumbledore, he is restricted because he has to follow laws. He can't blow Tom to smithereens because that would cause collateral damage and ruin his reputation. He also needs to protect other people. Tom, I would assume, is trying his hardest, and still, he's unable to harm Dumbledore.

** Few things to note:

- The Pareto Principle / Pareto Distribution or "80/20 rule"

#+begin_quote
  The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the output comes from 20% of the input. i.e. 80% of their "magical prowess" comes from 20% of their magical study/practice/experience. The remaining 80% is finessing or "polish".
#+end_quote

- Deliberate practice

#+begin_quote
  How much time did the wizard have to hone his craft? We know very little about either Voldemort or Dumbledore's past. Dumbledore has spent many years teaching and Voldemort spent 10 years as a bodiless wraith. How did that impact their ability? Is Voldemort able to learn more rapidly due to his impaired empathy and lack of need for friends? Dumbledore also spent years studying under Nicolas Flamel - how relevant that is to his prowess in duelling is unknown, but at the least, we can say he involved himself in assorted studies of magic. Anyway it's all speculation at this point.

  I think it is entirely plausible that Voldemort had a narrower set of goals, and therefore a narrower set of skills to focus on to target those goals. He also had bucketloads of power, and innate magical skill (wandless magical control as a child). We do not know exactly how Dumbledore compares - does he get stronger the older he is? Alas...
#+end_quote

I'm of the opinion that there's a certain point a wizard gets to (a very, very skilled wizard), where magic just "clicks" for them. It begins to make sense. They understand magic not in terms of branches of magic and specific spells, but in abstract parallels and intuitive relationships. After this point, improvements in skill are marginal and domain-oriented. Refer to the 80/20 rule, the "20% of input" would be what it takes to reach this intuitive understanding, and then the 80% of remaining input would be making refinements to take the wizard from the 1% to the 0.01%.

Dumbledore is a Transfigurations Master, he is "one" with that branch of magic, and proficient in the others, but his mastery of one branch is highly transferable.

Voldemort, by comparison, is not equal to Dumbledore in Transfiguration, but he has mastery of Curses and Dark Arts. His skill in that domain of magic is highly transferable with others.

Dumbledore's style of combat favours Transfiguration, whereas Voldemort's seems to be more elemental/fiends/curses and that kind of thing.

--------------

I think it is implausible to expect Harry to be "on a level" with Voldemort and Dumbledore, without some time-travel trickery. Harry, canonically, is /intended/ to be the underdog. He is the "prophesied child" and has scads of luck on his side. Fate itself seems to favour him.

Another option for an author to go down is to have Harry focus on a very, very narrow set of skills to get very, very good at. If Harry spent 7 years studying Transfiguration and little else, and mentoring under Dumbledore during his time in Hogwarts, I would fully expect him to wipe the floor with Death Eaters and perhaps be able to cause /some/ problems for Voldemort. But he would still get trounced in a prolonged 1 on 1, because Voldemort's /just that good/.

** I'm not sure how plausible/realistic it is, but as far as wanting Harry to be able to go to toe with Voldemort (without dragging it long past Hogwarts) I believe it would have to come down to how wide their comparative areas of focus are.

We know Tom Riddle was one of the most brilliant students Hogwarts has ever seen, implying high skill and more than likely therefore interest in every or at least most areas of magic. Personally I would think that would carry on during his decades of travel and study - while the Dark Arts would be his favourite topic so to speak, it's not his sole focus. He would learn every piece of magic he can possibly find, from elemental magic to duelling to rituals, even herbology and healing and things that would certainly never be associated with a Dark Lord. Magic is his obsession, not necessarily just magic he can use to kill people. Duelling might not even be much of a focus beyond learning the curses, because as far as he's concerned there are very, very few who he couldn't obliterate with pure power.

Harry would have to be more or less the opposite. He's got a frighteningly powerful Dark Lord trying to kill him, and so he focuses entirely on combat. He'd have to recognise it early (maybe even as soon as he realises Voldemort is still alive and still very much out to kill him after first year), be literally obsessive about it /and/ show some sort of prodigious talent in combat magic, but it's the most realistic possibility I've ever been able to come up with without having a magic bullet or making Voldemort's defeat a complete fluke.

** I think part of it is application, Voldemort WANTED to be the very best (I now have the Pokémon song stuck in my head) whereas Dumbledore didn't care as much. He pushed himself in other ways for creativity and inquisitive purposes. He wanted to learn things and know stuff. Voldemort wanted to be capable of dueling anyone and everyone to early graves because his main goal was to never die so he applied himself in other ways.

I'm not sure if I'm explaining myself well.

** I don't know that Harry could “never” be as skilled. It just seemed unlikely to occur within a reasonable amount of time - if Harry was to spend a couple decades specifically training to go toe-to-toe with Tom, he might have a chance, assuming that Tom wasn't likewise spending that time improving. It's just surpassing unlikely that he could attain that level of power and learning during his Hogwarts years.

Really though - war isn't a weight lifting contest. It's not always about who is stronger or more powerful.

** Copying a recent post I made in another thread because it is exactly on this topic:

Consider the Dumbledore vs. Voldemort duel at the end of OotP, the highest level exhibition of magic we have witnessed. What, in that duel, is particularly special?

- Dumbledore animates a number of statues. We know that animation is taught at Hogwarts. The act of animation itself is not impressive - it is not rare or secret knowledge. What is impressive is his ability to animate several large objects simultaneously, with a single wave of his wand.

- Dumbledore creates a flaming whip. We know that the creation of fire is taught at Hogwarts. The act of creating fire is not impressive. What is impressive is his fine control over the fire, and his ability to create it quickly.

- We see Voldemort transfigure the flaming whip into a snake. We know that transfiguration of animals is taught at Hogwarts. The act of turning something into an animal is not impressive. What is impressive is the ability to perform a large, perfect, complex transfiguration with a single wave of the wand, and on fire rather than a normal physical substance.

- We see Dumbledore turn the snake to smoke. We haven't seen students transfigure things to smoke, but it seems functionally no different to vanishing, which we know is taught at Hogwarts. What is impressive here is not his ability to get rid of the snake, but his ability to get rid of a large vertibrate animal with a single wave of his wand (for reference, Harry takes the length of a whole exam, probably well over an hour, to vanish an iguana in OotP).

- We see Voldemort conjure a silver shield. We know that conjuration is taught at Hogwarts. What is impressive is not the fact of conjuration, but his ability with it - we don't often see wizards creating silver.

- We see Dumbledore levitate a globe of water and encase Voldemort within it. Levitation, and the movement of objects more generally, is taught at Hogwarts. What is impressive is his fine control in being able to perform this magic on a substance which flows.

- Voldemort casts the Killing Curse a lot. This is something Goyle can do.

- They apparate a lot. This is something many wizards can do.

Of all the spells cast, the only spell which is properly outside the standard education of a wizard is Dumbledore's mysterious powerful spell which Voldemort conjures the silver shield to protect himself from. Everything else is magic which is theoretically within the Hogwarts curriculum. What is special is that their ability with this magic is very high: they can execute these spells flawlessly, effortlessly, in an instant, at scale, with power, and in apply them in ways which are not standard (e.g. levitating water rather than solid objects).

So all the knowledge is within your grasp at Hogwarts. The question is: what level of ability do you achieve with this magic by the time you leave the school? That will vary depending on the student's individual talent. Some completely fail. Others do the bare minimum needed to pass. Others excel.

On that front, we know that Dumbledore showed his examiners things they had never seen before, and was publishing articles in magical academia, exchanging letters with the greatest magical minds of the day while still a teenager. Similarly Tom Riddle is described as being the most brilliant student Hogwarts had ever seen. Grindelwald is also described as brilliant while he was still at school.

In short: if you're in the top tier of wizard, you flourish early. If you've got to age 18 and you haven't yet shown sign of being a Dumbledore-level talent, you're never going to get there.

So, to recap:

- All the magic needed to fight a top level duel is covered at Hogwarts.

- Top students have already mastered that magic by the time they leave Hogwarts.

What this tells us is that a Dumbledore-level wizard is probably 95% of the way to being the finished product by the time they finish Hogwarts. Post-Hogwarts, they are going to be experiencing significantly diminishing returns on new magical knowledge.

After Hogwarts, you may pick up useful and powerful spells here or there, and you might gain niche skills not taught at Hogwarts like occlumency, but the foundation of your magical repertoire is already all there. I would imagine a Tom Riddle at 18 would be almost as dangerous as Voldemort at 60.

** Using time turner to train trope. However that can complicate things aswell. Harryndoesnt have to be as good as Tom in everything just the auror subjects. The stuff that be useful in combat trans defence and charms maybe potions. Forget about everything else.

I get that he probably can't catch up to everything but in canon he was a sort of defence prodigy. Killed a basilisk survived triwizard tournament and cast patronus.

What Im saying is harry was plenty powerful in canon however toms advantage came from versatility being able to use unlockable curse and experience. Harry could have easily been trained by Flitwic to have more experience and make up the gap.

Harry's advantage was the surprise factor. Tom underestimated and obsessed with harry ultimately he had to great of a ego to consider harry a threat but saw him as a slight to his perceived immortality. Basically voldemort was a prime example of dark triad ofbpersonalities

Narrsisitic Manipulative (Machiavalian) Psychotic

He possessed the power he knows not because tom underestimated harry constantly only seeing Harry's emotions and classifying them a weakness.

Because of that and a bunch of luck harry was able to win anyway. Power wasn't the issue it was experience versatility and tactics.

Oh look Harry's best friends and mentor Dumbledore Hermione and Ron the dream team for defeatingnt the antagonist.

To make this trope realistic don't give harry superpowers but train him to build up hisweeknessesnin these areas were his friends can help.

** I think that you partially answer your own question.

From the time that Riddle finished Hogwarts, he did little other than collect trinkets for future horcruxes and plumb the depths of the Dark Arts and other magics. He needed time to travel to Albania to collect the Diadem so call it 1947 through 1970, when he began his campaign of terror. That's basically 23 years of study of the Dark Arts.

Dumbledore, in contrast, was an exceptionally bright student while at Hogwarts, excelling in Transfiguration and even dabbling in Alchemy. He graduated in 1899 and, perhaps, spent the next two years studying Alchemy under Nicholas Flamel. He returned to Hogwarts to teach in approximately 1901.

He continued working with Flamel (In the summers, perhaps? Over Christmases, maybe?). Perhaps he had 3 months of the year to intensely study his own pursuits.

69 years with 3 actual months of work each is 23 years. They were on par with each other, but Voldemort was probably more focused in his studies than Dumbledore.

** He can be, and my personal head canon is that he while he has the power in a couple decades he will be on par with Tom and dumbledore in skill It's just not possible for him to do that in the 7 years he is at hogwarts He can become stronger than most other magicals by the time he graduates as long as he applies himself but to become a true magical titan would require him to continue learning and pushing himself for years after he graduates

** Problem isn't that Voldemort is 40 years older than Harry. Voldemort spent around 20 years studying his craft while Harry Potter learned that magic exists only 7 years ago. So it's not like Harry can't catch up to him. But he can't catch up to him by seventeen. Tom Riddle couldn't rival Dumbledore when he was still in school. That's the problem.

** The problem of comparing Harry and Voldemort to me has always been about intent and not magical power. Of course Harry is not on par to Voldemort's skill level, but maybe he could match him or.at least put up a decent fight in 20 years or so. But the limiting factor here would be what either is willing to /do/ or sacrifice to win a fight or battle or even the wider war. And this is the crux of the problem, the bad guys (and Voldemort in particular is an excellent example of this, since he is really really evil and amoral) are just willing to break all rules and laws, they don't care about a lot of things that are super important to the good guy (Harry is an excellent example of this, he has a very clear moral compass and a lot to lose). Some lines are just very difficult to cross for the good guy, and the bad guy does it with no problem.

I am re reading DH, and when reading the scene at the beginning after the Trio escaped Bill and Fleur's wedding and they are ambushed by 2 death eaters in Muggle London I immediately thought of how much more useful and practical it would have been to just kill those 2 Death Eaters. They are confirmed Death Eaters and they have attacked and maimed and killed before and the Trio knows it, and they know they will continue to do so. And yet they can't kill them, they don't truly consider it. Because it would have cost them too much of themselves. Harry is clearly the leader, there is a line about Ron being relieved Harry decides to wipe.their memories and leave it at that. What would have happened if Harry decides or at least suggested to kill them? Apart from the more personal consideration about his own character, Harry would have most likely lost the respect and with time support of his two best and closest friends. Good guys have limitation where bad guys do not, generally speaking.

And this is at least a really cool thing about the ending, Harry has one thing that makes him more free to act than Voldemort, and that is that he is willing to die. He doesn't want to of course, but he is willing if it is necessary, while Voldemort is so scared he doesn't consider it for a second and that fear limits him constantly.
