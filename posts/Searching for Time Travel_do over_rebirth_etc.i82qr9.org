Soooo.... I'm looking for Fanfictions where a character basicly starts everything again with memory intact for whatever reason. It could be because somebody died 7 times and meets dead or because somebody fell into a time Turner cabinet or somebody has to raise himself or whatever else you can find.

Please also find some more unknown fanfiction or fanfictions that are not available on ao3 and fanfiction.net. It can be from this sides, but there is a higher chance that I haven't read it, if it isn't on this sides. Lastly I would appreciate if the story was finished, but then I have likely read it already.... so just give me everything you have.

Thank you people a lot <3


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

In which a Goundhogs Day looping Harry is completely off his rocker, after trying and failing to defeat an Evil Overlord List abiding Dark Lord, for upwards of one hundred thousand (subjective) years.

In fact, Harry's been looping so long that he's starting to run out of time. Better get it right, now. You'll never see the inside of Hogwarts, there's no time for that...

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Harry gets another chance - and another and another. At some point, they stop feeling like chances at all.
