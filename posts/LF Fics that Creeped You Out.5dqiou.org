** Intentionally creepy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be Thou My Good]]. My mental image of the Cenobites is probably informed by memories of seeing the first Hellraiser film at too young of an age.

Unintentionally creepy: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7093738/1/Brutal-Harry][Brutal Harry]]. The bit with Hermione in the graveyard is just pointless gore.

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

*** This one is weird because it isn't look over your shoulder creepy, it's just sort of vaguely unsettling.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.
