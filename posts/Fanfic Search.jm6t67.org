I'm looking for a fanfic I read a looong time ago. I've been looking forever and can't remember enough of the details to find it!! It was on fanfiction.net not Ao3 (though maybe double posted, I dunno). It had Hermione back in the Marauders era, and she ends up sacrificing herself for Harry in Lily's place. I think it was Remione or Sirmione? And I'm pretty sure she was Harry's aunt, so either bio or adopted sister of Lily or James. I mostly remember she sent Lily and James away for the night or Oct 31 knowing Voldemort was coming without them knowing the reason (something innocuous) and when he came she let herself be killed). I know that's kinda vague.. but I've been trying to remember more about it for ages and can't find it!! Any ideas??
