I'm looking for long fics where Hermione isn't one of the main cast. She's not one of Harry's or the Mc's friends or their love interest or a friend or love interest of some one else close to them.

I've noticed there will be alot of AUs where Harry may end up in a different house have different friends but he's still friends with Hermione so I'm looking for something different.

Harry doesn't have to be the MC could be someone else like ( not Hermione I've read quite a few protag Hermione stories too id like something else) but Hermione still can't be close to them either.

But the mc does have to be a canon character no ocs.

I also don't want like a Hermione equivalent either. I have read two stories where Hermione wasn't in the main cast and Padma was instead and Padma's characterization and skills basically became the same as Hermione. So not that.

No major character x Oc romances

No Lord Potter or super op Harry or other MC stories he can be stronger or smarter than in the books but just not like the strongest smartest person in his school or anything so like the other cast can have relevant talents .

I'm not looking to shit on Hermione or anything I just want stories where she's not relevant just to switch things up a bit.

Slash is fine

No ships is also fine.

Preferably long doesn't have to be complete.


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431454/1/What-Would-Broz-Do-A-Harry-Ron-Series-of-Events]]; [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12656823/1/Granger-Who]]) are the best I can find off the top of my head.

You might find something [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/No-Hermione-Allowed/124957/][here]] but I can't say all of them are bash-free.

  A collection of related one-shots spanning Hogwarts, where Hermione never has her Halloween epiphany and so the trio never forms, leaving Harry & Ron to bro their way through Hogwarts, forced to learn for themselves what they need to know.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament) is almost entirely Hermione-free, except for a few of the first chapters.
