Something like "my guided life"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3695419/1/My-Gilded-Life]]

But a bit less over the top with the changes and well written.


** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6473434][Unspeakable Things]]/ (200k words, complete): Harry and Ginny (like Voldemort) happen to have been born with off-the-scale magical power. Gilderoy Lockhart (an undercover Unspeakable) and Luna Lovegood (his more-than-a-little-insane assistant) are assigned to train them to exploit their exceptional ability.

*** For what it's worth, DM's story was based on [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4289379/1/Detention-in-Defense][this one shot]] I wrote some years back for a SIYE contest. (I recall it was nearly a last-place finish in the final balloting. Go me!)

It's been awhile, but I recall the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7487494/1/The-Chronicles-of-Harry-Holmes][Chronicles of Harry Holmes]] (112k words, complete) also having a competent Lockhart.

** There is this oneshot: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3312486/1/][Battles with Basilisks]]

#+begin_quote
  AU. Harry and Ron visit the office of the Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor to tell him where the Chamber of Secrets is. Everything Gilderoy Lockhart writes about himself is actually true.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8324961/1/][Magical Me]] was inspired by My Gilded Life. It's probably a bit better (not written by PL!), but not that good either.

#+begin_quote
  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all. (Formerly titled 'Gilding the Son of Lily').
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] /contains/, but isn't /about/ a competent Lockhart.

In this one, Lockhart is competent, but still technically a fraud, so YMMV: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6635363/1/][When In Doubt, Obliviate]]

#+begin_quote
  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

*** I'm liking Magical Me so far. Granted it's extremely Gary Stu, but it seems to be done quite well and isn't taking hugely absurd leaps like my gilded life was.

*** I would like to second When In Doubt, Obliviate. It is a much more effective portrayal of Lockhart as someone with the same characteristics, but who is still believable.

** Warning to those who don't realize it and might click the link, exposing themselves to some heinous plot holes and beliefs: "My Gilded life" is an extremely right-wing religious wack-job self-insert story where the SI won't drink tea, but finds murder completely acceptable. By the time chapter 7 rolls around, it's full-blown crazytown.

** Oh God Not Again! contains a Fraud Lockhart, but he's extremely competent in his true area of talent: the acquisition and management of fame. He basically becomes Harry's mentor. It's also complete, well-written, and good. Peggy Sue.

** I remember reading one where Lockhart was obliviated and read his books thinking they were true. I can't remember the name though and my brief google-fu was not up to the task. Does anyone know the fic?
