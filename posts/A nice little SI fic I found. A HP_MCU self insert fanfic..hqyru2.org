Professor Dovahkiin by LargeFarva.

The premise is that a normal human is ROB'd and dropped into the fusion between HP and MCU in the avatar of his Skyrim character.

I know literally nothing about Skyrim, but I still understood the few references there are, rest you can google for your selves.

Usually WebNovel fics are.. meh. But this one was amazing. It's still going on, with regular updates. So enjoy.

*** Sorry, but I don't know. Sufficient Velocity should have a reader mode on it, but you'll still have to use the browser.

I just downloaded the WebNovel app and downloaded it on there for offline reading.

**** Thanks, I'll try to look around again, see what falls out.

I have an e-reader that's very easy on the eyes, compared to my computer and I use it almost exclusively

Edit: Turns out, Calibre has a plugin called Fanficfare which is pretty good at handling weird URL's and turning them into Epub's or MOBI's

*** if you are still interested:

- [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare/wiki][FanFicFare]] - I recommend the Calibre plugin version... allows you to download a whole =Threadmarks=-page from SB/SV/QQ/AH.

- +[[http://www.omnibuser.com/][Omnibusser]]+ - Combined a =Threadmarks=-page into a epub that one then downloaded... but it has broken down and been discontinued.

- I would stay away from /WebNovel/, as it's owned/run by *Qidian* (Popped up when Noveltranslations got big(ish), strong armed a formerly vibrant scene into moving over Translations to their site by having ownership of original works... then started using MTL^{Machine Translation}-quality Translations while nickle&diming users for access... and stealing translations/novels etc etc.)
