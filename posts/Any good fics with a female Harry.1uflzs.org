Overwhelmingly often, this plot device is just used as a way to write a self-insert Mary Sue into the story, and/or as an excuse to write really bad shipfics.

I want to find a well-written fem!Harry story, and hopefully some of you guys have some reccomendations?


** Man, I am with you. I really like fem!Harry, or gender!swap in general (have you read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8202739/1/Weasley-Girl][Weasley Girl]]...?), but so often stories that employ those tropes are pure crap. Here are a couple I've enjoyed, though.

The following two are both WIP's that I bookmarked, but I don't remember a lot about them other than the fact that they're both girl!Harry and both are decent enough that I decided I wanted to keep reading them if/when they're updated.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/422080/chapters/704262][Girl in the War by astridfire]]

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/497962/chapters/872933][Rose Potter -- the Girl-Who-Lived by josephina_x]]

This one is also a WIP, but I remember more about it. I really like this one, I think that the author characterizes Harriet and Snape really well. But it is an eventual Snarry, and I know that the age difference thing squicks some people. Nothing happens while she's in school, though. Nearly 400,000 words have been written and they are no closer to being in a romantic relationship than they were at the beginning.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/536450/chapters/952621][The Never-ending Road by laventadorn]]

And finally, this one is a bit different. It's not fem!Harry /per se/. I'm not sure how to explain it other than the fact that it is very, very AU. Also it's eventual HP/LV. But HP stands for Haesel Potter, and hardly anything is the same as it is in canon. It's very well-written, for what it's worth.

*** Also, have you read Harry Potter and the Mysterious Case of the Girl Who Lived? It's not technically fem!Harry, but it is. Harry is placed under a curse where wizards perceive him to be female, but he is still male. There is a chance Voldemort is under the same curse.

** These two are the only straight up fem-harry fics I'm in the habit of reccing these days.

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] by Slygoddess*

This one gets a bit bogged down in melodrama, but the story, writing, and characters are unparalleled. If you like or can tolerate femslash, this fic is for you. There's something in this one for everyone really. /Hard R/

*[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] by Taure*

If you like Taure's theories about magical theory, you'll like this fic. He's a decent writer, and even though this has a bit of throwaway plot, it's very readable. /R for saftey/

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690/1/Holly-Evans-and-the-Spiral-Path][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]] is great, but kind of intense. Definitely worth reading the first 2-3 chapters to see if you'll enjoy it.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8299839/1/Alexandra-Potter][Alexandra Potter]] is amazing. It covers only her first year, but it's possible that Taure will continue on with a sequel. It also explores magical society more than it is explored in canon, so there's that.

This is a very well written and thought out story about Harry being a girl. It's finished and is part of a trilogy written by the author.

** I took love a good gender swap story. But I only read completed stories because there is nothing worse than getting engrossed in a story only to find out it's not finished and the last update was 2010...

It's a shame most of the stories listed in this thread are incomplete :(

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]] is definitely worth the read, i'd rate it second only to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6008512/1/A_Butterfly_Effect][A Butterfly Effect]] which has already been mentioned, it's a bit dark and the eventual paring is femslash if that bothers you.
