Like the title suggests, I'm looking for a fic where the Potters aren't betrayed while they are in hiding (either Peter doesn't go to Voldemort, or they have a different secret keeper) and Harry is raised by his parents and Sirius never goes to Azkaban. Any help you guys could give me would be much appreciated.


** Are there any ffs where Peter is actually a good guy? That would be interesting.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]] Is pretty good. It isn't exactly what you are looking for. PM, if you want the spoiler of exactly how it fits what you want. Since I don't think this subreddit has a spoiler tag.
