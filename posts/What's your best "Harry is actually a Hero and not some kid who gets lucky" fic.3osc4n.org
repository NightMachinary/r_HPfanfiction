In canon Harry doesn't train (outside of forth and fifth year). In Rune Master he is Political, is a prodigy in Runes, and does legendary things. Granted he is overpowered but he should be if he is Voldemort's equal. The fic doesn't make Voldemort a pushover like some overpowered Harry fics.

Any other fics out there that make Harry into the legend he should be with making him some multilast named lord who has more money than the rest of England combined?


** Lately my tastes in fanfiction have been changing, I use to love Powerful Harry in Hogwarts. Then I got older and started to realize that there is no good reason for an 11 year old to be respected in a national government, or be able to out duel a trained professional (Outside of Horrific Child Soldier situations, which I haven't found any stories that really delve into that subject.) Also, it kind of irks me when you find out Harry is the richest man on earth and is the only person to figure out investments. A lot of wealthy folks in Harry Potter seem to come from old money, and old money usually knows how to invest.

However, I still love a strong protagonist, I just think it shouldn't be done over a single summer, with wish fulfillment solving all his problems. I would love a good Post-Hogwarts Harry who is 30-35 years old and had a good solid background in adventuring, possibly start young with an apprenticeship that slowly builds over years or, if you have a young Harry, make him a child solider and really explore that avenue to it's greatest extent. I want people to be uneasy about this tragedy that has befallen this child, but at the same time be cautious about letting someone with such blood-stained hands enter the school. A Harry who's life has known nothing but violence and obeying his leader at all times adjusting to 'modern' society.

Sorry, just realized I didn't recommend anything..... ummmmm Linkffn(Forging the Sword) it doesn't fit the criteria I listed above, but it is well written, and shows signs of Harry becoming a Hero.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** I hate the ones where Harry becomes super powered after like 1 summer of training. That's not how that works. The best super powerful Harry stories are usually the ones where Harry skips Hogwarts to dedicate his life to training or trains hard over all seven years at Hogwarts.

I'd actually like to see an overpowered Harry story where he dedicates all his time to training and ends up doing horrible in his classes. He'd be super powerful and moderately smart but since he doesn't study the curriculum or do homework his grades are abysmal.
