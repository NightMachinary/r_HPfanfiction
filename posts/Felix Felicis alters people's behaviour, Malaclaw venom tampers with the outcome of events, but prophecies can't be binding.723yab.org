It's something odd that occurred to me.

In a way, 'good luck' is events coming together in an unforeseen way to provide a beneficial outcome. 'Bad luck' is the opposite, events conspiring to cause an undesirable thing to happen.

Now, with Felix Felicis, we get to see Harry take it and experience its effects. He promptly abandons his plan to go to talk to Professor Slughorn and decides to head down to Hagrid's place for Aragog's funeral.

Conveniently, along the way, he finds that Filch just happened to forget to lock the front doors that night, and that Slughorn just happens to be talking to Sprout outside; AND, Harry easily talks Slughorn into coming to the funeral with the prospect of getting acromantula venom. Slughorn and Hagrid get drunk, Harry talks Slughorn into giving him the memory, game set and match.

Now, Slughorn himself has good reasons to be out at night (he's collecting some herbs from Sprout which are best picked at twilight), and his interest in getting some acromantula venom is predictable self-interest. But Filch forgetting to lock the doors is improbable, and Harry's decision to go to Hagrid in the first place is downright irrational (as pointed out by Ron & Hermione), yet it still gets him exactly what he wants.

Therefore, it's safe to say that, even if Filch really did just naturally forget to lock the doors, Felix Felicis can and does alter people's behaviour, potentially in irrational ways, in order to trigger them to accomplish a predetermined objective.

^{Also, the battle at the end of the book, where a bunch of Harry's friends used Felix Felicis. I don't know if they split it up between them or one of them radiated an 'aura' of luck, but there were no fatalities on the Hogwarts side except for Dumbledore's pre-planned death.}

Now, there's these things called Mackled Malaclaws; if they bite you, it has the unusual effect of making you 'unlucky' for up to a week, with bets, wagers and ventures definitely going wrong during that time.

Consider that for that to be effective, all kinds of physical phenomena would have to occur; dice would have to roll the wrong way, mice would have to get into potions ingredients, racehorses might sprain their legs or just tire, customers might slip on wet floors and sue...alternatively, malaclaw venom may act as a reverse-Felix-Felicis, triggering people to make bad and impulsive decisions which are guaranteed to muck up their plans.

So, we have two substances, in Harry Potter canon, which can, if not alter the fabric of reality, then alter the way people act, in order to force specific future events to occur (or not occur).

Yet, when the question of how binding prophecies are comes up in book 6, the same book where Felix Felicis is introduced and used twice to devastating effect, Dumbledore explicitly points out that the prophecy has no power except for Voldemort believing in it. This is a contrast to how far-too-many fanfiction writers treat it as something binding.

...Unlessss...wasn't it awfully convenient that Snape heard just enough of the prophecy to tell Voldemort, thus triggering him to go and attempt to assassinate Harry Potter, thus ensuing that it's actually fulfilled?

I know that Dumbledore says that not every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecies is fulfilled, so that's evidence against them actually having binding power after all, but still.

Just something to wonder about. Isn't it odd that prophecies are apparently not-binding whatsoever, when we have a potion and a lobster-thing's self-defence mechanism which actively alter fate to cause or prevent specific future events?


** Perhaps a seer can only make prophecies if the conditions are such that the prophecy will be fulfilled? As in if Snape hadn't been listening, Trelawney wouldn't have made the prophecy. Or would have made it in another place at another time.

What i'm proposing is that seers can only make prophecies about things that will happen, even if a prophecy predicts it. The prophecy or fate won't force it to happen, merely it's just a prediction of the future, but the prediction itself isn't informative enough to bring about any meaningful change, only changing a few minor things.

Minor things like the fact that Voldemort would have probably come after Potters eventually, merely at a later date, since they had defied him several times, and he probably still would have tried to kill Harry even without a prophecy, to tie up loose ends.

As for some prophecies being unfulfilled, perhaps the usual divination can later give enough information to bring about change and the divining itself can't be predicted by prophecy.

** I wonder if the luck-bending properties of Felix Felicis and Malacaw venom are more due to what they cause the person to do. For instance, it's quite possible that Filch did forget to pick the doors and that he does so more often than we'd think, but we never see it because it's never important to the plot. And 2 teachers talking isn't that odd, nor is it odd for Sluggy to want to collect the acromantula venom. And we know there's nothing odd about Hagrid getting drunk. So what changed there is Harry. Normally, he would've gone to Slughorn's office. If he had that night, he would've been unlucky because Slughorn wasn't there. So by influencing him to go outside, the Felix Felicis caused him to take advantage of events and become luckier.

Similarly, Malacaw venom might cause people to make choices that seem like bad luck in hindsight. Betting on the wrong horse, or going the wrong way to find someone. Not looking before crossing the street. Stuff like that would seem like bad luck when it hurts them, but it's really a result of their choices.

So then we have prophecies. A couple posts have already mentioned the self-fulfilling nature of prophecies, and I think that's very accurate. It's the same in Harry Potter as in Greek mythology: someone hears a prophecy they don't like, they try to thwart it, and it actually sets the stage for the prophecy to come true. Just like Felix Felicis and Malacaw venom, it's not that fate is altered by the prophecy, but that a person's choices change in response and that causes the fulfillment. In a way it's also similar to how Time Turners work. Time travel is always a stable loop in canon (Cursed Child excepted) and the future cannot be changes because the future time travel has already happened in the past. Likewise, the prophecy is a read of the future based on choices people are making in response to it.

TL;DR version: predestination isn't a thing but precognition can be since it's based on the choices people make and everything is a giant mind-numbing loop

** I think time turners are also important to figuring this out. As we know from the third book, they create a fixed timeline ([[https://m.imgur.com/gallery/bc8Du]]). It seems Harry and Hermione were destined to go back in time no matter what. Does this mean everything is irrevocably destined to happen? When Harry uses the Felix Felicis in the sixth book, some of the "Luck" had happened before he drank it, such as Aragog's death or that Dean and Ginn were already going through a rocky patch in their relationship. Could it be that these had happened because Harry was destined to drink the Felix Felicis?

** I think it's just a case of prophesies being self-fulfilling...it doesn't have any power of its own, but if someone actually acts on the prophecy, it comes to pass. Adding to that, they are awfully vague(both of canon prophecies could apply to a large number of people), so i can kinda see what Dumbledore means about prophecies having no power

*** Hmm...I wonder, what if prophecies were meant to be fate-binding, but the degree to which they did so depended on the 'strength' of their prophet?

So, like, a prophecy (or maybe a dictate) uttered by a dark lord who has lots of training and has bolstered their magic via dark rituals or such, might be a binding curse that outright twists reality and controls people to force it to come to pass. Like that spinning-wheel curse from Sleeping Beauty, or possibly the curse Voldemort placed on the DADA position (and there's another fate-twisting magic in Harry Potter, come to think of it).

While prophecies told by not-as-strong wizards/witches, might not have as much power, using one or two bursts of chance to try and engineer themselves into self-fulfilling prophecies. And prophecies by squibs, centaurs, giants or otherwise those with very little magic might have no binding power at all (Bane read Harry's defeat in the planets, which is part of why he was angry at Firenze. Possibly? I'm not sure.).

And of course, if someone's dead by the time their prophecy can potentially come to pass, their magic would most likely be unable to bind whoever they prophesize about, no matter how powerful they were when they were alive.

--------------

...Hang on, there's the beginnings of a plot in there.

When one of Salazar Slytherin's descendants married a Seer, Voldemort as a descendent of that line inherited the power to use the Third Eye; in addition, the dark rituals he's performed (and many sacrifices he's made) to augment himself have bolstered his magical muscle to the point that his prophecies are almost inescapably binding.

The curse on the DADA position at Hogwarts is proof of this; doing a 'test drive' of a ritual designed to create 'controlled' prophecies with a witness, Voldemort placed his malediction that no defence teacher at Hogwarts would stay for longer than a year.

Now, having used these style of binding prophecies a fair few times over the years to mark his enemies for death, Voldemort's planning a big one; a foretelling of the future where he reigns victorious and wields absolute power over all beings on Earth for eternity.

To make /this/ one happen, though, is going to need more than his own power and a bunch of Death Eaters as witnesses; to make this prophecy of doom binding needs Voldemort to gather several famous and legendary people to hear it first-hand, including his nemeses Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, he needs just the right site to draw tremendous amounts of power from the earth's ley lines, he needs symbols of his power that help translate his words and intention into material reality...

Can our protagonists prevent Voldemort from executing his grand plan to kidnap dozens of world leaders and heroes, raising an epic Evil Overlord castle, and gathering a bunch of magical artifacts of supreme power?

** Prophecies only tell an extremely vague prediction of what can possibly happen/come to pass and it usually does happen because people take it at face value and act on it. Voldemort went after the Potters of his own accord and they weren't the only ones he could have went after. It's also highly likely he would have attacked them eventually anyway just did so sooner. If you never hear a prophecy you won't be as obligated to act on it. Also didn't Trelawney randomly start speaking it in a public place? I forgot where they were at the moment.

** I think you're making a mistake in assuming that the front door was the only way to get out of the castle that night, and that FF altered Filch's behavior in order to make it that way.

Maybe FF just makes the best of all possible options? For example, FF "knows" that the best end to the night is to get the memory, or uses the drinker's mind to determine the best end of the potion. Then it prompts the drinker to make choices to achieve their goal.

So if the front door had been closed that night, Harry would instead have had the sudden urge to jump out the window onto the back of a friendly hippogryph who'd just happened to be passing by.

I think that would work if the Malaclaw uses precognition to "unluckily" hunt.

** Maybe prophecies are only binding /IF/ someone hears it. Just like how felix felicis would obviously have no effect if not drunk, a prophecy would have no effect if no one knew about it. The prophecy could possibly have been preordained once spoken in the presence of dumbledore, regardless of whether or not snape was there to snitch to voldemort. Dumbledore would have placed security measures in regards to Harry and Neville's safety after their birth and events would fall into place to ultimately result in a confrontation between Harry and Voldemort.

** I believe the idea with Prophecies is that once they /start/ taking place they can't be stopped, but they can be ignored altogether. From the moment Voldemort heard the prophecy and acted on it, the rest of the thing was bound to come to pass; but if Snape hadn't overheard it and everyone had shut up about it it wouldn't have been realized.

** Its my head canon that the main ingredient in felix felicis is malaclaw venom with one of the important parts of the brewing being to increase the potency of the bad luck that the venom gives which is one of the reason it is so dangerous to get wrong. The other impotent step in the brewing is inverting the Bad luck from the venom so that it gives good luck.

** In my headcanon Felix Felicitis is like the Path to Victory from Worm.

It will lead it's user always to the desired outcome, as long as it's in any way possible to achieve.

Just except with Felix there is no conscious control over the parameters of the desired goal. Felix decides what's best for. Not you yourself.

** I've always considered Felix Felicis a trans-temporal subconcious feedback loop taking advantage of the multiverse theory where it finds the decision branch out of all possible outcomes that the user's subconcious deems most successful or 'lucky' and then alters the behavior to follow that timeline. (think that weird fizzy soda from Methods of Rationality but a lot more complex) Malaclaw venom could probably do something similar but in reverse. The problem with that is that the venom is something that occurs naturally while felicis is a Potion and thus actually engineered? A particularly amusing theory is that the Venom can manipulate nonpersonal events via Chaos Theory (roll of dice, horse tripping on inconvenient rock, ect) and the Felix Felicis affects personal choices, and if both are ingested for the same period, a remarkable amount of... things occur, that would count as bad luck but also being really lucky about it (having a Dark Lord shoot you with an Avada Kedavra, but reflecting it, causing said Dark Lord to die instead?) which would sort of explain the eventfulness of all 7 years of Harry's schooling.

** maybe prophecies are really just chronologically questionable accounts of events caused by felix felicis? They would come to pass but its always really open-ended? Enter Theodolphius Fortitude Fry, muggleborn potions master and terrible bowler. Theodolphius is tired of losing at Bowling Night, and brews a batch of Felix Felicis in order to win. Somehow, he still loses the game. He doesn't understand what happened until he reads the newspaper the next morning: the headline shouts: 'You-Know-Who defeated by Boy-Who-Lived.'

Or even better: 'Seers' just take swigs of Felix Felicis and start saying nonsense.
