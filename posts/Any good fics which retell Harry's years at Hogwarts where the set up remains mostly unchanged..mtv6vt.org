By set up remaining mostly unchanged I mean Harry is still orphaned by Voldemort and he is forced to live with the Dursleys at least until Hogwarts. He is still sorted in Gryffindor and remains friends with Ron and Hermione and the characters' behavior is mostly canon compliant. Other than that anything is fair game: Harry can have whatever relationship with the other characters, he may or may not be a Horcrux, Voldemort may or may not be a threat, the blood discrimination may or may not be an issue. I am just looking for a retelling of Harry's years at Hogwarts with different events and preferably a lot of cool world-building/new magic. If you know of such a series or even one story, I'd be grateful if you could recommend it.

Edit: pure curiosity and I don't really mind it all that much but who downvotes these kind of posts? I'd think it's a rather innocent one, not expressing any unpopular opinion, you're quite free to ignore it if you don't care about it but if you know a story you enjoy (or wrote it yourself) you can share it, so I don't really get it why some people do this.


** If you want one that follows an mc female oc that goes into the de as she grows to be a spy I got one. The Dursley's when Harry is a baby are tricked to send him away to a ‘boarding school' that's strict in boys, like the one they tell aunt marge he attends anyways. He lives with the Dursley's for the required two weeks a year to keep Lily's protection spell but then mainly lives with Regulus, Remus and a disguised Sirius who escaped from Azkaban a short way into his sentence along with Neville who Regulus got custody of and Sirius' daughter my oc. There's tons of world building and new events and enemies along the way until eventually the third Wizarding War begins and threatens to destroy the Muggle and Wizarding world.

Summary - In a post Wizarding War world families are torn to shreds and in the middle of piecing themselves back together the Black Family, notoriously wicked for generations, is the target of Minister Fudge's wrath for a scapegoat to make it all go away. Only what he never expected was the uproar the youngest assumed dead member of the clan would unleash on him to ensure he rights all he has done against her family. Though soon enough she learns Fudge is only the tip of the iceberg, much bigger wicked fish are circling in those waters waiting for her to slip.

**** It's different from the books. Definitely an au. I know the founders idea was one of my oldest ideas for the series back when the books were still coming out so I stuck with it because it makes more sense in the third book when making allies in the new world they escape to.

It's a niche series, it's ok if it's not your thing. It's just the opening to save having to rehash it when oc uses the book later, it all plays in later on into the series and two books after. You did say you wanted world building and new magic in the description.

** There's one I read part of recently that has the tiniest change being that he writes to Dudley in first year, it's a really tiny point of divergence and it's pretty good. Is that what you're looking for?

  An attempt to go against a popular trope. What if, instead of becoming dark/grey and gaining more power that way, Harry had been a little more considerate? Begins with a small change in first year, and sticks close to the original, but sometimes small changes can add up to change the world.

  Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts had two new teachers - Gilderoy Lockhart for Defense Against the Dark Arts and Regulus Arcturus Black for History of Magic, taking over years 1-5 from Professor Binns. It turns out, that change starts a ripple of events that may change the fates of some people forever. Or not.

  Albus Dumbledore's hiring habits leave a lot to be desired. Even if the choice of teachers weren't questionable, the methods are. Who would expect a headmaster to use blackmail quite so masterfully to keep his staff quiet about his regular bouts of negligence and ideas that put his students at risk?Thankfully there is one professor who has the heart and the means to help.
