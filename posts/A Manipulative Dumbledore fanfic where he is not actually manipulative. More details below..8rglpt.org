Like, if Harry 'discovers' that Dumbledore is manipulating him, and there's a big build up until he confronts Dumbledore about it. But then Dumbledore retorts with perfectly plausible reasons for each of his 'manipulations'

I think that this would be hilarious to read, and I wondered if any idea like this exists. Thanks! Edit: a word


** linkffn(Rise of the Wizards)

Harry ends up integrating some soul fragments of the horcrux while fighting against it. This leads to him absorbing some part of Voldemort's personality leading him to mistrust Dumbledore

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulative Old Coot), though it's McGonagall who retorts. Dumbledore's too soft.

*** My favorite part of this fic is the head of house summoning button. Imagine how many other Gryffindor students are the hero in their own story and want to rail against the establishment and McGonagall hears the call and just sighs, smartens up her appearance and goes to rain down no nonsense lectures on their heads. I imagine afterwards she and Snape hold contests trying to one up each other on ridiculous students during staff meetings while Sprout and Flitwick just share commiserating looks, because it's always the quiet ones and these two are drama queens.

  My take on the manipulative Dumbledore stories - from Dumbledore's point of view. Written late at night, not proof-read. Will probably go over it later, if people think it's worth a tidy-up.

** I'm confused. Are you asking for a Dumbledore who is not actually manipulative but seems like he is, or are you asking for a Dumbledore who is manipulative but doing so for a good goal?

It sounds like you're asking for the latter, but still thinking it isn't manipulation. As in canon, it's still manipulation even if for a good goal. Not necessarily bad, but still.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  It is said that convictions are more dangerous foes of truths than lies. What if the tale of the wizarding world wasn't the truth, but merely an interpretation of it? What if a single spark, instigated a man to do what was right, than what was easy? Starts at the end of fifth year. AU. [Elements from Fate/ Stay night] [Rated for Dark, mature themes]
