** The Reluctant Champion: linkffn(13160344)

Reluctant Champion is a GoF fic, Gabrielle is aged up to 16, and she's (at first unknowingly) bonded to Harry emotionally. There is some realistic relationship-drama even with the "veela bond" stuff in place.

The story assumes an AU where Harry didn't cheat by timetravel during Prisoner of Azkaban, and as a result he saw Sirius get the Dementor's Kiss. It's not quite an angst-fic but it gets close sometimes.

From what I've read of the author's Discord, this is somewhat of a backburner-project for them - they have other fics that are updated more regularly, but they haven't abandoned this one.

EDIT: Just read the "has to be complete" requirement. Sorry, it's incomplete but updated back in March.

#+begin_quote
  Book 1 of a Trilogy: Harry Potter thought his life could not get any worse. No parents, the worst childhood one could ever imagine, and now no godfather. Harry Potter was wrong. When his name comes out of The Goblet of Fire, Harry is abandoned by those closest to him, and is sure that he is truly and completely alone. Once again, Harry Potter was wrong.

**** I would assume, indeed, that "book one" means there's multiple books planned. I wouldn't be surprised if each book would cover one year at Hogwarts.

The fic is currently just past the First Task, so either way book 1 is going to take a while to complete. If you're really, exclusively looking for complete or near-complete fics, I wouldn't necessarily bother with it.

I /will/ say that it's very well-written overall - some weaker moments at the very beginning but he's in the process of rewriting that IIRC.

***** Gabrielle has no agency. No matter what length the Author goes to to explain that she does, the central point of the entire story is that she has no agency.

She cannot make a single decision on her own. Her entire existence is to serve Harry. She is forced into magically induced pain if she disobeys him. She receives pleasure if she obeys him. All of the whining and ranting that Harry does about 'not falling for a doll' is pointless, because it's exactly what happens.

The author tries very hard to write his way out of that hole, but never really accomplishes that. No matter how many times he tries to go 'well she has Free Will because Harry wants her to be independent' it's bullshit because said free will can, and does, disappear with a single stray thought. And worse, these instances are presented as positive things in the story.

Gabrielle is, at best, a drug addict, at worst a slave, depending on how you want to read it. She is physically incapable of doing anything Harry doesn't like. And the consequences of it are never fully explored.

Like why in the world would you want a GM of a sports team who is incapable of making a decision that irritates the star player? And won't even bring it up to him because he doesn't want to hear it?

Hell, she's sexually assaulted and Harry makes it all better by imagining her in a slutty outfit. Like....what?

There's a scene where Harry scares off some thugs by faking being a Vampire and later Gabrielle whines that she froze when she is trained better than that. It only very very briefly touches on the fact that she froze likely not because of Nerves but because that's EXACTLY what Harry wanted her to do. She's incapable of even defending herself when Harry is around because of what may be nothing more than a stray thought.

With the constraints of the 'Bond' in the story, she is incapable of being anything other than the doll Harry claims he will so flatly reject. She is incapable of making a decision that does not appease Harry. It doesn't matter how much he tries to write his way out of it, it literally can't happen. She is not allowed any hopes, dreams, or agency in her life that do not revolve around being subservient to Harry Potter. She is far closer to property than a person. I find it disgusting that people consider it to be a romantic story at all as one party is magically incapable of actual love.

And to me, that makes it super creepy.

****** Holy crap! I never thought it that way, I think never realized this version of the bond worked that way. I agree it's quite creepy, I much prefer the ones where she's just aged up and Harry falls in love with her naturally(maybe she has to call his attention) and this allows people to write her as her own character and not mini-Fleur.

It always had a strange feeling for me because of all the "bonded at 8"

Thank you for ruining my guilty pleasures re-reads! Or not, I will probably just interpret the other way though.

  Not your usual veela bonding story. When young veela enter puberty, their instincts guide them to the perfect man. It's either love or death for these beings of lust and flame, and Gabrielle Delacour has her mind set on love. HPGD

  English story; girl!Harry. It had been four years since Malfoy had changed her... four years since the War had ended. It was time for her to come back.

  The events of the second task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament will have great and long lasting effects. Join Harry as he comes into his own with the help of family. Events will push pairing together but not instant soul bond. Harry is angry about his treatment by those at school but not betrayal, mainly disagreements. Good but human Dumbles. Rated T for mild language.
