I don't know if it counts, since it has an actual plot.

*** Ok. So yeah. It has a plot and they ask for porn without a plot.

However.

The sheer volume of sexual antics in detail and passing this fic has more than qualifies it for any non slash recommendation thread.

** The free use experience. Very good smut with fluff, atrocious plot and laws bad enough that neither the Third Reich nor the Stalinist USSR ever dared to implement them. Technically it has lots of plot but it is so bad that you better off just ignoring it and search for the sex scenes. Conveniently the author puts "content warnings" in front of each chapter so you just have to skim over a few chapters to get to the good stuff. The smutty part is superbly written and has a relatively unique premise (Harry can turn into a girl and back due to metamorphic shenanigans) and the sex scenes are kept realistic (no 12-inch poles, three hour fuck sessions or other stuff you see far too often). The "firsts" feel plausible and are not just instant perfect sex.

Sadly the author hasn't updated for some time.

**** The "good" chapters are 1, 11, 13, 14, 23, 34, 35, 36, 41 and 42. Between all the bullshit plot there are a few good scenes in between but I lack the patience to find them.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Harry and his twin sister are the Twins-Who-Lived, and their parents survived that Halloween night, there is a sexual social experiment at Hogwarts known as the Free Use Experience. Starting at the age of fourteen, students can willingly volunteer. Willing witches are used sexually, not only in private, but also in public. Harry Potter, a Metamorphmagus, who can change his gender, is forced to volunteer in the Free Use Experience as a girl at least twice a week -- including once during the week when he/she must attend classes during the day. To prepare for the Experience, Harry, his twin sister, Rose, and his girlfriend Hermione have begun a sexual relationship prior to their Fourth Year at Hogwarts.NOTE: This story is my most mature and risque story to date. It is not for prudes or readers under the age of 18. This story will probably have some type of sexual situation in many chapters. Read the warnings (tags) and heed them well. If you do not favor (or qualify for) any of this, turn back now. Relationships and Characters, and Tags are not final and will be CONSTANTLY UPDATED!This story can also be found on Fanfiction.net under my pen name/real name Vance McGill
