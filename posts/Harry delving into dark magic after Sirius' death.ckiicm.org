Pretty much what the title states, looking for a Harry that decides to get into dark magic after the department of mysteries debacle. Not looking for a "Dark/Evil Harry" per se, more along the lines of a Harry who decides to fight fire with fire.

Maybe fics where Harry tries to hide his new interest in less than legal magic from Ron and Hermione, or with Harry sneaking out of his house to explore Knockturn Alley or even fics where Harry is very much in the wrong for learning dark magic. None of those are must haves but wouldn't mind fics that include them. Preferably no bashing, but if you have a good one with with bashing then share it! Also preferably no slash


** Its an old fic, and sadly abandoned, but it checks out. linkffn(Cage and Key by Faromir)

There's also (abandoned as well, but much longer) linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw)

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Summer of Change by lorddwar)

Harry trained by the Unspeakables (with Tonks as his partner and love interest). There are a lot of training montages though and the fic may not have aged well.
