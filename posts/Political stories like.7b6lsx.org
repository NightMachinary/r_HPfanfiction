Recently reread â€˜Son of Potter, Daughter of Black' and I'm looking for stories like that. Not necessarily genderbend Harry, but a more political story, don't even have to be Harry. Melania is just 16 and Head of House, she's a fighter and protects her family, she is just, respected by most and the story is well written. It even have some romance in it! That's what I'm looking for. It's hard to explain what I'm looking for, but people who've read SoPDoB and loved it might understand.

God know I love the Lord Potter/every other Lord trope (guilty pleasure), but this time I'm looking for something more sirius head of House stuff. Not just using it to escape a manipulative Dumbledore (though bonus for that!)

Thank you! :D


** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) has a lot of political undertones. Black Pawn is the first installment and corresponds to the first year of Hogwarts, so Harry and friends aren't involved in politics yet. However, it's a multiple POV story, so you get to see what's going on in the outside world via Amelia Bones, Rita Skeeter, etc.
