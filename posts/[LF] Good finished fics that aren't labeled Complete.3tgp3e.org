It's technically missing the epilogue chapter, but it works perfectly as a completed work.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** Dunno if you can call it complete when the sequel is being worked on over at DLP.

**** DLP doesn't exactly have the best track record at finishing fics so I wouldn't hold my breath. Sequel or not, I was happy with the "ending" as it is.

** Honestly, no. I know that when I finished something, I marked it complete. That said, I have lost two fucking accounts to lost emails addresses and this could be a factor....at least, on ffnet.

*** Wasn't there a time when FFN didn't /have/ that 'complete' option though? So there could be some really old stuff that's done but not marked.

**** At apparently the fear of being downvoted for expression an experience, the Old Timers would always say stories are complete in the summary. So yes, you are correct.
