Pretty much what the title said. In addition, the Pevensies (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) also lived in London, because they had been evacuated to the country (how they ended up in the house with the magical wardrobe to Narnia) during WWII.


** I haven't seen any crossovers for that yet. That sounds like a brilliant idea though! Maybe someone will pick it up.
