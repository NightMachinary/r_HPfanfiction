** In the Albus Potter series by NoahPhantom, there is an OC who does some intensive research on Patronuses. One of its properties is that it can absorb the Avada Kedavra if its cast at the same time as the killing curse. Its also identified as a derivative of an ancient ritual used to summon the guardian spirit, which is powerful enough to kill Dementors, but it comes at the price of corrupting the soul. There is also an Anti-Patronus which can be used to summon the Dementors.

However the OC is quite minor and its mostly Albus Potter that uses the charm throughout the story based on this OC's research.
