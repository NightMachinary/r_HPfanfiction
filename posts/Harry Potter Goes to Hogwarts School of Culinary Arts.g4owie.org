Ok I had this really weird idea while eating tacos (not unusual most of the weird stuff happens after tacos. Mmmm tacos.)

Crossover with Food wars/ Shokugeki no Soma

(note, I haven't seen the show in awhile, please don't critique me too harshly as this is all being thought up in a taco induced food coma at 3 am.)

So basically instead of magic, Harry is a culinary genius. Hogwarts is maybe not a castle more like big mansion? So basically take stuff from soma and apply it to Harry with some twists. Like instead of there being different classes of students (look it up if you don't know what Im talking about. Lots of details) the houses represent different varieties of food. Like Gryffindor is all about meats like beef and pork. Ravenclaw could be all about high class dining and precision plating. Hufflepuff could be about anything and everything to do with pastries. And Slytherin would be about Seafood who have an eteneral rivalry with the meat head Gryffindor. Harry could be sorted into any of the four or make an entire new house or something.

So in the anime, there's the top ten students who become basically the best chefs ever. Soma in the anime is the son of seat number two I think...? (no quote) In the anime the bad guy is an old student I believe who is trying to either shut down the school or take it over for money. Please don't quote me on that. It's been awhile since I've seen an episode.

Let me know what you think. It'd be a difficult fanfic as you'd have to do research on many different dishes, preparations and cooking galore. But I think it could be really cool.


** Have you ever read linkao3(Harry Potter and the lack of lamb sauce) it's quite good and focuses on cooking.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.
