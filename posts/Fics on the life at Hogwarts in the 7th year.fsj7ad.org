Since Harry, Hermione and Ron did not go back to Hogwarts and "The Deathly Hallows" follows their journey, we don't get to know much about the life at Hogwarts in that year. Can you suggest some well written fanfics that is on Hogwarts in the final year? I guess it would need the story to be told from the perspective of someone who was in Hogwarts in that year. Maybe Snape or Ginny...


** The Changeling includes seventh year, as does Six Pomegranate Seeds and The Green Girl. linkao3(189189; 7944847) linkffn(11027125)

Both are very AU. One has a Slytherin Ginny, and the others have a Slytherin Hermione. Likely not what you're looking for as they cover the full seven years, but they're good reads? The Changeling especially.

  Ginny is sorted into Slytherin. It takes her seven years to figure out why.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path.*time travel*

  Hermione is sorted into Slytherin; how will things play out differently when the brains of the Golden Trio has different friends? AU. Darkish Dramione. COMPLETE.
