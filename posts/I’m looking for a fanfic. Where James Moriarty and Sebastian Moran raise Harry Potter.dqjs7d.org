I think Sebastian Moran kills the Dursleys and takes Harry with him. Moriarty and Moran are in a relationship of some kind. It's kind of funny, when harry gets injuries during a quidditch game Moriarty scares Dumbledore and is very protective of harry. Harry is a normal 11-year-old, Just a little bit more accepting of murder


** I might have this... I'll look
