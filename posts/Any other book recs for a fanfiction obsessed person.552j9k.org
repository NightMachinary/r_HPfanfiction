Ever since i started reading fanfiction my habit of reading other original works has disappeared. Others who have experienced this, do you have any good book recs for me?


** Same here. And it gets worse actually when I read a new novel & liked it. Because then I start to search fanfiction based on this book.

** Have you read Neil Gaiman? He is a gifted story teller and he offers that britishness coupled with a tone of mystical wonder. American Gods, Coraline, Neverwhere and Good Omens are some of my favorites of his.

** If you want some published Fanfiction Cinder (Marissa Meyer) is Sailor Moon, Carry On is Harry Potter, and anything by Rainbow Rowell is amazing. If you haven't read Fangirl by her I would highly recommend it, it's a must for fanfiction readers. I'm currently reading The Handmaid's Tale and it is lovely if you like books like 1984 or Brave New World. If you like poems and cats then I Could Pee on This: And Other Poems by Cats (Francesco Marciuliano) is a very good quick read.

*** Seconding the Lunar Chronicles series by Marissa Meyer. I loved the cyberpunk setting and the awesome female characters.

*** Fangirl is great. It sort of calls back to Harry Potter without actually being about Harry Potter.

**** I would imagine /Catch-22/ fits under that description, if you haven't read it already. /Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas/ is absolutely hilarious once you get past the initial surprise of it being mostly Hunter S. Thompson's insane cocaine-addled fever dream. /A Confederacy of Dunces/ goes without saying. /Trainspotting/ is also incredibly funny, but not even remotely lighthearted and it can be difficult for people who aren't familiar with the Scots dialect to understand, so YMMV on that one.

** While her work does have a lot of flaws, I find Mercedes Lackey satisfies similar desires to fanfic. Many of her series all take place in the same world, with different characters, at different times. /Arrows of the Queen/ is the best place to start. If you find a favourite character in that book, odds are Lackey has written at least one other book about the character you liked most.

** I like biographies of famous people a lot.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Augustus-Life-Romes-First-Emperor/dp/0812970586/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475165531&sr=1-3&keywords=augustus][Augustus, by Anthony Everitt]]: I find Augustus fascinating because his rise to power was one of the very very few examples in history where a Trio of teenagers defeated their enemies against overwhelming odds and succeeded creating an order lasting for more than two centuries. (The Principate stopped working after Septimius Severus took power in 193AD)

[[https://www.amazon.com/FDR-Jean-Edward-Smith/dp/0812970497/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475165764&sr=1-1&keywords=fdr][FDR, by Jean Edward Smith]]: FDR is simply my favorite US president.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Titan-Life-John-Rockefeller-Sr/dp/1400077303/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475166050&sr=1-1&keywords=titan+the+life+of+john+d.+rockefeller+sr][Titan, The Life of John D. Rockefeller, by Ron Chernow]]: Rockefeller was born in a very poor family, never had an university education, and became a billionaire by the end of 19th century. Regardless how you view him today, his rise made an excellent story.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1501127624/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1475165456&sr=1-1&keywords=steve+jobs][Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson]]: He was a jerk, but also a genius. His love/hate relationship with Bill Gates is story for the ages. This book also shines some good insight into the tech industry. I have to say this book helped me making lots of money in stocks.

** One thing I like in fanfic is deconstructions. Two deconstructions I've enjoyed are [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307279863][Soon I Will Be Invincible]] and [[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0079XPUOW/][Redshirts]].

** After fanfiction entered my life, I stopped reading original works altogether it seems, and I used to be considered a bookworm.

Literally I racked my brain for at least ten minutes and the only thing I came up with was when I read the Da Vinci Code wayyyy back in the day. And that was because I had no internet and was on an international flight.

** I think it's so difficult reading books now, at least for me. When I first started reading fanfic, I could still read published books. Now, I only reread books I've liked. There are a few authors that I will read regardless. I really love [[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle][Howl's Moving Castle]] by Diana Wynne Jones. The Miyazaki [[http://www.veoh.com/watch/v208113346GkK6deZ][film]] was based on this novel. There are two books that follow "Howl's". Her other books, though I haven't read many, are lovely as well. I love her descriptive writing.

I'll post more recs when I'm done with classes for the day.

** I've been struggling to find decent fanfiction I haven't already read, so I've turned back to actual published work. As already mentioned, American Gods by Neil Gaiman is well worth checking out. TV show coming out next year has a lot of potential as well. I'd also recommend 1Q84 (Haruki Murakami) and Look Who's Back (Timur Vermes).

Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is good if you're just looking for something to kill time reading, but is more of a young adult novel than the previous three mentioned.

** I thought the premise of Altered Carbon (the first Takeshi Kovacs novel) was interesting:

#+begin_quote
  In the twenty-fifth century, humankind has spread throughout the galaxy, monitored by the watchful eye of the U.N. While divisions in race, religion, and class still exist, advances in technology have redefined life itself. Now, assuming one can afford the expensive procedure, a person's consciousness can be stored in a cortical stack at the base of the brain and easily downloaded into a new body (or “sleeve”) making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen.
#+end_quote

Be warned: this series has smut scenes (usually one easily skippable passage per novel) that make Fifty Shades seem like Thackeray or Dickens.

** If you want something similar to fanfiction, the author of the lie I've lived, jbern, has written some original fiction as well.

This one and its sequels are pretty decent. Haven't read his other series.

[[https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-D-List-Supervillain-Jim-Bernheimer-ebook/dp/B004WE0D3E/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1475359824&sr=8-1]]

Not on the level of Martin, Rothfuss, Sanderson, etc. But a good break from fanfiction that still has a similar easy to readness to it. Also it's basically superhero fanfiction just with original characters instead of the established ones.

** The Name of the Wind is a good book for fanfic readers. It has excellent worldbuilding, plenty of familiar but well-written tropes, and it's a standard Hero Journey that excels at character quirks and just being a whole lot of fun. If you like Indy!Harry fanfiction that doesn't take itself too seriously, you'll like it.
