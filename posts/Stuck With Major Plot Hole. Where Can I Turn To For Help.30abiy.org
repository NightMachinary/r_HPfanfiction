I'm currently writing a fic and I'm having problems with fleshing out a motivation for a character's action. Should I try to get a beta on ff.net? Is there a specific DLP forum I can use? Is this too off-topic for [[/r/HPfanfiction]] ?

It's not a major pressing concern yet but I've just realized the magnitude of this error and want to get some assistance before I complete any more of the story. Other writers, what resources have you used if faced with any similar scenarios in your past? Any help would be greatly appreciated.


** I can take a look at it if you want. PM the details?

** For a second there I was worried you had written yourself into a corner regarding the less than possible survival situation. Actually, while I'm thinking about it, I never did send you that message did i?

If not here it is:

  I guess I missed where you mentioned the scale of this area they're in. It seems like it's no more than a mile radius but irl it would probably be impossible for them to find enough food in that little space given that they can't yet hunt. On the other hand, if it was much wider, say a dozen miles, it would take them (being 12 year olds) days to walk the entire perimeter and weeks to see the entire interior, especially with it being primarily a forest. I probably should just reread the whole thing again to make better sense of it, but I still think the setting is too vague and nondescript. I'm used to fanfic where you already know a huge portion if the places, so without that background information, in my head their discussions might as well be floating in an endless gray blob. A drawn map would be cool, especially since Hermione is making one, maybe you could make it for her (and us)?

  As far as plot goes, you're never going to be able to recreate a real survival situation, and not for lack of trying either, I simply mean 99% of the time you stick a couple kids in the woods, they're dead within 3 days. Eating the wrong thing, drinking bad water, not enough shelter (hypothermia can set in at 50F air and 60-70F water. Both of those go up if it's raining or windy), infected or disabling injury, panic attacks, etc. Assuming they're not in a magically controlled climate, they wouldn't make it to Halloween, let alone Christmas. The first snow would kill them. Hell, just not disposing of their waste properly would kill them.

  I'm curious what you're going to do about these issues. Handwaving them is immersion breaking, but having them cared for by someone (hidden obviously) might be hard to write.

Anyway, I Still very much enjoy your story, even if it's unrealistic. The quality is just too high to ignore.

*** Closer to 2 miles in diameter, but the size is slightly immaterial given that they're now using Harry's broom and James' cloak to hunt. I figured a racing broom would cover the ground fairly quickly now that they've demarcated their boundaries.

I've already made a few different maps and will share one once Hermione makes her third or fourth version. By then - around four to five months in - they'll have almost everything mapped out. Their first priority was defining the boundaries of that area and even that rather simple task took nine days. A two mile diameter circle is 87 million square feet. I think it's plausible that it would take them a very long time to learn more about the environment than 'mostly forest' after only a few days. Thank you for raising the point though. I'll make sure to address it.

You're right that everything feels like an amorphous grey blob and it's intentional. They'll gradually discover more about their space and that will go hand in hand with fine tuning their efforts to forage, fish, and hunt. Winter is also approaching which will present its own challenges. As they have more detail about the space, so will the reader. I felt it was disingenuous to immediately describe all details of their beautiful prison right away. Perhaps that was a mistake?

I've already got conflicts plotted that address each of these, but you're absolutely right that in nearly every instance they wouldn't be able to survive.

**** I'm very happy that you have already started mapping it out. I know for me, knowing what my setting looks like has always been a hurdle. I don't think it was a mistake exactly, more that I think you should have had a general sort description, like "the lake took x amount of minutes to walk around", "the sun was hidden behind dense forest as it rose/set" and "the sun could be seen through the trees as it set/rose", "to the south of the camp the beach extended into a small open field for x amount of minutes walk".

As far as the 87 million square feet goes, I think unless you're talking extremely dense (100% ground cover) forest, the kids could walk across the whole distance in 20 minutes at most. Visibility in a forest could range from zero to a mile or more. That sort of description would give your setting a lot of description. Adding in elevation, even if it's just a few small hills or just one spot that can only be seen as being higher based on the trees bumping up a little, also would make sense.

After thinking about it a little while, I'm coming back to the two miles number and still not liking it as far as realism goes. I used [[http://obeattie.github.io/gmaps-radius/][this tool]] to drop a one mile radius circle on my house in the suburbs of a city, as well as on a small lake we own a trailer near, which is about 20 miles from a city and fairly wooded.

In both cases, it's still too small for me to believe there's enough food to survive on. The lake had a decent amount of fish, but its landlocked and stocked by the owners association. That should be something you address, because I don't think you mentioned the size of the lake or its source/drain point. There are deer and wild turkey that come through the region, but they tend to stick to the fields a few miles west. In the city circle, even if it was completely undeveloped, it would be very thin forest with mostly birds and squirrels but almost no deer or wild turkey. They're all many miles south across the river. The city circle though gives me a much better perspective of the distance because all three of my schools are just on the outside of the circle (to the north, west, and southwest respectively), I walk to work to the northeast, and there's a park I go to all the time to the southeast. It's basically nothing distance wise. The territory of wild predators is generally many times that.

Now I'm not really sure about the flora and fauna of "south of Hogwarts" but I imagine if it is in fact a real place that is just hidden, and not a magically created place, then it won't be truly wilderness. There's definitely forests and areas where you can get lost and where it looks pristine, but it'll be almost impossible to be somewhere no one has ever been.

I dunno, I guess it's fine for what you're trying to do. Probably better to just ignore me to be honest.

Although you should only really ignore the whole distance thing. Everything else is probably a good idea.

Also maybe describe their shelter? Because you mentioned waking up under the stars and even with a fire, they really can't keep warm enough like that.

***** I'm intrigued enough that I have to ask a question: aren't these folk magical? They survive direct impact with cannonballs traveling at the speed of automobiles. They're immune to most muggle diseases. If even one of them has a functional wand, they need only apply limited brainpower and have a four-bedroom underground bunker with running water.

I read this on DLP and had forgotten. It seems unlikely, but AFAIK it is canon. If a wizard broke into the CDC in Atlanta and licked a culture of Anthrax spores, do you think they'd get sick? I do, but canon says no. Seems to fly in the face of the whole germ-theory-of-disease thing. If wizards can get Spattergroit or Dragon Pox, why not have symptoms from cholera?

Second year fic. If it weren't for [[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/source_bos.html][this canon compliant text]] they'd be completely screwed. I'm trying to avoid the all-powerful Harry-Sue and super-braniac Hermione-Sue tropes.

You do bring up some good points though. Thanks for keeping me honest.

******* Kudos to your planning- you've chosen the best point to challenge them. They know just enough to realize that they'd be fine if they knew a few more spells.

As for the anthrax challenge, I'm of mixed feelings on JKR's claim of blanket immunity- why would they have a cure for the cold (pepper-up potion) if no one is susceptible to it? Still, there are magical diseases that haven't crossed into muggle society so maybe they have a hyper-charged immune system and the magical illnesses feed off the magic.

****** Where in canon does it say they're immune to disease. In canon, quidditch injuries are routine and no big deal because they have experienced healers on hand. Not so in the wild. They're also 12 and inexperienced in magic.

******* If you accept Pottermore as canon (I realize that not everyone does) JKR does discuss muggle diseases. She says wizards are immune from/can easily cure things like the flu or illnesses muggles could get and really only have problems with magic-induced health problems.

** If it's not already resolved, I think it's appropriate to mention your problem in this sub and brainstorm with the hive mind ways to resolve your issues.

Myself, I tend to do this when stuck for ideas on how to resolve a plot point (Alpha Fight Club and DLP's Work by Authors subforum are two resources that have proven valuable for me).
