** How is it overused? They are in a school setting(Most fics are at least), detention is likely to come up even if only as threats. And honestly it comes up quite a bit in canon as well just to summarise the three I can recall:

PS: evening/midnight in the forbidden forest looking for Unicorns.

OoTP: Umbridge giving detention to all who questions her: according to the wiki, from 5 to after midnight.

HBP: Snape gave Harry detention at least once a week for the remainder of the school year.

*** In canon? I actually find most of canon enjoyable, and the books are still the best. They did detentions to a reasonable degree.

But fics? I'm saying they're one of the plot devices that's poorly done.

**** One of the largest reasons for that, I'd imagine, would be that there are a lot more fics. Than there are canon stories.

A single fic, might not make it seem 'overused' but 1 000 fics might make it seem overused. But at the end of the day, those fics are not related to each other.

Have you ever heard of sturgeon's law? The vast majority of fics are crap.

****** I doubt it is overused. I doubt I read the most HP fanfics, but I read a lot. I can count on both hands the amount of times it's been used on the fics I'm currently reading, and still have fingers left over.

And as you mentioned: Sturgeons law, 90& of everything is crap. IDK how many fics have detention as a central plot element or use it to kick start a part of the story. But I'd imagine 90% of them are shit.

** What I don't get is how the detentions are done... Late at night... When they have class and homework... No definition of time limits or punishment fitting the crime. Total plot device

*** Well, there's no class at night, and it's usually after dinner, so between classes ending and dinner time (2-3 hours) they can do homework and then eat and then head for detention.

I mean, they live at the school, being out later is kinda... different than if they had to cross a city to get home.

**** Several times they stay in detention til midnight and then have classes the next day. Ridiculous. And sending them into the forbidden forest was just insane. Even with hagrid considering he split them up and sent two underage kids and a cowardly dog off by themselves

*** It's:

In the evening, with whoever, doing whatever, for as long as they decide.

So: With MCgonagall twice a week doing homework for 3 months, from 19 in the evening till 21. Is one example

Another is: With Snape, cleaning cauldrons and vials three times a week for 3 months from after dinner till curfew.

** Yes, especially in romance fics.

There are a plethora of ways to get Harry with Daphne without detention or a marriage contract. Canonically there's a whole Charms Club and other 3rd/6th year classes to take advantage of.

But it's kinda like a fic where Harry faints from magical exhaustion.

** It's fine, as long as it's not something like McGonagall or Dumbledore saying â€˜A month of detentions'.

Like what does that mean? Surely you can't give someone a detention every night for a month. When are they gonna do their work? Plus it's entirely out of character, especially for Dumbledore.

*** It's completely out of character and is usually a plot device.

I'm saying that as a plot device it's overused.

Although, the whole excessive punishment is also a bad trope. What, McGonagall does it twice, Dumbledore never does it, and Snape is a dick.
