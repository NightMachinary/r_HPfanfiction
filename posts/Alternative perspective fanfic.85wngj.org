So i have never been much of a fanfic person, I was a terribly uninformed noob who thought fanfic was all erotic fiction. However, i am 57/64 chapters in of A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles by Rannaro. A story that tells the whole book from snape's perspective and I love it. I was wondering what the best fics are that show a different perspective on the events of JKR's books. The best marauders fic for example of fic from Hermione/Ron's point of view? Anything to keep me immersed in this world


** Fanfiction was definitely not what I expected until I started reading it. I haven't read too many stories that are simply different perspectives on the series but I will recommend A call to arms Linkffn(8078750) which shows an alternative perspective on Deathly Hallows, specifically what's going on at Hogwarts while Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the Horcrux hunt.

  Harry proudly accepted the title of 'Dumbledore's man through and through' but how little does he, do we realize that Dumbledore was 'Harry's man through and through? Their years together, now through Albus's eyes, see the bond that these two share.

  One-Shot. The Order is frustrated by Dumbledore's lack of information concerning Harry and especially the mysterious prophecy they all know exists - and yet nobody knows what it foretells.

** There's [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] by Jeconais (one-shot, Harry/Daphne)

#+begin_quote
  A eulogy for a Gryffindor.
#+end_quote

And it's sequel [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]]

#+begin_quote
  What happened after Daphne's Eulogy in Perfect Situations?

  Twenty interconnected stories that show how the different people were affected.

  There are two ways to read this story. The "Pulp Fanfic" version, which is the way it was written, or the more prosaic chronological order.

** There's not a lot of these, at least that I've read, but here are the ones in my Favorites list.

Marauders' Era and the canon books from the professors' point of view (very funny): linkffn(4207913,4207913).

Slice of life of fifth year from McGonagall's point of view (even funnier): linkffn(3124159).

Seventh year from Dudley's point of view (serious): linkffn(7129525).
