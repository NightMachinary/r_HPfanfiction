Give me the most irrationally hate filled fics. The biggest leaps of logic, the most out of character actions, the most insidious evil plans. I want them all, but with a catch. It needs to be a serious fic. Some humor is fine, but nothing like Champion's Champion. Bonus points if there's no redemption for any of the people beingbashed.

Slash, crossovers, and dark!Harry are fine. Please no harems, smut/romance-centric plots, mpreg, pottercest or genderbending. Thank you!

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

This one bashes pretty heavily: mostly Ron, Draco, and Snape, but a little Dumble-bashing as well.

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

** For as much as I love Champion's Champion, it derails when Dumbledore is portrayed as a maliciously intentional bungler.
