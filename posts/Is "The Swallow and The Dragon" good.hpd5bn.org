#+begin_quote
  Harry finds a dying ashen haired girl in his backyard being attacked by men in skeleton armor. He obviously swoops in and kills them saving the girl before taking her to his home to heal her. He didn't know the far reaching consequences this would have on him personally. This will start in Harry Potter world but ultimately take place in the Witcher for the most part.
