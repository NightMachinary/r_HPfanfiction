I'm currently re reading and a few things have jumped out to me. And one of them is, as the title says, that Voldemort never actually comes out victorious. Obviously he and the Death Eaters are powerful and terrifying and he manages to kill Dumbledore and conqueror Britain but ultimately he's always stopped, especially when he appears in person, to the point it's almost comical.

He fails to get the Philosopher's Stone or kill Harry in the first book. Doesn't manage to come back via the diary or even kill any mudbloods in CoS. He does manage to get Harry into the Goblet and uses him to come back but then he fails to kill Harry.

In OotP he stays hidden and fools Harry but then he doesn't get the prophecy and has to flee his duel with Dumbledore after being discovered.

After a year of plotting Draco gets Voldemort's Death Eaters into Hogwarts but then all they do is help Dumbledore commit suicide.

DH is of course the height of his power, he rules Britain, starts purging Mudbloods and obtains the Elder Wand but ultimately he dies within the year.

Most of these defeats are a consequence of some combination of luck and his arrogance.

Don't get me wrong he's still terrifying and clearly powerful, we just don't get to see much of that in person. What do you folks think?

Edit: I admit my issue is kinda just that he didn't get the chance really flex. He only duels against anyone except Harry twice off the tip of my head. The first was against Dumbledore in OotP which is legitimately epic but I feel like it would have been a lot more impressive if he had arrived early and wiped out a bunch of Order members, even if it was just background players like Hestia Jones and Daedalus Diggle.

The second time is in DH where he has a real chance to show off since Hogwarts is filled with random wizards for him to slaughter expect they're all protected by Harry's love and wandlore so he does nothing until he gets smacked down by Harry.


** Most of Voldemort "sucesses" came from before the book, during the 1st Blood War. While we don't have a lot of informations about what happened, one thing is sure, he was winning. Bagnold was the 3rd minister of this war and was here because her 2 predecessors were unable to deal with the crisis. The Auror were able to use Unforgivable but it didn't seem to change the war and the Order of the Phoenix was in ruin. Only the Prophecy and his destruction ended the war (mainly because all the people he Imperiused were suddenly free, even if it allowed several Death Eater to escape.

As for the books, Voldemort has 3 distincts objectives there, retrieve his body, take control of Wizarding Britain, and kill Harry Potter (to assure his immortality).

- His first objective is a victory, you can argue that the escape of Harry from the cemetery is a fail, but he still managed to come back. Even worse, his Death Eaters mostly came back allowing him to directly reform their previous structure and he even had one year to secure his power base.

- For taking power, he won too. He may not have enjoyed it too much since he was too busy trying to kill Harry, but he was the master of the country. The murder of Dumbledore was a victory too. Dumbledore used his assured death to organize his suicide in the hope it would block the fidelity of the Elder Wand, but at that time Voldemort didn't even know about it and just wanted his dead so he could take control of the Ministry and the school, and that's what he did. As for the Elder Wand, it's not even sure it would have worked since we don't really know how the fidelity works. Even without Draco intervention, would the Death of Snape by Nagini been enough to ensure it? Or, since magic is about intent, and that Dumbledore created his plan after knowing he was on borrowed time cause by a curse cast by Voldemort, would his Death, even alone in his bed, been enough for the wand to switch for Voldemort?

- The only thing Voldemort truly failed was to kill Harry Potter. And for this it's not really his fault. I mean the guy managed to cast the killing Curse on him 2 time, a spell supposed to kill EVERYONE. The 1st time, the baby is fine and he looses his body, the 2nd time his loose a soul fragment. Maybe he should have used a different spell (but it's his signature spell, like Expeliarmus is for Harry), or destroyed his body later, but this is caused by his arrogance.

​

In the end, even if Voldemort lost the war, I think he won most of the battles fought before.

*** Yeah I totally agree he had victories and definitely achieved a lot of his over arching goals. I don't mean to say he's some kind of goofy character like Filch. It just kinda bothered me that he never wins in person on the page. Maybe that's a bit childish to want him to best some impressive wizards in a duel or something like that.

And I totally agree it's clear he was kicking ass before Harry killed him, the fact people won't say his name is an amazing way to show that in my opinion.

Even if he wanted to spread terror he could have just written the message before leaving.

That's kinda my point, his plots can be basically foolproof and would totally work but his stupidity and arrogance keeps getting in the way and the second it comes to him having to appear in person he loses.

***** Yeah it's strange that he has some pretty brilliant moments but also some moments of absolute stupidity. Like when he hides the diadam in the Room of Requirement and assumes its safe because he's the only one smart enough to find the Room. Except he placed it in a version of the Room filled with other people's junk from over the centuries, it seems like even an idiot could put together he wasn't the first and probably wouldn't be the last to find it.

** Voldemort's ultimate goal was to cheat death. He ended up dying much earlier than most wizards and witches...and this was after spending 10+ years of his shortened lifespan as a wraith. He may have won some battles and achieved power briefly but from a personal standpoint I would say he failed spectacularly.

**** Exactly. Voldemort's three obsessions were as follows:

1. Cheat death: Failed spectacularly
2. Achieve power: Kinda sorta achieved this for one year while Harry and Co. were on the run during Deathly Hallows.
3. Beat Harry Potter: Failed at this over and over. Even when he won (using Harry's blood to resurrect himself) in his mind he failed because Harry escaped and he appeared weak in front of his followers. Harry ultimately defeated him because he was shrewder...something Voldemort would take personal offense to. Harry beat Voldemort's Avada Kedavra using fucking Expelliarmus. Epic failure.

***** It's funny that he constantly stops the Death Eaters killing Harry so he recover his pride and prove he's unbeatable but he just keeps embarrassing himself. If Bellatrix kills Harry in OotP Voldemort has a clear shot to power. Yeah he would take a hit to his credibility but if he tortures anyone who thinks about it wrong eventually it'll go the way of his name.

** I'd say Goblet is more success than failure, sure killing Harry was an objective, but regaining a proper usable body was the larger objective and that was achieved. Not a win exactly, but, idk, I'd classify it a success.

** I feel the same, kinda. It's a bit frustrating, to some extent, too.

We get into this world 10 years after his demise, everyone thinks he's dead but they're all still afraid to even utter his name. And then he appears and somehow every fight is lost. I particularly dislike it in OoTP movie when he fights Dumbledore in the ministry. It seems so easy for Dumbledore then. And it doesn't make that much sense. He wouldn't be this feared after a decade of absence, he wouldn't have succeeded in terrifying the whole community so utterly, if he wasn't more than what is shown in the end. It felt (to me) as if the last books didn't really mesure up to the power and terror he called for. And I'm so glad Draco didn't end up killing Dumbledore because it would have been terribly absurd to see him succeed (however willing to die Dumbledore was) when just before Voldemort failed.

So, yeah. He does succeed, a lot, like the previous answers say. But it still feels, for me, as if there is this disservice to his character when he's put in action. It just falls short, always (or often enough) and it makes it a bit comical because of the dichotomy between his impact/the fear he inspires in everyone, and the actions.

That's probably one of the reason I like to read Tom Riddle's era fics so much, in part. It satisfies my need for this really fearful figure that I was waiting for.

(I'm not sure if this answer makes much sense. But I'm glad to see someone thinks the same thing on this topic!)

*** I admit I have a bunch of random thoughts but I'm spacing out the posts so no one realises what an idiot I am lol.

I suppose a different way too look at it is Voldemort is less of a war lord type, going here and there killing anyone in his way. He's more like a terrorist; sitting in the shadows and building this terrifying reputation by leading monster both figurative and literal. If you dare cross him or even say his name they'll turn up at your house and kill your family in cold blood. At that point Tom could be a squib and no one would dare whisper about it. But in the series it's played up that's he's actually super powerful, he could actually duel anyone up to and maybe even including the Albus Dumbledore, and he loses over and over.

***** Well we don't really know what Voldemort does or doesn't know. We do know that later in the cemetery Voldemort is able to identify the reason that a) his Killing Curse rebounded on him, and b) that Quirrel couldn't touch him. So he may have known/suspected a killing curse wouldn't have worked, but not necessarily that he couldn't touch him.

But yes that is conjecture on my part. The reason he didn't try was most likely he trying to keep a low profile, especially around Dumbledore.

***** Yeah in the other response to me it is pointed out that Voldemort was likely trying to keep a low profile and I agree.

​

But I do point out that Voldemort in the graveyard is able to identify the reason that his killing curse rebounded on him and the reason Quirrel couldn't touch him (Lily's Sacrifice). I posit that Voldemort knew or suspected that another Killing Curse would fail, i.e. that he had already identified Lily's Sacrifice and knew that another killing curse probably wouldn't work, but didn't necessarily know that he wouldn't be able to touch him.

​

But, since we don't know what Voldemort knows/doesn't know during the first book, that is conjecture on my part.

** It's a book with an incompetent villain.

If they really had the numbers that they had in the last battle and had control of the ministry, they could have easily banned apparition/floo for non-death eaters/sympathizers. If they did that and kept watch of undesirable individuals, they would have caught "unauthorized" meetings easily. I think they could have done this in the same way they tracked underage magic and the taboo on voldie's name.

And, they really should have had more death eaters at hogwarts and banned students from going home. They could have held the children hostage to keep the population compliant and fearful. Xeno Lovegood would be easily handled when he started printing those articles supporting Harry if they did it right. They wouldn't even have to kidnap Luna. The whole book 7 did not make sense since voldie did not really control hogwarts aside from having the carrows there. That's a lot of trust on Snape there to keep everyone in line and do the "right" thing to support his agenda.

The story required a really scary evil villain with bloody past and JKR created Voldemort. But her main hero is just a child without significant skills and abilities and therefore the villain had to step down to be on pair with him. As result we got stupid!Voldemort.

Even in fanfiction a rare author dares to make Riddle smart, because they Harry would have to be a lot smarter too and then we'll get another HPMoR ☺️

But seriously, it's just very hard to create truly smart (no just giving negative IQ to others) heroes and villains. Unfortunately it's just not JKR's area.
