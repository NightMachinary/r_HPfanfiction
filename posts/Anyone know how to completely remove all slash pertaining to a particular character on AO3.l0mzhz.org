I have a ridiculously long list of excluded tags on AO3, and I was wondering if anyone could help me shorten it a bit. It would be so helpful if I could just remove all slash relationships featuring Voldemort or Tom Riddle, for example, rather than having a long list of everyone I don't want to pair him with that gets in the way when I want to narrow down my search some more.


** The best method is unfortunately just blocking the pairings or checking your pairings. Honestly you shouldn't really have that big a list. One you block all the big ones Drarry, snarry, tomarry, Wolfstar, the rest of the slash doesn't really pop up.

Also if you're looking for het slash shouldn't pop up unless it's Ginny/Harry, or Ron/Hermione simply cause those pairings get used as background or plot to the slash stories . Once you've checked the box no slash should pop up if you have Harry/Luna filtered

** You can probably use the "search within results" tab and just put -Voldemort. The probelm with this is that it will remove all fics where Voldemort is in the tags, title, or summary. It might be a bit too all-encompassing for what you need.

** As the others have said, the only real way is to block all the popular pairings on top of blocking slash tags in general.

**** One trick to see whether a fic has slash or not in a glace is look at the squares at the left of the fic title.

** I wish tags were linked to m/m, m/f, f/f properly even if the author didn't select it... I end up having maxed out exclusions when I'm searching or browsing..

*** That doesn't always work. Excluding Draco Malfoy still shows fics with shit tags like "draco/harry is so cute UwU". Almost like they're avoiding standard tags to bait readers...

*** That doesn't always work. Blocking "Voldemort" will only remove the character tag, not the relationship one. Fics that have "Voldemort/Lucius Malfoy" could still show up as long as he isn't specifically tagged as a character :/

** The problem is that as far as I know, AO3 has at least 3 "Voldemort as a character" entries, and it also counts AxB and BxA separately. That means you've got to block a lot of tags... And that is just for those that ARE tagged, because a fair few spring those on the reader 5 chapters in and with no warning.

*** Yeah ik, that was just an example. The thing is that having six filters in my search is a lot less cluttered than twelve, and I could also use it with other characters. (It jut weirds me out, for example, when Snape is in a romantic relationship with /anyone/, and I could also use the opportunity to shut down all those "character x reader" stories.)

Tbh, if I had any hope for it, I'd ask for a way for Ron/Hermione to always be the case /if they just so happen to be in the story/. That's how ridiculously specific I am about my tags.

But seriously, there should be a button for "people you want to see in relationships" on AO3.

** This maybe pc only(not attempted mobile) but I believe using "ao3 savior" you can block by using voldemort/* to block out any fic with him in any relationship. Idk how, or if, you can do just slash.

It's been awhile since I configured mine, and I'm not near my pc, so I'm not 100% sure but I think I have somethings blocked out this way.
