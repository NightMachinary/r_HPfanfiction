**** Harry Potter and the Ashes of Chaos takes a healthy dose of inspiration from PoS. Another good series is Sarcasm and Slytherin

****** It's very much in the same vein as SaS and PoS, it takes a lot of things from both of them. It's just starting y2, so I honestly dont rlly know what summary to give anther than if u like those series you'll probably like it. It's first year was pretty good but also again overall pretty similar to those other 2.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Three Black Birds, Deprived, and Negligentia (links below). Three Black Birds has a really good development of the relationship between Harry and his neglectful family (actually explores it and it's not just "Everybody sucks!"), Deprived is just stupid B-Movie schlocky fun with some interesting neglectful-family-consequences, and Negligentia is such a great series where he doesn't get all angsty and shouty-at-everything (though even with three entries in the series, it still feels like the start of a fic and not a full fic itself).

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  On that fateful day, two Potters were born. One was destined to be the Boy-Who-Lived. The other was forgotten by the Wizarding World. Now, as the Triwizard Tournament nears, a strange boy is contracted to defend a beautiful girl.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)
