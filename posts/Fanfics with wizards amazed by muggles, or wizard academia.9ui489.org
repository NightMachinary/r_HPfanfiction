**TL;DR**: suggest stuff with the things from title. Also, generally looking for stories, not essays.

​

So I'm coming off the Arithmancer and Methods of Rationality and I need recommendations for my next binge. To be more specific, here's a general sketch of what I liked/disliked.

​

LIKE:

- *The wizarding world being amazed at the muggle world*. This is a theme that I'm very fond of, because I feel like a lot of people forget how amazing some of the stuff we do is. I've literally had fantasies about explaining a car, step by step, to Arthur Weasley.

- *The wizarding world has academia*, and its own amazing people. I am especially talking about how in The Arithmancer, there exist scholarly journals and magical theory. It just makes the world feel deeper, and resonates with me since I'm in academia.

- That one time Filch got to do magic by making potions.

- Femslash. Obviously not required.

​

DISLIKE:

- *The main character gets too powerful*. Basically I don't like it when the main character becomes a god/amazing wizard at any point it turns out. Even though I love the concepts in the arithmancer, by her 5th year, Hermione was just too amazingly strong and talented (invents spells on the fly, has a whole arrary of special spells she invented, several discoveries of equivalent magnitude to the nobel prize in several different fields, etc.) for me to be remain interested for example.

- *Wish fulfillment* becomes too obvious. Goes hand in hand with the above, but especially when the story starts to feel less cohesive and more like a series of contrived wins.

- *Pointless darkness*. OK this is kind of hard to quantify, but I feel like sometimes things get a bit edgy and miserable for basically no reason. Just a personal preference I suppose, but I felt that Hermione's death in HPMOR was really heavy handed and lead to a bizarre direction in the plot.


** These are all the fics I know that involve wizarding academia, in one way or another:

  Some have argued that the daily drudgery of being a Muggle is too much to bear.[10] This year I learned the opposite is true: they can and do entertain themselves in some interesting, if (delightfully) odd, ways.[10] See for example Chapter 3 of Cygnus Black's No Magic, No Meaning: Our Moral Obligation to Put Muggles Out of their Misery.

  Moon cups, Luna thinks. Moon cups and blood magic. And she remembers the old itch under her skin, and a music box fluttering into a flock of birds, and wonders just how powerful it could be.
