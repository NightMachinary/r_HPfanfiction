Hey all! I'm looking for a fic where one of the MAIN(ish) characters is Jewish; either has Jewish background or identifies as being Jewish. Bonus points if it's Lily Evans Potter who's Jewish. I'm writing a marauder's era fic and I'm toying with the idea of having Lily be Jewish.


** Anthony Goldstein is canonically (or at least by author fiat) Jewish so filtering for stories featuring him will give you a decent selection. In particular, linkffn(Goldstein by Laazov) focus on his Jewish heritage. I know I've also read at least one story with Anthony and Hermione as main characters taking action against prejudice from a more nonmagical perspective, but I can't find them now.

disclaimer: I'm not Jewish myself so I can't vouch for the accuracy of any author's portrayal of Jewish culture. The extent of my experience is celebrating Passover a few times with a friend and their family when I was a child and a few bar and bat mitzvahs.

** A Jewish character should be much more aware or sensitive to Voldemort's (Magical Nazi) agenda.

JKR mentioned on Twitter that [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Anthony_Goldstein][Anthony Goldstein]] is Jewish and distantly related to Porpentina and Queenie Goldstein.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10847788/1/Goldstein][Goldstein]], linkffn(10847788), seems decent enough and explores Anthony's Jewish heritage, and it's still being actively updated.

I'm not aware of any fic featuring Jewish characters during the first war, and I'm not really that enthusiastic about making Evans Jewish. On the other hand, Newt and Porpentina Scamander were well alive during that era (and still are when Voldemort fell in 1998), and being an former Auror and Grindelwald War veteran, Porpentina could have played a major role in protecting innocents and fighting Death Eaters.

In my own postwar world, the Scamanders successfully defended their local community against Death Eaters in the first war, but had to flee Britain after Voldemort took over the Ministry. Porpentina went to America and tried to rally support against Voldemort's regime there. However, Voldemort's speed fall surprised them, so they went back with several volunteers and offered to assist the Kingsley Ministry in rebuilding the Auror Office. Porpentina retired for a final time after Rudolphus Lestrange was killed in 2000.

**** Thanks for the rec! Yeah of course a Jewish character (especially an ashkenazi one) would be sensitive to the rhetoric of blood purity.

​

Out of curiousity why aren't you enthusiastic about making Evans Jewish? I can definitely see how there would need to be some explanations made to make it "fit" with canon, but I'm personally less concerned about that. I really wanted to make one of the main characters of my fic Jewish because that kind of representation is important to me, beyond the obvious parallels between Death Eaters and Nazis (it really is low hanging fruit lol). I thought Evans could be a good fit because she's doubly aware of what's brewing; as a muggleborn and as a Jew. Anyways just curious about your thoughts.

​

I've also seen some fics with Remus as Jewish (ie that Hope was Jewish), which could be interesting. Don't know why, but to me Lily makes more sense.

***** I'm against making Evanses Jewish in canon compliant settings simply because how Petunia and the Dursleys are depicted in the Books.

Now if you want to write AUs, then all powers to you. My suggestion is that this change should have plot implications. Even if James and Lily still couldn't escape Hallowe'en 1981, at least write Petunia differently.

****** fair, fair. I guess to me it would make sense for Petunia to shun her Judaism because of her hatred of anything that's considered to be "different". Especially if they grew up in an area without a large Jewish community and they might have even been picked on in school for being Jewish. Petunia would want to escape anything that sets her apart as being different. But I definitely agree with you that if I do keep things mostly canon compliant I couldn't just make them Jewish and NOT explain Petunia.

  In September of 1971, Severus Snape finds a forgotten portrait of the Slytherin family in a dark corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At the time, he has no idea that talking portrait will affect the rest of his life.
