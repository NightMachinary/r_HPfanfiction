I went back on the site to find an old fanfic and found the hpff site unnavigable.

The new owners have constant pop-ups, asking about my experience and if I want to pay money to “better my fanfic writing.”

I miss the old site and am upset that most hpff authors never moved their hpff posted work to ffn or ao3. :'(

Edit: fyi hpff is the abbreviated form of harrypotterfanfiction.com


** Holy Shit! What have they done to the website? It reads like advertisements!

** It's fucking comical that the stories are still only filterable with a limited amount of preset pairings. It was comical a decade ago and even more so now.

** Honestly, I've never used the site because its UI has been pretty painful all along.

** You don't mean [[http://hpff.com/]] , do you? That's some weird Chinese (?) site. Did you mean [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/]] ? One secret: [[https://github.com/JimmXinu/FanFicFare]] (be it a standalone program or the plugin for Calibre) supports it, so you can download the book as EPub and be happy.
