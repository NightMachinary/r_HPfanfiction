Looking for stories where Harry joins the mafia, like through a previously unknown family member or whatever.


** Smoke and Mirrors and Panic Switch by PCP Harry gets left on the street by the Durselys at a very young age not knowing who he really is but learns to survive from criminals/mob/mafia and becomes one himself.

***** Huh. I didn't realize the two were original and sequel and jumped into panic button because the writing on chapter one of the first one was....clumsy. Sub-par. The second one is greatly improved, but Harry was definitely talking to someone in his head, who was controlling movement. Doesn't seem so much like an alias as another personality?

****** Really? I never got that. Maybe something got lost cause you jumped to Panic Switch? He knows he's Harry Potter but when Vernon dumps him on the street he starts using the name Henry. He then meets Denny Brooks and starts his life of crime and takes Denny's last name to become Henry Brooks. He also gets connected to the Wesley's and uses the name Christopher so that part of him/his life can be separate. I never got the feeling that there were other personalities or that he was being controlled. Harry always seemed like the puppet master and that everything was Smoke and Mirrors. He has you looking right when crazy stuff is happening to the left.

******* I don't know how to make this a quote, but this is at the very beginning of Panic Switch.

---------

Denny!

Snapping out of his fantasy, Denny Brooks realized he was standing where the woman had left him, gazing into the reflection of a shop window with a smug smile on his face. After a pause, he snarled in his head, What?

That's the third time you've got distracted. It's five 'till, you lech! Leave the birds alone!

Henry sounded tremendously irritated. "I'm goin', I'm goin'," he muttered out loud, but mutinously.

You'd think you, of all people, the veritable slag that you are, would allow a man his sexual pleasures, Denny said mentally.

Henry sighed. Perhaps after we settle things with the two most powerful politicians in the world, Den.

---------

Ugh. No formatting.

I don't think I could read it without getting confused about it not being DID somehow, but it does look interesting. :) thank you!

******** Henry/Harry and Denny are two different people. Denny is an older guy that Harry meets on the streets. Harry looks at him as a father figure almost and takes Denny's last name of Brooks to become Henry Brooks. Harry has the gift of Legilimency.

  Where there is a Moriarty, there must also be a Holmes. Now let's see if she is up to the task.AN: Based on 'Business' by esama. Reading that first is required to understand the story.

** I think I saw a Wolfstar fic once where Lupin became a Mafia boss and raised Harry to be an enforcer or some shit. Don't remember the link though, but I'll edit if I do find it.
