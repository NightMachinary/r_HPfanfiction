Hello, everyone,

As many of you know, I will be audioreading Not from Others by FloreatCastellum. linkffn(Not from Others) and other assorted fics. (Full list is on the Google document) There is one problem, though. I am in need of voice actors.

If you are interested, please reply below listing the character you would like to voice.

EDIT: A few people have asked for the google document, here it is. [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MAhsGXqf9eskoXce96pRwSSBbgaNVv7S81oxSDvaXjk/edit#]]

*** I'd be willing to try and pinch-hit for my stories (haven't read the others), although I don't know if I can pull off the British accent.

How are you handling minor characters? Giving them to the narrator or partitioning them among the other voice actors?

So I record using the app you suggested, just all of her lines from each chapter one by one, 2 secs in between lines and email the recording to you? :)
