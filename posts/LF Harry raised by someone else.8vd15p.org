I just want something to soothe my soul from the awful childhood Harry had tbh. I like canon-divergent/critical stuff preferably without Dumbledore/Weasleys being maniacal villains but if I will take it if Harry is just raised by someone who cares lol

OC, Sirius, Dumbledore, the Giant Squid, whatever - I'll mostly likely read it anyway haha


** Stealing Harryverse by Copperbadge is fun. Sirius never goes to Azkaban and he and Remus raise Harry after discovering his mistreatment by the Dursleys. It's Sirius/Remus. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/58157]]

** Off the top of my head:

Linkffn( the Accidental Animagus): the Grangers

Linkffn(time to put your galleons where your mouth is): The Blacks

Linkffn(The darkness within): Voldemort

Linkffn(The Reluctant Champion): James

Linkffn(blindness): nice Dursleys

Linkffn(What you leave behind): spoiler for who it is, but it's not the Dursleys and it's an important part of the story

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

** If unusual crossovers interest you...

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elder sect) is a HP/Bewitched (classic 60s tv show) crossover where Harry lives and America.

Linkffn(Practical Magic works too) is a HP/Practical Magic (movie with Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock) crossover where Harry & Neville both live with that family.

Both series have Harry (and Neville in the second one) learning the unique Magic of their adopted family also.

** I'd throw in my own "No longer alone", where Harry gets adopted by the Tonks family after an AU end of the third year (fic begins on the last day of the term). I'm currently writing the events of Halloween 1994, and before that the fic is mostly "feel good" family fluff with some hurt/comfort and friendship elements in between.

It has no bashing (well, besides Death Eaters being considered human trash), but is critical of Madam Pomfrey, Mrs Weasley and the Hogwarts staff for what they do in canon (not noticing the Dursley abuse, making empty promises).
