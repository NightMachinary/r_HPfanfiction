**** I get where you're coming from for sure, but when I read it I didn't even realise it was to do with HPMOR until I re-read the summary. Only fic I really remembered that fit your request.

  Featuring a Cold War where both sides were helped by wizards, Hermione as a straitlaced bookworm who also blows up buildings sometimes, Harry Potter as a mind-clone of Tom Riddle, three transnational corporations figuring out how magic can be their competitive edge, and Ozland Cunningham who's a little confused about the whole thing (HPMOR fic, AU but not just for the sake of it)

*** The nevernever from dresden files mostly. I was wondering how different mage society would be it they didnt have to actually hide from muggles except those that elect to live in muggle society for whatever reason.

** There was an incomplete fic I read years ago where Harry and Hermione travelled together to reach Hogwarts. They had to go into the wizarding world, which involved riding in carts and on ships. I believe at some point they met Kingsley Shacklebolt, and he tried to get Harry to work with him on his ship.
