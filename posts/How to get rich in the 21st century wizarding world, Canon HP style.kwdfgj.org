Step 1: Build a printer that can print gifs.

Step 2: Sell the required magic ink at ten times the cost of making it while also building the printers to not accept third party ink.

Step 3: ????

Step 4: Profit.


** I always thought that Fred and George's patented daydream charms could be the first step towards the next big thing in the wizarding world. Fanon likes to portray the wizarding world as stagnant but I don't think that's the case at all - magic is intended to progress in an analogous way to technology.

So if you wanted to go a Neuromancer type route you could definitely portray a 21st century wizarding world where increasingly wizards are occupying a "virtual" shared dream world, and where George Weasley has become the richest wizard in the world as a result.

*** I'm not sure if it'd be that legal. Muggle authorities, especially tax related, would find it suspicious and investigate. Magical authorities wouldn't like the potential breach of Secrecy. And they probably have laws in place to prevent Wall Street from being overrun with wizards with halfway decent divination skills. Any realistic magical government would put a lot of effort into making get rich schemes exploiting the muggle world more difficult. They'd probably get suspicious at anyone trying to convert large amounts of muggle money to magical currency. Making lots of magical currency without getting into trouble with the government would likely require doing something completely new, something difficult to detect (magic powered Bitcoin mining?) or something perfectly legitimate like selling inventions to other wizards.

****** Yeah, you still have to do plenty of your own work, but because you have magic, you can do it faster easier, and cheaper than other people. It does require skills as you can't just say Reparo and fix it. You'd have to repair it slowly piece, by piece. You still might have to replace plumbing or electrical systems.

** If you passed Henry by on the street, you would not know he was homeless. His clothes were old, but clean and cared for. His beard was trimmed, as was his hair. He didn't carry the smell of someone who went days without a shower. And even if all he had were three changes of clothes, no one would know.

The factory he had been working on went under almost two decades earlier and he could not find a stable job since, but he was still young enough to work construction from time to time, and still had his papers up to date. Sometimes he was hired for the papers, but construction work was easier to put on the paperwork. Rates were lower, too. He didn't mind. He could not afford a flat, not with his irregular income, never mind a house, but he could affford the necessities. It could have been worse.

The occasional jobs were enough to cover food and water, and even electricity. The abandoned cinema he was squatting in he kept in good enough shape that it looked like it was still owned. The nearby lots with warehouses and garages were empty, too, but more because there was no value in the area than anything else. Structurally unstable. Mine subsidence. Unlivable. Still, his cinema was fine, and he visited the garages too. And then, one day, three kids, barely out of their teens came to him with an offer to buy.

Well, they didn't phase it like that, but they found the place, they liked it... They said they would be willing to pay him to testify. He had lived there for more than 12 years, after all. With his testimony, they could claim the whole area, the cinema, the overgrown, empty lots, the warehouses and the garages under the squatter's rights. They offered to cover all court costs upfront. They offered to build him a proper house, one he would own both the building and land it stood on. They just wanted all the rest - and if he proved his presence, and his work keeping out vermin and paying bills for utilities, the little he used... WEll, the electricity company didn't check if the old cinema went bankrupt or if he owned it - all they cared about was that it was connected to the grid already and that there was someone willing to pay for their power.

Henry though on it for a while... and agreed. The property was repossesed and formally granted to bim and to his partners within a month, during which time they visited to talk and to survey the land. It turned out that land had been in something of a legal limbo, so the adverse possesion was approved by default. There was no one to challenge the claim. He had insisted that the cinema would stand until his house was ready. He didn't have money to live in a hotel or anywhere else if it was demolished. They had just smiled then.

A week later, a tent had sprung up over the first property. By the second week, all were covered and hidden from prying eyes. By third, his cinema was no longer surrounded by ruins. Instead, there were beatiful houses with small gardens and white picket fences. The road had been repaired too, the asphalt smooth and the brick of the sidewalks even and neatly fit into place. Mining damage vanished like an illusion.

"Here you go, Mr. Strong. This one is yours! And here's the deed, already filed and legally binding. "

He barely fought back tears as he receieved the sheaf of papers from the girl, Sarah, who brought back to life a dream he had given up on since after his first workplace fell. To live on his own land, in house he owned. Mark, Sarah, Jessica and John, four children barely drinking age, had managed an impossible. A miracle. Henry lost his battle.

////

"Alright, that is the seventh spot. Jessica, you said you had some buyers already lined up?"

"Yeah, Mark, we've been over this already." she responded "I've got three families ready to move in as soon as you finish the road. Good job on the local surface, but we need an access to the motorway if we want people to buy. How's that going John? "

"Almost done. Should be ready by wednesday"

"Great. And the cinema will be ours, as we agreed. Sarah?"

"Yeah, yeah. All the permits are secured, we own all the surrounding area, we can do whatever. Good thing we strted now, in five years it would have become a monument, and complicated matters. You're not paying me enough to deal with that!"

"But, we do an even split! You get whole 25%?"

"Exactly!"

*** ***/later, at a local pub\/***

*"*Cheer, drink and be merry, friends! It's not every day we can claim such a success!"

Sometime in the evening, all four of them have found themselves sitting at a table. Their last job was bigger than any single one before. "/Who would have thought that you can make so much money renovating some decaying ruins?",/ Sarah thought,"/How come noone else had ever done it before? It's so easy!"/

Most of the homes ended up being sold, and after a grand opening of their own private cinema their group decided to celebrate their success. That it was their seventh official job seemed to make it even more fitting for a celebratory drink or ten.

They've placed their orders, and only a moment later a middle-aged gentleman with a tray of five glasses approached their table and deposited one glass before each of them.

"I didn't want to be nosy", he began, "But i've overheard that you kids are drinkin' up for some success here, aye? Well, i've come to come for a small celebration myself, so i thought i'd share my cheer with ya!", a good-natured smile adorning his features.

Sarah looke at her friends exchanging glances. Sarah shrugged, and made an inviting gesture towards the older fellow. Newly rich or not, who they were to refuse a free drink?

"Thank you, sir, it's very nice of you", she said. "What is it that made you so happy today?"

"Ah, i've got me old job back, kid. Been tryin' to get that un for ages, i tell ya, but somethin' always came up. What about ya young folk then? Got into Oxford or somethin'?"

"Ah, nothing of the sort, /grandpa/", Mark said in good humour, "We're running a business here. Property renovations. Just got our seventh deal done since we've started a few mo... years ago", he recovered, masking the slip up by taking a heavy sip from his glass. His eyes widened and bulged, as if he were to suddenly start choking on the liquid.

"Don't likin' the good, ol' Islay whiskey, eh? Don't ya dare spit it out, Lagavulin ain't cheap!" the old man jeered with a wide grin, then punctuated his statement by taking his own glass in one go and slamming it on the table. "What it was you said, thoug'? Seven house flipped in few months?" he asked with a raised eyebrow.

"Ah, no, no, i really meant years", Mark countered, "After all, it takes work and time and effort. We aren't magicians or anything" he 'joked'. Everyone gave a bark of laughter at that.

"Aye, that you aren't", their guest said. Sarah thought she noticed a briefest glimpse of something sharp in the man's eyes, but before she could dwell on it she felt her legs get gipped together something fierce and her whole body stiffen.

The man smiled and rised, looking at four now teenagers before him, now bound and petrified. Sarah realised the whole pub seemed quiet, as if no sound were to reach their table. She saw the waitress that took their original order walking by as if everything was in perfect order and she didn't see their predicament. She turned her eyes towards the man.

"Michael von Usedom, ICW", he finally deigned to introduce himself, "You're under arrest for gross violations of Statute of Secrecy, misuse of muggle artifacts, unlicensed use of mind magics on non-magicals and running illegal business ventures. I'd say you have a right to remain silent, but that seems kind of redunant, now, doesn't it?". He was still smiling, and Sarah wanted nothing more than to wipe that grin of his face. Of course, that wasn't really an option at the moment, but a girl could dream.

Now introduced ICW official put his left hand on the table, his other now visibly gripping a wand. "/Portus",/ he murmured, tapping the table, and suddenly the world lurched and spun, lights flashing. Sarah felt her breath knocked out of her lungs as her back hit the floor at a new location. Out of the corner of her eye she could see her friends suffering similiar fates. That ICW bastard still stood, smiling, only now he was suddenly dressed in deep blue robe instead of a casual suit he sported earlier. He waved his wand, and more ropes bound all of them as the /Petrificus/ curse lessened.

"Fuck. You", John spat, "Don't you ICW folks got anything better to do?!"

"As a matter of fact, we don't", the official anwsered, a small smile still playing on his face. Sarah could see a slow transition happening, his beard lenghtening and graying in some sort of artistic pattern as he slowly paced to the table to pick another glass.

"Do you think you're the first smart cookies to come up with a scheme to profit off of muggle world? No, my dear friends, you're just recycling the ideas that people better and smarter than you have tried for generations", his smile widened, "After all, i have been one of them!", he laughed. Sarah felt at a loss. What did they did wrong? Where did they fail?

"Well, I'm sure you'd love to hear that story, but i'm slightly pressed for time. You know, muggles to obliviate, assets to secure, Ministers to meet, that sort of thing. Someone shold pick you up soon, anyway." ICW wizard continued, "Do take my advice about remaining silent though. As long as you stay nice, you might even learn how to avoid such mess in the future".

He turned to them, his eyes glowing with a faint sheen. "But do remember", he warned, "Don't try to escape. It won't end well", with that, he apparated.

Sarah could hear some wiggling from her side, propably Mark trying to wiggle around enough to turn and apparate. She, on the other hand, wasn't even thinking about it. She barely even registered the parting words from the ICW official. Her gaze was focused on the full-wall window that was right in front of her.

Behind the glass pane, all she could see was endless black void, dotted with tiny specks of white. Right in the middle of it, she could barely make out a bigger speck, blue streaked with white, fluffy patches of clouds covering the planet they just left.

Took me a while to think of some interesting direction to take this one. I hope you're not mad i've sent your protagonist to jail.

**** Not really, you are free to do whatever. Thing is, normally it would not happen. ICW does not handle individual cases - it handles nations, and there would not be any ICW agents until the situation was already shot to hell (complete breakdown, no longer a country), or they were specifically invited. I mean, they ignored Voldemort.

Add in that they purchased all properties they flipped and removed all magic before selling them, legally they could not only win the case, but also sue for harassment after. The addition of Mind Magic charge could be used to discredit prosecution - they never used any. Just perfectly muggle cloth tents, as used by other extreme house flipping teams.

Add in that they were confronted by one official... The natural course of action would be the guy finding himself obliviated, drunk and in Soho.

But otherwise, it was cool, and generally the more words get typed, the happier I am XD

***** I took some liberty here with interpretations, in that i'd made it so the ICW alwasy works alongside locals or in parallel to them, so that they can keep the handle on secrecy side of things if a country goes to shit.

When it comes to Voldemort, they did a hell of a lot of the work keeping magic secret since it wasn't like death eaters and Voldie were particularily concerned about such unimportant things like muggles.

In that particular instance, ICW simply beat the Brits to the punch in apprehending the perps - a part of their quest of getting ahold of the more resourceful wizards. Some shock and awe, a few legal threats, and a sweet promise of helping their business continue as long as they maybe agree to work with ICW once in a while and keep more cautious about their business.

As for the 1 vs 4 thing - not all wizards are of the same skill, and if you get a drop on someone it should be fairly easy to subdue a few people, especially if you're skilled and they're not.

**** I mean, the oceans pretty big, so despite shipwrecks being an (obviously) finite resource, there might be a more than you think.

I just looked at a Wikipedia article titled 'List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean', and it divides it into pre and post 1492 (Columbus). So even ignoring everything before then, that's 500 years worth of shipwrecks out there. And that's just the one ocean.

That, and "point me" acting like GPS is fanon. In canon, it's merely a Four Directions Charm, and shows north. That means a bit of extra work there. Might be more worth it to just take a boat on a grid search and use Accio XD
