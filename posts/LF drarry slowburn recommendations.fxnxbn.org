if anybody has any good drarry slowburns to recommend, i'd love to hear about them. good storytelling abilities are a must, and they have to be in character, but other than that i'd like to see what you guys have to recommend me. if it's over 50k words that's a plus, and if it's over 100k words i'll love you forever.


** Very Draco Malfoy centric, time loop fic. 70k words. Post-war Malfoy family wants to redeem itself and Draco has to give a speech at an official Ministry event which is very important to their cause. Unfortunately he gets stuck in a time loop. It's a story about self discovery, and Draco questioning if his life really has to be the way it is planned out for him. Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082]])

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
