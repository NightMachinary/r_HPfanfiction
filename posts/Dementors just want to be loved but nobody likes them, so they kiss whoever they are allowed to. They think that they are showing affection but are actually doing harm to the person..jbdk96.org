*** Yeah cool right? I mean I really love the word 'perspective' üòÅ. Dementors feeling sad and trying to kiss (show affection in their own way) will make them sexual harassers but when someone's dogs or cats peek on them while bathing, no one caresüòÖ. Dementors are not humans, just because they resemble one a little doesn't mean they are though.

I know I'm simplifying my words a lot here but truly it's all about perspective. Pets often kiss their owners, slobber them with their saliva sometimes. Of course the feeling is mutual but when they come sleep on your chest while you are asleep, it's not called groping ü§î. In fact, it's encouraged.

The common point in pets and Dementors that I can see is that they are showing their affection here and none of it is making them sexually aroused. It's like some people shake hands on greeting, some kiss but both in sense of greeting and nothing sexually offensive. Do I make any sense? üòÅ

**** super weird take. It still makes me feel sick and uncomfortable. I hate it when someone else's pet pees on me or tries to kick my mouth. It's still uncomfortable and in my personal space.

** Or maybe they are so sad that they just want to share the happy memories of others to cheer both of them but unfortunately they start leeching the happy memories and in turn leave behind despair for the other guy. Sadly they are socially and emotionally disfunctional and don't understand that only they are getting the happy part and their friend is going into despair.
