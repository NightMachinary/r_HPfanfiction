I just dropped a fic in which Harry was possesed by a literal God, isn't even attending hogwarts and /still/ ended up tied to a gravestone.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Maybe it's written into the whole Goblet-Of-Fire Binding Magical Contract thing that nobody seems able to explain the physics or logic of yet is completely and absolutely binding if you don't want to be a squib. Wand Weighing, First Task, Yule Ball, Second Task, Third Task, Kidnapping.

*** (Harry Portkeys back to Hogwarts, into the middle of the party)

HARRY: Guys I just got kidnapped by Voldemort and Cedric was murdered and oh god I might throw up-

HERMIONE: Harry, getting kidnapped is such a traditional part of the Tournament, stop being such a spoil-sport.

HARRY: WHAT? Why didn't you /tell/ me that?

HERMIONE: It's Tournament Tradition not to.

HARRY: But Voldemort is /back/ now!

HERMIONE: Oh my god, Harry, nobody cares. You won. Stop whining.

*** I read one once where Harry decided to not bother with the tournament despite it being magically binding.

Turns out Fake Moody was the one who was magically bound. He had his magic taken away since he was the one who engineered it.

Makes sense that the Goblet would have anti-cheating built into it. Otherwise they could use it to mandate anyone to show up at a place of their choosing.

**** You'd be surprised how much that exact trope is used.

Harry vanishes off he face of the earth and then The Dark/Light/Both put his name into the Goblet of Fire and he gets summoned there from the 8th moon of Saturn/America or wherever he is.

** There's a Star Wars crossover by Darth Marrs where the goblet binds Harry to the tournament from across the fuckin galaxy. It's a really good fic otherwise but just seemed kind of forced. I believe it's called The Katarn Side. Kind of curb-stompy if you're into that.
