Okay, I realize there aren't many fanfiction like this, but I really can't imagine Tom didn't offer anything other than murdering Muggles and destroying Muggleborns. Seriously, he grew up a Muggle, must have realized that the Wizarding World had stopped in evolution in the Middle Ages.

I need a fanfiction in which he offers something more and wizards follow him by choice, because they think that he can actually bring something to this world. Perhaps better economic conditions, primary schools for wizards, guaranteeing the safety e.t.c.

Besides, I would like that in such a fic Harry, after his unhappy lonely childhood (I do not mean being abused by the Dursleys, there is definitely too much of this) he does not like people and prefers the company of animals, only later he makes friends with someone who is worth trusting. And Dumbledore, who realizes his mistake, wants to fix it and tries to help Harry. She trains him to eventually defeat Voldemort and to have more control over his magic. Here Dumbledore will not be at all like this Evil! Dumbledore with so many fanfics, only a bit manipulative, but still good.

Does anyone see something like this?
