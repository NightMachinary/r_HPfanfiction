Daphne isn't an ice-queen in the same way she normally is. She's actually pretty sweet, but she has a lot of trouble expressing herself, reading social cues and understanding other people. That earns her the reputation of "ice queen", which she doesn't like.

I find her depiction in this one-shot very close to some cases of autism - and I say that as someone who's on the autism spectrum themselves.

**** People get around of loads of characterisation by just saying ‘Daphne is considered the ice queen of Slytherin' or something of that nature. It just feels... sloppy? One dimensional?

As soon as I see the phrase in a fic, I'm betting that 2 pages later they'll be bashing Ron for his eating or Dumbledore for being manipulative and stealing Harry's money/ ‘blocking his magic'. It's just

***** In most of the fics I see the term in, it's not like that. In fact, if she's important enough in the story to have the nickname used, she usually gets a lot of characterization that either explains it or expands on it - it's a summary but not a shortcut.

It probably helps that I filter out as many bashing-tropes as I possibly can, so I don't actually see the connection between the "Ice Queen Daphne" nickname and "OMG Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Ron's a greedy pig, and Slytherin is probably good".

****** The correlation is more that a lot of aristocratic/Lord Potter stories are badly written and bash Dumbledore/Ron, and they have an overlap with the stories that have him getting together with a pureblood Daphne/why there's a 'good' faction of purebloods.

It makes it so that there are a lot of fics that have him getting together with Daphne while bashing the other characters - but there's a lot of fics that don't have Daphne in it that also have that bashing, so it's not at all restricted. I could see how someone exposed only to fics where they're put together could think of them as connected.

****** I get what you're saying. I will also mention though that I struggle to see anyone ever calling someone that as a nick name. This is coming from someone who went to British-South African boarding school, an international school, and two American high schools.

I could readily see a lot more negative ones (ie stuck up bitch, bitchy, offish, awkos, bint, arrogant something, a ‘Princess' (as in sensitive or stuck up) ect ect. Or perhaps a few less harsh ones around her being timid/shy/too cool. Ice queen though? Eh. Just breaks immersion for me. Which is probably why I categorise it with a lot of bashing fics, super tropes, ect.

***** At this point, it's a pretty common fanon nickname - and its usage doesn't force bashing Ron or manipulative Dumbledore.

The advantage it has is that it explains why Daphne is not really mentioned along with anyone ('Ice Princess' = standoffish), and because there's an appeal to having someone with a harsh first glance/attitude, but defrosting over the course of a story/with a heart of gold/whatever other cliche term we might want to use. It helps to put her in her own category within Slytherin, without having to go along with the overt racism of the prominent members of the house that we see in canon - while still being important.

It's also a characteristic that we don't really have in Hogwarts, so now that it's become somewhat fanon for Daphne, it's the logical choice for someone who wants to have a character with that outlook.

***** I should have clarified... I would prefer canon compliant characters... but since Daphne is in essence an OC, often associated with the description of 'ice queen', I would prefer to see something different. As a matter of fact I wouldn't mind even a self-insert that instead of being a heart breaking ice queen, is a nice sweet but, overall, normal girl with her flaws and insecurities.
