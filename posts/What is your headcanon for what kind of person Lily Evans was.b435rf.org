Beyond her being James Potter's wife, Harry Potter's mother, or even Severus Snape's friend/crush; we know tragically little about her from canon. So what do you guys fill the blanks with?


** Please keep mind most of what is know is told to Harry directly by people who like him. None of those people are gonna shit talk an orphan about his dead mum. There is a high chance of little white lies about people who died 10 years prior.

** Warm, charming, curious, no bullshit and a bit cheeky---what others have said.

Her flaws are harder to work out from what we know. I think canon supports that she was judgmental (though not without reason) and vengeful (she remembered how Sirius acted towards Snape on the train, and when he made room for her on the Gryffindor bench, she snubbed him).

You could probably extrapolate that she could be manipulative if it got her ahead, depending on how you read her relationship to Slughorn and her feelings towards him as a person. A bad judge of character in that she gave Severus apparently some leeway once he started hanging with the junior Death Eaters and dropping slurs. Her face also twitches, like she's about to laugh, in Snape's memory. It's not much but it's there. She's not saintly. She may even have been vain and enjoyed the attention James Potter gave her.

The one flaw I hate to see is that of a shrill, nagging woman with no sense of fun. As a partner to James, that would seem to make no sense. He seems to have been popular enough that he hardly needed to pine for someone who was such a poor fit, too.

** We get some insight into Lily from other places too. She had the confidence to clap back when Slughorn teased her, the wit to make it funny, and the charm to make this a fond memory for him. Ollivander said her wand was good for charms. Her letter to Sirius after Harry's first birthday mentioned that, despite whatever friction existed between them, there was still enough affection for them to exchange gifts. And in Snape's memories, we see she is self-possessed, has a sense of justice, and is loyal to others so long as they are worthy of it.

I don't know if I have a head canon for Lily, really. There is enough in the text to give you sense that she was admirable but not perfect.

*** Or in other words, Lily's known personality is far closer to Hermione than to Ginny, although with more humor.

Another major head canon I have about Lily is that she, perhaps under Dumbledore's guidance, created a sacrificial ritual based on blood magic that ultimately blew up Voldemort's body. I refused to believe that her scenario had never happened before. For example, a jealous or crazed wizard might think that the child was not his, so decided to kill the baby while offering his wife another chance. Lily had to have done something that was unique, and performing a complex sacrificial ritual would reinforce her reputation as a powerful and intelligent witch. JKR acolytes can tow her official line all they want, but I find her constant promotion of “unarmed sacrifices” very off putting.

I imagine her to be a little spoiled...

"The problem though with having been doted upon by the family (and friends and admirers) was that Lily thought the world revolved around her. She was ignorant and intolerant of her sister's grievances. Never having experienced neglect from her parents, she couldn't believe Petunia's complaints and instead thought that her sister was simply jealous of her abilities, which was also true; Petunia did wish that she was a witch and wondered what her life would have been if she were one. By the time Lily had grown out of that mindset, too many things had cropped up to make healing the rift with Petunia a priority. Mr. and Mrs. Evans deaths occurred, Lily got involved in her magic world's war and new people came into the sisters' lives. Then Lily died and of course, by then, it was already too late to say sorry."

** I've always imagined her to be very empathetic, sharp-witted, and able to joke around. She was empathetic enough to end up seeing James differently after hating him so long and to befriend Snape despite most chidlren being judgementy little assholes. She was sharp-witted enough to be very good at potions and debate/argue with Snape when he was falling to the dark side and the Marauders when they were being assholes. And though she was probably a bit of a stick in the mud early on, but I imagine when she was older she became more chill. Not irresponsible and pranking people all the time, but able to laugh at herself and stupid situations that mildly annoyed her. She isn't athletic. I think her weaknesses would be her overthinking things and her tendancy to be argumentative and probably her caring about what people around her think. I know that last one is a little weird, but I like to imagine she and Petunia have that in common, but she's more paranoid people won't love her or accept her from Petunia being a bitch and her facing muggle-born discrimination. She wouldn't be mean about it like Petunia, she would be more self-hating. Even if she can overcome it to do what needs to be done, it wouldn't stop her from maybe worrying a lot about how she acts and looks in a room full of pureblood wizards. And I think James's outlandishness would make it a bit worse.

We also know she was somewhat of a firecracker and Snape was her best friend for years. She was intelligent, likely with a sharp tongue, and a hidden sense of humour... she did eventually fall for James Potter, after all. None of us are without our flaws, but I imagine Lily Potter l worked hard to make up for hers. Finally, she sacrificed herself for her son. Not all mothers would do the same.

She also thwarted Voldemort thrice, presumably without any of the ridiculous Deux Ex machina Harry had. I'd say she was very, very powerful.

******** I agree very much with this. James charging when he was wandless earned him back a lot of the points he'd lost in book five for me. It's courageous to fight even when it seems inevitable to lose. I really respected his character for that and it's one of the saddest parts of the series to me.

Wasn't that exactly what the Order were doing as an organization, anyway?

Building up Snape's "redemption" based on his love for Lily and making James seem like a tool in that, and then nerfing or never backing up all of the talk of him reforming/maturing/etc. was total character assassination, though. I feel like Rowling had an idea for the Marauders in mind, /told/ us what those traits were, and then /showed/ differently and there was often a disconnect.

She probably stayed after her friends to study, but also made sure to take breaks to have fun and relax. She didn't really have to be overbearing to the Marauders because Remus was there to help her out.

*** You joke, but there's been a trend on Tumblr and fan art in the last couple of years to portray James as Indian.

This [[http://www.mugglenet.com/2017/10/mind-harry-potter-indian/]["In my mind, Harry Potter is Indian"]] essay sums up a few points in how they got to the conclusion that Harry is biracial Indian, and James is full Indian. [[https://desiharrypotterblog.tumblr.com/][This Tumblr]] page has a lot of fanart and Indian Harry content.

- Black hair. Indian people have black hair, and the books never said James /was/ white Anglo-Saxon British.

- [[http://harry-potter-headcanon.tumblr.com/post/126179755754/can-you-explain-why-many-people-think-harry-potter][On the night he died, James was making pretty-colored lights for Harry.]] That was October 31st. In 1981, Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, started on October 27th. It lasts five days.

- Harry identifies as a halfblood, faced adversity and injustice due to his heritage.

- Treated as abnormal by his whitebread, xenophobic Dursley relatives, and never accepted as one of their family. Vernon and Petunia believed that there was something wrong with James Potter:.. it's obviously his skin color.

- Government authorities attempted to silence and control him, and treated him with contempt. Obvious British Raj, colonial-era symbolism.

****** Think what? Is it plausible? Not a chance. If he had Indian heritage Padma and Parvati would have brought it up in the story (most probably during the yule ball) which they don't.

Another note Harry would never have green eyes or the chances of that would be quite slim as most Indians have brown, black eyes and those colours are pretty dominant.

As for Diwali that's a stretch. Where I live we only start burning firecrackers one day before the day of festival not weeks.

I also read the Tumblr blog, it's just trying to connect themes which they think they are seeing but in reality don't exist.

Basically they think being an Indian is exotic and somehow special. Everyone was against Harry because racism or something. If that was the case then why didn't it happen to padma and parvati too? No I would say the points are pretty weak, everything they base is on skin color. There are white Indians too, go to the northern side of the country Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal and you'll see Indians who are as white as Europeans or come pretty close to it, go to the east side like अरुणाचल and you'll see Indians who are indistinguishable from Chinese people.

Indians having brown skin is a stereotype and anyone who thinks that is racist j/k. Tell the tumblr blogger that lol

Anyways they say that the Potter surname could be an anglicized version of an Asian name like Potdar. That's some pretty impressive mental gymnastics right there.

Do you know that Indian Christians have surnames like Rodriguez, Alfonso, Dias, Henriques etc? If they had said that James Potter's family was originally from Goa who converted to Christianity and after the Portuguese and British Raj left they too left for UK to settle there I might have found it plausible and have patted them on the back for a nice back story.

But nooo Harry Potter is Indian because having dark complexion is in fashion.

I don't mind Harry having different phenotype but there should be a proper reasoning behind it, not just your fetish (unless it is smut rawrrr)

So tl;dr I like the idea but not the reasoning.

** I see adult Lily as someone like Amelia Pond from Doctor Who, just a lot less...Scottish.

As for child and teen Lily; I imagine that her magic started a bit early, around about five, and was mostly small things. Pulling things to her, fixing things she accidentally broke, stuff like that.

Her parents gave her a little more attention than Petunia just by trying to figure out what the hell was going on, which planted the small seed of resentment.

(Petunia would sometimes call her a freak or weirdo whenever they fought as young siblings do).

As Lily grew, her parents cottoned on to the fact that weird things mostly happened when she was upset and so taught her such things as anger management tactics.

Lily probably knew Snape's home-life wasn't the best, in that way kids know when other kids' parents are super mean or angry, and he was often invited to the Evans' house.

When Snape told Lily that she was a witch, Lily didn't quite believe that but she didn't not believe either. It was as good an explanation as anything else, even if it was out there.

The day McGonagall showed up to give Lily her letter was just like any other day but but it also signaled the festering resentment that Petunia had would grow, especially since she didn't get a letter.

(Of course /Lily/ got a letter, of course /Lily/ had magic; /Lily/ was special. Just like everything else. People would stop the family on the streets to coo over /Lily's/ red hair and /Lily's/ green eyes and Petunia was plain and ordinary, nobody gave Petunia a second glance when /Lily/ was around.)

The Evans parents were overjoyed, not that they had a witch in the family like Petunia thought but that they finally knew what Lily was doing and that Lily could learn to control her Gift.

Petunia's resentment grew as they went to Diagon Alley.

Lily first met James Potter not on the train like everyone assumes, but the first day of school proper; oh sure, she had seen him and his friends but they hadn't spoken to each other. She thought he was rather nice until he started picking on Snape (years later she would realize that Snape always gave back as good as he got and would sometimes pick a fight or something trying to get Potter in trouble) and playing pranks. She also kinda realized Remus was sick but didn't know how.

As the years went on, Lily did develop a sort of not really crush on Potter, he was cute, but it was the type of crush that didn't make sense because he was an arsehole. She also realized that Snape had a crush on her and tried to let him down gently.

Lily knew Snape was falling in with a bad crowd, they had several fights over his new pals and their...'fun', but it really was the Mudblood Incident that caused her to realize she couldn't save Snape and that she was in danger now. She still didn't swoon into Potter's arms, he did have to grow up.

Potter finally got his shit together and she gave him a chance; one date became two became three, until she realized she did love James. It wasn't a big dramatic epiphany, more like 'oh, that makes sense' and 'when did that happen?'

She found out Remus was a werewolf by accident (and nearly tore Sirius several new aresholes when she found out about /that/ stunt).

Harry was an accident too.

** I've formed a mostly negative opinion of Lily Evans/Potter over the years, based on what I've read about her and the little I've found out about J. Rowling, who created her.

​

Most of what we have directly on her is from Snape's memories, and the girl featured there I find to be deeply unpleasant. Young Severus is a bit of a creepy little shit, yes, but Lily treats him as a lackey to (verbally) kick around, not as a friend of eventually some 7+ years.

​

[[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm][Apparently]], [search for 'disdainful' in the article] Rowling went to a secondary school where this sort of behaviour was the norm - from girls toward boys - and the real person Snape was based off of, the chemistry master there, was at the time an overworked insomniac, and believed that women were superior to men in every regard.

This might just be an idiosyncrasy of mine, but I think close friends should treat each other with a mix of deep respect and (especially if they're British) a healthy dose of piss-taking. Off the top of my head, the kindest I remember Lily being to Snape was when she asked him how things were at his home.

​

Not helping her case with me is when she almost laughs at Snape while he's being dangled by the ankle, especially since Rowling herself indicated that she might've been subconsciously flirting with James during that scene.

James, the rich, dominant, athletic, powerful bully, who would go on to pretend to clean up his act while keeping up a hex war with Snape behind her back in Year 7, when he had the Map (until Filch somehow got it), knowledge of the castle unparalleled except by his mates and possibly Dumbledore, and the True Invisibility Cloak on hand as invaluable tools for controlling when and if confrontations with Snape happened.

You can tear into me all you want for bringing this up, but: /hypergamy/. Whatever any of you think about it, for me it's one of those things like racism and bullying: the more of it I see in someone, the less I will respect them. And the more personally powerful a woman is (Lily was a highly-regarded student of */magic,/* and right after the almost smiling incident, her whipping out her wand was enough to make both James and Sirius wary and even, by my reading, reluctantly compliant) the more my respect will lessen when (I think) she's being hypergamous.

** Lily Evans was a flawed but also good hearted woman. I don't think she was anything like Hermione or Ginny.

- *Gold daughter* She was the prettiest and most talented daughter, for sure she was her parents gold child while Petunia was weird looking, a bit clumsy and somewhat neglected. She was the beauty of the family and quite charming. I'd say she was a bit spoiled but not snotty or a brat.

- *Girly girl, a bit frivolous* Loved make up, fashion, wore frilly or elegant dresses, daydreamed of prince charming and had she lived a normal life, would love elegant social events. She was very graceful and given a chance she would be high maintenance because she had expensive tastes and loved to live comfortably. Her hair was always done and her outfits milimetrically in place because she cared for her appearance - but she wasn't judgemental of others outfits or appearance overall and would love to help others in dressing up and similar stuff. She just wanted to look pretty herself.

- *Sharp tongued* Lily was also sharp tongued and when she entered Hogwarts she was a bit baffled seeing all the prejudice towards people like her, so she decided to study hard to be respected and make a point to herself, that said she wasn't "au courant" like Hermione, she had good social skills and enjoyed a good time with her friends and was the leader of her "girls" group. She made a point of make everything appear effortless so it seems she rarely studied and was naturally gifted.

- *Hypocrite* She was also a bit hypocrite and turned a blind eye to the flaws of people she loved of whose she was protective, resulting on her seeing everything in a black and white perspective. She was a judgmental and but she liked to always be right a didn't accept criticism about herself, her friends and family easily. She was easily offended in those situations and was very argumentative. It made her a bit narrow minded.

- *loyal to a fault* That said, Lily was sacrificing and loyal to a fault. She would defend her friends and loved ones until they do something terrible TO HER, like Snape calling her slurs or Petunia being mean with her and James. If they didn't do it, she would still keep turning a blind eye. This temperament made her really fit to the Phoenix order because she has the protecting demeaning naturally.

- *Played hard to get* Lily Evans was attracted to James Potter and was really flattered by him pursuing her, but she played hard to get because it made her popular toward girls who fancied him, not to mention that James also liked the chase. She was really flatted that the popular sportist guy from a traditional rich family was so head over heels over her.

- Lily Evans was initially a reluctant to fight because she was a bit allieneted to political issues and the conjuncture of the wizard World. She still dreamed of an ideal world. She used to think that her being muggleborn was not that important and tried to close her eyes to some issues, seeing Slytherin as simply stupid delinquent troublemakers, but after she broke her friendship with Snape and started to hang with James, after a lot of argumentations she understood the situation well and was convinced by his militant ideals and joined the Phoenix Order.

- *Princessy and high maintenance* I believe she was the "princess" of Phoenix order. Pretty young lady, loved to do girly things and would bring trivial decorations to emblish the place like flowers, perfumes and other cute things. People like Sirius were friendly to her and found this really funny if a bit silly, but some others would roll their eyes to Lily. She also did traditional womenly stuff in the order like cooking, etc..

  Also I believe the house she lived with James was very tasteful and when they couldn't leave they still had the best of everything and a very comfortable life especially because of Lily liked to live comfy and had hm... Expensive tastes.

- *Teen pregnancy*. She always wanted to be a mother but Harry was not planned. She was relieved that James was the father and his proposal after receiving the news made her really happy. Also she was happy that she was pregnant at the time her older sister was as well cause they would have a lot of things to share.

  - *Brave* She was really brave though. No matter what, she would always stand for what she believes and would die for who she loves, no matter if she were right or wrong. Changing her mind takes a lot. It constrats to her girly demeanor as some people in the order were exceptical of her.

- *Spoiling mother* I believe if she was still alive Harry would be spoiled by Lily and James a lot, he would be like a good hearted version of Dudley.

** How I imagine Lily Evans personality:

Cheerful, demure, sweet, a bit childish emotionally but very compassionate. She's helpful, charismatic and makes an effort gets along with pretty much everyone mostly because she wants to be liked and being popular validates her, she can be a bit attention seeker and cares too much for appareances.

She is hard-working and always does her best to get good grades.  She's also really into elegant things like flower arranging, dancing and decoration, and is impressioned by idols, fame and popularity.

I also don't believe she was so argumentative in a daily life. She would always put others opinions in front, try to conform with the set she is, trying to keep peace, her breaking with Snape and discussing with James was the last resort. If she was pissed she would give the silent treatment.

I don't think she was highly involved in battling Voldemort until she dated James. I believe she suffered from high anxiety during her pregnancy and the war, because things weren't going as she planned, but Lily stayed mostly silent about it cause she always wanted to look put together and be a support to others, few people other than James realized she was depressed.

With James he was her husband and father of her son, and fighting against Voldemort maintened them together so his bullying tendencies and him being a bit narcissist was trivial compared to all horrible things that were happening around them like death of their friends, and their own lives in risk.

My view on magic and morality is much more utilitarian than the simplistic black-and-white many try to shoehorn the world into. As far as I'm concerned, magic is no different than any other tool, and nobody considers a frying pan evil.

Don't get me wrong, I don't sympathize with Snape at all; I think he's a terrible shitty person. I just happen to think James, Sirius, Remus and Lily are too, as are all the Hogwarts professors, most of the Ministry, and pretty much the entirety of magical society.

*** Maybe she was a start fucker, makes sense on character, but I also believe she was right on being pissed with Snape. He was a terrorist racist come on.
