  "You can speak Parseltongue, Harry," said Dumbledore calmly, "because Lord Voldemort - who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin - can speak Parseltongue."
#+end_quote

From one of the older copies of Chamber of Secrets. And Ron also says something about people thinking Harry might be Slytherin's Ancestor. It's corrected to descendant in post-2000 prints, though.

Harry gets accused of being the Ancestor of Salazar Slytherin. Even funnier when Muggleborn that should know how genealogy works accuse him of it (Like Justin). Harry convinces everyone that he traveled back in time using a Delorean with a Flux Capacitor that the Muggles built, and became Slytherin's Ancestor, so he's 1000 going on 12. A Portrait of Slytherin, instead of being the god tier mentor that it usually is, is a massive troll and decides to play along with this and starts referring to Harry as Father or Grandfather, appearing during a Great Hall feast.

It all goes massively out of hand and causes Chaos, naturally. Harry gets away with it in the end. The biggest threat to Harry isn't the Basilisk this year, it's trying not to die laughing because of the stupidity of it all.

*** The older print books mix up the two words. The pre edit versions are worth quite a bit of money, if i recall. Somewhere before October 2000, the COS books said Ancestor instead of Descendant. The prompt is a joke based on the misprint in the older copies.

***** Quick check on ebay, seems like $30 for a hardcover copy.

The real value (3-4 figures) is if you have genuine first editions, meaning the first batch printed in the UK. I have copies of Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets with typos, but they are Canadian, so significantly less valuable. The typos themselves aren't actually important.

** That puts me in mind of the throwaway line in "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," in which it's mentioned that Zaphod Beeblebrox is the son of Zaphod Beeblebrox II, who in turn is the son of Zaphod Beeblebrox III due to an accident involving a time machine and a condom.

I'm unaware of any stories with OP's premise, but in this [[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/ASIAF/ASIAF.html][story]], in which Harry wins early (5th year, I think) and adopts a couple of war orphans, Harry uses that joke to explain to Dumbledore where the girls came from:

#+begin_quote
  "They're from the future," some stray whim prompted Harry to 'explain', just to see how much further he could push the usually infuriatingly all-knowing headmaster. "Something about an accident with a Time-Turner that they're not allowed to discuss for fear of causing a paradox. We've spent half the morning at the Ministry going over what can and can't be done about it with the Unspeakables."
#+end_quote

Also, in linkffn(The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter), he has a daughter who actually did come back from the future.
