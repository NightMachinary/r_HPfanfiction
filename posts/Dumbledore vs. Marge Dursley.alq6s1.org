Anyone got a fic where Dumbledore and Marge go toe to toe? Marge seems like the sort that'd even get to him.

** Dumbledore fights with words above all else. He would simply enjoy her getting angry at him being incredibly polite. Maybe a stunning spell if she starts using violence.

*** She's a Muggle not in on magic, he'd probably just obliviate her.
