I know its as canon and vanilla as it can get but I've always been enamored with their love story. I've read a ton of stories on them, and I was hoping for any more suggestions on really good fics. I don't have any other requirements besides quality writing. Thanks for your help!


** Can you let us know some of the ones you've already read, so we know what not to recommend?

** Ok, I agree with you on the pairing they are my favorites as well, but for what kind of story do you look?

Should the story be complete or are you reading in process things as well? When should it start and do you enjoy something that starts before the 6th year or not?
