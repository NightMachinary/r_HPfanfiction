** Here's one I've enjoyed quite a bit. linkffn(11191235) Prince of Slytherin is ongoing and updates fairly consistently. Solid plot, enough things different or branching off of canon to keep my interest, great character, and a fair amount of well-done foreshadowing. I think the one major issue with it is that second year drags on a bit, but surprisingly, the pace is otherwise pretty decent for a massive fic.

** Ignoring the cringe summary, there is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12021325/1/Antithesis][Antithesis by OceanBreeze7]] which has come along as a rather promising fic. The first 100k words are bit rough but the past 15 chapters or so have been on point. This is a Harry who does bad things but sees the consequences of his actions and his conscience bothers him. This along with DPSW are the two best WBWL out there in my opinion.

** Well for NBWL:

By the Divining Light and Conlaodh's Song has Harry as a prodigy training with Dumbledore to deal in Old Magic

The Art of Self-Fashioning is one of the best emotionally stunted Harry fics, and takes the specializing in one skill thing to new heights.

C'est la vie by cwycross is an example of what entertaining writing can do with a bunch of overused concepts.
