I'm looking for stories where Harry goes to another world/universe ect and meets the characters from said world and his powers (be magic or more) give him enough of a impact to make him have an effect on the world or story.


** Check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] for a very well done HP/Avengers crossover. It fits your preferences exactly. It's a WIP (always frustrating, I know) but there's already plenty to read. It's just about the only crossover I've ever read that I think of as worth recommending.

Also, I haven't gotten around to reading it yet but people seem to love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Brown Coat, Green Eyes]] by Nonjon, of A Black Comedy internet fame. This one is HP/Firefly.

Edit: While I'm in this thread, has anyone ever seen a good Harry Potter/Worm crossover? I just thought of this possibility, and it sounds bad ass.

Edit 2: I just finished reading BC,GE and it was definitely awesome. Consider it highly recommended by this humble fanfic fan.

*** +1 on BCGE. I resisted nonjon for so long. Started reading it several times but just didn't jive with me til I forced myself to continue one day and it all CLICKED. What an amazing, detailed story, just beautiful and so well thought out.

I still can't read A Black Comedy though I'M SO SORRY I JUST CAN'T

** Some Harry Potter/Star Wars WIPs that fit your criteria are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc side of the Force]]. Summary: I have a singularly impressive talent for messing up the plans of very powerful people - both good and evil. Somehow, I'm always just in the right place at exactly the wrong time. What can I say? It's a gift. A HP/SW xover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]. Summary: Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard][Revenge of the Wizard]]. Summary: A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the raping of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

** Apart from those already mentioned, [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2666277/1/Something-Grim-This-Way-Comes][Something Grim This Way Comes]] by Ruskbyte is very good. Crossover with The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is about to start his first year at Hogwarts. With him comes his cynical, somewhat unofficial (not to mention bent on world domination) girlfriend; Mandy. And they're also bringing their mutual best friend (i.e.: indentured servant) the Grim Reaper himself.

A starwars/hp crossover that's set post DH. It is a WiP but unlike [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] the author delivers steady updates.

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter decided to travel the world. Twelve years later when a new threat attempts to destroy the progress made in Britain he returns home to deal with the situation. During the fight that puts down the small group of upstarts Harry finds himself in a world of ice and fire

*** I love both of these. Darth Marrs is an incredible author, his stories are some of my favorites, but Revenge of the Wizard looks to me like it's going to be his best yet.

The Difference One Man Can Make is great, too, but I'm anxious for the action to start. 90k words in at 7 chapters, and it's only just starting to blossom into the main plot.

Don't get me wrong, those 90k words are captivating. But it's still mostly exposition.

** A great crossover that never comes up in these threads is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8616362/1/Harry-Potter-The-Last-Avatar][Harry Potter: The Last Avatar]].

It's a full world fusion, not merely a character or two hopping worlds. Basically you have Harry Potter characters and the idea of Hogwarts in the world of Avatar (TLA and Korra, not blue people), with the Avatar magic system.

You don't have to have seen any Avatar to follow, as everything is explained, though having seen Avatar certainly enhances the experience. (Also, Avatar is great so I recommend watching it anyway)

** I really liked Harry Potter: Geth (Mass Effect 1-3 crossover, no need to have played the games). Harry gets a bit super, but it is nicely balanced with other characters being quite advanced (It is a video game crossover, after all) and Harry does NOT always win. But still, there are many conflicts and overarching things but in never stays with one problem for too long (again, video game crossover...) linkffn(Harry Potter: Geth by mjimeyg)

** I actually really liked this fic:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] by Ulstem. It's a crossover with Mass Effect.

#+begin_quote
  The battle at the Department of Mysteries went differently for Harry. Trapped in a new time and being the last wizard alive, Harry must find a way home while evading enemies far darker than he has ever faced before.- Pre-ME1 to Pre-ME2.
#+end_quote

It was a pretty good story in my opinion and quite different to anything else I'd ever read.

I'd also recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] as being a pretty good crossover with the avengers-verse.

#+begin_quote
  The world is breaking; war and technology are pushing on the edge of the unbelievable, and S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately attempts to keep the peace. The soldier and the scientist are not the only lights that push back against the darkness, however; magic will encompass the world again as the last wizard makes himself known.

** An A-MAZ-ING crossover between HP and Sherlock is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1134255/chapters/2292768][Whispers in Corners]] by esama. It also fits your "goes to another world" desire perfectly.

This author has another, shorter Sherlock/HP crossover as well, [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1113600][Magnificent]], which is equally awesome.

*** Eh... While the premises were good, I felt like the Mycroft/Harry relationship really detracted from the stories as a whole. It was incredibly frustrating reading Whispers in Corners especially since it was such a fresh concept and very well written but the characters are way OCC just to force the relationship to work. If you're not a fan of slash then I would avoid it.
