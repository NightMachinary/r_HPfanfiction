What I need is a rough timeline about Sirius's break-ins into Hogwarts and the Gryffindor Tower in PoA for one of my fics. Like, when exactly did he slash the Fat Lady's portrait? When did he get /in/ the tower? I think he even woke Ron by accident one time, who screamed and everything (might be remembering that wrong -- the lines between original and fanfiction are blurry)?

Thanks in advance! ðŸ¥°


** Sirius attacks the Fat Lady on Halloween for sure, but you can find a pretty accurate outline [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/calendars-harry-potter-novels/day-day-calendar-prisoner-azkaban/][here]]

Were they sleeping in the tower then or not?

**** They were in the tower. Ron wakes up screaming that he saw Sirius Black with a knife.

**** In the Great Hall makeshift beds.\\
Edit: My mistake, they were sleeping in the Great Hall *after* this incident.

*** Yeah, Halloween is something I had in mind as well, but I'm pretty sure there were two instances when he broke in.

** He attacks the Fat Lady's portrait on the Halloween night.

He rips Ron's bed curtains after the Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw game.
