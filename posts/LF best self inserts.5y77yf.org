I know most of them are cringey and just plain bad, but what's the best story about a character who knows the books trapped in that world?


** I read an absolutely hilarious 1st chapter a while back, of a SI who wakes up as Voldemort a few weeks post resurrection. I think one of his servants was talking about a plan to attack somewhere and the SI is quietly freaking out, trying to find a phone to call the police and report he's been kidnapped by terrorists. Can't remember the title, but I thought it was a great start.

I like this HP SI as Merope Gaunt's little sister. Talk about changes! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10115976/1/Butterfly-Effect]]

** ...I honestly can't remember the last time I saw a HP SI story.

Naruto? Happens occasionally. MLP? All the damn time. Bleach? Maybe a couple. Worm? Fun, but not too common.

But Harry Potter? I can't think of a single SI story. I'm going to poke around this thread for a bit...

Edit: I don't know why I got my hopes up.

*** Meh. It's okay the first time through. But I tried to reread it and the exaggeration of angst in Hermione and Harry's character, the SI's silly/unique abilities, and the general lack of plot until the end put me off. It's a decent read compared to the rest of the self insert genre, but In Bad Faith and Magical Me are far better.

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

Love both of these, the SI is a Malfoy which is an interesting change.

There's quite a few where the SI is Lockhart and only one that's good....Unfortunately I don't recall the titles.

There's also one on space battles where the SI is Sally Ann Perks that I don't remember being technically well written but is still amusing and worthwhile: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/]]

  This is an extremely girly self-insert, very likely a Mary-Sue type of story, where a lot of the characters aren't at all straight. I thought I'd let you know straight up so you can just pass it by it if that's likely to upset and/or offend you. Otherwise - welcome to the Malfoy family.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.
