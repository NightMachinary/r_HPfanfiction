** Nothing that's really like that. We have a plethora of dark or evil Harry, but an actually uncaring or empathiless Harry is pretty much unheard of. There are some fics that start like that, but all of them eventually drown in annoying tropes or get drawn out ad infinitum before they're eventually abandoned.

** Check this one out: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5778267/1/Beyond-the-Pale]]

It has emotionless, apolitical Harry. I haven't read it in years, but it's very good from what I remember, although unfinished and last updated in 2011

** Honestly, I think the one that best fits your title is Harry Potter and the Daft Morons - I'm not keen on the fic myself, but it's a grey!Harry who doesn't give a fuck and has little emotion.
