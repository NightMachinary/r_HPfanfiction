Looking for the particular story where Ginny is living with Harry in the muggle world with Ginny paying cheap rent for a great house.

Ginny does not know that it is Harry at the start and if i remember right Harry does not know that Ginny is magical.

Thanks for anyone who will help me.


** Sounds a bit like Easier To Be by hgfan1111, unfortunately I don't think it's online anymore. I think I have an epub of it somewhere, I'll have a look later when I'm home.

*** I agree that it sounds like 'Easier to Be', and there's a copy [[https://www.scribd.com/doc/194945821/Easier-to-Be-by-Hgfan1111][here]], but it's not posted by the original author.

** I know the fic you are talking about but can't recall the title. Perhaps it was an old hgfan1111 fic?
