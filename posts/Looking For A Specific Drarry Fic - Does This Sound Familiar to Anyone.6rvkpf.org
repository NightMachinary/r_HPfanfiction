** The only fic I can think of like this is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/327164/chapters/527529][Eclipse]] . It's one of my favorites!! I think there's a swimming scene but I don't remember the part about Draco being scared although it's possible I just forgot that. Some other highlights from this fic are fairy circles, a suuuper long camping trip and some cool foraged potion making. Linkao3(527529)
