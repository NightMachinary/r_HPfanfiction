** The Voldemort in Linkffn(A Stranger in an Unholy Land) is definitely scary, intelligent, powerful, and just all around awesome. Makes this story very memorable despite it's age.

*** Agreed. A lot of the elements of this fic have aged badly, like katana!Harry, but despite that the Voldemort is pretty awesome. I remember reading this before DH came out and it was the first time I had ever seen a version of Voldemort that was actually strategic and making meaningful steps towards control rather than just performing random attacks on non-strategic locations like Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade, which was the standard fanfic back then.

** It's already been mentioned, but since some people seem to have a problem with an author linking to their own fic, linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has a Voldemort who is a proper evil genius, powerful and manipulative.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** This sub seems to really snub [[http://hpmor.com/][Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]], but of all the fics I've read, it has hands down the best interpretation/portrayal of Voldemort. He fits your request perfectly (evil genius, feared for a reason). To tell you more would be spoiler-ish though.

*** As a part of LessWrong myself, I always found it funny how divisive HPMOR was - not because I can't comprehend why people don't like it, but because it's not actually all that important. Eliezer wrote HPMOR as a funny side project, and I wouldn't take anything in it to be immediately indicative of his beliefs given that he has already written the /Sequences/. So I'm amused that people took it so seriously.

By the time HPMOR was over, the population of LessWrong doubled and the rest of the fandom had developed a severe allergy to anything rationalist.

** In my AU story "Patron", he's cunning, calculating, making plans that do not rely on coincidences or mistakes of his enemies, and scarily powerful. For example, the whole "Harry is put into the Tournament against his will" is just a diversion, to keep Dumbledore too busy protecting Harry to detect and foil the actual resurrection plan. And if some of the sabotage acts (the tournament itself is rather safe in that story) actually succeed in killing Harry, then that's a bonus. He also doesn't trust Snape, too close to Dumbledore.

**** Yeah! OP specifically asked that there be no self-promotions or fics that have been recommended in other threads. Oh, wait, no, he or she didn't!

[[/u/Starfox5]]'s answers the OP's query, which is more than can be said for your post. If you don't like his fic, then say so, and give your reasons.

**** For what it's worth, I thoroughly enjoyed much of Patron (I am a horrible horrible reader who gets impatient, even with all the weekly updates so I moved on after chapter 19 or so to other things until it is completed though). In fact, I loved the portrayal of Voldemort there

**** Oh good, I'm not the only one. I've tried to read Patron so many times, but I've never made it past chapter 25. Every time I see it recc'd by Starfox, I try again. I don't know why it just doesn't hold my interest. I want to like it, and the writing's fairly good, and I liked the premise, but...there's something about it.
