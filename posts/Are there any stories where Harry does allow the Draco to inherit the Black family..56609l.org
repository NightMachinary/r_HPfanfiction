I have read hundreds of rebellious Harry fics, and thousands of others, but I don't think I have ever seen Harry rebel to the point where he refuses to be the heir to the Black family. Sure it would be stupid, but he is a teenager, and Sirius hated his family.

This of course means that it is a fic where those things are actually important. Harry would have to have a claim somehow, and all that jazz.

It just irks me that most rebellious Harry stories lack any proper stupid rebellion, also that he tends to join the very system that he is supposedly fighting. Hell, I would be ecstatic if he didn't accept the title because his morals refuse to let him accept being part of the corrupt system.

Edit) Just noticed my title mistake, I choose to accept it and from now on refer to him as such to keep the ruse alive.


** This story perhaps fits for the requirement. In this story, Harry gifted the Black title to Malfoy as a wedding present.

Warning: AU after Hogwarts battle, stuffs like Ron & Ginny bashing, writer being in love with Draco, grammatical errors etc. At best decent read.

*** For those stories where Ancient and Most Proud house of black has political connections and obligations. The question becomes, why would morally upright Harry accept an obligitory position in a corrupt system?

If the story is closer to Canon(In which honestly Harry should have received no money, as from what I can tell none of it was Sirius's) the Black family only had "A reasonable amount of gold" however much that is.

***** I don't think you get what OP is asking for. He wants one of the 'Most Nobel and Ancient' fics to subvert the trope. Instead of angsty teenage Harry rebelling against Dumbledore and becoming Lord Hadrian Potter Black Peverell the 3rd he says 'fuck it' and rebels against that system instead.

Or maybe I got it wrong.

***** I am not a Draco fan in the least bit, but a post about the Black family inheritance got me thinking about how I had never seen a single fanfiction where Harry just doesn't accept it. He doesn't like attention, he already is moderately well off to do, and as much as he dislikes Draco he isn't spiteful. Sure after Voldemort is back from the dead then Harry would fight it, he doesn't want to support Voldemort. But there are plenty of fanfics of younger Harry activity hunting down the Black family 'fortune' for no reason other then wish fulfillment.

Sure in the long run having political power can do more good, but he is a dumb teenager. Maybe he gives up his tenuous claim and regrets it later in life.

Also, I see tons of requests for Grey/Neutral Harry, but I don't think I have read a single one. I can definitely see a Neutral Harry just not accepting because he doesn't want to deal with the responsibilities. He wants to be left out of all of it, and making power grabs at power is a good way to convince everyone else you are up to something.

*** He could rebelliously transfer it to an infant Teddy. Not only is the new Lord Black a baby, but also the son of a werewolf!
