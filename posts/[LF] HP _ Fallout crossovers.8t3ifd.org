Not too sure how this would work. Following totally new wizard OCs? The few elderly survivors from Harry's generation? All I to know is, I want to read about some wizards whooping cazador arse. (Or the British equivalent of tarantula hawks, depending on what part of the world it's set in.)

You can just go the way most crossovers do it: Harry crosses the veil of death and he travels to FO's dimension, or Harry is MoD and he's reborn as a vault dweller.

Damn tho, only 18 works on ffnet? That's one underused crossover setting.

** Might also be fun to have Harry exploring the Fallout world, before realizing that wizards (or a particular one perhaps) started the war in the first place.

** Or you can move up the timeline of Fallout.

Given how militaristic and nationalistic that world was, it would be totally possible to have the great war happening well before 2077.

For a brief history of the Fallout world, check out this video: [[https://youtu.be/rW4-0BZ7kb0]]

  War... War never changes. In the year 2076, Europe is consumed in war. Muggle Britain stands mostly intact, but it will not remain so for long. Concurrently, Magical Britain denies the return of the most feared wizard in generations. In all of this, what is UK-13? And what does it have to do with Harry Potter?

  In one moment, the earth burned and they all required just one thing; survival. So the Room provided. Two-Hundred years later, six wizards and witches come back to reality and find a world destroyed. A letter, telling of the last surviving wizards, leads them to Salem where they must fight once again to survive. /Abandoned
