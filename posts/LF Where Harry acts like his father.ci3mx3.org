This is where Harry's parents are alive with no Voldemort and acted just like James did when he went to hogwarts. He chases after Hermione like James did to lily.

  AU. Harry, just another normal Hogwarts student with no evil whatsoever plaguing his life, really likes Hermione Granger, who won't even give him the time of day. How is he going to win her heart? By being a complete tosser, of course. Boys are idiots.
