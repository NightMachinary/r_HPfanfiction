I've been reading Hp-fanfiction for a while and I've found some very good self-inserts but I can't seem to find anymore. If anyone knows of a self-insert that takes place during the start of book 1-ish, is longer than 150,000 words, and is in general good, hit this post up.


** *Bracing myself for downvotes* Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality.

For some reason this sub really hates the fic, but in my humble opinion it's the only good SI I've ever read. Some people also recommend "Curse of Truth" sometimes, but I found it to be super boring and didn't get very far.

*** I like it on account of it being as if someone wrote an SI of me.

** A Curse of Truth is one of the few good ones. Some of the timetravel ones are basically SIs in everything but name. HPMOR is more AU than SI(though i can see how it seems like an SI with extreme OOC characters) , but clearly worth the time if you have it. If nothing else, it introduced me to Godel, Escher, Bach which was a load of fun.
