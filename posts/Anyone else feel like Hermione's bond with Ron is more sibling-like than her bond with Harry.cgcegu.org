The way they argue over every mundane thing doesn't feel very 'old married couple' to me. It feels more like how siblings always start fights over nothing. I know we're supposed to see Harry and Hermione having the brother-sister connection, but I see it more with Ron and Hermione tbh.


** To be honest, I get that reading for both Harry and Ron when Hermione speaks with them. Hermione as the older responsible but impulsive sister, Ron as the middle one who's overlooked and Harry as the youngest one who goes into extreme antics.

And that's what I always wished. No pairings at all in between these three people and then just continue onto adulthood as close confidants. But what romance we do get leaves a lot to be desired.

***** I feel like in all of these scenarios he doesn't go looking for trouble, rather because he feels like he has to, because no one actually tells him anything. For example, he went to Professor McGonagall about the stone, but she just dismissed his claims altogether. As far as he knew, Snape was going to get the stone and no one was going to do anything about it, so it had to be him.

It's easy to say what could or not have done, but with how little anyone clues Harry in about any of their plans, it's no wonder he feels like the only one qualified to tackle the problem. 'Fine, I guess. I'll do it myself.'

The entire plot boils down to "Kid makes multiple wrong assumptions, tells them to adult, is (rightfully) told that it's nonsense. Decides to ignore that, as he obviously knows better, and goes on to cause the very problem that he was warning against." Thank god for the Deus Ex Machina, else voldemort would have been back a few years early, and it would have been entirely 100% Harry's fault.

Later plots get a BIT better in not being entirely dependent on Harry doing something, more on things being done to him. In most of those however it swings the other way, were Harry is ridiculously passive and merely reacting to things. He does tend to make stupid decisions still though. I mean, 2nd year, all else aside, IIRC he already considered Gilderoy a fraud and a joke. So when he had the rather clever idea of go to a teacher.... WHY choose the one you know is not only useless but also incapable? McGonnagal, Flitwick, hell, fucking SNAPE would have been a better choice, at least he knows they are competent.

  "A what?" shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. "A what, exactly?"

But I guess it's weird in general trying to figure out Ron's feelings about Hermione and when exactly they started changing from friendship to romance. Ron's burgeoning romantic feelings toward Hermione just don't really come off as... romantic. Of course he's a 14 year old boy when this happens, but he never seems to grow past this type of immature insecurity, since his big fear, as revealed by the Horcrux Locket, was Hermione dumping him for Harry.

Which honestly just proves that he did not love her. I mean, they were in the middle of a civil war where Hermione was Most wanted Number 2, Muggleborns were deported to Azkaban, which was repurposed into a concentration camp, if they were lucky. Many met worse fates and, like Edward Tonks, were summarily executed by the countless death squads which searched the country. And his own family was under tight security as well.

But no, Ron's biggest fear is whether Harry banged Hermione and not if she was even alive, or the atrocities she or his family could suffer under the Death Eaters. Because I imagine the likes of Malfoy and his cronies taking turns with Hermione a significantly worse and more likely danger than her and Harry finding solace in each other.

****** In regards to Ron's feelings about Hermione, The locket was only exposed to Ron's thoughts and feelings when he was in the tent, with Harry and Hermione. He wasn't worried that Hermione was out there, dying. He was right there next to her. He knew she was alive and well and safe, so his worries about her weren't as strong as the worries were for his family, since he didn't know if any of them were dead or alive at the time.

Remember, the Locket is not a boggart or a dementor. It does not show you your worst fear or worst memories. The effect of the locket was that it fed off of negative thoughts and emotions that were already there, and amplifies the negativity and makes them worse.

So Hermione dying was certain one of Ron's worst fears, but when they were in that tent, he knew she was alive and well, and didn't think about her fate as much as he did about his family's fate, who he was worried sick for, and had no information on.

However, since Hermione was alive and well and in a position where she was in constantly close to Harry, his old insecurities popped back up, not only about Hermione, but also about his family, and how he always felt least loved and the least important among his siblings. It was small at first, but once the Horcrux saw that insecurity, it focused on that insecurity alongside its focus on the facts the he was starving and malnourished, his family could all be dead right now, Dumbledore didn't train Harry at all or tell him a good course of action just in case Dumbledore died, and now they were wandering aimlessly around in the woods with a Horcrux that is slowly eating away at all of them, bit by bit.

All of those things are what led to Ron losing his temper after months of being tortured by the Horcrux and fighting its influence, finally make him give in to all his worries and confront Harry. Of course, the Horcrux had constantly taken its toll on all of them, and was manipulating all of their thoughts, which meant that Harry's paranoia about his friends losing faith in him were true, because the Horcrux was manipulating them into losing faith in him.

As a result, when Ron confronted Harry, Harry wasn't exactly kind or patient or understanding either.

The Horcrux wanted this group broken up, so that they wouldn't destroy it, and putting them against each other was its best shot of preserving itself, but I digress.

Ron's constantt insecurity was that he wasn't good enough for Hermione as a partner, and that he wasn't good enough to be a friend for Harry, and that he wasn't good enough for anybody for anything. That was only amplified by the fact that he got splinched, and literally could not be of any help to Harry or Hermione at all.

That insecurity, along with everything else I mentioned, are the reasons why Ron spoke up and left, especially the fact that his family could be out there dying and he wouldn't know, because he's stuck in a tent on a godforsaken mission with no plan and no goal other than to eventually find some sort of clue towards destroying the one Horcrux they have, and finding the other Horcuxes to destroy as well.

  “Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met.

From the very first moment we meet Ron we see he feels unnoticed and lost in the crowd. That feeling stuck with him throughout the series.

He was also super worried about his own family.

That doesn't mean it really showed him the most disturbing thing. The Horcrux was sentient. It lies. Think about the horcrux's goal and you'd realize why it did what it did.

It wanted control. How could it possibly achieve that by showing Ron what danger his family was in? No, its first step was divide and conquer. It wanted to separate them three first. That way it won't be passed around among the three to divide the burden. So it exploited Ron's insecurity to achieve that.

******** Ron, for all his flaws, is fiercely protective of those he cares for. When Malfoy insulted Hermione, Ron tried to curse him. Ron worried for his baby sister when she started dating guys. He would get indignant or even angry about Snape insulting and slighting Harry or Hermione in classes. He went with Harry into the forbidden forest to follow the spiders that terrified him because he wasn't going to let Harry go by himself. He would get into fights with Malfoy over insults about his friends or family. He shows this protective nature at every turn in the books.

If the locket started showing him that his family was being tortured, regardless of whether or not it was true, he would attack the locket faster than you could blink. Then he'd strike off without a plan to go save his family or something along that vein with his friends at his six. By playing on his insecurities, it's trying to turn him on his friends. To keep them all distracted from destroying the locket and instead intent on attacking each other.

What's a more effective course of action is debatable as both courses are valid and I think that debate would ultimately be tangential to our subject.

The point is the Horcrux was sentient. It's not just programmed to do one thing like show a person's worst fear. It lies, it does whatever it thinks is necessary to get what it wanted. It showing Ron an image of Harry and Hermione is a poor indication of Ron's actual priorities, etc. It says more about what the horcrux wanted.

** Maybe, we don't see a lot of it. I often think I'd like to see a JK-written rewrite of moments in the series from Hermione's POV.

To be honest based on canon alone I don't pick up a lot of chemistry or romantic attraction between any of the Trio. I feel like a lot of Harmonian shipping is as a result more of Harry and Hermione appearing to be the male and female lead of the text rather than any inherent chemistry they have as people.

Of course, there's also the fact that Daniel and Emma have wicked chemistry as actors to contend with though, which is unfortunate.

** Yes, I'm a only child who has several pairs of siblings as cousins from the out side looking in. Ron never flirts with Hermione that we can see, it's just assumed he is attracted to her starting 6th year. The closest they ever seem as a couple is on Herbology when they dance around Hermione asking Ron to the Slug Club as her date. Even during the hunt he and Hermione maintain that weird brother sister vibe with JK shoving the one hint they are into each other with Hermione and him holding hands in Grimmauld. Then they kiss and it's kinds squiky

Harry and Hermione actually seem to take comfort in each other both emotionally and physically (not sexually) when the Ron leaves and the infamous dance happens as well as the Christmas Eve visit to James and Lily's Graves. This is just a extention of their roles in each other lives as the others true best friend.

** It depends on what your view of a sibling relationship is. Hermione and Harry seem to avoid confrontation at all costs as though they're trying hard not to ruin the stable familial relationship they've built. Not all siblings are stereotypically argumentative. My brother and I tend to avoid conflict like the plague because we know that it will be a lot worse in the long run. Hermione and Ron on the other hand argue like friends/potential lovers, they don't have as much fear of losing the other because you can always find someone else to love romantically but you can't get new family. Just because Harry and Hermione get on doesn't mean they're romantically attracted to each other. When I first started dating my boyfriend we argued more because we were insecure and unsure of things. Now we don't argue at all. I think we get these ideas in our heads of what other people's relationships should be based on our own experiences but there's no mould for relationships.

** I think Ron had no idea how to act and react around a girl he likes (I don't think he figured out that his feelings were romantic, he only knew that he enjoyed her company) and since the only girl he knows and likes is his sister he mimics the way he behaves around her.

Once he grows up a bit and realizes that Hermione is not his sister he realizes that he shouldn't be talking and acting the same way he does with Ginny, but he still doesn't know HOW to act. It took Krum appearing and him feeling jealous for him to realize what he felt and yet he had no idea how to communicate it to her. He has no couple point of reference beside his parents and they've been married for a looong time so it's not a dynamics he can copy. He could've gone and asked his brothers for tips, but I'm his mind the twins would make fun of him, Percy was being a dick and I think Ron was waaay too immature to deal with a conversation like this in a letter with Billy or Charlie.

His relationship with Lavender is when he discovers how this boyfriend and girlfriend stuff works and how to act romantically around a girl. And she was the one that made all the first steps for it to happen. And that's when he finally starts to make a move with Hermione and it starts to work well.

Harry on the other hand doesn't have any starting point on "how do I act around girls" so he just treats her as he would treat a friend. Their relationship becomes stronger, but the way he treats her is always in a "you're my friend and I respect you" way. He was a tool when it comes to dating as well, but he never changed how he sees Hermione, he's not overprotective of her, he respects her decisions and their arguments is never sibling-like.

Someone commented of the Horcrux Harry and Hermione moment, but the way I see it's just a fear Ron had from the way he perceived things, he thought Harry was superior and that maybe Hermione would want that superiority. Harry immediately says that he doesn't sees Hermione like this and honestly not a line when they were alone on that trip to find Horcruxes leads to romantic behaviour.

Anyway, that's how I see and interpret it, I know that Harmony shippers don't see it like that, but the beauty of art is that people can perceive it in different ways and exchange experiences.
