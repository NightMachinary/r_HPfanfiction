  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU

** I want a crossover of this with the animated movie the Queen's Corgi.

A bit of the story from Wikipedia.

Rex is the Queen's favourite corgi and lives with his three other corgi companions a life of luxury at the Buckingham Palace. On a visit made by President Donald Trump with his wife Melania Trump and their own dog Mitzi, the Queen suggests that perhaps one of her corgis might prove to be a suitable mate for Mitzi, who chooses Rex, who is not pleased at all at the prospect of marrying Mitzi. After Rex evades her multiple times, Mitzi eventually chases him into the dining hall where he accidentally bites the president, deeply angering the Queen.

There's more to it but I'm imagining Mitzi in love with Harry also she's slightly obsessed with mating with Rex but instead it would be with Harry.
