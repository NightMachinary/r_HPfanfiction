:END:
I can't remember too much but a part that stands out in my mind is that Harry's friend that he would do drugs with dies and when Bill (i think) finds him at the hospital and tries to take Harry back to Hogwarts, harry tries to kill himself with some random pills at the hospital. After this they manage to get Harry under observation and in therapy.


** I think the one you're talking about is called hooked. If you look up hooked Harry Potter wattpad. it's the first link.
