I've read a lot of Harry going back in time to change the outcome of the war but want to read one where Hermione goes back in time to save Harry. Looking for Harry/Hermione pairing of course. Would prefer her to arrive at the beginning of GoF but will take almost anything. A lot of stories I have found when searching is Hermione traveling to the marauders era but that's not what I want. Let me know of any good stories you guys know. Thanks!


** Yes, it seems Hermione time travel often goes back to marauder era where she gets hooked up with Sirius, Remus, or both of them. To be honest, none of the plot lines I read so far was truly satisfactory, with the possible exception of *One Hundred and Sixty Nine*, linkffn(8581093).

I always think the solution is pretty simple:

1) Let everything happen just as it was in canon, until the last few days before Oct 31 1981.

2) Keep Petegrew as the secret keeper, let him betray the Potters, except that none of the Potters would be there. Instead, place three incapacitated death eaters inside Harry's room (just in case V casts Homenum Revelio).

3) Rig the house with tons of explosives, and blow it up once V entered the building. His spirit should be fleeing for Albania next.

4) Once Lucius Malfoy shows to proclaim his innocence, arrest him and search his secret hiding room. That should get him at least few decades quality time with dementors and the Diary.

5) Set up an ambush at Longbottom's place. Capture the Lestranges and force them to get the Cup. Use Crouch Jr to force Crouch Sr out of the office.

6) Go to Hogwarts, retrieve the Diadem, and dump all horcruxes into the Gaunt Shack.

7) Burn down the Gaunt shack with Fiendfyre.

8) Wait until Walbulga kicks the bucket, take control of Kreacher, destroy the Locket.

9) V should be ok until the animal he possesses dies, but once there's need to possess a new one, he will die as there are no more horcruxes to prevent his soul from migrating.

I always think it's a lot easier to destroy Horcruxes without a live dark lord bearing down your neck. There was also the risk of V sensing something if you try to destroy his horcruxes. I also think that V doesn't need a human body to die. Once horcruxes are gone and his animal body dies, he dies.

As for what Hermione or any other hero can do until 1981, they can make a KILLING in the financial markets with their advance knowledge. In fact, if I can have just 24 hours advance knowledge before the option expiration date or FDA decision day, I can easily make 10 or 100 times my money.

*** I really liked 169. I also liked Storm of Yesterday linkffn(11494764), which paired her up with James.

For another possible rationale of why travelling back to the marauder-era may be more popular: If I could travel back in time to save the world from Voldemort, might as well give Harry (and Neville as a bonus) the chance to grow up with his parents, or at least have the next 14~ years to destroy V completely, rather than have to do everything in a smaller time frame. Just my 2c, for whatever it's worth :)

I think there are also fics that go way back into the 50's (?) to TMR's childhood...

  Hunted by Voldemort, Hermione and Harry make a last stand in Godric's Hollow.

**** It's not often I get to add things to my library that are marked with 5*

Thanks for the awesome rec! I wasn't expecting it to work so well, but it did! Some of the kids ages were played with loosely in the epilogue, but that's ok

A brief review: relatively fluffy fic without a lot of conflict. Lots of short chapters make it easy to sit and read without drowning in fluff, angst, or intrigue. Very well written, though there may have been a rush to finish near the end.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** It's a solid plan, but Voldemort has a very decent chance of surviving the trap. He could figure out that it is a trap in time, or apparate, or simply be tough enough to survive a massive explosion in the face. If things don't go perfectly, V will live and the rest of the plan will be thrown into complete disarray.

I /think/.

Anyway, Hermione sent it back in time for little Hermione could save little Harry from his horrible life with the Dursleys and make a better future. They lost in the future and this was their only shot at victory.

I don't think it was finished, but it was at least a little different from most time travel stories, since the target of the memories and personality was given a choice in how to handle things.

Ha, found it! I remembered little Hermione making bagels for breakfast to share with little Harry and it came up. It's called "Second Chance at Life." linkffn(5644619)

Only 10 chapters, so it stopped even sooner than I thought. Pity.

Now I remember another where Hermione went back in time and took in Harry to raise him. I'm not sure if her travel was intentional or not, but Harry tried to follow her and ended up attaching himself to the Grangers, helping give little Hermione a better childhood.

And, yeah, they all ran into each other after a while.

But I really don't remember enough to find that one.

** I'll mention linkffn(10949411) We Found Wonderland but as it seems to be abandoned, it's not a recommendation.

This was the first story I Beta-ed - I hope you can tell when I started; it certainly wasn't from the start.

I still think this has a lot of promise and really hope the author will come out of retirement.

  Hermione Granger has always been exceptional. When the war with Voldemort is finally over, it has taken everything from her. Including her ability to die properly, it seems. And now she's in the 1940s, living in an orphanage. What could possibly go wrong? Only time will tell.

** There's also "Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World", where Hermione sends an alternate self of her a letter with instructions. Sadly, not completed.

  Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.
