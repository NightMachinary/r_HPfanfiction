In this fic, Dumbledore lets Grindelwald out of Nurmengard to help in the fight with Voldemort.


** I'm not sure if this counts as a "Grindelwald fic", but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2705927/1/Imprisoned-Realm][Imprisoned Realm]] (Words: 222,454 - Updated: Mar 19) starts from a scene like that.

#+begin_quote
  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a nightmarish dimension where war has reigned for 28 years. Other thing worse than Voldemort, the evil Ministry of Magic, the threat of a new Dark Lord & parents who despise him is the new situation Harry is thrust into. Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? A story of heroes and fallen angels. Warnings within.
