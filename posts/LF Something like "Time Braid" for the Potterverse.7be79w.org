Is there anything like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid][Time Braid]] in the Potterverse? I'm specifically looking for the following attributes:

- More than one of the MCs is looping
- Does not necessarily have to follow Harry
- Loopers may not be looping together at first
- Shit leaves scars, and MCs may need to patch themselves up afterwards
- Eventual romance
- /Upgrades/

Anything like this exist yet?


** Linkffn(many deaths of Harry potter)

Haven't read time braid, but it seems like it fits.

** linkffn(6517567)

It's honestly not that good, and abandoned to boot, but it's got two MCs looping.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
