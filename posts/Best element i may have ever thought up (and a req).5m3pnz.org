So in a story i put on hiatus, there would be a hogwarts school newspaper. There would, of course, be a column where hufflepuffs are reported on, where it's a running joke they're looking for the next dark lord since it's long past time for one from there.

But the big idea? When Harry enters Hogwarts there's a column about him---that's reprinted in the Daily Prophet, of course---named, rather brilliantly I think, /The Harry Column/. Older students would giggle at the name while first year girls would breathlessly discuss the Harry Column at length.

I'll probably write a few hundred words or so for my anthology but I'd love to see some more school paper stories. Anyone got good ones?

** Harry goes around at night with the invisibility cloak and exposes all the illicit couples on his column.

Harry smuggles drugs into Hogwarts and after he gets students addicted, he does an expose on the "Hogwarts underground drug culture".

Harry uses amonertia on some female students with Lockhart being the target, then reveals Lockhart for a child molester.

******* This needs to be a story. Can you imagine it? He'd probably start school just a couple of years after the end of the war, probably finish school either the year just gone or the year before. Neville would become a teacher in his time, Teddy, Victoire, Dominique, Louis, James, Molly, and Fred would start school, perfect candidates for his school paper.

  The Harry Column

Missed chance there. Potter Post. Lightning Scar Letter. The-Column-that-Lived.

I'd love if, eventually, Harry is the one writing it under a fake name. Like Peter Parker reporting about Spiderman, you know.

** Would this be an official school newspaper or an underground one where the professors have no control over it? Maybe one of each?

Well you have to have a column of the recent sighting of Nargles and whatnot by Luna. Maybe a Weasley Watch where people talk about their most recent pranks? How about a secret column which needs a passcode (ala "I solemnly swear I am up to no good") to access the Harry Potter Fan Club updates? You'd also maybe want someone to draw a cartoon strip or something. Something to talk smack about Snape would be fun. Maybe a "Whose dating whom" thing?

*** Elements of both, student control with 'staff' oversight that's actually a daily prophet employee on loan.

It's just a story about a school paper, not an actual paper but as a former j-student, I do muse about writing a real one. I had an idea for a 'zine about crossover fiction actually, did a mockup of it a while ago. [[http://ovxer.blogspot.com]]
