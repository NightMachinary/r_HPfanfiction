A few days ago, [[/u/MidgardWyrm][u/MidgardWyrm]] posted a really fun prompt (which can be found here: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mpkkx9/maledictus_cure/]]) about Daphne discovering an... unorthodox method of curing Astoria's illness.

Pretty much before I had even finished reading his idea, I fell in love with the prompt. After making sure there were no objections to me giving it a go, I sat down and thought about where and how I'd like this story to go.

Anyway, the first chapter's published now. Enjoy!

Chapter 1 - A Malignant Ruse

*** Err... well. I CAN tell you it will have a happy ending, but no promises on it being a 'cheerful' story. We're talking about a dying little girl, and someone manipulating another. Not exactly comedic gold haha.

** I'm not an angst fan, and a lot of the potential options in the prompt look like they could end up that way. Is that likely in your fics, or do you lead more towards happy endings?

*** Phew! That's a loaded question haha. The short answer is: if a fic I write does /not/ have a happy ending, I will tag it as tragedy. Otherwise, you can be sure that - at minimum - Harry and the principle love interest survive to the end and have a ride into the sunset.

HOWEVER - people who do read my stories will tell you that I can be pretty merciless in the hardships my characters endure en route to said happy ending. For this fic, I feel like you'll probably be okay. It will mostly track with canon for 5th year, diverging as we move along (stays with Daphne POV most of the story).

** Call me evil but I would like option A and C (from original post) but not as ending, more like in midway. Then they build their trust back (in sequel?) through being forced in situations where they have to talk or help each other out... I'm a romantic that way and think that love is not easy to forget.

I'll definitely read your story once I'm free (and there is more content) and will follow (and favourite) for future updates. Good luck and hope you have fun writing it :)
