As the title says, I'm looking for fics where students compete in a tournament or competition that isn't the Triwizard - like the Hogwarts Games in 'An Unfound Door' by Joe. Not competitions that are just non-canon Triwizards - we've had threads on those before - but anything involving a competition that isn't the Triwizard in any form. There's a Triwizard fic where Harry and Fleur attend a dueling competition 'on the continent' midway through the tournament - her mother later criticises her on it, and Harry for losing to Flitwick after a 'lucky shot'. Can't for the life of me recall the name, but triwizard fics with non-Triwizard competitions like that are also cool (please do mention that it has a non-Triwizard competition in your comment though - will likely prevent some downvotes from any miscommunication there).

Unfound Door - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7552826/1/An-Unfound-Door]]

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.


** In these fics, the tournaments are significant but may not necessarily be the focus.

In the Red Knight, TimeTraveler!Ron ends up in an international dueling tournament with Fleur. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight]])

Hogwarts Battle School is pretty much all about intra-mural combat tournaments (it also has the Triwizard but there are tournaments outside of that competition). linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School]])

HPMOR also has an extensive intramural combat tournament linkffn(HPMOR)

According to His Own Nature has a Gryffindor!Tom Riddle being trained by Flitwick and culminates with a Dueling Tournament. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15989558/chapters/37302626]]) Probably should read the one-shot Men Who Are Resolved first though. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15607950]])

*** Wow. I haven't read any of those - except a bit of HPMOR, which I stopped for the usual reason of finding the protagonist irritating. From their first chapters, Red Knight looks very interesting, same with Men Who Are Resolved and Own Nature. Not sure about Battle School, though. Seems a bit... clunky. I'll read a bit more, see what direction the whole 'Snape leads a child-soldier training camp' theme is taken in. Thanks for the recs!

*** It is very long. It's been on the list to read for awhile now. I might have to push it up a bit, now I know there's a tournament in there somewhere. Thanks for the rec. :)

**** If you read and loved Alanna the lioness (Different book series; not fanfic), I think you'll love this one too. This is my favourite fanfic ever, though I know it's not for everyone

****** I think it's awesome. It loosely follows the plot of both Alanna and HP, but things happen differently and it's got its own story going on too. Most/all of the characters are what'd I'd call “reimagined” - they're not in character, but they're not meant to be, and I love the friendships Harry forms and seeing who the characters could've been.

IMO Harry is OP for a child, which may or may not be a big issue for others, but doesn't bother me too much, because the obstacles/opponents are also powerful

******* Oh, I meant the Alanna the Lioness books, sorry. I've already been convinced to try the fic, now I'm curious about the original material. :)

Would you say that they're still similar, at least? Not just OCs with the Harry Potter names tacked on? At lot of AUs seem to struggle with that parallel-universe-esque 'the same but different' stuff when it comes to characters, I've noticed.

******** Haha, sorry! I read Allana series when I was a kid, and yes, it is awesome. She swaps places with her brother to become a knight and he a mage, and it's tough but she makes it through and becomes a totally badass.

I'd say some of them are very similar, others not so much. A lot of characters who were on the sidelines in hp are big in pureblood pretense, and personally I love it; I'd say reimagined - share some background, traits, goals, ways of thinking, but different too. I do think a lot of the characters are very very similar to their cannon counterpart, but they maybe don't have as big a role in pureblood pretense.

********* Cool. I'll take a look. It sounds kind of like a children's version of The Deed of Paksennarion in tone, so it sounds like something I'd like.

And that is interesting. Not many AUs actively try balance out that dynamic between same and different like that.

  Harry stared out the Dursely car window morosely. 'I would have went with Sirius if he had asked.' He thought. 'I would have run from the law and Durselys with him.' He paused, blinking. 'I could do that on my own! I could run away' Summer after 3rd year

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.
