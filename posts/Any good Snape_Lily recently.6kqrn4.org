[Request] Hi everyone, just looking for some help on any decent and Snape/Lily fics. I've read a few already of the more popular ones on ff. Thanks.


** I'm sure you've probably read the most recomended ones: linkffn(ananke) linkffn(obscura nox animae) linkffn(4936966) linkffn(12129370) linkffn(8134710) Linkffn(12129370) linkffn(9425774) linkffn(7919460) linkffn(6306296) linkffn(7670834) linkffn(11266220) linkffn(12369512) linkffn(6613973)

I hope you like them. I have more but I'd need more time to look for them in my favourites. These are the ones I could remember.

*** Thank you for the peace not promised rec Just read it and it's really good. Usually I find both Snape and Lily extremely out of character in time travel fics but this one seems to actually be staying true to their characters. It's a relief to read a fic where she doesn't just suddenly start being friends with him again just because he starts acting nicer and drops James just because.

**** Unfortunaly there's not many fics to choose in this ship, almost nobody ships them (I'd say most are HOSTILE to snily). Even most of the fics I've favorited are just good enough, not the very best.

IMO it's way easier to find a decent snily than a decent hapne, but the struggle is real, most of the fics about them aren't really good or clich√© free.

  1976 and nightmare visions of the future are plaguing Severus Snape. With Lily's help, he will need to figure out what these glimpses are trying to tell him, to change their future to a better one for all of the wizarding world. Although the future is not set in stone, not everything Severus sees can be changed, sometimes the inevitable will reach them sooner than they expected

  It's 1976 and the scene by the lake after the fifth year defence OWLs but instead of trying to fight back with magic, Severus snaps his own wand and throws it at Lupin's feet, announcing he's quitting Hogwarts.
