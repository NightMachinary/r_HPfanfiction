Recommend to me YOUR OWN ongoing or completed fanfiction that is canon-compliant or canon-divergent (but still fits in with the canon universe that JK created).

No stories with slash or harems, but non-canon pairings are acceptable.

I want to see some good fanfiction discovered.

I'll start with a (shameless) promotion of my own linkffn(Dysfunctional by Rose9797) Canon-divergent at the end of OotP because Sirius didn't die.

As you can see, I enjoy the world JKR created so much and would love to see more stories that do good fanservice to it.


** All my stories are canon compliant (except maybe the Aurors where I took so liberties with a very minor character - more divergence than AU).

  Post-OotP - Sirius is cleared and finally gets to give Harry the home he had always wanted. The war is escalating outside and the Order of the Phoenix needs to rise to the challenge to prepare themselves for a war of the ages. OR What if Sirius never fell through the veil but lives instead? No slash/bashing. Harry and Sirius family fic. HBP Semi-canon compliant.

** My trilogy is almost entirely canon-compliant (except for the AU addition of a daughter of Snape and Bellatrix) up until the end of Goblet of Fire where some canon divergence begins to occur because of the inclusion of the new character who is an adult by this time. I also greatly expand on the concepts of Occlumency and legilimency but keep it compliant with the little we do see in canon, and I've been told I have one of the more believable but still sympathetic portrayals of Snape out there.

#+begin_quote
  After the Dark Lord's fall in 1981, more than one child was lost in the spoils of war. Six-year-old Calista, the daughter of the Dark Lord's most infamous and fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, has been left in an orphanage by her mother's cousin Sirius Black, following her rescue from a mother that only wanted to twist her to the Dark Lord's purpose. The staff at the orphanage consider her both a lost cause and a Squib, but it may take a forgotten, rejected man to save a forgotten, rejected child. For his part, Severus Snape has enough to regret without dwelling on his brief, haunting affair with the Dark Lord's most quixotic servant; but he decides to see, in the aftermath of her arrest, if he can locate her missing daughter. Instead of answers, he finds a haunted, irrevocably damaged child with his eyes and his ghosts, and he knows at once that he cannot leave her where she is. Above all, a realistic Snape's daughter story, as well as an honest depiction of recovery and PTSD, and an in-depth exploration of the mental arts of Legilimency and Occlumency.

  COMPLETE. Sequel to "Always in Your Shadow". Severus Snape's daughter Calista attends Hogwarts. As if Occlumency lessons, peer rivalry, and growing up Snape weren't challenging enough, she still has to contend with her dangerous, sadistic mother, Bellatrix Lestrange, trying to invade her mind. AU, in-character; CC where possible. In-depth exploration of the art of Occlumency.

** I've started writing my in my own canon universe. Here are links to my two current WIP, but I also have some one-shots and short stories on my author page.

- Toy Soldier: linkffn(12986857)
- Full Steam Ahead: linkffn(13031314)

I've got some really good story ideas that I've been saving FOR YEARS. And I know if I can just finish them, they are going to be really good. I'm excited, but also nervous because I'm notoriously bad about abandoning projects (and then deleting them in shame). I've told myself that I'm not allowed to abandon anything anymore, and I will hold myself accountable.

** Yeah, that's 90% of everything I've every written. I've basically made a universe to play in while still being as canon compliment as I can be.

Fair warning that canon characters appear but are not the main focus of most of my fics, I like to focus on average people who were not marked by destiny, but made choices and now have to live with them. Investigations is an exception.
