Can we please stop with Harem fics?

It's just ridiculous how Harry ends up with nine women.

The Wizarding world doesn't have a large population --- by taking many wives, Harry deprives family line from a chance at survival.

Having Potter spawn everywhere would only reduce the gene pool and let's remember that inbreeding is a major problem of the Wizarding world.

Moreover, how Harry would find the time to love and care for so many partners? You can't do everything. Let's think about the girls. Don't they deserve a great love story, don't they deserve to feel unique, don't they deserve to have their lover's undivided attention? So what, they just have to bear sharing their husband with other women?

And let's not talk about the quality of childcare. Having a child with each wife would make it difficult for Harry to develop a meaningful relationship with each children. Harry yearns for a family, a simple love story like his parents. The harem trope doesn't make that possible I'm afraid.

The girls themselves are suffering from bad writing, limited to basic traits, no flesh to their characters. Hermione is the smart one, Susan is the kind one, Fleur is the beautiful one, Daphne is the political one, Nymphadora is the wild/fun one, Luna is the odd one...

Women are more that one defining traits, they are not trophies. They deserve better than what those Harem fics are offering.

Instead of working on a character that can hold some of these traits in some measure, authors just take the easy (and bad) way out.

I'm not against polyamory. But harem fics are just a recipe for bad writing. Harry spends two paragraphs with each girls and each of them seem content with only that.

So can we please stop? Please stop this misogynistic/anti-feminist writing.


** While I'm not personally a fan of Harem fics, I don't really think it's up to us to ask people to stop writing them. I know plenty of people who love them, after all. No hate, of course. Just my opinion.

*** Oh I agree with you. Freedom of speech and write whatever makes you happy. I guess some people would enjoy them and it's their right. I'm just hoping for more thought-out stories in the future.

As a reader, I just wanted to give my thoughts to the authors.

I respect their work. They write for free, for my entertainment so it would be rude of me to bash their work (which I kind of did, sorry ---but I only meant to bash the trope). I don't have the right to feel entitled to only what I consider being good writing.

Bad writing is inevitable but if I can denounce some tropes that inevitably lead to it, then I want to do it.

It's just frustrating when a story holds promise and then is botched mid-way by a poor attempt at writing a polyamorous trope.

I LOVE the Poly trope which is a big part of why I don't like Harem fics, honestly. As a Poly person myself, it always seems like kind of a cop out when the author goes for Harem. There aren't nearly enough Poly stories out there.

***** Oh yeah I agree with you. Good poly is hard to find. It starts as poly then turns into a harem fic with a godlike man and objectified and badly written women. The love is almost non-existent. Harry just throws ‚ÄúI-love-you‚Äùs left and right without any reason about why he fell in love. ‚ÄúSusan if you sign this betrothal contract, I'll promise to love you and cherish you for as long as we live [...]‚Äù well sorry to burst your bubble toxic male but you can't promise love, you either feel it or not, you can't force it. I'm not a Poly person, but I don't mind and even like reading good poly fics, but they seem to be rare commodities these days. While I'm gay and prefer slash I will read anything as long as it is well-written and makes sense.

The thing is, just like with any group of people you write about, you CAN make pretty much any size of cast work if you spend enough time on character development AND the interactions of everyone inside that group. BUT, here's the issue. Doubling the number of people does not double the number of relationships between the characters, the increase is much larger. It gets infeasible really quickly:

- 1 Character - 0 Relationships

- 2 Characters - 1 Relationship

- 3 Characters - 3 Relationships

- 4 Characters - 6 Relationships

- 5 Characters - 10 Relationships

And so on. With each character you add, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep them unique and their actions and interactions believable. Romantic entanglements are just the cherry on top of the already difficult characterisations and relationships. Look at Canon and at how little we actually learn about the characters other than Harry. We don't even know the names of Hermione's parents, or what her dream profession would be. And that's just the trio, nevermind Ginny or Neville.

But while it kinda works for (distant) friends, that would be unacceptable for people in a committed relationship. So you either don't move the plot at all or you do as most harem fics do and ignore characterisation beyond one or two generic traits. And that's why they are so bad. Not because the premise is inherently bad, very few are, but because the people who write that kind of fic usually lack the necessary skills to make their premise work.

Tl;dr: Anything up to 4 people can be made to work with enough effort, everything beyond that is doomed to fail.

** I wanted to agree with the general idea as writing good harem plot is either really hard or leads to crack fics. Harem Crack Fics are rather interesting in my opinion and allow for both doing the multi relationship plot as well as they remove some problems. However they are not the only way as one can trully make a good plot while keeping harem elements, provided of course that the are not more people involved than the author can manage and that the story pacing is somewhat slower to actually give time for character development and relationship development.

There are few important points beside that:

Trying to make all of the relationships involved as perfect ones leads nowhere.

Rushing it leads to failure or to crack.

Harem politics could work so well if anyone actually did them in any way other than political marriage.

While it is connected with other problems, tropes and cliches, why almost no story has a character as both bashed one and a part of harem, it could be quite a plot.

And finally, what actually lead me to writing this comment and unlike most of additional points above that are there because I like to rant is that harem stories can be mysoginistic but doesn't have to be. They are hard to write of course but it does not make them some special kind of evil. Discarding them can be of course a simple preference but it is a bit kinkshamy..

TLDR Harem stories are hard not bad, so dear writers GIT GUT or make it cracky.

I don't think everyone is a bit bi.

You can be straight and appreciate the beauty of girls but that doesn't mean you'd have sex with one.

True, some guys are bi but prefer to think themselves as straight because their ¬´ masculinity ¬ª would not allow them to consider being with a guy.

But some people are straight or gay only and that's something to accept.

Sexuality is immensely complicated, you can't simplify it by saying that everyone is a bit bi.

********* Do you mean that straight (cis) guy like to watch straight action (men and women) having sex, so they must be attracted to men as well?

I can't tell you about that, I've never been in a straight male's head.

I suppose most of it is projection though. You know imagining being the male getting some. Imagining what it would be like to have a giant tool, or what it would be like to have rough encounters (when most non-professional women wouldn't let themselves be roughed up).

I don't know if there is attraction, I think it's more akin to admiration and wish fulfillment.

But I agree with your assessment of harems. The problem is that most authors have no experience with polyamorous relationships and can't figure out the dynamics of it clearly.

So they write it with a powerful man surrounded by love-sick women, vying for his attention. They write it like they would a single relationship and multiply it by the number of women they want Harry to be with. They make all relationships progress at the same pace, when it doesn't work like that. And finally, they write it with Harry not questioning his attraction to many women at all. They just assume that he would instantly go with many women, instead of asking himself if it's normal, or if it wouldn't be better if he had an exclusive and monogamous relationship.

And given that there are potions to regrow bones, there ought to be some to help you bone. If the spirit is willing but the body weak, there are always human transfiguration, possibly metamorphic powers, Polyjuice (fresh muscles and "tools") and good ol' toys.

Also, not everyone has to be a nymphomaniac, nor does Harry has to be the only source of "entertainment".
