I mean, come on, after spending 13+ years as a bodiless spirit/tumor growing in the back of someone's head he regained a body using a method that includes forcibly taking the blood of someone who hates him, has a mental link with him and just so happens to have a powerful and ancient anti-Voldemort enchantment, it would be perfectly possible for everything to backfire horrible in a way that forces Voldemort to spend the rest of his (immortal) life as a vegetal drooling in a bed at some asylum at the end of the world.


** Or what about the biological components? What if Harry had been nursing a cold leading up to the 3rd task? What if Pettigrew had caught the Black Plague as a rat before sacrificing his hand? What if Tom Riddle, Sr had had some sort of early stage bone cancer before being murdered?

** A tumour, which is a mundane non-magical disease, is probably very easy to manage as a wizard, especially when you have a potions expert like Snape available

*** /Having/ a tumor? Yeah, probably. But /being/ a tumor, this got to have some kind of after effect, even if it is only the psychological problems. Plus of all the reasons I gave for Voldemort developing brain problems this one was probably the lesser.
