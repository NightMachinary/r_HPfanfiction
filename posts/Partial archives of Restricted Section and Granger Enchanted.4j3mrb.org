Going through my calibre program, I realized I had 218 RS and 91 GE stories saved, and remembered [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4iccq8/its_been_almost_2_months_any_updates_regarding/][this thread]] and [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4hcrfy/so_with_granger_enchanted_permanently_shut_down/][this thread]]. Anyone interested in copies can shoot me a PM with their email.

Here's a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14hR1Se8JvdHMKuRwCVHr3ZrWMBpkckC5M_huD15PhLE/edit?usp=sharing][listing]] of the fics I have.


** Why not create a torrent instead, accessible Google Drive account, or a mega.co.nz pack? That would make finding the stories much easier for people down the line and reduce the inconvenience for you too.

**** If you want, you can put the whole thing into a single .zip\rar archive and share access with me --- I'll create mirrors in a way that will make individual stories\files accessible without having to download the whole thing.

** Could I get your top 10 completed ones? (If that isn't too much work for you). I just need new fics to read.
