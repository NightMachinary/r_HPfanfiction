**** For those who haven't understood the reference, it is from a poem Ozymandias, by Percy B Shelley.

Full text:

I met a traveller from an antique land

Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone

Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,

Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,

Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,

The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:

And on the pedestal these words appear:

'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:

Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'

Nothing beside remains. Round the decay

Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare

The lone and level sands stretch far away.

**** Well, popular is debate able. From what i understand of canon, Harry didnt interact with people a whole lot outside of his year. Though, i suppose that might play up his 'mysterious celebrity' feel, and make him /more/ popular.

Though he was most definitely a jock.

That's putting it mildly. He didn't even know Susan Bones' /name/ in /The Order of the Phoenix,/ and that was after four years of having her in Herbology, at the very least.

He also didn't know who Cormac McLaggen was, despite McLaggen being only one year older, and shared his Common Room.

**** We don't really have jocks in England. I mean, there are sporty people, but there never is the same stress on them being the top of the popularity chain.

However, I guess that's slightly different when you have one overwhelming sport? I always found it strange that they didn't have a cross country team or a football one from all the muggleborns.

****** I don't think Jk really thought that far beyond Gobbstones, chess and quidditch (the latter which I think we can all agree wasn't /really/ thought out) for fun (I may have forgotten some).

It's a shame that the books didn't show more at Hogwarts, with the other characters. However much it doesn't work logistically it seems a shame that we got "Dean forest" rather than the dark reality of Hogwarts 7th year. The other books were too repetitive in the details.

Add in hiding from fans and enemies in Hogwarts and I just love the idea of Harry being a master of stealth even without the Cloak and maybe going on to (in a crossover mostly) become a spy, information broker, or assassin.
