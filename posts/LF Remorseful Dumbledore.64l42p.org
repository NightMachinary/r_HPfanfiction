Hey guys,

me myself and I again ;)

This time I am looking for a Dumbledore that is remorseful for what he has put Harry through at the Dursleys and tries to make up for it (including having the Dursleys sent to prison or something like that, because sometimes blood-protection isn't worth it - especially since a fidelius charm with Dumbledore as the secret keeper would probably work just as well!) and encourage Harry to learn etc. :) and changes his plans to basically lead him to the slaughter (like he IMHO did in canon - I mean the "manipulative Dumbledore" stories do come from what we are shown in canon and IMHO it's not flattering for Dumbledore!)

Bonus points if he reigns in Snape (or if Snape himself stops being a miserable excuse for a human being who should probably be in Azkaban instead of Sirius Black!)

Things I don't want:

- No Harry/Ginny (I am sick of that pairing...I loved that at first, but after doing some more growing up I have a problem with Ginny being a second line character that is just defined enough that it doesn't give you free reign as a writer but not fleshed out enough to not need additional fleshing out...also: Their relationship appeared out of nowhere, no foreshadowing, nothing! There was just Ginny's silly crush and that's not a foundation for a relationship at all!)
- No main character slash (so no Harry/Draco, Snape, Lucius, Voldemort etc.)
- No praising Hermione as the best thing since sliced bread :( (she is (book-)smart, motivated and academically inclined, but she's not "the smartest witch of her age"!)

Thanks in advance for your help guys :) - stage is yours and I am signing off for now :)


** Hmm... I'm not sure if this fits the bill, but in linkffn(9824342) Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure, a Dumbles from another dimension takes over for a manipulative!Dumbledore and starts fixing his counterpart's mistakes. Its okay. Definitely worth a read if you're currently scratching the barrel.

Also, stop shouting at me with your exclamation marks!!! Those things are not made for normal speech and you make the English language cry!

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Dursleys went to prison, Dumbledore helped Harry settle down with Grangers, and Harry was academically very close to Hermione and had better intuition. Harry's scar problem was later resolved without him having to sacrifice himself.

** Not answering the prompt, I just wanted to point out that the smartest witch of her age is taken out of context if I recall correctly. I believe it was Lupin who said that, and he was referring to her as one of the smartest witches of her age group, not the smartest witch of the age, as in unit of time. I have seen multiple writers get confused at that point.

*** Probably, but fanfiction either demonizes her (Hermione bashing! - Which I admit I sometimes find amusing, especially if it "bashes" her real flaws and not stuff the author made up) or praises her and puts her on a pedestal (meaning that compared to "allmighty Hermione" all other characters are kind of dumb (except maybe Dumbledore) and need her to get anything done at all -.-)
