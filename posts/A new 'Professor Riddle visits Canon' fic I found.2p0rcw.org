** I read this and on one hand, it is rather well written, but on the other, Riddle isn't acting like a Slytherin, let alone someone who has been their head of house. He has no ambition, has shown no cunning, and is acting more like a Gryffindor or Ravenclaw than anything. Publicly taking an unbreakable vow that would limit him forever just to make people feel good is /not/ Slytherin - it opens him up to people using his words against him for the rest of his life. More than that, Sirius, Remus and Harry taking an immediate liking to him (well, within the first week of knowing him) is just wrong on so many levels.

I read one comment that pointed out his treatment of Snape in chapter four being a cheap prelude for evil!Snape - I reread the chapter, and found it quite interesting: Snape raised valid concerns. Riddle's reactions? Saying he deserved the scene at the lake because it was caused by Snape's big mouth and that he was essentially a little bitch. That's how he treats his colleagues and former house members. Not only did he not stop the bullying of his students, he actually holds it over their heads /and joins in/ two decades later.

That ticks me off to no end; avoiding the bullying angle by saying the victim had it coming is disgusting. Having a head of house act that way shows he is utterly undeserving of the job. I get it that the author wants to blame Snape for not teaching Harry occlumency so Riddle can teach it to him an a week to show us all how awesome he is, and how much of a better character judge he is than Dumbledore (you know, the Marauders had it right from the start and all)... but the execution of it is just childish.

Dumbledore isn't an idiot, no one deserves to be bullied and much less deserves it thrown in their face in public, Sirius wouldn't get over his loathing of Slytherins within an hour of meeting a new one, and no Slytherin would act the way Professor Riddle does. The story is interesting, and written to a much higher standard than most. Unfortunately, Professor Riddle seems like an excuse to put an overpowered good guy as a "twist" on canon. After reading enough fan fiction, I just can't bring myself to read more of this.

** Got to chapter 12, then dropped it. Riddle seems too weak...

But thnk you for the rec, none the less.

*** I actually like that Riddle is just a person, rather than a power-match for the version of himself that went heavily into dark rituals as self /improvement./

But I can see where that may not be what everyone is looking for. The panic attacks are a bit weird...

He does seem rather... accepting of his situation?

**** I don't object to him not being power-hungry, but this Riddle doesn't seem powerful nor intelligent, which are supposed (IMO) to be two defining factors about Riddle.

He also hasn't demonstrated any cunning nor ambition, which I would also want. Not that the ambition has to be power or otherwise negative. I mean, I assume he wants to return to his own universe, and so that would be his ambition. What cunning plans are he developing to achieve this goal? Er, he's going to teach at Hogwarts? Er, right ...

So far, I don't think the author has demonstrated any of the attributes that Riddle should have, and so it seems like some random OC with the same name. This Riddle simply isn't that interesting to me.

*** Weak in character or power? So far my biggest issue is that the characters are rather flat.

**** Mostly in character - we haven't really seen anything about his power one way or the other. Or maybe it is, as you said, that Riddle seems like a rather flat character.

I mean, it seems like he would be much more about trying to find a way home, rather than sitting back and taking on a new job.

** What are the other 'Professor Riddle visits Canon' fics you know? Read this, but have to say prefer Niger Aquila's Rectifier. Don't know any others.

*** Yes, it's quite good.

It can be a touch rough at the edges (occasional typos like hate/hat) but I like the plot. And the typos are at least nonstandard errors, rather than defiantly replacing definitely three times a chapter.

**** I don't even see typos, to be honest. Unless it's using the wrong word (people who use bemused always trip me up, are they using it the correct way or not?) my mind just fills in what the word should be and moves on.

***** Mostly these ones aren't too bad. There were one or two times that I couldn't figure out what the author was trying to say. There were a few times where the author missed capitalizing "Harry", and that was a bit annoying.

Not as annoying as the author of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10099028/28/Murder-Most-Horrid][Murder Most Horrid]], who always uses lower case for "Mr" and "Mrs". At least s/he's consistent about it.

** I'm only 5 chapters in, but I like it so far. I just don't understand why they didn't warn Ginny? Seems like a recipe for disaster
