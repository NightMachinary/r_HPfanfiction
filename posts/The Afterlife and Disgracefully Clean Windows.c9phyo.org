Sunlight streamed through the openings between the wooden slats covering the windows. In the final battle, the residents of the village of Hogsmeade had fought back against the Death Eaters stationed in the village, defeated them and then set off along the long drive to Hogwarts to fight in the against Voldemort and His followers. In the chaos a Death Eater had sent a blasting hex hurtling into the front of the Hog's Head bar, shattering its ancient grime caked windows which were nearly as old as the village itself. Since then the front wall had been rebuilt, just the same as it once was, though no amount of magic would resurrect the decades of grime that had adorned it. And until the years rolled by and the glass fogged over grey with grime once again, sunlight would stream unimpeded through the windows, and the patrons of the Hogs Head would have to double check to see if people outside the pub were looking in on who they were drinking with for the first time in living memory. It was by one of these newly transparent windows, around a small round table, that three people sat. Drinking warm butterbeer and speaking as only old friends do, two men and a woman spent their afternoon completely at ease in each other's company. A testament to years by each others side.

"How's Auror training Harry?" Hermione said, a teasing grin dancing across Her face.

"Oh shut up." Grumbled Harry. "You perfectly well how it is, it's bloody impossible."

"You'd think they'd give Him a bit of extra credit at least" intoned Ron, "I mean, Voldemort wasn't exactly a pushover. And that kind of practical experience has to count for something."

"Harry asked Kingsley to make sure He didn't get any special treatment, He wanted to graduate fair and square like everyone else." Hermione said, an air of mock haughtiness and an upturned nose completing the effect.

An effect that lasted all of three seconds as she broke down in giggles.

"Yeah yeah, laugh it up" said Harry, "doesn't change the fact that Robards training methods are at least distantly related to a kitchen blender"

'Still' Harry mused, 'She was right that He had asked Kingsley to prevent Him from receiving special treatment. Something He seemed to be succeeding at magnificently. At least, if His grades in the academy's advanced potion course we're anything to go by.'

Harry Ron and Hermione had returned to Hogwarts to finish their education after the war, and while Harry had somehow managed to get the required potion NEWT to qualify for the academy, He had no illusions as to whether He could ever make a fallback career as a professional brewer. For all that He had managed to redeem Himself in the end, it could not be disputed that Snape had been absolutely terrible at teaching potions.

"Well I think it's admirable that Harry is going about this the fair way" said Hermione.

"And I think they'd have made Him head of the bloody department without the training if He'd asked them to" Ron added.

"Be that as it may" Hermione said, an air of evasion about Her words, "I still think Harry made the right choice."

"You don't see Me contradicting that do You" replied Ron, "I just think that..."

As Hermione and Ron's voices faded into the background, Harry thought back fondly over all the times He had witnessed the same sort of argument happen between them. They loved to bicker, the two of them. Though in truth, there was no heat behind their words, and they both wore a smile on their faces as they argued.

"That's completely irrelevant, the fact is that the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures shouldn't base its definition of "being" on how close a creature is to human"

An argument that had expanded to include the definition of sentient life, apparently.

Seeing them like this, so at ease with each other, sitting in close affection by each other's side, it reminded Harry of His own parents. The way they were always close to each other. Whether in the photo album Hagrid gave Him in His first year, or in pictures taken from Daily Prophet news clippings. They were always in close proximity, even when He had summoned Them with the ressurection stone they had stood so close to one another's side they had been almost touching.

"Harry..."

"Hmm? Oh" Harry Started, "What is it?"

"Nothing mate, just, you looked kinda lost there for a second" Ron said.

"I was just... remembering." Replied Harry.

"You were thinking about your parents weren't You," said Hermione, "You always get this pensive look when you do."

"Yeah, I suppose I was" said Harry, marveling at how well Hermione knew His facial expressions.

"Are you alright mate?" Asked Ron.

"Yeah, I am" replied Harry. And He meant it, thinking of His parents no longer brought on a sense of depressed longing, but rather, peace. One of the more unexpected things to come out of brief journey to "the next great adventure" as Dumbledore had put it.

"I was just remembering seeing them when I used the resurrection stone. You two reminded me of them, actually."

Ron and Hermione looked a bit flummoxed at that admission. Well, Ron did, Hermione's eyes widened slightly and She quickly changed the subject.

"You know Harry, You never actually told what us what it was like." Said Hermione, suddenly rather timid.

"What what was like?" Asked Ron.

"What, well, what it was like being dead" said Hermione, going a bit pink in the face.

"Oh, that" said Ron, also suddenly uncomfortable.

'No, He hadn't told them had He' thought Harry, though they clearly wanted to know, and yet they had let Him tell them in His own time. And He knew that they wouldn't press the matter if He refused, and yet, it seemed to be right.

"You don't have to tell us if you don't want to Harry" Hermione said quickly, "it's perfectly alright if you..."

"No", Harry interrupted, "it's alright. You've waited this long, You deserve to know."

Harry opened His mouth to speak and, for a moment, didn't have a clue what to say. How on earth could He explain what had happened, something He Himself could barely comprehend. In the end, He decided not to try and explain it, just to tell them what happened and then let them figure it out for themselves.

"Well," Harry began, "After I watched Snape's memories I knew what had to happen. The bit of Voldemort that was in my Scar had to go, and according to the Prophecy, Voldemort had to be the one to get rid of it. I went to the forest and confronted Voldemort. The curse hit Me and I died, that's the simple part." Said Harry

"And, what happened next?" Inquired Hermione, a mixture of curiosity and trepidation in Her eye.

"Well, I woke up" said Harry.

"So, that's It? Nothing actually happened?" Said Ron, looking rather dissapointed.

"Not quite," said Harry, "When I woke up, I wasn't in the forest anymore. I was somewhere else entirely."

"Where?" asked Hermione, leaning forward now, Her curiosity on full display.

"I was... on a riverbank", said Harry, slowly.

Hermione, blinked. She seemed rather surprised.

"It was bright out, there wasn't a cloud in the sky. It was a wide river, and while it didn't seem to be moving fast, it did seem quite deep. I very much doubt I could have swum across."

"So, the afterlife is a river?" Asked Ron, looking rather confused.

"Not quite, it was strange, I could tell the river was there, but at the same time, I felt like I wasn't really seeing it. Or rather, like what I what I was seeing wasn't the whole picture. And anyway, I'm not done describing it."

"So there was the river", began Harry "and I couldn't quite see the other shore. More like, I didn't want to look for some reason. So I looked around Me instead. The shore I was on was made entirely from stones." Harry Remembered. They had all been small, smooth, round, and bleached white by the sun. "There was a single tree up on the bank, and beyond that, a rolling field that seemed to stretch on forever." As He thought back to that moment, He could almost see the field again, it had looked like a sea of flecked gold stretching off into the distance. And the tree, it was tall ancient thing. With many branches and trunks splitting off from the body. "I stood there for a long time, looking out over the field, listening to the river flow by behind Me. It was... peaceful." Harry stopped speaking for a moment, how on earth could He explain what happened next?

"Peaceful?" Said Hermione

"Yeah, yeah it was. Harry answered, "It felt, contented".

"What came Next" Ron asked, eagerly.

"Well," said Harry, bracing Himself, "then I spoke to Death."

"Death, You spoke, with Death" Said Hermione, almost disbelievingly. But as she looked into Harry's eyes, she could that He was telling the truth.

"Ohmygod, You spoke with Death" Hermione sat back heavily in Her chair, Her face going white.

"Well, um, what did He say?" Asked Ron, glancing awkwardly between Harry and Hermione, who still looked rather pale.

"That's the thing," said Harry, "Death didn't really say anything. I mean, not with words".

"What do You mean, not with words?" Asked Hermione, Her brow furrowed, a bit of the color returning to her face.

"I mean, He wasn't using a spoken language to communicate" said Harry, "not a human one, anyway."

"But, what do You mean, I don't understand. How could He speak without saying anything?" said Hermione, now looking thoroughly confused.

"Think of it like this Hermione," began Harry "when I first noticed Death, cause He'd been there the whole time, I just didn't see Him till then. I was rather startled, and more than a bit afraid. But when He spoke, He calmed me. It was like, a soft breeze. The still of the air in fall, the buzz of insects on distant flowers."

Seeing the uncomprehending look on Hermione and Ron's faces, He hurried on.

"Death is a part of Nature, and His voice was like Nature. When He spoke, He captured not only the meaning, but the very essence of what He wanted to say. I don't think there exists any language in the world that can truly comprehend Death's words."

Harry went on,

"When Death spoke, it was like the very idea of whatever He was saying was suddenly inside my head. He didn't actually say anything, but he wanted Me to be calm. And suddenly, I could hear birds singing, and feel an ocean breeze on my face, and smell the mountain air.

We spoke like that for awhile, I would ask Him something, and suddenly I would know. The very nature of the Idea would be revealed to Me and I would understand exactly what death was saying without Him speaking a word."

As Harry said this, He could the looks of discomfort on Ron and Hermione's faces shift slowly to those of awe, and wonder.

"Is that how You knew You could come back?" Asked Ron, "Death, told You?"

"Yes", Harry replied, simply.

"And is that how You knew how to beat Voldemort?" Ron asked further.

"Nope," said Harry, "as matter of fact, We didn't discuss Voldemort at all"

"Why not?" Asked Hermione, astonished.

"Because it wasn't for us to speak of." said Harry.

Seeing the confusion on their faces, Harry Elaborated.

"Think of it this way, time, is not a part of Death's domain. So why on earth would death tell You what is going to happen tomorrow? Or even what happened yesterday for that matter. Time is not in Death's domain, so He doesn't speak of it. Advice on how to defeat Voldemort is not part of Death's domain, so it wasn't part of our conversation."

"So then, what is in Death's domain?" Asked Hermione.

"Life", He answered, simply.

Chuckling at the expressions on their faces, Harry explained, "everyone's life is a story, and in that story, Death is Always the final chapter. Death is the final part of Life before moving on, and so Death is perfectly happy to discuss all that came before Him."

"So, you talked about Life?" Asked Ron.

"My life, specifically" Harry Clarified.

"And what did He say?" Asked Hermione

"That it wasn't over, if I didn't want it to be" Harry Amswered, "then, I came back."

"What, just like that?" Asked Ron, seeming rather surprised.

"Just like that." Harry agreed.

"Huh, I would have thought there'd be more to it." Said Ron.

The three of them lapsed into silence, Harry took a sip of His butterbeer, absently noting that it had gone cold.

"Harry... I have one more question" said Hermione, rather timidly.

"What is it?" Asked Harry.

"What does Death, well, what does He look like?" Asked Hermione.

Ron's eyebrows shot up and He turned to face Harry again, evidently also curious.

"Well," Harry Began, rather slowly, "He doesn't."

"What do you mean?" Asked Hermione

"I mean, well, you know how earlier I said that when I looked at the river I didn't think I was seeing everything? It's something like that. When I looked at Him, I could tell that what I was seeing wasn't really what He looked like. Not only that but, well, Death isn't a person. Death is an idea, a concept, a natural law given life. I don't think there is any body that could truly act as an avatar for Death." Said Harry.

"Well, you saw something. What was it?" Hermione asked curiosity bursting from Her voice.

"I saw, a shroud." Said Harry, "like some sort of barrier concealing what Death really is beyond my comprehension and hiding it behind something like a cloak."

"Hang on," said Ron, "A cloak, like, *The Cloak*?"

Harry smiled

"So wait a moment," said Ron, his eyes widening, "but if... then that must mean... no way."

"'No way what' Ron? What am I missing" asked Hermione, looking confused.

"Hermione," Harry began, "I woke up on the side of a treacherous river, whose shores are made of small smooth stones, on whose banks rests a single ancient tree, and over whom Death stands watch adorned in His cloak which conceals Him from those that look upon Him."

"Blimey mate, you met Death in the same place as the Three Bothers." Exclaimed Ron, unnecessarily.

Hermione's jaw dropped. For a moment she said nothing, and then... "But, where's the bridge? If you really did meet Death in the same place as the Peverell brothers, then where's the bridge they built?" Asked Hermione, looking confused.

"In the Department of Mysteries," said Harry.

"Umm, wot?" Said Ron, intelligently.

"Think about it," said Harry, "the river, the shore, the stones, the tree, the endless field, even the cloak. They all seemed to conceal something more."

"It's a metaphor," Said Hermione, Realization dawning across Her face.

"Exactly" said Harry.

"And then,"Hermione continued, "the river, that would be the barrier between life and death. And so, the bridge would be something that crosses that barrier. Something like, like..."

"Like a doorway directly from life into death.", said Harry.

"Like the Veil in the Department of Mysteries" whispered Hermione, astonishment written plainly across both Her and Ron's faces.

"Right in one" said Harry.

"Wow... I mean... wow," said Ron.

"Yeah," said Hermione.

Seeing as Ron and Hermione hadn't moved for quite awhile, Harry checked the watch that Mr and Mrs Weasley had given Him for His seventeenth birthday and discovered, somewhat to His surprise, that it was nearly six o'clock.

"Come on you two," Harry said, standing up. "You can ponder the mysteries of the universe later, Molly is expecting us for dinner, and we'd better get going if We don't want to be late.

"Yeah," said Ron, shaking Himself out of His stupor in anticipation of His Mother's cooking, "let's get going".

.

As Aberforth watched Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger leave his pub for the fifth Saturday evening in a row, He pondered what it was that they could have been talking about that was so interesting for them not have noticed the giant orange and purple Weasley's Wizarding Wheeze's parade float that had parked itself just outside the pub's newly clean windows. Although, jusldging by the veritable scream of shock that had sounded as soon as Granger had exited the door, it had not stayed undiscovered for very long.

The End

** Nice story, but the He being capitalized feels kinda wrong, I think that's only supposed to be capitalized if you're talking about a deity like Death or God, not when talking about Harry.

*** According to every English professor I've ever had, pronouns get capitalized when referring to a specific person. It does kinda feel weird, but I'm pretty sure that it's supposed to be that way.

**** I'm not sure where your English professors were from, but the only pronoun that needs capitalization when not beginning a sentence is "I".

Maybe you were thinking of "proper nouns", the words for specific, unique things, like people's names.
