** I actually would love a story in which Harry stood by a heavily crippled/disabled/scarred Ginny/Hermione/Luna until the end.

** Penknife's [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/14599][The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]] is locked to AO3 members. Wolfstar with Sirius raising Harry, and Remus as 'Jane.' It's one of my favourite shorter fics.

Or am I missing something?
