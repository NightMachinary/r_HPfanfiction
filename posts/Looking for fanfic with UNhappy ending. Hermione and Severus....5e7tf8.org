Im trying to find the first SS/HG fic I read. I was dumb and new so I didn't save it. It's complete and the writer put in the notes a few times about not being able to pull themselves to write a "happy ending." All I remember is the end; Severus is dying and he whispers Hermione's name with what could be his last breathe, it activates a port-key she gave him (i think it was a ring? I don't recall completely) It's left there for you to decide if he dies or not... please tell me you can help?! I've looked for months!

If you know any others that have unhappy endings, please recommend!

** I remember reading this in another thread about best quotes in fanfiction... gimme a few, I'll look for it.

Edit: i'm a dolt, I was thinking of the thread you posted a couple of days ago- which I clicked on right after I read the most impactful lines in fanfiction thread so they were combined in my head... sorry! It sounds like a really interesting fic :) good luck!
