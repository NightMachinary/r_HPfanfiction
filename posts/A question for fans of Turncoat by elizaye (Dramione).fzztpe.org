So, I've finally decided to read this fic after seeing it on almost every Dramione rec list, I don't even know why I haven't done that by now... And I really like it; the writing, the theme, the characterization. I understand why it is so loved, but there is something about it that is driving me a bit crazy... Is the whole fic written that every scene between Draco and Hermione is seen from both angles, or is that just in the beginning?\\
Because as much as I like this story and really want to read it, it is really tiring to constantly read the same chapter two times with barely any change in them except of the point of view... Thanks!


** It's been a long time since I've read it, but I think yes?

*** I ended up reading it in the end. Their scenes did repeat until the end but it's such a lovely book that I chose to disregard it... ☺️

** I've never read it, but if it is from both POV's, then I would recommend picking one character, either Draco or Hermione, and first read all of the chapters from their perspective, and then if you want to, read the other person's afterwards. But I've never read it, so...
