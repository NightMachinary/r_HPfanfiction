I was browsing the HP Wikia and I stumbled upon a conundrum that puzzles me. It's a somewhat minute thought experiment, but here it goes.

Imagine that two children born into pure-blood families are forced into a marriage contract the moment they are born. Being from pure-blood families means that they themselves are considered pure-bloods. But here's the thing, even though the scenario is highly unlikely, imagine that both children end up being squibs, but the contract is not nullified and they get married. They have a child and that child has magical abilities. But what is the blood status of said child?

According to the Harry Potter wikia: /"Pure-blood individuals are people who have no Muggles or Muggle-borns as parents or grandparents."/ The /"parents OR grandparents"/ line is what disturbs me. Because, if you follow the definition to the letter, if a child has wizarding grandparents, then he IS considered a pure-blood, even if his parents are NOT wizards themselves. That would mean that someone born to two "pure-blood" squibs is a pureblood, even though both parents have no magical affinity. This is, however, highly unlikely and I see no chance of pure-bloods considering such an individual their equal.

Now, let us look at the definitin of a squibs, again from the Harry Potter Wikia. It states: /"Squibs are, in essence, "wizard-born Muggles"... Muggle-born witches and wizards are descended from Squibs who married Muggles: the magical ability unexpectedly resurfaces many generations later"/ The wording of this definition indicates that squibs are in essence the same as muggles, meaning that a squib born individual should be seen as a muggle-born. But nowhere does is directly state that being a squib would automatically mean being muggle-born. A muggle-born is descended from a /squib who married a muggle/. But if two squibs were to marry and have a child, they would not have married a muggle, meaning the child isn't muggle-born per definition.

That means that, according to both definitions, which, I must add, are not mutually exclusive /per se/, a child born to two "pure-blood squibs" would in a way be a muggle-born AND a pure-blood at the same time. This, of course, makes no sense, but I still find it amusing.

But what are your thoughts on the matter? What would such a child's blood status be?

Maybe we need to see a fic with such a premise; it would be interesting to see such a person in Slytherin and how his/her life would play out.

*** While I agree with you about the squibs being pureblood. Technically a grandchild of a halfblood, or a muggleborn could be a pureblood. Halfblood or muggleborn marries another wizard of any blood status. Their child is considered a half blood because of the muggle grandparents, but wizard parents. Their half blood child Marrys a pureblood (or half blood, or a squib). Doesn't matter as long as the new in-law isn't a muggleborn, or a halfblood w/ a muggle parent. Then their grandchild would technically be a pureblood because both their parents and grandparents would be wizards. (Even though they have relatives who are only half bloods/muggle borns). With this method every 3 gen a new pureblood family could theoretically get started. So it's not just what the parents are.

Harry could have married a pureblood, a half blood child of two muggle borns, a half blood child of half bloods, or any combination there in, and his child would be considered a pureblood.

It really makes the whole blood purity thing even dumber, when by their own logic every muggleborn is basically a new pureblood family waiting to happen.

****** that explanation would work IF Lily was HALFBLOOD, but she's muggleborn, she doesn't have magical lineage meaning in blood terms, she's basically a muggle.

One example you could use is Teddy Lupin. Grandmother is pureblood, grandfather is muggle born. both parents are halfbloods and yet Teddy is considered Halfblood. A muggleborn grandparent does not allow for a pureblood child, but a muggleborn great-grandchild does.

**** I agree with your proposal. The question when does a half-blood really turn into a pure-blood is somewhat lacking in the world of JK. I mean, the idea that you only need grandparents to be magical to be a pure-blood is somewhat of a lax set of criteria. That would mean that there would be quite a lot of pure-bloods in the world as we've seen that wizards usually marry amongst themselves. I'd sooner say that at least all great-grandparents should be magical for one to be considered a pure-blood. In the book it's stated quite often that there aren't that many true pure-bloods left.

***** I think people's opinions probably vary within the HP universe. Like, the Malfoys might claim that you're only “truly” pure blood if you've /never/ interbred with a muggle (obviously they would have at some point, but they'd erase all records of it), whereas more centrist-conservatives might say that both sets of grandparents is enough to claim you're pure blood. Centrists would say as long as you're magical and raised in the magical world (aka, both parents magical or you're adopted) then you're pure blood, liberals would say that there's only magical and non-magical and that blood doesn't matter and leftist radicals would say that all those POVs assume that Muggles are inferior which is incorrect. That's my pet theory anyway haha.

I can't remember if it was fanon or canon that pure blood kids had to memorise their family tree lol, but it sounds like something they'd do to “prove their good breeding” or whatever bigots say. It would fit with the canon statement that there aren't many true pure bloods left.

That's kind of the point, though. "True purebloods" are those that like to think themselves superior, like the Malfoys, Lestranges, and Blacks generally tend to do. But I think the books also said the Malfoy line wasn't entirely pure anymore. We see this with the Blacks and their family tapestry where they blast their squibs and those that marry muggles or muggleborns from their family tree. But that's still their blood that continues on in those lines.

There are also people like Umbridge who'll conceal their bloodline and pretend to be pureblooded. Or be connected to an "important" pureblood family. We don't know how much pureblood families bothered to research their prospective partners. For all we know, they do have half-blood or muggleborn ancestors somewhere up the line.

While blood purity is a baseless notion-- nothing more than something wizards and witches can feel superior about--pureblood culture does give them huge advantages. Being seen by the elite, to have influence and be rich, being a "true pureblood" is made to look very desirable. It is also not something you cannot simply /become/.

Most magicals would thus rather claim being pureblood than half-blood. Pureblood is where the power lies, after all. So instead of evening the playing field, they rather claim they're purebloods after 2 generations of magical ancestry. I think that also perfectly explains why some "true pureblood" got irked and wrote The Sacred 28, to remind everyone what a "true pureblood lineage" should be and no matter what they call themselves, they still wouldn't be able to claim that sort of prestige. It's a giant fuck-you from the "true purebloods" so they can still feel superior to those who claim being pureblooded only based on their parents and grandparents.

Though ofc they also didn't include several families that can be considered to be among the "true purebloods" too (like the Potters). Kinda makes you wonder what sort of beef they were having. Or perhaps the author only wrote of the pureblood families that 'they' were related to in the past century or two. Either way, it's besides the point.

Point is, "pureblood" is a social construct within the magical world; it is whatever value they agree to put in it. As there are doubtless more magicals that can claim magical relations to their grandparents and would want to do so, then that becomes the norm.

I also don't agree with JKR's explanation that squibs are wizard-born muggles. After all, we all know Hogwarts has loads of extensive anti Muggle charms on it, but Argus Filch is not at all affected. However, I doubt magical society would be all that considerate. I think most magical children born from squibs would try to claim being pureblooded or half-blooded. They wouldn't be as clueless to the magical world as muggleborns, so they should be able to get by that way. Squibs are a pretty taboo subject in the wizarding world, unless it's used as an insult. I think the lack of defining the blood status of the magical children of squibs is therefore not something purebloods want to consider a possibility. They generally do not want to think of squibs at all, after all, and calculating in that possibility, that perhaps squibs can have magical children goes against pureblood culture. It gives squibs more worth than purebloods want to attribute to them. So it's better to pretend they do not exist.

Edited to add: if I want such a child to claim having squib parents in my fics, I'd probably have them refer to themselves as "Squibleborns", at least for the ones that can't be bothered to care about their blood status.

******* Thank you! I think in general the fandom wants magical blood to make sense as it's made so important in the books and has had a huge impact on the magical world. Bloodlines can be a legitimate factor in plenty of other fantasy works, too, so it wouldn't be all that odd if it did come with certain magical perks. I definitely fell for subconsciously thinking that way many times myself at any rate. But in HP it's a factor of discrimination, not something that has reason to it, as we're constantly reminded of with Hermione's and Lily's successes.

People like to make some universal strict rules for that but society doesn't work like that. And in the end you are a pureblood if you can scam other purebloods into accepting you as one of their own. That is really the only criterium that works.

** If you solely follow the pureblood definition word by word, they wouldn't be a pureblood since they don't have magical grandparents AND parents. And would likely end up considered a closer to a half blood than a muggleborn due to having magical grandparents, and most likely having knowledge of the wizarding world growing up.

But, I think realistically in a society like that, they would be treated by other purebloods as what would be the equivalent of a bastard child but still a pureblood. None of the respect given that most purebloods would get, but a possible back up heir to keep the family going if absolutely necessary. Because how long their bloodline goes back is so important to them that I think they would choose to recognize a squib's child than let the line die.

*** I could see this. I always wondered why the pureblood didn't at least keep track of their squib descendants. I realize the social "blight" if a squib child is produced but they must realize the squibs still carry that "spark" of magic that could be passed on.

**** It's possible a lot of the pureblood families erase squib's from public records but keep track of them privately in case of a threat to the continuation of the bloodline. And for those families who completely cut off squib's and don't track them at all, they probably believe so blindly in magic breeding true that it never occurs to them that their line could die out. Let alone that their inbreeding could be the cause of the death of their line.

  I must add, are not mutually exclusive /per se/, a child born to two "pure-blood squibs" would in a way be a muggle-born AND a pure-blood at the same time.
#+end_quote

This is basically what half-bloods are. And that's what such a child's blood status would be. Half-blooded.

Purebloods are those with both parents and grandparents being purebloods. Muggleborns are those with no magic in their parents and grandparents. Half-bloods are everyone else.

** A pure-blood family that would arrange the marriage of their children only for the children from both families to be squibs but produce a magical child. I think they would still view the child as being pure-blood. A family that would arrange the marriage of their children like this and on the off chance that something like this happened they would consider the two's squib status ailments. If anything if the marriage is still going through that suggests that the marriage is still profitable for each family despite them both being squibs. This is also assuming that the family is wealthy (with the arranged marriage aspect) they'd probably just keep the two out of the public eye to save face. It's been shown that squibs aren't always removed from magical society or forced to leave magical society (the existence of quick spell type products). It seems that some families just have children who choose to live in the muggle world out of convenience +^{(and probably as a way to not constantly be reminded that they don't have magic abilities})+ It's been shown time and time again that to families where blood status is important they can and often will ignore someone's half-blood status and have no problem lying about their own blood status. So i doubt that a family that's gone through this situation would even acknowledge that the parents are squibs BECAUSE they produced a magical child.

** That's not something that we know for sure - blood purity in harry potter can be weird in fanfiction I find (like, am I expected to believe that a family like the Blacks that have been 'always pure' their whole line is going to find a person with muggle ancestry a few generations back equivalently pureblood? )

Additionally, I'm not sure how strong the rule is - I know some people hold with the "all grandparents and parents are magical" rule for purebloods, while I've also seen the "no known muggles in the ancestry" rule. Depending on how we view those, it could affect the status.

However, I think it comes down to this - what are the politics surrounding that child and those families? It'd be on a case by case basis if those families throw their weight around to make them considered pureblood (with good arguments for it, obviously) or if they kick them out into obscurity or something else. Some families would be more willing for one over the other, etc etc.

** I have a problem with the wikia, the line "Squibs are .....Muggle-born witches and wizards are descended from squibs..." is incorrect, they have a source listed and it's a J.K. Talk. in her talk she says

" *J.K. Rowling*: Muggle-borns will have a witch or wizard somewhere on their family tree, in some cases many, many generations back. The gene re-surfaces in some unexpected places."

She didn't say they had a squib somewhere in the tree she said a witch or wizard. I feel like if she meant they had a squib in the tree why wouldn't she have said that?

The real answer to the question depends on how you define magical folk. Do you say wizardkind? If that's the case then yes Squibs are wizards, therefore their bloodstatus is following the traditional way.

** I think it would depend on which definition is being used to define pureblood. in the case that you use the theory that if all 4 grandparents are magical you are pureblood, then this child would be a pureblood. However, since both parents are squibs, there is an argument for the child being a muggleborn, as some people theorise that muggleborn are simply people that many years ago in their lineage had a squib ancestor who passed on the magical gene. In this which the theoretical child should be considered "muggleborn" eventhough this term is not fully the correct description for the situation described. A better term might be something along the lines of s first generation withx or wizard if this is the approach taken in distinguishing blood status.

** What I find interesting about this post is how you say this “disturbs” you. It seems reasonable to me that you could have a pure-blood witch/wizard with squib parents, because the grandparents are likely magical.

More than that, the issue of “pure-blood” seems to be contingent on distance from Muggle blood, rather than just magic, given that the definition includes Muggle-borns as undesirable parentage.

So even if a child comes from pure-blood squibs, it's still “magical” blood, thus pure-blood.

** A squib is still a pureblood. The word indicates an anomaly- a person who is supposed to be magical that is not. A muggle born is a person who should be a muggle who is not. A half blood is someone whose parents are a pureblood and a muggleborn. Either all muggles are descended from squibs or all wizards are descended from a muggleborn. Squib doesn't effect the blood status- just indicates a magical bloodline person with no magic. Pureblood families do have squibs, and yes they are embarrassed about them- Filch. That is why a child isn't sent their Hogwarts letter until they show some magical ability- remember Neville's grandma scarring him so he would because they feared he might be a squib. A squib wouldn't go to Hogwarts even if they were pureblood.

#+begin_quote
  According to the Harry Potter wikia: "Pure-blood individuals are people who have no Muggles or Muggle-borns as parents or grandparents." The "parents OR grandparents" line is what disturbs me. Because, if you follow the definition to the letter, if a child has wizarding grandparents, then he IS considered a pure-blood, even if his parents are NOT wizards themselves.
#+end_quote

No Muggles as grandparents, no Muggles as parents. If either of those conditions are not met, then the child is not a pureblood.

Squibs are Muggles. You say that in the next paragraph, but then seem to ignore it. They're not wizards, they can't do magic, so they're Muggles. They're a special subset of Muggles, but they're Muggles all the same. Ergo, a child of two squibs is not pureblood, as they have Muggles as parents.

The thing about having married a Muggle isn't a definition, it's a description. The definition of Muggleborn is simply "a wizard born of two Muggles." But in either case, as the squibs are Muggle parents and they each married another Muggle, so Muggleborn is the only correct answer for this child

It would be an interesting idea for a fic, sure, but quibbling over blood status would not be the interesting part.

** Assuming the squib children were not disavowed outright upon their magical status being determined, I am going to lean on the idea that the child born of two squibs would likely be considered "Muggle-born".

my reasoning is that, in my reading, I deduce that "blood status" is based as much on magical ability as lineage. If a child of "pure-blood" wizarding status is unable to perform magic, they are not really considered wixen and thus not "counted" and probably "encouraged" to depart for the Muggle world to live out their lives unless they develop a skill or talent wixen deem useful - or to perform necessary manual labour that wixen would consider beneath their dignity (ala Filch). Any child born of two parents from the Muggle world, squibs or not, would likely be considered "Muggle-born" given where they grew up.

that's my input for what it's worth
