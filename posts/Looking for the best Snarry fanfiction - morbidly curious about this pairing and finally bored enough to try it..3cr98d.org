The longer the better. Thank you!


** I have a list. A long one but going down to the better long ones that are actually complete here are 4. Mind you, a lot of ficts worth reading are usually on the snarry centered [[http://walkingtheplank.org/][Walking the Plank]] archive but I learned of a lot of good recs from [[http://painless-j.net/blog/hp-recs/][Painless J]] -who also recs other ships and gen and what have you along with themed lists based on fetishes, tropes or whatever is suggested. Anyway, on with this list from longest to shortest.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/39333][Cambiare Podentes]] - ass long series about Harry tying himself to Snape to take out the jolly old dark lord. Not a lot of sex [at least not in the first book] and a lot of Harry being the lovable snarky stumbling idiot we know from canon. Snape chills out a bit too quickly for my taste in this one but YMMV. The two stories combined are over 600k words.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4241040/chapters/9595593][The Apple Tree]] - overpowered!Harry who is kind of chill and is in a secret relationship with Snape that even Snape doesn't know about. I like the characterization of the rest of the cast and the few OCs aren't annoying little dicks. Warning for the unlabeled rape that walks like a duck, quacks like a duck but is somehow labeled a moose. Nearly 300k words.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/774664/chapters/1455417][In the Red]] - Harry is a bit overpowered in this one as well [yes I have a thing for super Harry, sue me] but he's pretty cool and low key about it. The one who carries this story is Snape who is 50 shades of confused with this cool as a cucumber Potter he is completely unused to. Read it because of the funny snark and situations. About 80k words.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/449382][Yet Here You Stand]] - you want a horrible mutually domestic violence type story where the characters are torn down chapter by chapter? Of course you do! I warn you that the story kind of leaps about in time so it's for the sake of avoiding headaches that you pay attention to the date headings when the pop up in this overtly long one shot. 40k words.

Feel free [this is to anyone] to message me for other recs for snarry.

*** I love super Harry too believe it or not. A question on Apple Tree - the mislabeled rape.... can you explain a bit more of that one? I don't care too much about spoilers because knowing the circumstances in the book and avoiding triggers from to my own past is more important then 'spoiling' a story. I probably won't attempt that one until I get clarification on that scene. Thank you for the recommendations though! The last one looks interesting as well, and the first one might the first fic that I read.

**** Snape's magic acts up when he's pissed off with Harry. He literally goes 'well, fuck you' and his magic pretty much fists harry without lube. This causes serious medical problems later in the story and is described as Harry's sphincter and a good chunk of colon being pretty fucked up. It caused a bit of controversy in the community since it came on with no warning and the writer was hesitant to label it as such. That said, the link I posted was to the AO3 version so maybe she posted the proper labels, idk.

Ignoring that it is a pretty solid story and doesn't romanticizes things but it does kind of gloss over it or rather gets over it pretty damn quickly in my opinion. The ending is a bit drawn out and over-dramatic to me on second read through but again, I have a list of other ficts to read if you can't stand that one in particular.

***** I'm a quarter of the way through the sequel of Cambiare Podentes right now (I read all of the first one yesterday somehow). I'm really enjoying it, but the author has definitely captivated the essence of 'roiling unease' throughout what I've read of the second book. It's... surprisingly accurate in the portrayal of the characters after the ending of the first novel.

Back to the main thought, I will definitely give apples a go now that I have an idea of whats contained within. I appreciate the clarifications more than you know, though.

******* I don't mind reading stories that can be considered triggers, *as long as* the characters react and respond appropriately - Honestly, if the story is well written, I will grieve and feel loss right along with the characters. In a way, I heal while the story heals. But if it ends abruptly, or worse, if the characters don't react or brush off trauma as though it's like putting a new pair of trainers on - that's what really makes me feel like shit. I can't accurately describe it - I hope you understand what exactly I mean. :S

******** Not in the same way but, yeah. I'm not that emotionally invested but there is something frustrating to read something that just spends the whole story tearing a character down without having a proper resolution such as a happy ending or death. I actually dropped a story because the writer said it was just Snape torture porn. So yeah.

That said, I don't mind stories that are a study in breaking a character qas long as there is a reason and it's nuanced enough to not just shrug it off. Someone in that story has to change in some way to make it worth my while.

********* That's a really good point. I like the way you think. Oh, and I got hooked hard on Cambiare Podentes - I just finished reading 605 000 words in two days. Damn those two novels were amazing. I think I spent about 20-22 hours just reading over the last 48. Lol!

********** I really suggest you don't plow through things like that. There is actually not a lot of good long ficts out there, especially for the less popular pairs [though Snarry is like the second biggest ship after Drarry, imo]. Else, you'll wind up like me, talking shit about shit ficts because I have nothing else to read 140 char at a time on twitter. LOL

Now that said, here are a few more ficts. Good but not quite at the same level as previously mentioned.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/424276][Accidentally Bound]] - basically your marriage bond type fict. Harry, our lovely derp, accidentally binds Snape to him while trying to save him from Nagini's bite [this fict is pretty canon, minus Snape surviving] It gets a bit melodramatic near the end and sappy for my tastes but that's Laurenke for ya. 230k words

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/677351][Birth Of A Dancing Star]] - I really hesitate to rec this one because mpreg BUT WAIT COME BACK it is a pretty politics heavy story. Harry isn't supposed to be pregnant and finding out unravels this massive conspiracy that unfolds so beautifully. Draco is quite brilliant in this one as is Neville and Luna and just the whole cast in general. Post epilogue but Snape survives [seems to be a running theme here] 250k words

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/96429][Everybody's Fool]] - Don't let the Evanescence title fool you. This is so fucking good. Harry is in a downward spiral and Snape is having none of it and Draco is 50 shades of lil shit and just everyone is being an asshole yet in a great way and the snarky banter between Snape and Harry and the sex is so hot and...okay I just like this fict and this author and you should read it and all her ficts. 100k

[[http://archiveofourown.org/series/152684][In Between Days]] - going on with the downward spiral Harry theme to close this out, you have to read the In Between Days series. Harry is like hella depressed after Sirius' death and Snape save him in the snapey way he does. Free warning for Dubcon [not rape per se but naughty things happening under obliviates and imperios and yeah] and pretty damn violent sex. Still a must read with a canon yet delicate characterization of Harry and Snape so close to canon yet so much more horrible. 90k

So here is a bit more to read. I have some more on my phone that aren't online anymore [like The Boy Who Lived A Bit series which makes me sad] so pm me if you'd like.

** I would second Cambiare Podentes, it's pretty good and as a guide to its length, well both parts are in Walking the Plank's list of top ten longest fics.

I'd also recommend [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=2042&index=1][No Hiding Place]] and [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewstory.php?sid=799&index=1][A Nick in Time]] (which is itself not super long, but does have a sequel called Growing Pains). And if you go in for series I remember liking the [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=87][Tea series]] and [[http://www.walkingtheplank.org/archive/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][If You Are Prepared]], which had some nice fanart to go with it if I remember rightly.
