How are the Board of Governors for Hogwarts appointed and who appoints them?

I'm writing a fanfiction, and since JK Rowling never gave us this information. I need to make it up.

*How are the members appointed and who appoints them? *Who do you guys think the governors were? *Except appointing and suspending the Headmaster, what other powers do you guys think they have?


** Generally, any kind of Governing Board has two main functions. Setting a direction for the thing they're governing to go, and making sure it stays on course. There are variations, but that's the main idea for Governors, Trustees, Directors, etc. It's called, appropriately, 'Governance'.

Setting a direction covers stuff like future investment, any changes they wanna make to the organisation, new opportunities to look into, anything they wanna keep doing and double down on, determining policies and practices, etc. It's literally "What do we want to try and do for the next X years?" and it covers everything a school might do. Whatever it is, they have the power to say 'this is what you should do in the future' about it. Whether they do or not is up to the staff themselves, and that's where the checking up bit comes in.

Making sure it stays on course is basically providing someone for the Management Staff that's making decisions (Dumbledore and McG at Hogwarts) to be accountable to, someone that doesn't have a direct interest in the thing and so (supposedly) is less prone to the bias and corruption that comes with having the power to approve or disapprove your own decisions.

Headmaster Dumbledore: I wanna bring the Philosophers Stone to Hogwarts!

Governor Dumbledore: That's a great plan, Big D. I say yes!

I'm sure the issue with having that power is obvious. :D

That does also mean that they'd see virtually everything about the school during their assessment period. There's not much of a concept of Confidentiality at the Board level, since they have to see stuff to evaluate whether it's sticking to the set-direction or not.

In terms of appointment, they're generally elected (group votes) or appointed (Successor, I choose you!). Different governors can be elected by different groups, so you might have one voted in by students, one voted in by staff, one voted in by Dumbledore, one voted in by the Ministry, etc. or they might all be voted in by the Wizengamot, or the Board themselves. Or they could just have to confirm and approve individual nominated successors.

"This guy has said that guy should replace him, do we agree? We do?! Cool. Welcome, Guy B, you in da club now."

In a good board, the members're generally picked to get a range of skills and backgrounds for the Board to draw on when making decisions or checking stuff out (but as with any group politics does play a part, so it's quite understandable that the majority of the board would be crusty Purebloods). So, you might have someone who knows a lot about Arithmancy and Ancient Runes, so that when they review those courses, they can speak with some authority on what improvements might need to be made.

This tends to lead to certain amounts of delegation of tasks - Arithmancy policy might be determined by the Arithmancer on the board, potions by the potioneer, etc - but that's not always the case. They'll usually end up discussing it as a group regardless to get final approvals and such, but the individual policy would be suggested by the appropriate member.

They also might have the ability to review certain opportunities when they come up - particularly those that might impact the school as a whole or even just house-wide. So, if Malfoy had wanted to buy the Slytherin Team brooms, he might've had to run that by the board, so they could approve the school taking the 'gift' and any conditions attached (to see if it matches their school plan and reputation, basically). He could've also bribed them all to accept it regardless, but the presentation of the opportunity would still be a barrier to hurdle.

One thing they usually don't have authority on is making decisions on the day-to-day running of the thing (Operational Decisions). So, if the students decided they wanted regular Yule Balls, they'd go to the Senior Staff and not the Board of Governors. They might have that power if you wanna write it that way, but that does also still fall into the "Dumbledore plan? Dumbledore Yes!" issue I mentioned a few paragraphs back. :D

I've been involved in this sort of thing at a school and charity level, so feel free to ask and I'll do my best to help. :)

** Could they be volunteers? I doubt it is a paid post. Maybe they have to volunteer and then voted on by the current board, or have a sponsor currently on the board or teaching?

Perhaps the Board has financial power? Maybe they set the budgets for each subject and/or can award grants for things? That could be fun if you have the teachers competing for limited funding!

Maybe they have to approve all staff appointments? (Not sure how Lupin got through in the case, but it's a nice idea!)

I think the "real" equivalent in British schools also do fundraisers, and attend meetings about Grade Point Averages

Could they be an equivalent of OFSTED and do inspections?

I always got the impression that in canon, the Board didn't do much apart from nod along with all of Dumbledore's decisions (with the exception of Lucius, of course!) So maybe you would have a more "hands-on" Board instead?

Good luck with the writing!

** What I wrote for the notes to my current project:

#+begin_quote
  It is said that the Hogwarts Board of Governors was created by the last of the Founders, Helga Hufflepuff, to lend assistance in her twilight years and (perhaps remembering Salazar Slytherin and fearing that another like him might one day arise) to act as a check against the power of her successors. It has also been speculated that she wanted to replicate something of the sharing of authority that existed from the founding of Hogwarts down to the death of Godric Gryffindor (which left Hufflepuff the sole remaining Founder).

  The Board's twelve members were handpicked by Hufflepuff, and each appointed their own successor. In practice this has led to the seats largely being inherited along family lines. Where there is no heir, the Headmaster was responsible for choosing a new member (allowing the Board to both expel members and appoint new ones would clearly lead to abuses of power), but this power was given to the Wizards' Council during the creation of the latter, in exchange for a seat.

  The positions of “Headmaster” and “School governor,” like the institution of Houses, have much to do with the British education system, but most muggleborns get the relationship completely wrong. It isn't muggle schools which inspired Hogwarts, as a quick look at any timeline would make clear, but Hogwarts which (via muggleborn and half-blood students who maintained a connection to the muggle world) inspired certain qualities of muggle British schools.

** Many such boards are self-perpetuating: i.e., members of the Board select next member of the Board.

** We know that Malfoy was on the board until the end of the 92/93 year, and that he was able to coerce the other board members. So presumably they were either rather weak in order for Lucius to coerce them without the Death Eater routine (can't do that if you pretend that you only have been under the Imperius) or that they were usually associated with the pureblood side and that's how Lucius got dirt on them.

And unlike in many fanfics, Augusta Longbottom is not a member.

** Normal British schools have a Board of Governors, so I imagine it doesn't differ greatly from that. Maybe you could research the role of muggle governors to get inspiration?

** From what I recall in canon: all we know is Lucius Malfoy was a member while his son was in school. He threatened the other members. He was subsequently fired. Importantly-- this sacking had no impact at all whatsoever on his standing with the Minister.

While Albus Dumbledore is headmaster, I honestly don't think the board is able to do much without a unanimous vote which temporarily got Dumbledore out of office. They don't seem to hold much sway over the professors hired, students admitted, or curriculum taught. I would imagine its mostly a formality. People in power get a pat on the back for being admitted. Lucius, who cares for almost nothing aside from his family, was likely a relatively new member. But Dumbledore appoints anyone he wishes to professorships-- a half giant with a third year education, a centaur, a werewolf. The governors have little control over the school.

In my own imagining, the role is given to those who seek it-- over-involved parents like Lucius, perhaps. There may be a House of Lords hereditary aspect as well. It's clearly not a lifelong post if Lucius can get sacked so easily. Lucius Malfoy seems the type of wizard who asks and immediately receives, so if he wanted a role in Draco's schooling, this was the way to get it. It never comes up again though, so it's only relevant when someone is pushy. Even during Umbridge's regime, I don't recall anything about the governors, so they may only have a significant presence when't there's a significant person on the board.

Edit: just pulled out CoS to check, and Lucius says that the appointment or suspension of headmasters is something the governors are in charge of. Do we think they all voted for Snape? Probably a Ministry offshoot-- they're definitely all corrupt.
