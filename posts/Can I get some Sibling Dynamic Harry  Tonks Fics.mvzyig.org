  Seeing as he's her closest living relative who isn't her mother, a Malfoy, or a prisoner of Azkaban, seventh-year student Nymphadora Tonks takes first-year student Harry Potter under her wing.

** Sibling dynamic between those two is the only dynamic I want, but I have honestly never seen it in a fic. It's always â€˜look, underage child! I, an adult and a cop can make my boobs grow at will!'

*** I didn't link it because it has an underage sex scene in it like thirty chapters in between an underaged Character and a grown woman

***** Didn't expect someone to demand a link for it -shrug- being told to take a fic give a fic is a new thing for me and it's not a rule. I normally do link Fics I mention but it's 2am and again the fic has underage sex in it so in my mind I'm not gonna link it

****** It is certainly is not a rule, I just thought that it is a plain politeness. And yes, the underage sex thing would be lovely if mentioned. And yes, I understand 2 am thing.

  Harry Potter's life was not a very good one, but then one day that all changed, one day he found a snake in his cupboard. Slytherin Harry, dark/grey. There will be bashing. HarryxDaphne (pairing could change in the future).
