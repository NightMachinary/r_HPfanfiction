** Well, this starts after Sirius dies but otherwise iirc it fits what your asking for - it's been awhile but I remember enjoying reading linkffn(Lord of Caer Azkaban)

  A letter causes Harry to learn some surprising things about his lineage, a different twist on the usual Harry in Azkaban story line.

*** I hate when an author tells you the pairing is going to be a surprise. There are just pairings that I don't enjoy, is it too much to ask to know about the pairing beforehand so I don't waste my time? FFS.

**** If you're interested, the only pairing so far is Daphne/Harry--starts around the Yule Ball 4th year, then they break up and go back to being friends by the next summer. The author confirmed that Harry is straight, although other characters may end up in m/m or f/f pairings. Romance is a very minor part of the story, I wouldn't be surprised if Harry doesn't end up paired with anyone by the end.

***** Sorry I didn't mean to preach at you. I just saw it listed as "it's a surprise" and flipped out. I can put up with a lot of things but not knowing the pairing bothers me like nothing else.
