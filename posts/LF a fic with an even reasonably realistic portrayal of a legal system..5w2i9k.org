** I dunno - the Wizarding World is in the shape it's in BECAUSE the legal system is corrupt and incapable. You can't have Malfoy and company bribing their way through life if they had been convicted a decade earlier.

*** I don't know, any "and that's why it's impossible to convict anyone" legal theory just comes off too much like a crank to be believable. Proving no one can go to jail is the legal version of [[http://www.snopes.com/science/bumblebees.asp]["scientists prove bees (which /can/ fly) can't fly"]].

**** Eh, I don't think the two are really analogous - the bees thing has to do more with using the wrong model to attempt to explain a process, and it's not like it's impossible to convict at all, the "with eye-witness testimony alone" bit is pretty crucial. plus, even here in the meatspace world without magic, eye-witness testimony on its own is not usually enough for a criminal conviction.

** linkffn(The Malfoy Case) I don't have much knowledge of the legal system so I can't say for certain just how accurate the legal proceedings are in this fic, but it did seem realistic to me. Great portrayal of Draco as well.

** Linkffn(Lily Potter and the Third Realm) is a fairly new fanfiction that's still in progress. You have to read the Albus Potter series to understand what's going on but it's really well written. Lily is a lawyer and you get to see her in action during a hearing.

  Lily Luna Potter is one of the magical world's most prominent legal experts. As a student of law, she learned the right thing is not just hard to do, but hard to identify. When laws both magical and Muggle are brought into question, she'll have to figure it out fast. *Sequel to the Albus Potter series on this profile. Reading it first is not necessary but very highly recommended.*

** Linkao3(seven names) Hermione is exiled from the wizarding world after she refuses to name people who committed war crimes to a special post-war tribunal. 73 years later she returns. Flashbacks to the tribunals throughout the fic. Very grim fic about justice, law, and reparations.

Yeah, and that's in the actual books.

Seriously, the most cringe-inducing legal scenes in various fics are hardly worse than JK's efforts.

I mean, Karkaroff is interrogated by a court instead of by proper investigators. The time for Harry's hearing for underage magic use is changed - brought forward no less - without him being notified. The implication being that he would have been found guilty in absentia, another batshit-insane idea. No investigation was done, just a letter sent that informed him that he was guilty and what his punishment was, which was then overruled by one person. No legal representation is provided for him either. The legislative and judiciary bodies have individuals in both, meaning that the same people making the laws are the people prosecuting lawbreakers - something that doesn't happen anywhere in the world that isn't a totalitarian shithole. And that's not even touching on the fact that at least two people were sent to Azkaban without trial.

** Actually, the legal system in Harry Potter is quite similar to the legal system in Britain. It's run more on emotion than facts, and doesn't really use anything to hold its side of the argument.
