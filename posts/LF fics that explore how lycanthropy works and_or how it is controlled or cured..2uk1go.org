** I really like the werewolves in Prince of a Dark Kingdom. I think they make an appearance somewhere around book 2.

**** A few things that stood out to me were:

-An emphasis on the whole idea of a 'pack'. Due to the circumstances of the story, werewolves have all been relocated to reserves. This allows them to sort of create a culture of their own. They have a hunter/gatherer mindset that I think fits really well with the whole wolf thing.

-They actually turn into wolves when they transform, none of this wolf/human/beast/awesome hybrid thing. And those transformations are exclusively tied to the moon. Those infected have absolutely no control over when they change.

-Lycanthropy is a sort of disease that can be passed to someone without giving them the full blown condition. Drinking from the same cup, sharing food, or getting some of their blood in an open wound can result in the victim manifesting some rather wolf like properties without actually undergoing the change.

-The world building in this story favors a very mythological view of magic, and the werewolves are very well tied into that.

-As far as physiology goes, werewolves are a little stronger and faster, probably due to the magic that runs through their bodies. They do have very real weaknesses though, and are generally thought of as inferior to wizards. Wizards who are turned retain their ability to use magic, but the majority of the werewolves appear to have been muggles, or have been taken before they received a wand and are therefor not able to use magic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305052/1/Against-the-Moon][Against the Moon]] is probably my favorite Marauder/Remus Lupin story. I literally could not put it down for a week. It doesn't really discuss IN DEPTH about the history of lycanthropy or anything, but it does go in depth about its effect on young Remus and his life. It really tugs on your heartstrings.

** It seems like lycanthropy only shows up as a means for the author to show how brilliant Hermione is. Because she can definitely cure it as an extra credit project in her fifth year. Hopefully someone has come across a fic with a good description of it.

**** Werewolves are so feared in that society that you would think someone would pick up on Lupin's secret. Especially with Snape handing out hints! The only way I can explain it is that no one could even imagine hiring a werewolf to teach kids.

***** Well one of the ideas floating around my head was that Ron should be the one to figure it out, not Hermione, as he's pureblood and comes from a well rounded pureblood family so you think he would be given some sort of knowledge on how to recognize werewolves right? Then add in Snapes lesson, well lets be honest here. A bunch of thirteen year olds would instantly begin teasing and comparing each other about the various signs (the finger length for instance), and eventually they would jokingly spread rumors about the teachers, which would rapidly become a realization that yeah Professor Lupin is totally a werewolf.

But then again JKR wrote the entire society as dumber than a box of rocks so I would wind up rewriting the whole story in order to give them enough logic to figure it out. meh.

****** If /Ron/ of all people can figure it out, then pretty much /all/ of the other students should be able to. Or at least all the Ravenclaws should, and probably most of the Slytherins. Probably a good many of the Hufflepuffs would know too, especially since it probably only takes one to figure it out before the rest know.

**** Theres actually a really good 'Hermione cures lycanthropy' fic that I've read. It's not the main focus of the story though, its mainly a (very long!) Hermione/Snape romance, although the lycanthropy storyline does run throughout the book and the author is very detailed about it all. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4776976/1/The-Problem-with-Purity][The Problem With Purity.]]

Basically Hermione's in her 7th year - She works off Snape's wolfsbane potion, which she argues only suppresses the 'wolf' aspect of the werewolf at the full moon, and instead creates a potion which suppresses the 'were' aspect. It involves making the werewolves become wolf animagi.

Chapters 19 to 22 are worth reading if you don't want to read the rest, thats where the majority of the explanation is.

** In the Sacrifices Arc series it's like this conscious virus that weaves a web in your brain. Like a monster living inside you that is essentially you. Anyways, so it's always there, raging inside you and then the closer to the full moon you are it's more and more pronounced, getting stronger and then during the full moon it takes over and turns you into the hateful monster that just wants to tear things apart including yourself.

I'm probably not explaining this very well, it's explained through out all eight fics, but I really liked how it was thought out. The author was incredibly detailed.

The first one is Saving Connor. They're a good read IMO. It starts off like it's another all powerful Harry, but as the story develops you realize it's not like that. Yes Harry is powerful, but he's extremely messed up and his powers do have a lot of constriction.

** There's a Drarry fic called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2693312/chapters/6026747][The Light More Beautiful]] that deals with lycanthropy by having "suppressants" that prevent the werewolf from transforming. There are still effects such as illness around the full moon, heightened senses, and such. If you're OK reading slash I'd really recommend reading this - it's a beautiful story.

** The [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9469064/1/Innocent][Innocent]], Initiate, Identity trilogy has some serious stuff about Werewolf society and culture and mentality as a decently large subplot. I think it mostly comes out in the second and third books though.

[[http://www.mediageek.ca/arsenicjade/writing/comcall.html][Care of Magical Creatures]] also has some stuff on werewolves and their physical characteristics and how their lives are affected
