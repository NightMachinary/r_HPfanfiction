Over the holidays following the close of his fifth year at Hogwarts, James Potter vanishes. Everyone fears the worst until one day, just before the start of 6th year, he suddenly appears again. Everything seems normal, except for his vivid green eyes.

That's right. Harry takes his father's place in the time stream. Gone is the brash youth, replaced by Harry Potter, fresh from winning the war in his own time. Trying to find out what happened to the real James Potter, Harry elects to take his fathers place, at least while he figures out how to get home.

The Marauders: suspicious. Snape: Hateful. The staff: Grateful for the sudden onset of maturity. Harry can deal with all that. It's all manageable save for one thing. Lily Evan's finds this new James Potter /absolutely/ fascinating.


** By the time Harry gets home, he's already done half of James' work for him and seduced Lily, /completely by accident/.

******** The character she plays is not confirmed to be either Korean or Indonesian. Nagini is a Maledictus meaning she was blood cursed to be a snake. Since she was turned into a naga we could argue that she is of Indonesian descent but we don't know how far back that is because of possible interracial marriage that could have happened. (We know that international travel was possible around the 1600s because that is around the time Ilvermorny was founded by an Irish witch) So it's completely plausible that although she might have Indonesian descent she could consider herself fully Korean anyway. But being this was magic and international travel might have been easier when her family line was first cursed. It is possible that an Indonesian witch or maybe someone who studied Indonesian magic place a curse inspired by Hindu, Buddhist, and Jainist mythology. We also don't know at what point the curse was cast upon her family.

******* *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal%20loop][Causal loop]]*

A causal loop is a theoretical proposition in which, by means of either retrocausality or time travel, a sequence of events (actions, information, objects, people) is among the causes of another event, which is in turn among the causes of the first-mentioned event. Such causally looped events then exist in spacetime, but their origin cannot be determined. A hypothetical example of a causality loop is given of a billiard ball striking its past self: the billiard ball moves in a path towards a time machine, and the future self of the billiard ball emerges from the time machine before its past self enters it, giving its past self a glancing blow, altering the past ball's path and causing it to enter the time machine at an angle that would cause its future self to strike its past self the very glancing blow that altered its path. In this sequence of events, the change in the ball's path is its own cause, which might appear paradoxical.

**** Well, no since it's an issue. Also she answered that the intent is for Harry to leave the past to James before anything happens.

It can be quite plotty.

Harry has to find out what happened to James, and make him return.

Harry has to find out how to return to his own time. Or he already knows and there's a time constrain in his mission, which can be fun to write to.

Harry has to avoid having to turn into prongs, or find excuse he can't, or learn ASAP how to transfigure into Prongs, with the same marking as his dad.

Harry has to avoid Lily, but if he hoped to be born someday, he also have to find the balance to NOT disgust Lily from James. He needs to find a balance, here.

Harry also need to act as James. Learn lot of details about the Potter family and James himself that he doesn't know that James would. Like Harry's grandparents birthdays, what they do for a living, but also things like what James actually likes or hate as food. Imagine, James always gave all his tomatoes to Remus, because James can't stand the taste. And suddently, he eat it with gusto. WTF?? It can be a way to underline how much Harry actually doesn't know about his father and his family.

  It can be a way to underline how much Harry actually doesn't know about his father and his family
#+end_quote

Not only about his family but also about Sirius and Remus. I mean, yeah, they were there for him a little bit. But all in all Harry had known Remus for one year as a teacher, then Remus disappeared again and then Harry met him for two summers and two christmas holidays. Sirius wrote Harry and he met him during fourth year trice, but other than that he only had one summer and one christmas with him.

****** Very true.

And even worse Peter. Because he actually knows nothing substantial about Peter.

Which is another source of conflict to write about. Harry have to act very friendly with Peter Pettigrow, knowing that kind of evil bastard he is.

I would find it even more interesting when Peter wasn't an evil bastard in this fanfiction. When Peter was this geniuly nice guy who remembers him a little bit of Neville. A guy who just makes a wrong decision when being afraid some years in the future, but generally a good friend, a good guy - a guy who Harry starts liking. And he can't do anything to save him from his fate because Pettigrew was the only reason Harry was in a situation to defeat Voldemort and saving Peter, his Parents, Sirius and Remus would mean his victory was for nought.

******** Could he let go of his resentment for Pettigrow enough to like him as genuine good friend he still is?

That is an internal conflict worthy to explore.

Or even, "James" obvious ambivalence toward Peter in 6th year is the very reason why he betrayed, in the end.

(even if Harry tries to hide it, it shows in subtle ways that he doesn't like Peter, at least at first. Peter might not even pick up on it consciously. But it might be the very first start of the beginning of the end).

As well as not intervening in any way, no saying anything that would save his family.

As for "not knowing anything about my best firends and my family", I guess "James" could explain it by saying that while his disappearance and kidnapping etc, he got hit by a mean memory charms that wasn't well-executed, that's why what he forgot and what he remembered is inconsistant.

But Harry's internal conflict toward those situations, and that would show in his behavior at times can't be explain away.

********* Also having parents. That would be... something. "James" would suddenly be distant with the Potters Sr. and wouldn't be able to explain why other than "I'm a teenager. Isn't this what teenagers do?" He would also probably need to fake a hand injury for long enough to learn how to forge his "own" handwriting.

********** Head injuries can be severe to the point where they completely change a person's personality.

"James" suddenly being completely different after a severe "head injury" is easily explained, even with magic.

it could also cause some tension, too: if Lily falls for this "New James" and "James" is pretty uninterested in Lily, Sirius and his friends can turn on her because she hasn't fallen in love with "James" as he was before his injury.

Pettigrew being alienated and becoming a traitor because of this "injury" would work, too.
