What are the best apocalypse fics? Anything that involves events that could end society/the planet as the Rowling-Magical Peeps know it, basically. Zombies, natural disasters brought on by spells or rituals, magic declining and them all becoming muggles, extra-planetary/dimensional invasion, splintering of reality, etc.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome.


** In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6888519/1/][Sole Survivor]] a plague wipes out the muggle population of Great Britain when Harry is only ten years old. Harry is left to fend for himself and eventually learns that he is being hunted by several factions. Unfortunately it's just a oneshot, though I wish that the author had made it into a complete story.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10390769/1/][Desiccated]] (a oneshot crossover with the Dishonored universe) Harry reveals that the world was broken by a cataclysm set off in a war between wizardkind and the technologically advanced muggle population.

If you read far enough into [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10313612/][The Traveler]] you'll eventually see clues that the seemingly fairy-tale inspired alternate universe is actually a post-apocalyptic world. The backstory seems to be that the "gentry" and other fantastical beings were originally techno-magical constructs that gained sentience and banded together to wipe out their creators.

  Sequel to 'To Play the Devil'. Harry and Tom left our world behind and found themselves in a world filled with the night-time fears of mankind. The washerwomen guard the fords; reapers walk the noon-day fields, and the Gentry are riding. Worst of all, Death himself has taken an interest in them, and he has a plan. Enter a land of fairies, enchantment and fear.

  A plague has swept across Britain, wiping out the Muggle population. Ignorant of his heritage and the magical world, a ten year-old Harry Potter is left to fend for himself against two factions, each plotting and conspiring to find him before the other.

  The worst thing you can do in Dunwall, is magic. Harry does it anyway. A fragmented MoD one-shot that might one day grow up to be a proper story.

That does look interesting, you're right. Don't know if I'd define it as an apocalypse from the Summary and the first chapter yet, but that'll come later, I expect. :)

  Dumbledore's dead. On the train ride home, cars are at a standstill, the electricity is out, fires burn unchecked from Scotland to London, and chaos reigns in muggle Britain. Somehow Harry has to survive this new world while destroying Voldemort.

  The war is ended , and the world along with it. It wasn't the dark in the end , nor the light.It was the muggles , and their cure for magic. How can they learn how to survive in a world where they are hunted for what they are.(Post HBP , goes wildly off canon from there , character deaths , ZOMBIES and post apocalyptic / Dystopian world)
