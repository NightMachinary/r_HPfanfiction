** I cannot for the life of me remember the name of it, but I read a story from Lavender's POV where everything she did with Ron was her elaborate way of setting Ron and Hermione up. It totally changed the way I look at her, especially as I'm currently rereading HBP. It was wonderful, and if you use HPFF, I encourage to look around for it.
