:END:
Ages ago I read a HP fanfic and I can't find it. Hope someone can help. It was a dark Harry fanfiction in which he was fairly possessive over Draco. Scenes I can remember- Harry nearly kills the Dursley's but Draco talks him out of it. Harry forces Draco to sit at the Gryffindor table. Harry hurts Ron when he's rude to/about Draco. Harry actively kills death eaters. Towards the end Harry is speaking to aurors (I think) and getting frustrated at having to continue to talk to them and Draco calms him down. I think Harry might kill Voldemort in this but I'm not 100% sure. Also at some point Harry takes Draco's wand and he has to walk up to him and ask for it back or something.
