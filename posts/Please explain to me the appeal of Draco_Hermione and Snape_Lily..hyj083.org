These are probably the two most popular pairings in the fandom, and I honest to god never understood why. Draco is essentially a magical Hitler Youth, and Snape is a grown man in a position of power who verbally abuses children.

So please explain to me how could people genuinely think that Hermione or Lily would ever get together with either one?

** Two main points. Redemption and Empathy. A lot of authors can looks at Snape and Draco's characters, their actions, their motivations, their desires, their pasts, and see more there and Rowling wrote.

What does a childhood with Lucius Malfoy for a father look like? Just how bad were things with a drunk and abusive Tobias Snape for a father and a broken Eileen Prince for a mother? People are the result of their environments, the things that build them up or break them down, the choices they make to survive, and the ways those choices change them.

Yeah Canon Snape was an unrequited asshole who bullied children, obsessed over a dead woman, and never really regretted his actions for what they were rather than how they hurt him personally. But at the same time canon Severus was an 11 year old boy with an abusive muggle father, isolated from his one friend in a racist echo chamber with people that fed him the praise he had been starved of. He makes sense, and he didn't have to turn out the way he did. If Eileen had left Tobias, if Snape had been sorted into Ravenclaw, if he and Lily were in the same house, if he had a positive role model outside of Slytherin, if he just tried a littler harder. If any of those things happened, he wouldn't have been the way he was. That's the Snape that most Snape/Lily fics are written about.

Similarly for Draco. People like redemption, especially for someone who is a freaking child. Draco grew up without ever even meeting a muggle and hardly ever associating with muggleborn. All while being fed a narrative of bigotry during his formative years. Even when he got what he had thought he wanted and became a Death Eater, it wasn't what he wanted. It was punishment for Lucius's failures, it was a threat against his mother's life. It was bad and it broke him. Draco as a character has far more to offer than Magical Hitler Youth, and canon did him dirty by not giving him a real chance to make that up. Hermione/Draco fics work best for Draco's that start reforming earlier in life, or as redemption fics later.

‚Äã

All of that being said. There are still plenty of Snape/Lily and Draco/Hermione where none of that is addressed and those have issues.

** Draco was raised to be Hitler youth, and didn't question his assigned role as a child, but clearly had qualms about it as he matured. He didn't kill Dumbledore, and didn't confirm the trio's identity at Malfoy Manor, so he's not totally evil. It's believable that he could continue breaking free of his parent's' expectations, and eventually become a good guy, even to the point where he'd consider a muggleborn as a partner. His development over time makes him an interesting character.

*** Plus, frankly if Snape can turn out to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù (heavy on the quote marks there) despite being a fully signed up adult Death Eater I think it's a little rich that Draco was less deserving of a redemption arc. I would see Snape as worse than Draco tbh. That doesn't necessarily justify Draco, but I agree that he's not totally evil, although obviously he should be actually repentant as opposed to it just all somehow being suddenly fine.

** Well, at first I would only ship Hermione with Harry. 2001 was the First time I read Harry Potter, I was 8yo. I grow up re-reading the books constantly. At the University I had to stop and actually read other stuff. But the fact is that the first time I read Harry Potter ad a adult changed my point of view about nearly all characters. No one in the world is only good or only bad. Our environment has a huge impact in our decisions, so does people who surround us. Draco is a character that never got the chance of redemption. He is complex, but not important enough to most of the readers to give him the chance of doubt. He is judged from beginning to end by things he did when he was a child/teenager, or and the pressure to save his parents. I believe what I like about Draco/Hermione fanfictions is the fact that they give him a chance to grow up, to redeem and to be a better person. The fact that he is paired up with Hermione shows that even the fact that he grow up in an extremely racist family doesn't stop him from questioning and eventually have the courage to go against it. They were both "forcedlly" marked on their arms to remind them forever about "who they are" (death water x mud blood).

I never support fanfictions where Draco doesn't evolve and his relationship with Hermione is abusive and toxic, but I love the fact that Draco Malfoy has a chance of redemption and development that he didn't have throughout the books!

That's it üòä sorry if my writing is not really good, English is not my first or second language, so I always feel a little insecure!

** Draco: There is some powerful romantic archetype among teenage girls how pure and innocent girl leads evil and black man to his redemption (see ‚ÄúJane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´‚Äù for better example). Plus, yes, it doesn't hurt that Tom Felton is apparently considered a handsome guy.

Snape: with anything concerning Snape (including Snamione, which is also disturbingly popular), there is always the explanation which consists of two words: Alan Rickman. Apparently most teenage girls who saw the films fell in love with him, and it they projected themselves to Hermione falling in love with him (thus Snamione) or in their pity for his poor poor life (of his own making, I would add) they wanted to fix it for him and thus Snily.

All these ships are in my opinion complete nonsense (except Snape going to the pre-Marauder times, that it makes at least plausible, see linkao3(18697885) or linkffn(9552519).

One more note about Alan Rickman. There is a lot of discussion about film!Ron v book!Ron or book!Hermione v film!Hermione. Have you noticed that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film][the production for the film started in 2000, and the film was released in November 2001]])? That means JKR saw Alan Rickman as Snape while she was writing the Order of Phoenix (released June 2003), and so I have my suspicion that book!Snape there (but especially in HBP) actually WAS the film!Snape instead.

*** I agree that Peggy Sue is a decent way to make Severus/Lily plausible, but I gave up on Art of War pretty quickly. Lily and Severus hanging out to swear and smoke stolen cigarettes just didn't seem in character, and it felt like Severus was able to relax and laugh and generally be a teenager surprisingly quickly for someone who had been through everything he did. Having his mother be deaf is an interesting twist, though, and her supportiveness was sweet.

The Peace Not Promised felt more in character to me. It's kind of angst-heavy, and he's quite serious, but at the same time, it's hopeful. Severus has to go through a lot, but it works out and he's happier than he ever was in his first life. Or maybe I just like it better because it doesn't have much strong language :D.

Which Severus/Lily Peggy Sue fics have you read? I've come across one that I really liked, one that impressed me with its writing quality but was a bit grim and not so much to my taste, and one where I gave up after a chapter or two because the characterisation just seemed off.

I do think that something substantial needs to change about Snape's character - like a Peggy Sue premise giving him decades more experience and maturity - to make Severus/Lily workable. He would never be a barrel of laughs as a husband, but he would be hardworking, intelligent, brave, and unshakably loyal; that should count for something.

His devotion to Lily's memory in canon may seem on the face of it to be creepy, but if you stop and think about it, it couldn't have been obsession in the usual sense, because there was nothing left for him to be selfish about. Lily was beyond his reach, and he took no joy in her son's company, yet he still kept to his promises and tried to protect what was left of her because he believed her to be a wonderful person who should not be entirely lost to the world. And perhaps to avenge her death upon the monster responsible, which may be a somewhat dark goal but is hardly beyond the pale.

** I suppose the appeal of Severus/Lily is that people see the unhappiness, even tragedy, in Snape's life, and wish for it to be fixed, in the same way that they might wish for Romeo and Juliet to live happily ever after, or Remus and Tonks and Fred to survive the Battle of Hogwarts.

Certainly there are substantial obstacles in the way of Lily and Severus actually having a healthy and happy friendship, let alone a romantic relationship, but I think a sufficiently talented author can rise to that challenge.

** Draco/Hermione falls into the enemies to lover trope. Or the "pigtail puller/I'm mean to you because I secretly like you" trope. Also a lot of people love Tom Felton (myself included) and Hermione (or any MC female in any fandom) is usually used as an OC/self projection of the author in fics (esp older fics) so she got shipped with him a lot. It's basically the same appeal of Draco/Harry, but straight and also keeps Harry free if you ship him with someone else (like Ron, Ginny, ect. ect)

Snape/Lily falls into the childhood friends trope. Or the "I can fix you/all you need is love to fix everything" trope. I usually see it in Snape AU fics that take place during Hogwarts/before he joined the DEs. Snape, no matter what you think of him, is a complex character with a lot of flaws and that makes him very interesting to write about in any scenario.

But generally comes down to: fandom gonna fandom.

so im assuming by "favorites" he could be beaten by a couple other students too. but there is no denying that he was, at the very least, pretty smart and good at magic.

***** He also struggled to perform a Levitation Charm (a first year spell) during his Charms OWL.

  His Levitation Charm was certainly much better than Malfoy's had been

As for him being second best in school behind Hermione, that is nowhere near explicitly canon.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄòThough if his school marks don't pick up,' said Mr Malfoy, more coldly still, ‚Äòthat may indeed be all he is fit for.'

  ‚ÄòIt's not my fault,' retorted Draco. ‚ÄòThe teachers all have favourites, that Hermione Granger --'

  ‚ÄòI would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,' snapped Mr Malfoy.
#+end_quote

Second behind Hermione who managed to get 112% in an exam is not marks that need picking up. Yes, Lucius Malfoy would still make that second comment about Hermione beating him in every exam, but that doesn't account for the first comment. Also 'the teachers /all/ have favourites' implies that there are other students who are the teacher's favourites as well as Hermione. Lucius cuts him off before he can mention any others.

There is also this from slightly earlier in the scene.

#+begin_quote
  ‚ÄòWhat's the good of that if I'm not in the house team?' said Malfoy, looking sulky and bad-tempered. ‚ÄòHarry Potter got a Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dumbledore so he could play for Gryffindor. He's not even that good, it's just because he's famous ... famous for having a stupid scar on his forehead ...'

  Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls.

  ‚Äò... everyone thinks he's so /smart/, wonderful Potter with his scar and his broomstick --'
#+end_quote

In his litany of complaints right after Harry getting to play Quidditch, Draco says that people think Harry is /smart/. Which is a weird thing for a kid who hates Harry to say immediately following 'he's not good at Quidditch, he's just famous'. Why would Draco Malfoy complain that people think Harry is smart unless there's a reason for that? Could that reason be, in fact, that Harry also beat Draco in overall marks?

***** So by what we've seen in canon, he's above average in potions. The rest of the subjects is anyone's guess, aside from that he got into N.E.W.T level classes. So it's a pretty massive reach to place him at second behind Hermione.

I do think it's funny that people don't like Romione because Ron is supposedly too dumb for Hermione, and then go on to ship her with a dude who thought the height of comedy was making the Potter Sucks-badges.

I think it is the pure canon that Lily specifically waited on James until he did get over it. BTW, I can understand that James being in love with Lily never seriously dated anybody else, but why there is never anything about any other dates for Lily before James?

***** And by the time James grew up, Snape was already or on the direct way to be a death eater, an enemy in a deadly war.

Why should he make amends towards him and for all we know, maybe James even tried, but by that time Snape went after James to hex him and that with pretty dark cursers
