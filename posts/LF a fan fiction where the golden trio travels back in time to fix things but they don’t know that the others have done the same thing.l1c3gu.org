** The closest fics I can give you are:

linkffn(Far Too Many Time Travelers by Lord Jeram), where pretty much everyone except Harry independently travels back in time.

linkao3(Messing With Time by slythernim) has Harry travelling back in time, and while it hasn't reached the reveal yet, it looks like Hermione also traveled back without him knowing.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? [Trope stew: this fic began as an exercise, an attempt to use problematic or challenging tropes. A meta-discussion of each trope to follow each chapter.]
