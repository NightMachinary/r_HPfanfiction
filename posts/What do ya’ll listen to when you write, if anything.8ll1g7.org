Do you listen to music? Which genre when? Do you listen to podcasts or watch videos? Or do you concentrate fully on the task?

Thanks.


** Normally, nothing. When writing action, this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OffF0e2h4TU]]

** Sometimes I listen to /Harry's Wondrous World/, or /The Chamber of Secrets/. Other times, I'll put on sounds of nature and click on /Water Flowing/. Also, there are periods of writing where I don't listen to anything except the voice(s) in my own head.

** I haven't written fanfiction in a while, but I always listen to music when I write anything. Mostly [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xbZMJGpc9I][metal]] and some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98DDgbtE-eU][synthwave]].

** It depends. If I'm writing a battle scene, I listen to a track I've built that includes arena rock, hair metal, epic movie sound tracks (Lord of the Rings, Pirates of the Caribean, Indiana Jones ect) and the occasional anime OP like Howling or H.T. If I am writing something silly and funny, I listen to Silly Songs with Larry (no really) and Muppets soundtracks (and other silly things). If I'm writing something serious but not epic, I listen to classical music and some classic rock and jazz.

** I enjoy listening to movie scores that inspire my imagination and put me in the mood to writes. (For example, "Romantic Flight" from /How to Train Your Dragon,/ or "Harry and Hermione" from* Prisoner of Azkaba*n) Most classical music in general is pretty enjoyable to listen to while writing.

** Usually videos. If I'm grinding words, I'll rewatch Top Gear for the 50th time, or maybe just some twitch streams. Sometimes music like sabaton or blind guardian.

** I don't listen to anything specific. Usually the TV is on, but when I'm really into writing, I tune it out. I also tune out my husband, which has varying results!

** I don't listen to music while I'm writing but I will listen to the Gaslight Anthem or Haim to get in the mood to write. For the fic I'm currently writing (though I've taken a bit of a break) both bands remind me of the main characters and listening to their albums get me in the right headspace.

** Depends on the scene and if I have to get myself "in the mood".

If I have to write action scenes I like listening to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqUPGa15Oto][metal]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Q5Qowx99Zs][metal link 2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-2yuGgp_U8][link3]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55ls_ydHstU][link4]]), some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yB8Ci7X5HUU&has_verified=1][electronic music genres]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJcshA4J82I][link2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khchqRIPN4U][link3]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTicwhTatGY][link4]]) or some [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gJ3HzBbdxI][aggressive rap]] ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7Ex-ubaU6A][link 2]]).

For love scenes I have a few go to tracks that I find to just fit. ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxjvNUNXhkU][link1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hUBBJgPf5A][link2]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NmKp5A8i3M][link3]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoLMGSBGYc][link4]])

And for scenes where magical effects play a big role, I also have a few songs. [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FJmiyFD6PM][Song1]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fnPwj1AMpo][Song2]] , [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY4Yvbm6Tw4][Song3]].

For the other stuff I mostly don't need to zone me into my writing, but love, action and the mystical is hard to get a good mindset for sometimes.

*** The "Romantic Flight" score from /How to Train Your Dragon/ is my favorite song to put me in a romantic writing mood.

**** I generally dislike listening to soundtracks of movies I know. I just can't disconnect the score from the movie, hence making is a bit unusable for creative writing.
