  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon... Winner of Mugglenet's Quicksilver Quill Awards 2016, Best Post-Hogwarts.

** It takes a while for it to become clear that there's a hunt for a serial killer going on in the background, and the main POV character barely notices, but the hunt is there and it's interesting.

** I'm pretty new so I'm not sure if its ok to post recs outside the main archives, but it's one of my favorites. "Dark Gods in the Blood" by Hayseed. It's pretty old (written around the time of book 5 so a little AU) but holds up. Harry is the victim and Hermione searches for the killer with Snape's assistance. Almost "Silence of the Lambs"-ish. Mild HG/SS at the end. [[https://www.google.com/amp/s/hayseed42.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/dark-gods-in-the-blood-pro30/amp/][Link]]

#+begin_quote
  To avoid the unjust prosecution of his friends in the days following the end of the war, Harry Potter signed a magical contract in blood. Years later, Harry struggles with the balance of his latest Auror case involving a wizard ritualistically murdering Muggles, periodic contract renewals, and both the developing and deteriorating relationships with those closest to him. HP/NT.
