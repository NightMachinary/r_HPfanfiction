i dont remember where i read it. ive tried to google phrases from it that i remember but it doesnt bring it up. the premise of it is that harry and ron cant get dates in goblet so they just go "why dont we go together?" and then they do. harry enjoys seeing malfoy and crouch looking like homophobic idiots because he showed up with another guy instead of a girl. mcgonagall supports harry and ron being together and i thought it was sweet of her. i think it might have been a one shot sadly.

  Goblet of Fire AU: The change in their relationship happened during fourth year, when an exhausted and dateless Harry groaned out the important question of, “Why can't we just go together?”Pure fluff for the 5+ AU Headcanons game.
