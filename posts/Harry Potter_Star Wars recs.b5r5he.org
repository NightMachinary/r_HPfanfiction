So, I've been reading /Holocron/ lately, linkffn(12704369) and it's pretty good.

Anyone got any other good HP/Star Wars crossovers that are good and engaging and still updating?


** u/BionicleKid:
#+begin_quote
  still updating
#+end_quote

I had you until there.

Umm, linkffn(I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For) is technically updating, as in Kathryn is alive and always updates eventually?

linkffn(In All Things Balance, IATB: The Rise) two parts of a planned 4 parter, still waiting on part three, but the first two updated consistently.

linkffn(The Boy Who Fell, a HP Starwars Crossover, The Katarn Side) both complete.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.

** well, I tried to find your comment & failed, so.

Tbh there's just a major lack of HP/SW fics to rec.

linkffn(Magic of the Force) I forgot about this one, but it updates occasionally.

linkffn(The Havoc Side of the Force) I've never read it, but everyone recs it, so I assume it's good. it also has a sequel.

linkffn(Discordant by Heather Sinclair)

linkffn(Last Second Savior), classic Plums story, Harem and all that, but I enjoyed it.

Yeah huh, that's all I've got.

** The IATB duology has been mentioned and linked before. I enjoyed it because it's a fully-fledged HP/SW crossover that is largely set on Earth and in the wizarding world. There's more planned for the series, but while the author is still around and reading fanfiction. he/she has been silent for a year on new releases. Then again, it may just take a while to prepare and get out another epic-length story like the previous two.

Darth Marrs isn't everyone's cup of tea, but since there were already two other SW crossovers mentioned, why not add another one? Revenge of the Wizard linkffn(10912355) is about a post-epilogue canon Earth that gets discovered by an Empire that's up to their typical evil ways and what happens after they clash. Why I enjoyed it: the tale has some interesting magic vs force interactions and the author is known for following through with the bitter consequences of his set-ups.

I liked the humor and personal interaction between Harry and Leia in the early chapters of Shiver me Timbers linkffn(11675231), a story in which Earth eventually develops into the ice-planet Hoth. The author had a long hiatus after the first half a dozen chapters and it's been really slow going since. Not sure exactly, since I haven't kept up with it, but I do remember enjoying it back when it started posting initially.

Sadly there' so much uninspired crap out there that builds upon the same idea that bluminous8 first used in his Sword and Magic fic. Out of all of them, I probably like the original (before it was rewritten and only partially reposted) the best.

  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

  He'd slumbered in Hoth's cold embrace for millennia before being exhumed by the Alliance. Could he help them defeat the Empire? A HP SW crossover(obviously)

**** What are you talking about?

It's cookie cutter plot filled with cliches..

And what do you mean knowing star wars lore? There's no SW mythos, almost nothing about jedi/code/techniques. Just some statements what the jedi did and a power-up for Harry.

It's barely even a SW crossover, it's basically just Harry with more powers and a lightsaber.
