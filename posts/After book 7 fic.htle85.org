:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok, i search a fic I read long time ago but unfortunately I didn't save.

It was Harry/Ginny, Hermione/Ron. The story follow the couples right after the end of book 7.

Things I remember: Harry and Ginny started their relationship again and they start to deepen and get more understanding of each other's relationship and what they been through.

Bill and Fleur helped them a lot and they even take them to Paris.

Ron and Hermione try to stay together but they have some problems, with Harry as well.

Ron starts to drink and and fight with Harry until they even don't talk or something.

Molly has a nervous breakdown because of Fred's death and she gets hospitalized because she overdosed. She initially opposed to Harry and Ginny relationship by saying they're too young.

Ginny move in in Grimmould place (I think) and Harry propose to her(?).

Yeah this is everything I remember, it's more then I thought actually....

Anyway I can't seem to remember the name of the fanfiction or the author.

Please someone who knows give me a link to this fic !!!!
