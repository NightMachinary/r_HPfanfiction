Do you think the movies have had a better or worse effect on fanfiction as a whole?

On one hand, the movies did a great job bringing the books to life. The music was great, the battles and Tournament were great, and basically everyone grew up to be eye candy. Some little touches made it into fanfiction that were unique to the movies, like the 'Mudblood' scar on Hermione's arm, that added to the fanon. H/G and R/Hr shippers got to see their fantasies come to life on the silver screen, and let's not forget that stupid but lovely joke about Hermione's parents being called Emma and Dan.

On the other hand, basically everyone was eye candy. This basically meant that people forgot how the characters were in book canon. Draco was described as looking like a ferret. Hermione was described as looking plain. Snape was a sallow faced, greasy haired batlike man. Tom Felton does not look ferretty at all, Emma Watson is not plain, and Alan Rickman (God rest his soul) was basically a white Morgan Freeman. This gave way to the hormonal, overly flowerly self-inserts by teenaged girls (or boys), and gave rise to some really creepy ships. SS/Hr, if not in time travel format, is *grooming*, boys and girls. That is an offense in the UK, a federal offense in the US, and was a internationally recognized crime in *1921*. Women under 30 couldn't vote in the UK in 1921!

I'd like to hear your opinions on this.


** Movies slaughtered Ron's character, which made Ron bashing a bigger thing than it would have been otherwise. It also glorified Hermione to the point we get fics like Harry Crow, which should be given to Hans and his Flammenwerfer. It also led to weird Fangirls shipping "Drarry"

*** didn't Drarry basically start in book 6 when Harry is stalking Draco to know what he's doing in the Room of Requirement?

Actual quote from the canon narration: "Harry was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy"

** Emma and Tom I thought were fine in the first few movies. It wasn't really until the third movie that I think their appearances began to differ from their descriptions, but that's not really something you can predict when casting 10 year olds.

As for Snape... he doesn't quite look the part, but he played the part brilliantly, I thought.

** One thing I'll say is that Imelda Staunton brought Dolores Umbridge to life in a way my imagination never managed. I think if we didn't get such an amazing portrayal of Umbridge in the books we might have a very different fanon version.

This of course had downsides in how Alan Rickman's Snape meant that fanon forgot about a lot of Snape's downsides, but I think overall our appreciation of the chracters is richer because of the movies.

*** She was so great as Umbridge. Overall, I thought the casting was pretty good, but I agree with you on Snape. I think you needed an actor of Rickman's caliber to do the character justice, but did he have to be so pretty?

One bit of casting I've never cared for are Harry's parents. Why do they look so old? They were what ... 21 ... when they died? That's barely out of Saved By The Bell!

I have not seen it in any fanon discussion/fanfiction.

The worst part about the movies is that they cut out many important plot elements, and changed characters (Ron became useless, Hermione became a God)

*** Really? I have seen it many times. It's basically a thing the writer uses to flesh out Hermione's character without straying too far from Canon. It's never a plot point though. Just for the feels.

  Draco was described as looking like a ferret.
#+end_quote

That was an insult based on the Crouch transfiguration, no? In an interview, JKR said Draco is intended to be attractive.

Overall, I think the movies did fine. Unlike some, I do not think they really contributed that much to bashing. Most Dumbledore bashing is based on the obvious stuff, which occurred in the books just as much as the movies (dropping him at the Dursleys unannounced, being generally incompetent at protecting the school,.etc), a lot of Ron bashing from books 4, 6, and 7, Ginny from the God awful romance plot in HBP via the "beast in his [Harry's] chest", etc. Movies weren't great for Ron and were great for Hermione, but it really wasn't much when you read the books (like the only noticeable thing that comes to my mind is the Sirius confrontation being given to Hermione in PoA).

I like a lot of the scenes added in the movies (the tent scenes in DH were nice), but there are also flaws that people rightfully mention.

**** Here it is:

  Draco Malfoy does indeed stand for that type of boy. He wouldn't have killed Dumbledore , he couldn't. As long as things are imaginary, okay, but once it becomes reality, the thing becomes more difficult. No, that I gave him that light blonde hair is not because I wanted to make him into a scary Nazi. You give your characters the appearance that you find attractive; that is why I gave my hero dark hair, green eyes and glasses. I'm married to a man who looks like that.

** On one hand, I really like the movies. Umbridge and the Dursleys were spot on, the former especially so in appearances...I'm now doomed to imagining Vernon with auburn hair and Petunia and Dudley with dark brown, but oh well. There could be worse things in life.

The movies also gave us characters JKR might've imagined after her books were published, like Bem, Fay Dunbar, and the Carrow sisters. Not to mention the fact that they gave people who might not be good at visualizing or reading books an alternative, but still enjoyable way to like Harry Potter.

But, on the other hand, Rupert Grint did a spectacular job at overplaying Ron's bad qualities, and Ginny was made much more of a background character than she was in the books. Heck, Bill and Charlie were only mentioned until Bill showed up in DH1. Charlie never showed up at all.

Also, while I know that a 300+ page book cannot condense completely into one movie, there was a lot of great stuff cut out. The week that Umbridge was tortured by the twins was put into one still spectacular show, but it took away from the hilarity of her rage. Or the jealousy between Fleur and Ginny and Hermione, or Percy being devastated when Fred died.

The movies I really only watch are PoS, PoA, and GoF. Don't get me wrong, the other movies are good, but they don't make me feel like I'm watching the actual book all the time. PoS and PoA do. GoF I just watch because I'm writing a story that takes place during it.

** The Movies bashed Ron and Ginny, while glorifying Hermione, Snape, and Draco. Michael Gambon's performance sucked too: “HARRYDIDYAPUTYANAMEINTHEGOBLETOFFIYAH!”

There is a very good reason why there are so many Harmony, Dramione, Snamione, Drarry, and Snarry fics.

There is also a very good reason why there are so many Dumbledore, Ron, and Ginny bash fics.

*** well, Micheal Gambon broke with atleast 1 of Richard Harris "Dumbledore-like" Behavior. As he was casted, he was asked to climb a staircase. Gambon pulled his robes in the front (to avoid stumbling) and run the staircase up. The responsible person argued "Thats not how Dumbledore (Richard Harris) would climb a Stair" and Gambon answered "But, its my doing". Sure, adapt a Role so it suit yourself, no matter if its getting unfit.
