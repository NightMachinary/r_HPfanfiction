:END:
Hi, I have been looking for a HP fic for some time now and think it may have been deleted but I hope it hasn't so :)

It's a one-shot set under Harry's childhood where he has a twin and his parents live. His twin is considered the BWL but I think this turns out to be wrong.

Harry is neglected/forgotten by his parents and Remus and Sirius during his childhood which culminates when he is ten and he confronts Lily and then runs out in the cold.

He is then found a day later, having died from hypothermia and sitting against a tree.

It is very sad but very well written so I would very much like to find it :)
