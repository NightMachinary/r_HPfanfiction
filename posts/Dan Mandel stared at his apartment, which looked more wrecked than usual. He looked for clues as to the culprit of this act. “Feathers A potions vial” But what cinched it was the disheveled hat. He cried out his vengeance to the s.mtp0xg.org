" I have been wronged buy WIZARDS ,and need to get revenge on those no good stick waving maniacs!"he said in a rant. "AND they scared mr. Mumbles" dan stated as a gathered materials and stuff them to Chris's car. Dan's screaming brought Elise outside so see what got dan so riled up this time. May do more don't know if but I love dan vs.
