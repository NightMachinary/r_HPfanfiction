So, he's actually doing really, really well.

As for Obliviating people, he can't really do that; instead, he relies on giving his victims concussions and then a cocktail of drugs that have a side effect of memory loss.

Bonus points if Dumbledore hired Lockhart knowing all of this, because he wanted to give Harry confidence.

Emma Thompson is a class act. Of course it's to her benefit to be so classy about what happened, otherwise she would be the one missing out on roles like Trelawny, but still. Classy lady.

***** Rowling actually wrote on Pottermore that he has two squib siblings, which caused him to be favored by his mother a lot and pretty much resulted in his overconfidence and narcissism.

With two squib siblings, him also being one doesn't even seem to be that unlikely.

**** I don't know how an "experience" would cancel what is a magical defense around Hogwarts. Its clear muggles cannot literally walk into the grounds, even if it appears as ruins, so something is physically blocking them as well.

The only way I could see this working is if the Lockhart at school is in fact a double to replace him.

***** Iirc, the muggle repelling charm causes the target to suddenly "remember" an urgent need to be somewhere else, and that all major wizarding locations are protected by this charm. It's not a physical barrier, but a bit of mind control that convinces muggles to leave.

******* As far as satellites, they could rely on the old needle-in-a-haystack ploy; there's lots of old crumbling castles in the region, and theirs doesn't stick out as bad as an American might think.

Unless satellites can take pictures of hikers? If there's pictures of hikers in the Scottish Highlands on Google Maps, then there would also be pictures of a quidditch match or whatever.

******** It'd be interesting to make a magical satellite with a magical camera that sees Hogwarts normally and a muggle camera that sees it as a ruin, scan the magical image to get both versions in digital form, and run a difference finding algorithm to automatically find every muggle protected place on the planet.

********* I think it's only Muggles who would see it as a ruin if they could actually get there (probably an older charm before Muggle Repelling was necessary or even existent). Overall, it appears that the Muggle Repelling charm might just make it undetectable to Muggles and Muggle tech in general. No one's ever gotten a picture of The Leaky Cauldron either, and it's in plain sight in London, but no security camera or bystander can see it, according to Book One.

********** Don't forget there's a separate charm called the Unplottable charm, which causes covered locations to somehow fail to appear on maps. Hogwarts and The Leaky Cauldron could also be deleted from muggle maps using this or another charm.

*********** It goes further than maps. At least according to Sirius, an Unplottable location is impossible for Muggles to detect at all. Like Number 12, even before the Fidelius, never had its existence noticed by the neighbors, despite being situated between 2 houses. Harry notes it appearing to expand into existence between them after getting the secret, so some sort of manipulation of space appears to be involved too.

************* You're misunderstanding. When I say they don't show up, I mean it's existence is completely disguised. It's not like an invisible person. The whole point of the enchantments are that only magical people can discern it's there, there's nothing in normal observation that will clue you in on the existence, so comparison to magical beings being able to see it is a non starter. The difference will be "One can see it and the other can't".
