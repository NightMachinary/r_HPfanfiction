We don't know much about Charlie or Bill's Hogwarts years, do you think either one of them got detention during their Hogwarts years?


** Pretty sure they both seem like the types who - whilst not seeking out too much mischief like the Twins - got in their share of trouble. Molly, despite being proud of their O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. scores really seemed to favour Percy's academic inclinations heavily, which suggests - because Percy was very well-behaved - that Bill and Charlie weren't too much of goody-two-shoes in their time at Hogwarts.

**** Just apply the axiom "What would Hagrid do?" and then have Charlie do something even dumber when it comes to a magical creature.

***** On the topic of detention, is someone more likely to get detention for sneaking into the kitchens or being out after curfew.

*** Bill was prefect then head boy which suggests exemplary behaviour.

Charlie too was prefect (given that Molly says "that's everyone in the family!" when Ron gets it then the twins get offended), not sure about head boy, don't think so) which also suggests exemplary behaviour.

**** It doesn't have to be perfect behavior, well known head boys do include Tom Riddle and James Potter.

***** Tom Riddle was an exemplary student, from what we know he was never caught doing anything bad and had stellar grades in every subject. The teachers all loved him.

James was not prefect before being head boy specifically because he cleaned up his act and stopped being so foolish after his 5th year, presumably because he fancied Lily and she thought he was petty and immature so he decided to wise up for her.

****** Still, how much can one really clean up their act within one year? Even if he was a complete goody two shoes for the year, I still don't see how they gave him Head Boy.

** I feel like getting detention is a semi-natural thing. Like I was an honor role student and I got (minor) detentions a few times when i was younger. It's not uncommon to have a teacher you don't get along with.

So odds are yes. The question is, did he get them often or was it a once-off thing?

*** I was a relatively good student but I still got detention too. That was mostly for being late.

** Considering that they had Snape I'd say yes based on that alone.
