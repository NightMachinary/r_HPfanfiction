I remember when I was around 15, I started reading and at that time, I was pretty sure I would grow out of it. Now at 20 years old, I still find that I enjoy reading fanfics, although my tastes have changed a fair bit since then.

Just a thought I had while taking a walk.

Edit: I certainly didn't mean to imply that it is something that is childish or contains subpar writing. I just figured that I would get tired of reading it. I am pleasantly surprised to find out that I did not. My bad for not clearly stating what I meant. No intent to offend :O


** Not really. I've always loved reading in general. Fanfiction to me was just an alternative spin on the source material. It's especially great for series that have already concluded, or whose endings you aren't thrilled with. I think that as long as I like reading, I will continue to like fanfiction.

** I'm almost 29, but I've only been reading fanfiction seriously for about a year. I'd read a few stories from other fandoms in the past (alternative endings to the 1980's Beauty and the Beast TV series and spin-off fics about Rose and the human Doctor in the parallel universe from Doctor Who mostly), but I'd never gotten heavily invested in a fandom. And then Alan Rickman died, and I started really reading fanfiction. Now I read way too much, lol. I haven't read an actual book in months! I keep thinking that I'll run out of things to read eventually, but there's just /so much fanfiction/ I'll probably still be reading 10 years from now!

*** I used to think that. Then I realized, the more I read, the more snobby I got about what makes a good fanfiction. Sadly, my pool of fics shrinks everytime I realize a trope sucks.

**** Oh yes, that feeling when you realize that this seemingly endless ocean of fanfiction is actually dark brown from the shit, and you have to fish out a good fic.

I've been reading HP FF for what has to be 12-13 years now. Didn't realize what I was getting into when I first started, didn't even know what fanfiction was. Now I look at my list of fics I love, and while it is very long, I've already read them.

Finding new stuff that is actually good is a process of going through rec threads/searching on stuff like scryer, opening 50 tabs of potential fics, and then closing 49 of them (if I'm lucky) because only 1 wasn't terrible.

*** 28 here, and I really started getting into HP fanfiction at some point end of last year, when I stumbled over hpmor. Over the winter holidays I've absorbed thousands and thousands of pages on my trusty eBook reader. Two hours of public transport each day also helps, I guess. Quality is certainly fluctuating, and the amount of great, but incomplete and abandoned stories is quite sad - luckily, as you said, the sheer amount of stories certainly helps.

**** I think the reason I latched on to Harry Potter is because you get so attached to the characters throughout the series. After reading it and loads of fanfiction, I find myself unenthusiastic to read new things because I feel like it's not worth it to try to get invested in new characters for one book and then done. Also, I think there is a lot more quality HP fanfiction just because of the number of fics compared to any other smaller fandom.

***** Fair enough. I started with Buffy fanfic after I was done with the show(same reason, super attached to the characters), and later Worm fanfic(again the same reason, plus setting). I spread out after that to Harry Potter(I like setting over characters here) and other fandoms because on spacebattles, quality fanfic is much easier to find.

** Little bit, but not shocked. I had a period of a couple years where I took a break, because I just got tired of it. These days I don't tend to read all that much FF, besides for what either fits my niche or is truly excellent.

I love reading, always have. It's been an escape in good times and bad. I also love the HP world, and there's a certain amount of nostalgia to coming back to it.

Doesn't hurt that I tend to only read fantasy/urban fantasy books written from a male perspective. I don't mind female POV in other genres, but reading urban fantasy as my main genre for a couple years has made me weirdly prejudiced towards them now. I was introduced to the genre by Anita Blake and Dresden Files, and very much enjoyed Dresden far more. When I went looking for more stuff like Dresden (from either male or female POV back then), I got burned out on the oh so common tropes in urban fantasy. I don't doubt that if UF had more male POV books, I'd have quit the genre entirely. Since it doesn't however, I haven't burned out completely yet.

My tastes /have/ changed as I've gotten older, it's just that those changes have pushed me more towards HP FF than away from it.

** I agree and don't agree. I still love my fandoms and creating stories for them (not just HP either). Did I think I would stop entirely? Probably not, though I probably didn't think I'd still be completely obsessed with it.

You making this post made me realize that I've literally been reading fanficton for nigh on 22 years (yes you read that right 22 years). Literally since Windows 95 and a 24kbps dial-up modem (or was it 16kbps? It's been a while, and I was a kid :P ). I had to save text pages to /3.5" floppy disks/ so that I could read them offline.

Actually, I think some of those are still hanging around my mom's house if I can find a drive to read them.

Reading fanfiction involved out of a /very/ early love of reading in general. So I guess I thought I'd probably read /less/ but never stop entirely.

** I'm 50+. I started reading fanfiction while waiting for the 3rd? 4th? book. The internet was being flooded with fake "scans".

It was the Psychic Serpent, a trilogy, I think. Good story, stupid ending.

I've read about a hundred different ones now. Some several times.

Big plot twist, Dumbledore is behind everything and Voldemort works for him. That was just before waiting for the 5th book. I think Psychic serpent was a tad later

** I'm definitely surprised. There's been a couple of times I've lightened up on the amount I read, and I burn out on fandoms on a cyclical basis (I'm just now going back into a HP phase after going through a largely Teen Wolf phase, and I suspect an Avengers binge in the future), but I don't think I've gone a full month without reading at least one fic since middle school.

The first two years I knew about fanfiction, I read sparingly, mostly because I only wanted to read Jacen/Tenel Ka fics. Then I found Animorphs fics, and Alanna fics, and I was hooked. Then HP came out, aaand that's about when I became a devotee. So it's been almost 20 years since I started reading fic, and 18 since it became a big part of my life. I'm 27, so it's not an exaggeration to say that two-thirds of my life have been spent with fanfiction as my main entertainment, which makes me wonder what I could've done with all that time. Especially because I have read a /lot/ of badfics in my time

** I'm turning 40 in a couple years and I've been reading fanfiction of various types off and on since I was in my teens. Back then you didn't have such nice sites that compiled all the stories together like ff.net. We had to use newsgroups and email lists to get our story fix.

As long as people are still writing interesting stories people will read it. Fanfic, as we recognize it, has been around since at least the Original Star Trek tv show and "stories based on other people's works/worlds" has been around for centuries. Just look at how many people have written books about various supernatural creatures.

** I'm kinda surprised that I'm still into fan fiction. My tastes have changed over the past ten years, and there is always new (somewhat good) content if you know where to look. Adding that with reread potential, I don't get tired of it.

However, there are times that I've gone months without reading anything, primarily because of RL obligations. Whenever I come back into reading fanfic after a hiatus, I like reading alternate endings and scenarios. HP is a universe with so much potential.

As long as authors keep doing what they do, I'll be reading and reviewing stories.
