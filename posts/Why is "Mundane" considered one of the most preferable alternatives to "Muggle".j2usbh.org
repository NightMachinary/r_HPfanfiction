I've always wondered why so many fanfic authors use mundane as the preferred euphemism for someone without magic in lieu of muggle. I get that muggle is considered a slur and sounds vaguely condescending, but mundane isn't much better. It's literally calling them boring or run-of-the-mill.

***** Also as an American, we don't like words with J endings. Seriously, does anything end in a J? Magic doesn't even have a J. It would be Magless if you really need a different word. Muggle is nice because of the nice full sounds, it's fun to say, much like llama or bubble. There's no way Americans would give up a word that fun to say.

Personally, I read a fic (I /think/ by Muggleftw) that instead had muggles call wizards “maggies”. I find this hilarious and highly amusing.

Death eaters were a radicalized group trying to purge muggle borns from their society.

** The word mundane has been used for many decades in science fiction fandom to refer to non-fans. Mundanes have normal lives and go to bed at reasonable hours, while SF fans stay up all night singing ridiculous songs and expostulating about roller skating on Mars. The perjorative overtone was intended. See also "Fans are Slans", though I think that's not heard much any more. Slans were super-beings in some old A. E. van Vogt novels.

** I wonder if it isn't partially the fault of the /Xanth/ series by Piers Anthony, as that series uses "mundane" to refer to the non-magical world, as well as non-magical people.

But as for why it's preferred? I think it's partially due to "muggle" being having derogatory roots

From the /Harry Potter/ wiki:

#+begin_quote
  Muggle is derived from the word "mug," which refers to a gullible person. J. K. Rowling has commented that she added a syllable to soften the word, which she wanted to suggest "both foolishness and lovability."[27] In the Brazilian translation of the series the term "muggle" was adapted to "trouxa", which literally means "fool", albeit not necessarily lovable at all. Wizards define themselves in contrast to muggle, since the words "wizard" and "wisdom" have a common etymological origin.
#+end_quote

While "mundane" can also be considered insulting, the roots of the word are a little more neutral, with roots in "worldly" as opposed to "fool"

** Mundane is not only more elitist, it's more obviously condescending. If you call a random person a Muggle, they won't have a clue what you mean. If you call them Mundane, they also won't know the specifics of what you mean, but they'll definitely be able to tell that you think you're better than them.

The thing is, we don't even know the canonical etymology of Muggle. We know /Rowling/ created it based on "mug" (someone easily fooled), but that needn't be true in-universe. You can invent any etymology you like.

And frankly, given the Statute of Secrecy, the whole thing seems self-congratulatory. Only a very small number of Muggles ever know the word, and they're kept on the furthest periphery of the Wizarding World. Changing the term would have minimal effect in terms of stopping anyone being offended, it's just a way to make the "progressive" wizards feel more enlightened without having to actually do anything.

** Could be the opposite effect, though I admit I've never heard anyone espouse this one. Rowling basically mundanified magic, dragging down arcane and wonder into humdrum schooling and day-to-day life. Her magic, as arbitrary as it is, is supposed to be just a mundane thing to Magical People.

So, maybe it's kind of an attempt to re-magicalise Magical People so that they're special and interesting rather than just people who happen to have magic that they use like we use screwdrivers and mobile phones.

That's just a guess though. It probably is as basic as 'muggle sounds like a slang slur, so lets change it for something more scientific and official sounding'.

Muggle on the other hand makes the absence of magic strange and basically a disability. A wizard trying to be polite about it, not calling them 'mudblood', but it still draws attention to the perceived disability when remarking upon muggles.

** This post inspired me to create a new word for non-magical people that sounds less like a slur while retaining the implied meaning of "someone who is deceived".

Wizard comes from Old English "wise" which in turn comes from a word that means "to see".

In Old English, "blendan" apparently means to blind/deprive of sight/deceive. So I think "blennard"/"blenard" would be a good corruption of that to use for non-magical people.

Disclaimer: I don't actually speak or know any Old English, this was just a bit of internet translation because I was curious if there was an easy-to-adapt word I could use based on the etymology of wizard.

** Mostly because Mundane means normal, or rather of the earthy world instead of the heavenly or spiritual one. It also means lacking interest or excitement, dull.

Basically the use of Mundane is saying that they are boring, uninteresting, dull, when compared to witches and wizards with magic or piwers/abilities regular people are boring.

Muggle is used as a slur, even by the lighter magicals... The Weasleys for a single example. They may not mean it as a slur, but they clearly use it as one.

Mundane isn't a slur, at it's worst it denotes extreme normality or boredom, but my intent is the second adjective definition: */of an earthly existence rather than a heavenly, spiritual, or powered one/*.

No-Maj is stupid. Rowling's English speaking magicals were using 'Muggle' prior to the Statute of Secrecy... At about the same time the English were colonizing the East coast of North America. I could see a term co-opted from one of the other colonizing nations or even from the Amerind culture that was waiting for them, but 'no-maj'? That's just dumb

But this is like the situation with language surrounding disabilities. It doesn't matter what the words are - so long as people see the condition being referred to as negative, the words will take on a negative connotation. Changing the words might be easier than changing the attitudes, but it's ultimately futile.

we have a group that looks after disabled people called minda so minda became an insult akin to retard.
