  This is the story of how Voldemort and the tools he created to defy death were destroyed by Harry Potter and me while sitting in an empty Hogwarts classroom using Harry's idea, my design, and most importantly, our intent. Set during 6th Year.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

  Hermione didn't care that the soulmate potion didn't reveal who she was meant for, too content with who it wasn't. She only cares about keeping Harry far away from Umbridge and helping the Order wherever she can. But when Harry has a strange vision, they must save Sirius from Voldemort and- well- people just don't stay dead the way they used to... luckily for her.

** [[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18LfF7F3kBx7FpHUIa_FMGTDvnChrEaN9][Faith and Understanding]] by Lethe Laguz

This is the chronicle of Ginny's friendship with Luna, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's funny, it's heartfelt, it's goofy, it's sweet. Ginny and Luna argue and tease and confide in one another.

This is my favorite one-shot Harry Potter fanfic ever. The closings lines are absolutely beautiful:

#+begin_quote
  Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

  It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

  As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

  "Luna, who's your favorite person?"

  She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

  But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

  "You are."

  Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

  Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

*** I'm left scratching my head as to how is it racist for Hermione not to recognize that Cho is a Korean surname to the point where she has to tiptoe around the question and apologize for being a "stupid white girl". Would the same amount of kowtowing be warranted if Hermione displayed ignorance about the names from two European countries? Rhetorical question.
