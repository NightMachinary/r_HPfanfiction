I originally posted this as a comment on another discussion thread but felt it would work as a discussion topic on it's own.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is something that bugged me about the canon HP ending. The prophecy stated that he was born with a power that the dark lord knows not.. The ending given in the books is Harry's capacity for love and his willingness to sacrifice himself coupled with the fact that the Elder Wand was technically Harry's is what won the day..

However, that is utter bullshit. Voldemort would never DO those things. But he sure as hell knew what they were. Besides, the whole reason Harry survived was because his MOTHER had those same qualities. Voldemort has experienced several wizards willing to sacrifice themselves for the sake of their loved ones. Did he understand it? No, he was incapable of understanding why someone would give up their lives for another. But he KNEW it.

Even if we factor in the Elder Wand. Voldemort KNEW the wand. Hell, it's the reason that he was carrying it in the first place. Even then, it's not a 'power' it's a tool. A very powerful one, it by itself is not a power.

Honestly, sometimes it feels like J.K.Rowling just couldn't decide how to make Harry powerful enough to fight Voldemort without making him godlike, so she came up with some cop-out chain of events to set the stage for Voldemort to disintegrate from a bloody Expelliarmus.


** a) The prophecy didn't actually say that the power Voldemort knows not would be how the chosen one would vanquish him. Rather, it stated that that power would be the reason the chosen one would be /different/ from Voldemort. "The Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal, but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not." And, indeed, when Harry was worried about their similarities, it was his concern and love for other people that reassured him that he's on a different path.

b) "Knows" can refer to more than just academic/intellectual knowledge. It can often refer to familiarity and association. We talk about knowing a person, but a person isn't a fact that we memorise; what we mean is that we have experience and understanding of that person. Voldemort may have had an academic knowledge that sacrifice borne of love could give protection, but he didn't /know/ love in the way that we know our friends, or a mother knows her child.

** i don't think the wand was supposed to be the power at all. the wand was another representation of voldemort's hubris, not part of harry's intrinsic power that the prophecy describes. that's just harry's love for his friends and his willingness to sacrifice himself.

I also think JKR knew exactly what she was trying to do when marked love and sacrifice as power. the whole thing is kind of one big christ allegory so it makes sense that those sort of "christ-like" attributes would be the "power" that the prophecy describes, and what allows Harry to be a hero and save the day.

Voldy not understanding the power of Lily's original sacrifice is what allowed Harry to return from the dead, so to speak. Knowing that love and sacrifice exist and understanding the literal power (in this case due to Lily's protective enchantment) of sacrifice and love are are two very different things.

we're all entitled to our opinions about the text of course, and I don't mean to disrespect yours but I really don't see this as a cop out. i personally think it was a really beautiful way to embed these themes in physical ways into the fictional world she created. the climax of the story is emotional, not physical, which I really respect. but again, just my opinion!

*** Fair enough, but as a counterpoint. The only thing the sacrifice actually did was remove the horcrux from Harry. Harry was able to come back, partially because Voldemort was Harry's horcrux, accidentally sure but yes. At that point, once Nagini was slain, anyone could have killed him.

The prophecy as it was implied in OotP was that it required a special power to kill Voldemort. Because anybody could have gone around and destroyed the horcruxes if they knew about them.

**** I suppose. but you could argue that Harry was the only one who could defeat voldemort because he himself had to die to destroy the horcurx. harry is crucial to voldemort's defeat whether he pulls the trigger on him or not. and dying to destroy the horcrux required the love and sacrifice the prophecy said was the key to defeating him.

***** True, and I don't doubt that that is the intended interpretation. However, prior to Voldemort coming after Harry, he obviously wasn't the horcrux. The prophecy was given before Harry was born and thus Voldemort had only 5 or 6 horcruxes. (I don't remember if it was clearly stated whether or not Nagini was a horcrux before GoF).

The prophecy explicitly begins with the line. "The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches..." The way it played out, Harry's "power" had little to nothing to do with actually defeating Voldemort besides maybe being the thing that prevented him from dying, though that could arguably also be chalked up to the fact that Voldemort was Harry's horcrux and tried to kill him with what was technically Harry's wand. No power of Harry's was intrinsically tied with the death of Voldemort. As the only power tied to Harry, only came into play to remove a horcrux that didn't exist when the prophecy was made.

One cannot argue that only Harry would have the power to defeat the dark lord when all that power accomplished was resetting the status quo to how it was prior to Voldemort's attack on Godric Hollow. Harry wasn't required to destroy the horcruxes. And once those were gone, there was nothing stopping every wizard at Hogwarts from pointing their wands at Voldie and blowing him to smithereens.

****** but that's the thing about the prophecy, it was self-fulfilling. if Voldemort had never heard the prophecy, he would have gone on his merry way without being defeated, and the prophecy would have ended up like all the others in the hall of prophecies: unfulfilled.

If voldemort had never gone after Harry, Harry would never have had the desire to defeat him, nor would he have become a horcrux, nor would he have been imbued with the physical protection of Lily's love. in turn, the prophecy predicted that Harry would use his power of love and sacrifice to defeat voldemort, and he did.

yes, all he did was reset things to the status quo before Godric's hollow. but that reset was necessary to defeat Voldemort. if harry had decided to stay dead, someone else surely could have finished him off. but he didn't, because he loved his friends too much to have them go at it alone. Dumbledore explicitly says in the book that it's the continuation of Lily's enchantment through the blood voldemort stole from Harry is what allows harry to come back. it has nothing to do with the elder wand.

no, Harry was not required to destroy the horcruxes. but as dumbledore said, harry would never be able to rest until Voldemort was defeated. because of the love he had for his friends and family who had sacrificed themselves for him.

the prophecy simply predicts how things will play out. it doesn't explore other solutions. yes, other people could have destroyed the horcruxes. but they didn't. harry did. yes, other people could have killed voldemort. but they didn't. harry did. Harry has the power to vanquish the dark lord and he did so.

******* Not all prophecy are correct. IMO The power Voldemort knows not is sacrifice. Sacrifice to save the one you love. Scared of death and ripping his soul to tether to mortal world even as a parasite. He ‘knows' about love but can't feel it.

Lily was also probably the first to sacrifice herself for another in front of Voldemort. She was given a way out due to Severus but she choose not to. Giving Harry the protection of sacrifice.

Voldemort mistakes this protection as something which doesn't allow him to touch Harry (magically and physically). In Gof, confirms he can touch Harry and inflict pain upon him before trying to kill him. He still had bad experience from rebounding killing curse thus he confirmed his doubts before using lethal attacks. (Also explains why he didn't kill Harry at once. Also his first act after return should be removal of this thorn in reputation in front of followers, thus no one can interfere. Losing face in front of everyone again infuriates him making him hell bent on killing Harry himself at all cost. Something you only understand when you are brought down from a pedestal by a nobody)

About the wand. It is a tool. Harry has it's alligence and it will not listen to Voldemort. But it's killing curse will kill Harry. It will kill it's master and will serve Voldemort. But Harry didn't die. He was protected by Lily's lingering protection flowing in Voldemort himself. The wand didn't want to kill and it never did. It remained loyal to Harry. And his sacrifice saved everyone.

Voldemort was defeated right there. He lost his followers belief. He lost any ability to hurt anyone at school. The defeat here is emotional. Disbelief and doubt. Harry knew that anyone can kill the snake and then Voldemort, a rotten and decaying flesh. That's why he went to die alone. For others. It is my own interpretation.

Dumbledore didn't think so. Harry's attempted suicide by Voldemort was exactly the same as Dumbledore's suicide by Snape, which Dumbledore thought would mean the Elder Wand's power would be broken (rather than meaning Snape would be its new master).

So... this is probably not the case.

** Voldemort has decades of experience and an unmatched (at the time of his defeat) mastery of magic. There was no way Harry, no matter the amount of training, could ever have defeated Voldemort without many more years.

The sacrifice was fitting. Their shared blood, the remnants of his mothers sacrifice, Harry's willingness to die, and Voldemort's soul fragment came together to extend his mother's protection to Harry's friends and ensure that Harry would survive.

The prophecy wasn't literal. Voldemort knows not of love because he hasn't and can't love. The elder wand remained Harry's because all Voldemort did was briefly knock him out, as opposed to a true victory or success, not to mention the wand's ability to choose.

It was really the only way for Harry to win, and I thought it was poetic.

*** Fair enough, I can respect the opinion. And I don't HATE the ending (except for the fact that Harry named one of kids after Snape rather than Hagrid, Remus, or Arthur, but that's a whole different rant)

The only part of this that I would argue against with this response is:

The wand changed it's allegiance from Dumbles, to Draco, to Harry, due to disarming. Now, perhaps the act of disarming an opponent is somehow more significant than knocking someone out. However, based on the description of the want we're given (that I can remember), it passes hands when it's owner is defeated. Now one would justifiably argue that being knocked out to the point where you're literally at the gateway to the afterlife would constitute a loss.

However, the core problem I have with it, is that all the sacrifice really accomplished is resetting the status quo to back before Voldemort attacked Godric's Hollow. Harry wasn't really important to any other aspect of defeating Voldie. He wasn't the only one who could destroy the horcruxes. He wasn't technically the only one that would be able to land a killing blow once the horcruxes were gone. The only thing the "power to vanquish the dark lord" was needed for was to remove a horcrux that didn't exist when the prophecy was given.

Now, I will agree that J.K. really couldn't have ended it much different without somehow giving Harry something like Merlin's powers or something equally asinine if they were to fight the conventional way. I honestly feel like, if she had made it so that only Harry could actually approach the horcruxes to destroy them since he was technically one himself and was protected from them due to his mother's sacrifice. That would have made more sense.

I could be reading this wrong as it's dawn and I haven't had much sleep, but I think your problem is the point of the whole shebang and the very thing emphasized in a chapter (HBP23, Horcruxes) I've been quoting all night.

#+begin_quote
  “Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!”

  “I'd want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I'd want to do it.”

  “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it certain, really, that ---”

  “That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry. “Yes.”
#+end_quote

There's more to that convo, and I'm on the verge of encouraging everyone to re-read it, but essentially, no, Harry wasn't necessary to destroying the other horcruxes. No, he didn't need to be the one to land the final blow, but he wanted to be; he made the choice.

The prophecy didn't make Harry special or a hero. Harry made Harry special and a hero.

***** I don't think so - the ending doesn't satisfy everyone, and at the core that isn't always something that can be put into words. It's a personal preference, at the end - and quoting from canon isn't always going to help with that sort of disappointment.

With regards to the prophecy, it seems to fall into an uneasy middle ground - where it was real and important, and yet - when looked at from a few steps back - it really /wasn't/ (in terms of having Harry be special). I'm a big fan of subverting/removing prophecies - but the HP series /felt/ like it wanted to have its cake and eat it too. I think the conversation you're talking about would feel more weighty if it took place earlier - perhaps at the end of the previous book or something, where it would have been more emphasized/clear to people.

But in the end, disconnect with the ending isn't always something that can be expressed adequately, I find.

** Let's inspect the prophecy.

#+begin_quote
  The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal,
#+end_quote

Here it defines someone with specific qualities. Born in a certain time and marked by Voldemort as an equal. If someone was born as the seventh month dies but was not marked (Neville) he would not be this person. If someone was marked by Voldemort but was not born as predicted, he would not be this person. It is not Harry Potter the Chosen One that is described here. Harry Potter is the 'chosen one' /because/ he fits the description. In a way these are the prerequisites of the prophecy. The rest is valid only if these are true.

Side note: in my opinion, Voldemort marking Harry as his equal is not because they are or will be equal in power. It is because Voldemort himself /believes/ Harry will be able to defeat him in the traditional sense and unwittingly marks him as such when he tries to eradicate this 'threat'.

#+begin_quote
  but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...
#+end_quote

This is love, as stated in canon. Now it does not say that this power will be the thing that lets this 'chosen one' defeat Voldemort. It just says there will be a power that one of them knows and one of them doesn't. Now the words can have different meanings in context. For example when someone says "You know nothing" it does not literally mean that you have no knowledge in any matter in existence. And thus I would argue that the "know" used in the prophecy has deeper meaning that "have knowledge of"

#+begin_quote
  and either must die at the hand of the other, for neither can live while the other survives...
#+end_quote

This line shows that there is no guarantee that this 'chosen one' /will/ defeat the Dark Lord. It says one of them must die in the hand of the other. So while it isn't a given Harry will kill Voldemort, it is certain that if he dies it will be by Harry's hand. So no, anyone can't kill Voldemort if the prophecy is to be trusted. I think this line also supports my case to not take it purely literally. There are definitely periods of time where both of them 'live while the other survives'.

#+begin_quote
  the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...
#+end_quote

Okay, so you might point to this and say "So if love is the /power he knows not/ then love must be /the power to vanquish the Dark Lord/. No. It doesn't say that the power that vanquishes Voldemort will be one that he doesn't /know/. It just says that the chosen one will have /a/ power that defeats Voldemort in the end. The power that vanquishes the Dark Lord might be the elder wand or it might be a very convincing dead pose for all we know.

** I think to me, the ending felt a bit out of nowhere - I agree that the ending was a bit disappointing. The wand lore aspects introduced in the last book or so didn't really mesh into my understanding of the magic system, which makes that reliance on the Elder Wand's allegiance fall flat to an extent.

The way that Harry's big act at the end was to just walk up and willingly die was... disappointing. It's not super impressive, felt like JKR wanted too much of a Jesus moment, and it's not even his idea - it's Dumbledore's master plan that he just didn't tell Harry about until it was needed. But at the same time, it doesn't /feel/ like the only intricate way of getting rid of the horcrux in Harry - from the POV we get (Harry), it appears like there should be a lot of different options - and Dumbledore's expertise is not enough to make all readers accept it.

That all combines to make the ending feel to some like JKR just pulled it out, or didn't really build up to it - like you say. Part of it is that we're in the perspective of the guy who doesn't come up with the plan, but ends up just going through with it - if we'd seen Harry actually try a few other things but fail, or fail until he came up with it, maybe it'd feel different.

** The prophecy is a red-herring.

Few things to note:

1. it is only in the movies that Voldemort disintegrates. In the books, he falls back, dead. I remember being gobsmacked in the theatre at how much horseshit the final confrontation was. All they needed to do was near word-for-word copy the book and it would have been one of the most satisfying conclusions in any series, ever. The book ending (disregarding is SO much better. I remember crying when Harry was mobbed by the students after he wins the duel. It was such a "Fuck yes!" moment. The movie butchered it.

2. My interpretation of "the power he knows not" is that it refers to the power of a fully functioning soul, /capable/ of love. Not love itself. As we know, Voldemort wasn't exactly careful with maintaining the completeness of his soul. The prophecy is red herring, only relevant insofar as Voldemort believes it is relevant. Voldemort set in motions the series of events culminating in his defeat. If he didn't believe in prophecies, and Harry wasn't so darned lucky, then he would have won the first war. You are right, though, I think the prophecy has as much or more relevance to his mother's nature as it does to his own.

3. The Hallows are interesting, and likely a side plot that J.K. Rowling thought would be cool to include, and then they took on more direct relevance to the overarching plot so she fit them in as neatly as possible. This is only speculation on my part, obviously, but writing a story is reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaally difficult, therefore I can't say she made the "wrong" decision to use them as a tool to reach the finish line.

*** It's stuff like the Deathly Hallows that makes the world feel alive. I'm glad she added them in, but I do think its a little convenient that Harry happens to have the Invisibility Cloak.

** Maybe the power he knew what was acceptance of death? Like he went through all those lenghts to make sure he's immortal, meanwhile Harry was like "Lol sure I'll die just lemme talk to these magic stone ghosts first"

** Voldemort never knew Love and that ignorance left him forever vulnerable to it. He thought he could "counter" it with his regeneration potion like it was just a strange bit of magic he hadn't known. This mistake is what allowed Harry to come back after death and spelled his end.

The "power he knows not" is Love not the Elder Wand.

** I think it's meant that by "knowing" it means truly knowing it, that is to say, understanding it fully. One could make the case that Voldemort, while knowing that people sacrifice themselves for others, never managed to comprehend it and as such never understood it.

It's still stupid and cheesy af, but it makes a bit more sense.
