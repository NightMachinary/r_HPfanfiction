Maybe a tournament involving more schools (thus not technically "tri-wizard" anymore) or events that are actually interesting for an audience to watch (why don't they have magical projectors showing everything...).

A magic combat event where champions have to pair up with another champion and do something would actually be in line with the whole "This is actually to foster goodwill between the schools" thing they mention a few times.

Would prefer it to have Harry be in character and not OP at a minimum. Kills me when he's written as "Dumbledore-but-young" level of skill. Bonus if there's some nice friendship (pairing possibly but not necessary) moments with Harry and Hermione due to Harry being ostracized by a lot of the school.


** linkao3(294722) The Train to Nowhere is a full on dark AU where Voldemort won, and Harry is a Durmstrang student and necromancer. The Triwizard is a major plot arc, and it's not about goodwill between schools, but about proving the supremacy of Durmstrang's child soldier program, a Voldemort initiative introduced when he conquered half of Europe.

The three challenges are original, dark, and have no limits, and include things like "Trapped in a murder maze" or "24 hours to kill the assigned target as creatively as possible".

It doesn't have a lot of fluffy moments, but Harry is well developed and struggles to find a way to survive the tournament---which is probably the darkest and most out-there one I've ever read in fanfic.

#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort's victory brought forth the golden age of pureblood supremacy, young Harry - an average Durmstrang student - grows surrounded by the same propaganda that has become the gospel truth of the Wizarding World. Injustice is a norm and racism is not only accepted, but actively encouraged. Embracing the status quo becomes harder when Harry finds himself in a train station where the living should not dwell, and a dangerous friend who goes by the name "Tom".

** linkffn(The Futile Facade by murkybluematter) is just starting a fascinating Triwizard Tournament (parady, it's not like it at all) that focuses on blood purity. Mild spoilers (but not anything important):

Politician Tom Riddle pits a muggleborn, halfblood, and pureblood against each other to finally answer the question of blood purity, all the while rigging it so that a pureblood wins, of course.

So far, the first task is wildly different, and so are the rules and entries. However, the tournament is still being written, plus it's the fourth book in the series; the first is linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter). But it's def the most unique and actually purposeful tournament I've ever read, so I couldn't resist mentioning it! The high stakes of the tournament keep you at the edge of your seat.

edit: UHH apparently I don't know how to use spoilers markdown on reddit. Help?

*** I was just about to post this!! THANK YOU BASED BRAIN TWIN.

If I had to name one franchise I'd live for, it would be Violet's work. The narration, characterisation, and world building are a sight to behold. And don't let the word count fool you - the suspense and the utter reality will keep you going.

I'm on my 4th reread and have been following since the second installment. :)

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea.

** Linkffn(The TriSchool Tournament by DisobedienceWriter) has different tasks and more than three champions. It has multiple champions from each school. It has two parts - the first in which Voldemort is the villain and the second has a different dark wizard.

It shows a cunning Harry (not Slytherin Harry) and how he overcomes the tasks.

  One shot, AU of GOF. Here's the story I wish I had found when I read GoF or GoF fanfiction. New, harder tasks. Observant!Smart!Harry. On the outs with Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, and Hogwarts in general. No pairings.

** [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/what-wicked-warthings-harry-potter-rwby.614516/reader][What Wicked Warthings]] is a RWBY crossover. Harry having a giant spear and sheild really adds to the tournament.

*** I liked that in this fic the tournament is publicized for the entire population as a vital morale booster, including for muggles. Who wins the tournament is actually critically important because if people lose faith in the strength of the next generation then their despair will spawn more powerful grimm.
