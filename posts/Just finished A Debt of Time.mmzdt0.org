** Best advice I can give is to re-read it. I have yet to find another story as great as DoT.

** I really need to read this fic. I liked Soul Scars and Tying the Nott by the same author.

For Sirius/Hermione and time travel though, I can suggest one fic.

** You'll want to read Roundabout Destiny by MaryRoyale. It hits many of the same notes, Hermione and Sirius, time travel (ish), Hermione as Jame's sister.

  Hermione's destiny is altered by the Powers that Be. She is cast back to the Marauder's Era where she is Hermione Potter, the pureblood fraternal twin sister of James Potter. She retains Hermione Granger's memories, and is determined to change her brother's fate for the better. Obviously AU. Starts in their 1st year. M for language, minor violence, etc.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

** Omg ANSJFJSHJKHA arguably my favorite HP story of all time. You'll be chasing this high for a while, but here's a story that is also Sirimione time travel that has a lot of the same friendship feel, some emotional highs. The plot is really, really interesting and this hermione is differently characterized than Mia but just as passionate, confused, and loving of her family and friends.

Checkout One Hundred and Sixty Nine on AO3! here's the link : )
