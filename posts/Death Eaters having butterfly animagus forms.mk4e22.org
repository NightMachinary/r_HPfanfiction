Why? Because nobody ever suspects the butterfly!


** It would be pretty on-brand for Death Eaters. The most common thing butterflies symbolise in mythology around the globe is the soul, usually centred on death or departing but sometimes also rebirth (though re-birth also tends to include pupa or the entire cycle of a butterfly).

** I'm actually really scared of butterflies so this works well for me. That [[https://youtu.be/dF3vquclli0][one]] episode of spongebob really screwed me up for life.

** It would be funny if it was Bellatrix that had that form. But she's probably not that subtle.

** It would be cooler if they transformed into a swarm of butterflies. Like you see one, it's no big deal. Then two... then a few... then a couple of hundred fly together and coalesce into Lucius Malfoy.

And then when he wanted to leave, he'd suddenly burst apart into hundreds of butterflies that scatter in every direction

** I'm desperately hoping this is a secret asoiaf reference.

But even if it's not, I love the idea in principle. Ideas of transformation and rebirth would be really interesting to read
