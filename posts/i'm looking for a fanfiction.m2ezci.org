#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort, what was his payment? He got kicked out of the Wizarding world! They tried to bind his magic and it backfired, so what has Harry been doing the past 15 years since his escape from that world, and what happens when he gets a chance to take another trip around the bend? Time Travel Story, some bashing. Independant!Harry. OOC.
