** There's a post from about a year ago claiming that the owner died in match 2020. Maybe the auto renew for the hosting fees went unpaid.

*** On the bright(?) side, it looks like its brief downtime back then drove people to archive more on the wayback machine when it came back up. I wonder if Ao3 already has an open doors project in the works for it?

** I know hpfandom.net feom several years ago was consumed by Ao3 (they were going under and transferred all works in their archives to Ao3) Idk if the owners of hpfanficarchive did the same but it's worth checking
