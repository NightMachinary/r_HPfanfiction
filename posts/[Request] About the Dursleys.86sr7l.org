** Though it's not finished, I really enjoyed [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7129525/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Quest-for-Truth][Dudley Dursley and the Quest for Truth]], which is an imagining of the Dursley's time at a safe house during the Deathly Hallows. Great characterization of both Dudley and Petunia. linkffn(7129525)

It's definitely difficult to find fics where Vernon is a good guy. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3446796/1/Magical-Relations][Magical Relations]] has a Vernon who isn't necessarily good, but tries harder than Petunia to accept Dudley after he receives a Hogwarts letter along with Harry. linkffn(3446796)

**** It's really quite good, with many unexpected divergences from canon! I sped through all the chapters in a couple of days. Though fair warning: It hasn't been updated in a while.

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  When Dudley Dursley and his parents are forced to spend a year with-gasp!- witches and wizards, Dudley decides this is the opportunity to learn more about his apparently famous cousin. Potterwatch, tall tales and magic, oh my! Rating changed for safety...

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

** There was one fanfic, that for the life of me I can't seem to remember the name of sorry, where Harry discovers that someone has purposely cursed them to always hate him and the magic that he can do. He then proceeds to investigate who the saboteur is.
