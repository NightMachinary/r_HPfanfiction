** Agree with others that Hermione was respected. She was probably seen as 'that annoying girl who's top at everything.' But she definitely helps others, so I think once people see that side of her they'd like her. Think everyone would *know* her but not everyone would like her.

Think Ron was pretty well-liked but people would compare him to his siblings. I think he'd be kind of popular. He has that typical boyishness.

** Ron seems to be relatively popular among the Gryffindors, but is never shown to interact with people from other Houses very much.

Hermione seems to be disliked by the Gryffindors, although Ron implied that she was more popular than Neville, and the Ravenclaws, since they refused to join the DA until Ginny convinced them and they accused Hermione of having ulterior motives for creating the DA. The Hufflepuffs seem to like her, since she's shown to be friendly with Ernie, Hannah, and Justin.

** speaking like as if theyre normal teenagers no voldemort murder team bullsh*t

hermione was probably known. she wasn't like a total nobody and blended into the background but she definitely wasn't super popular. shes smart, so people knew her for her grades, she helps people with homework so theres that too. shes usually nice and knows people from other houses so id say shes that girl in your ela class that youve talked to about whats due next week, she lent you a pencil, probably told the teacher they forgot to assign homework and everyone knows her grades so... id say respected.

ron has a ton of cool brothers and a pretty sister so id think hes pretty popular. he plays quidditch and is good at it---although its an expectation set by his siblings---but it doesn't matter because he plays and hes good. hes funny and charismatic---he made friends with seamus and dean particularly /fast/ after he and harrys fight---so yeah, hes a nice bloke.

** Putting aside the heroics for a sec because that's not relevant. And I'm assuming this is just as classmates so not best friend level, just that other person in your year level of friend.

Hermione was respected. But even I don't think I'd have liked her. She doesnt really have any likes or interests outside of agressive studying. Does she like music? Does she have a sense of humour that isn't sarcasm? I don't think I could even discuss books with her because she'd have a 'correct' opinion you know? She isn't very personable. But I'd respect her and keep out of her way.

Ron is such a bloke that I'd say the lads liked him but the girls would have thought him a fucking idiot. (at least till hormones properly kicked in). Good fun, funny, has a personality with likes and interest. Bit of a laugh. Can be a bit mood-swingy though.

I'd gravitate more towards Ron than Hermione though I don't think I'd particularly like either of them.

** I'm rereading the books now and have only gotten into the 4th so maybe I'm forgetting some things,

I think ppl respected Hermione but didn't like her. I wouldn't like her if I went there I think we would clash a lot. Harry and Ron only became her friend because of the troll situation but found her annoying at first. She seems very dismissive of the other girls in her year and their interests so I think she probably rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. I don't think they hated her but they likely weren't seeking her out to hang with her. We also never hear Hermione say oh I'm hanging out with so and so.

Ron I think was well liked enough. He seems to get on with the boys well enough.

** I have been always thinking that Hemrione's relationship with Lavender and Paravati (and possibly any other Gryffindor girls in their year, or perhaps even in other years) was much more interesting that nothing we have in the books. Perhaps there were some stories/adventures which never made it outside of the girls' staircase of the Gryffindor tower.

1. Hermione went to the Yule ball dressed to the nines. It took her three hours to be prepared for it. I am a man, but I don't think it is normal for women to prepare for such big action alone. And with the ball gowns it is common for somebody to even help her to get into it. Who did help Hermione? The only two possible choices are Ginny or her room-mates (or somebody completely else, but that would be exactly that missing story). Is it more probable she was helped by rather tomboyish a year younger Ginny, or by her robes-obsessed room-mates? I would for the latter.

2. There is that scene during the Battle of Hogwarts when Lavender Brown was attacked by Fenrir Greyback (let's put aide the question whether Lavender survived the attack or not; my headcanon unequivocally contains that she survived and she is now famouse [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/104579][Auror Werewolf]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][Lavender Brown]], but that's another question). Hermione tried to defend her and by using some hex she threw Greyback over the whole hall of Hogwarts. I am not sure whether I subscribe to the intent-based theory of magic, but if it is so, then there must be A LOT of intent to save her. Was their relationship (putting aside the Ron/Lavender dating disaster) truly so completely non-existing as the books would make us to believe?

**** I agree, I am not saying they were the best buddies, more than friendship I would expect honour and respect.

Angelina is also a possibility, true.

Concerning the blackness of either Hermione or Lavender, I am firmly on the fence. Knowing how many black actors and actresses play daily white roles (have you tried to arrange Shakespearean theatre in Africa? why would you limit yourself just to white actors? not mentioning Othello, while talking about Shakespeare), I have zero problems with a black actress playing white Hermione, and I don't know why JKR had to start post factum making Hermione black (aside from her politics, of course).

****** And yes, of course, I am Czech, so I am as white as possible, but it always seemed to me that whole arrogant ignorance of S.P.E.W. (“It is not spew, Ronald!”) felt much more like white upper-middle-class do-gooder than somebody who actually knew what was slavery really about. And I have always imagined Dean and Angelina smirking in background over her nonsensical efforts.

  And again, her hypocrisy with the centaurs and the Veelas make her initial SPEW attempts seem like a white savior thing
#+end_quote

She never said anything against either groups. Sure, she said she doesn't like horses very much after Parvati told her she must be jealous that a hot centaur is teaching them, but they are /literally half-horse./ She's hardly racist (speciest?) for not being attracted to them.

  (otherwise characters like Dean and Remus would have been a lot more emphatetic)
#+end_quote

That's a bit of a false dichotomy, no? Just because someone is apart of an oppressed minority group doesn't mean they don't have their own prejudices. There were freed slaves in America who purchased their own slaves later on in life. Do you now think American slavery was okay? Also, slavery wasn't very common in Britain, so bringing Dean into it is a bit weird.

  A centaur is not a horse, so calling him one was somewhat hypocritical
#+end_quote

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't seem very hypocritical. As a muggleborn, she thinks of them as half-horse, and is disgusted at the thought of being with them. I'd be disgusted too.

#+begin_quote
  That directly ties in with her being called out by them in the forest at the end of OotP.
#+end_quote

How was that hypocritical at all? She was a teenager who was just leading Umbridge into the forest to stop her best friend from getting tortured, stumbled upon the centaurs, and wanted them to help her. She would do the same thing if she stumbled upon a group of wizards.

Also, if you were in her position, what would you do? Let your best friend get tortured out of respect for the centaurs? She literally had no other option. If you think that's hypocritical, then that's your prerogative, I guess.

#+begin_quote
  For the House Elf thing, I am referring to the one of the main arguments in the fandom in favor of Hermione being black: that she feels strongly about house elf issues because she connects it with the mistreatment of Black people.
#+end_quote

Hermione was obviously meant to be white in the books. It's just that I felt your arguments were not very good.

#+begin_quote
  The reason I used Dean as an example is that he is both black and raised by Muggles in canon
#+end_quote

First of all, as I said before, slavery wasn't very common in Britain. Him being black has no bearing on his views on it. If the books were set in America, him being black would be important, but they're not, so I don't know why you're mentioning his race so much. Second of all, I really feel like you're generalizing black people way too much. Two black people can have opposing views, even on issues like slavery. In real like, freed slaves were somewhat split on the issue too. Some purchased their own slaves and supported it, while some became revolutionaries and activists who denounced slavery.

#+begin_quote
  However, SPEW clearly didn't resonate with him. Not him, not the other students in marginalized groups, and certainly not the entirety of the Hogwarts population.
#+end_quote

You don't know that. It's said that multiple students in Gryffindor were interested in the cause, but refused to enter, some because of the entry fee, and some because of unknown reasons. He may or may not have been one of those students., so I don't think you should spread around misinformation.

**** Wait, was it confirmed Lavender died? I thought she was in this weird limbo where the books didn't confirm it, then Pottermore gave her a death date, and then Pottermore REMOVED the death date, so her fate is still ambiguous.

Maybe nobody. They have M A G I C after all.

Maybe she took three hours because she was insecure as all hell.

The girl who worried about exams six months in advance sounds insecure to me.
