I'm looking for any Fics where Harry has adopted a kid/baby and is bringing them up, mainly by himself. I read a fic the other day where he raised Dudley's kid with the help of Dobby, Angelina and the Twins, and want similar stories. Preferably still in school years, no pairing preference.


** It's been a while since I've read it, but I do remember liking A Father's Courage by FatherSnape.

  With Sirius dead, Harry expected a summer filled with dark times, marinating on how he was to blame. What he did not expect was for the Dursleys to thrust a baby into his arms and declare it his. One night of recklessness was enough, but he refused to leave the baby with the Dursleys. Could he do this at 16 on top of school and extra Defense? (Mentor/Fatherly Snape, eventually.)

** How old do you want Harry to be? Still in school? After the war? Do you preferences for the main pairing? I immediately thought of Secrets by Vorabiza.

** linkffn(The Little Child to Lead Him by BlueRosesAtMidnight).

linkffn(Beltane Child by White Angel of Auralon). Not during school years, and not by himself.

linkffn(Steps in Life by potter8668). Not an adoption, but during school years.

linkffn(Secrets by potter8668). Again, not an adoption, but during school years.

linkffn(The Lily Potter Foundation by theflyinfoote). After winning, but before finishing Hogwarts, Harry decides to open an orphanage for magical children. I believe that he adopts at least one, but it's been a long time since I read it. I know he gets things started while he's in school, but I don't remember if it opens before he's out of school.

It's unfinished (and probably abandoned), and the site is currently down, but [[http://home.exetel.com.au/jaina/ASIAF/ASIAF01.html][And So I'm A Father]] by Jaina is one I enjoy. After winning (but before finishing school), Harry is visiting the DMLE when he sees a couple of young girls who've been taken into custody. They're being mistreated/threatened because their parents were Death Eaters, and the family assets - including their home - are unavailable to them, but Harry feels sympathy for the girls, so he offers to adopt them. He is unaware that they have an older sister, and is surprised to discover that, in addition to the two girls he knew of, he's now in charge of Pansy Parkinson.

  A Christmas visit to Harry's relatives set in motion a number of changes in his life... fatherhood being the largest. Eventually Harry and Daphne Greengrass.
