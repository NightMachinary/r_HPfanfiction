**** Tell me about it. Search for "Harry Potter" and you'll get a load of fics that aren't Harry centric. Hell, you'll get a load of fics that don't even really involve him that much - he's merely given a passing mention, so the author tagged him.

AO3 tagging system is such a mess that it's pretty much irredeemable at this point for actually finding anything useful. Searching for any reasonably useful tags - such as any of the common pairings - will return basically every fic on the site, whether or not that tag is the focus of the fic or not.

** Tagging is an art that many haven't yet grasped.

Before I even begin, I'm just going to rant on the people that frequently tag asinine things and have them added to multiple tags, such as some authors who insist on doing the following: 'I know it's silly', 'but I really think that', 'Harry could use a massive hug!'. It's such a small thing, but it completely ruins the flow of the tags and takes up space that could be sued for other important tags.

Tags such as '<character> needs a hug!' or '<character> is so cute my brain hurts!' don't contribute to the tags at all.

Another thing is not giving away to much information in the tags. I have seen quite a few fics where the fic has been spoiled because of the tags. You want to hook readers, not make them sigh and already know what's going to happen. You need to keep them coming back with each chapter you post.

** I've just got one thing to add. Using Slash and And interchangeably is just stupendous. As in "Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley, Harry Potter/Ron Weasley, Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy" And when you check the rest of the tags you realise that it's actually a Harry/Draco fic. Proper tagging is key. Trust me. Proper yet sparse is the way to go, at least in my opinion.

*** & is actually proper syntax for a non-romantic relationship, so you'll see things like 'Harry Potter & Sirius Black, Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley,' indicating that it's probably a Sirius-raising-Harry fic where Harry is paired with Ginny.

Anyone tagging a romantic pairing as Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy should be reported, and the AO3 tag wranglers fix that!

**** I know that. I tag romantic relationships with a Slash. And if I were to tag every non-romantic relationship it would just make the entire tag section five times longer than my actual summary. So, that's a no-go. Besides, it'll usually become apparent based on the summary or other tags.

Yeah, I've seen stuff like that too often to even bother thinking of reporting it.

***** I don't have a problem with tag sections longer than the summary. I do have a problem with people who used like, eight tags, and then the fic is 300k. There's GOT to be more than that in there...

tbh what I really want is for AO3 to add an user-side option where if you don't want to see tags/warnings, you check off a box in your profile that says 'Hide Tags and Warnings' and then you don't have to see them, you just see title/author/rating/fandom(s)/summary, and those of us who do want to can still see them, and everyone's happy. But that's probably a pipedream.

****** Eh, it's not that I have an issue with it. But there are those that have a 10K story and they've got a huge tag section. But then again some stories have gotten me to read them because of what was said in the tags. And thinking of it, tagging is essentially a series of words that should be used to write the summary. I'll have to consider that for my next fic :)

** You should tag properly. Tag main characters, tag ships, but tag the actual content of the fic - particular themes, particular kinds of characters (e.g. Independent Harry), genres, et cetera.

The benefit of Ao3 is that it allows you to put in all kinds of tags, and you *SHOULD* use them.

The HP community on Ao3 is very small, and people don't just trawl for random crap like they do on FFnet - people search very specifically for certain ships or themes, so the more you tag (within reason), the more readers you'll get.

**** Not big spoilers but some are fine. For example, if the fic has harry collecting the deathly hallows, I would put relevant tags (elder wand, stone etc.) but if the plot is building to a reveal that Draco has the elder wand, I wouldn't tag elder wand if that makes sense?

** Don't do the FFNet tradition of creating a Drabble series that has a different Drabble every chapter. AO3 has a 'series' tag, so create the drabbles on their own, tag what they're about, and file them under the series tag. Here's an example: [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/579316]]

** Also remember to tag for triggery stuff if it applies. While AO3 has specific warnings for big stuff (non-con, character death, etc.), it doesn't hurt to also include those in the tags as well, since people can miss the AO3 warnings and look only at the tags. Tag for major stuff only. For chapter specific warnings, just put those in the author's notes for the chapter.

Basically, think about how you would go about finding your fic and use those tags. Think about stuff you would want to avoid and include those tags as well. Don't abuse the tags tumblr-style and ramble. But don't be afraid to use fandom tropes as well. (For example, "Howard Stark's A+ parenting" is a tag used in Marvel fandom to indicate that Tony Stark's daddy issues are present in the fic.)

Finally, AO3 has specific places for you to put author's notes. Make use of those. Don't leave your notes in the body of the fic.

**** Nope. I love AO3 tagging and the smart grouping of tags. So if I click "Female Harry" and then limit it to Harry Potter, then I get every Fem!Harry, Girl!Harry, Genderbent Harry, Trans Harry, etc. back as a result. I know it looks odd seeing stories with TONS of tags, but it really does help me narrow down whether I want to read a fic or not.

***** The problem is that every story is tagged with a load of stuff that barely appears in that fic. So you search the tag "female Harry" and a ton of stories not about fem!Harry come up.

****** For me that isn't "proper" tagging. I have seen stories that have incorrect tagging or inappropriate tagging and that is annoying. But sometimes there is a story that is really, really good that I get from maybe a recommendation here that I hadn't read before solely because it didn't have tags that would have highlighted it for me. ): It's a hard balance.

**** Okay so a lot of different advice - some saying don't overdo tagging and others saying don't underdo! But imo only smut has a WALL of tags and pairings. If I see that when I'm looking for substance I just scroll right past.

But at the same time, you gotta tag the main things so that people can find you. [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2780708/chapters/6238094][Another Mask Behind You]] is an example of terrible tagging while [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/6239806/chapters/14295997][The Stately Homes of Wiltshire]] does a great job.
