It was draco and Hermione and for some reason they had to live in like a shack together or a cabin? It wasn't a marriage fic. At one point draco walks in on Hermione or Hermione walks in on draco naked. Ahhhh I cant remember much else but I thought I'd give it a shot.

  Hermione and Draco are pushed together through the workings of a prophecy. Initially they try fight the knowledge that their relationship was predetermined, but eventually use their love to fight Voldemort. Worth a read. HGDM and HPGW. COMPLETE!
