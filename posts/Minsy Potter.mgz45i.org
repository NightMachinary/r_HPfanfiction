I really want to read a story where Pansy Parkinson and Millicent Bulstrode end up with Harry Potter. Preferably a non-au post-Hogwarts story, where Gryffindor Harry thought Millicent was Female Crabbe&Goyle and Pansy was a pug-faced bitch. But since I doubt any story with that romantic trio exists at all, I'm not really going to be picky about it.
