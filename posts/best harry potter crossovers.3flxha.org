Hey guys, the title says it all. I only have two rules, One Shezza's Denarian series is off limits. and the second, you have to link it. (via the bot or whatever I dont really care) I want to know what your favorite/best HP crossovers are. And Then I hope to read them :)


** Damn you. I just went through my whole list of stuff and you get all the good stuff. This took way too long.

First, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7156582/1/That-Which-Holds-The-Image][That Which Holds the Image]]. Doctor Who cross. Harry once saw an angel statue that never moved, but was always closer than he thought. This terrified him. Far more then dementors. When the boggart appears, it takes the shape of this statue. But never changes back, for that which takes the image of an Angel becomes itself an angel.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8187591/1/The-Savior-Child-of-the-Tardis-Son-of-a-Mad-Man][The Savior, Child of the Tardis, Son of a Mad Man]] Dumbledore doesn't know what to do with Harry, so he calls in a favor from a man he met once. The Doctor raises Harry. Lot's of world building. Also ships Jack with Salazar.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good][Evil Be thou My Good.]] The power he knows not is very frightening indeed. Hellraiser crossover. Don't need to know anything about it to enjoy.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4532363/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sun-Source][Harry Potter and the Sun Source]] A crossover with the Destroyer Chronicles. Also don't need to have read source material to enjoy. In which Harry is raised by Korean assassins.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3862543/1/The-Traveler-in-Black-meets-Harry-Potter][The Traveler in Black meets Harry Potter]] An interesting crossover with the Traveler in Black. In which people get their wishes, and probably wish they didn't.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6341291/1/Harveste][Harveste]] Harry raised by the Addams family. Has several sequels, one for each book, but stops two chapters into book 6. I still don't know why.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8177168/1/Wand-and-Shield][Wand and Shield]] Master of Death!Harry in the MCU with elements from the comics. I thought it was dead, but it recently updated, so yay!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6370414/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-God-of-Death][Harry Potter and the God of Death]] Cross with Bleach, follows Ichigo in Hogwarts. Probably dead, but well worth the read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5501817/1/Something-Wicked-This-Way-Comes][Something Wicked This way Comes]] In which a demon is summoned, but things are never that simple. The demon is from Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, and contains an arc in Silent Hill, some elements of Narnia are alluded to. Very good. One of my favorites.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11188292/1/Deal-with-a-Devil][Deal With a Devil]] Lash from the Dresden Files ends up in Harry's head. Different Harry this time. Eight chapters, but not yet in Hogwarts. Should be happening in a chapter or two by WoG.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5871255/1/Fictional][Fictional]] Fate/stay Night cross. Harry is summoned by the Throne of Heroes, but remains a fictional character.Very dead, but still good.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10187441/1/Monster-Lord][Monster Lord]] Harry undergoes a power enhancing ritual to stop Voldemort. It works. It also turns him into a woman. Who is also half snake. Crossover with Monster Girl Quest.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8400788/1/Inquisitor-Carrow-and-the-GodEmperorless-Heathens][Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens]] Harry the Warhammer 40k Space Marine. That is all.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4826372/1/Harry-Mewter][Harry Mewter]] Harry's animagus form is Mew. Shenanigans ensue.

Enjoy.

I never even thought to go looking for one, this is awesome. I hope it's written well.

--------------

All I, in turn, have to recommend though are these four:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][HP & the Natural 20]] (W: 301,307; WiP) --- *HP × D&D* --- Good characters, good writing style, and very good D&D technical knowledge on author's behalf.
- [[http://fanfiction.tenhawkpresents.com/viewstory.php?sid=35][Alexander Harris and the Shadow Council]] (W: 355,026; WiP)--- *HP × Buffy × Addams Family* --- I'd give it a rating somewhere between 60% and 80%. One major drawback is that [[/s][spoiler]].
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10006313/1/Ascension][Ascension]] (W: 141,467; abandoned) --- *HP × Mass Effect* --- The author knows his Mass Effect lore. Unfortunately, the story doesn't get the chance to develop fully before it gets abandoned.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4990751/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Slayer-Dimension][HP & the Slayer Dimension]] (W: 70,590; abandoned) --- *HP × Buffy* --- could've been good if wasn't abandoned at 70KW.

**** I've read Ascension, and it was great. I might need to reread it. The two Buffy fics are on my list to pick up once I finish watching BtVS. I never actually finished HP & the Natural 20, but from what I remember it was very good. I'll take another shot at it.

As for Monster Lord, it's written pretty well. I couldn't read it a second time, but that was more elements of the story itself than the writing.

** [[http://ishtar.fanficauthors.net/The_Case_of_the_Missing_Wizard/index/][The Case of the Missing Wizard by Ishtar]] is a HPxSherlock currently being released once a week. It's very good so far.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherins by Jeconais]] a HPxAdamsFamily(and others) that is pretty fantastic. Stories up to the start of 4th year.

Speaking of HPxStarWars: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8501689/1/The-Havoc-side-of-the-Force][The Havoc Side of the Force by Tsu Doh Nimh]]. Fantastic, although a long time since the last update.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved by Darth Drafter]], a pretty hilarious HPxRanma1/2xSailorMoon with a sequel as well.

And what crossover list would be complete without: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][Browncoat, Green Eyes by nonjon]]. A fantastic HPxFirefly story.

Should be something for everyone in there.

** Double Jeopardy by Ruairi J.L linkffn(6656240)

An HP/Inheritance crossover. Just read this one and it is very well written.

Also linkffn(4922483) A HP/Doctor Who crossover where Harry becomes the head of an wizarding agency that deals with aliens. The premise being that the Dr is Harry's friend from a very young age and due to Timy Whimy stuff their paths intersect at various stages. Also contains a psychotic Ginny who believes that Harry is delusional for believing in aliens and attempts to cure him through any means possible.

Retsu's Folly an HP/Bleach crossover. It is not needed to know the source material or have watched the show. Harry is accidentally sent to soul society and must fight his way out. Very well written and lots of fun. Seemingly abandoned though.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Éowyn.

  He remembered being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a creature borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the 2nd son of the King, a spare, but that changes when things rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming... but magic is might.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Master Ball) is a Harry Potter/Pokemon crossover that feels a lot like the original books, and is fairly well-done.

It starts off slightly like a canon rehash, but drifts more and more until book 3 is unrecognisable (same characters, different story). I'm not sure if book 3 is done yet, it's been a while since I've checked, but as far as I'm aware it's still updating regularly.
