Just finished re-reading Basilisk Born (very good if you haven't read it) and I'm interested in more stories that have royalty mixed in, whether it's harry or just the au setting I would love to see your recommendations. No slash is my only request.


** Please, don't do [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/mrstum/lf_royalty_fics/][double posts]]: you won't get more replies, just more people pissed off with you.

** I have a hp/hobbit crossover where in fleeing the magical world in flames from the third Wizarding world everyone comes across various nobles of the new world to build alliances to rebuild their world and my mc Oc is Queen of the Death Eaters and nudged to do pretty much all of the talks between all the nobles when issues come up as stand in representative of the Wizarding World as there have to be new elections for the Ministry that they have to rebuild and weed through the useless laws and such. It's got a soulmates touch to it as well and is pretty cool of an idea if you'd be up for it.
