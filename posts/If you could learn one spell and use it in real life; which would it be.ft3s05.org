For me it has to be Gemino (Doubling charm). It would allow me to increase my food, soap and sanitizer supply in this period and when it finally is over it will allow me to increase goods and raw material for a lot of profit.

Which spell would you like to learn.

But you're probably right. Hmm. In that case, I change my answer to Legilimency, but only if I can read myself and my own unconscious thoughts so I can find out where I left my keys. The information is still there, even if I'm not consciously aware of it, I just have to find it.

Though, I'm curious if anyone has actually asked Rowling about that sort of thing (Snape's lessons and Bellatrix's Crucio Primer, etc) and how honest a Death Eater-turned-Spy and a Death Eater Fanatic would really be to someone they hated and/or opposed.

From a utilitarian point of view it would be extremely irresponsible not to choose the Imperius Curse.

A few years ago I walked right past our Prime Minister with no security guards in sight when he was hosting a party conference in a university campus. Imperius him, order him to arrange me access to foreign prime ministers, Imperius them, and so on.

Of course, if the Imperius Curse allows the caster to dominate only those who have weaker will power, it would be quite useless for me, because I'm a timid and awkward person. In that case I would probably choose wandless Legilimency, because it would help me overcome this personal weakness.

** Something that breaks the laws of physics in a simple, consistent and reliable way. I'm thinking ideally the ability to enchant something to do the physics breaking for me, like an enchantment that could be put on a water bottle that refills it so it provides an unlimited amount.

Breaking conservation of mass has the neat side effect of also breaking conservation of momentum, which makes a ton of really interesting engineering exploits possible. Travel to Mars in a week? Totally doable! Just attach the unlimited water source to a nuclear reactor and let the resulting high pressure steam out of a nozzle and you get unlimited Δv!

****** That question is very similar to the question of what superpower I would choose. I have thought a lot about that one.

In the end it comes down to if I'm the only one who has or will have a superpower. If I'm the only one, I'd be able to let my ravenclaw side out. What I would choose would depend on how far you would stretch your question. Fanon occlumancy (mindscape, avatars, organising knowledge, faster thought process) is something I'd love to have as are ancient runes (again fanon with it basically being programming for reality). But if you were to be stricter, I'd probably go for repair and make a loiving repairing stuff for a couple hours a day while reading and learning the rest of the time.

If there are others with powers in the world or there will be or if I'm unsure, then I would have to let !y slytherin side out. My first choice would once again be occlumancy but now not just for personal improvement, but to shape myself into someone akin to Mycroft Holmes. Failing that I'd go for the imperious curse, for the same purpose.

All very cliché I'm sure, but I've literally spent dozens of hours thinking this over. I've got lists and drafts of fanfics with this as a topic and everything.
