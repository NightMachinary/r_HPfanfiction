I quite enjoyed this fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11059561/1/Charms-Can-t-Fix-Us]]

Because of the fact it showed the children - all of them, not just the main few, not just Harry, hurting and healing and all of that. Its not just a happy ending, its work.

However, that story was a bit ooc and not my kinda ship. I was wondering if anyone knew of any similar stories. Less fluffy is completely okay. I just - really love the fact that it shows the impact the war had on everyone.


** I really liked Cauterize linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/]]). It is very short but it gives some depth to the whole "going on after a war" thing.

** linkffn(The Scientist) is decent, and deals with healing from dark magic. linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation) is astoundingly good, and has some of that, though not a lot.

  Post-DH, Hermione confronts the post-war world, including the wizarding War Crimes Trials of 1999, rogue Dementors, werewolf packs, and Ministry intrigue. All is not well, and this is nothing new. Rated M for later chapters.

  Curiosity killed the cat, they say. But satisfaction brought it back. A few years after the war Hermione is a widely respected academic about to start her latest research project. To see its completion, however, she will truly have to venture into the unknown. Cissy/Hermione pairing in due time.

  Pieces Universe. Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts had a plan: do what she could to help rebuild the school, study hard, avoid distractions, pass her NEWTs, and secure an internship at the Ministry. But things never work out quite the way that we expect.

  Hermione Granger returns to Hogwarts to help rebuild the shattered castle the summer after the war. She and the other summer resident - and eventually their friends - have to come to terms with how the war broke more than just the walls of the building. Dramione. COMPLETE.
