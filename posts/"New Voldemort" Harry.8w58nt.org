Hi,

I read some time ago "The Birth of Evil" linkffn(4133028) and I would like to read some more stories where Harry follows Voldemort steps (but not as an ally).

The idea would be that Dumbledore's plan backfires on him. This doesn't need to be Dumbledore bashing, manipulative Dumbledore or Evil Dumbledore. In fact I would find it even better if Dumbledore was sure to do good and with genuine good intention but Harry falls into darkness following his treatment at the hands of the Dursley and/or the behaviour of Hogwarts' population during his 2nd and 4th year. Harry would be hides his true self and manipulates people just as Voldemort did (with Dumbledore seeing it as it is or being oblivious to it all) to become a new Dark Lord just as Voldemort was (without wanting himself to ally to him. Them even being enemies for the title).

I put a lot of details in my description and it doesn't need to be exactly that but it's to give you an idea of what I'm looking for. Not a Harry that can be appreciated or seen as good but flawed but a genuinely evil one (as in "The Birth of Evil".

As always I prefer completed or ongoing (not abandoned) fics.

Thanks


** Well, I'm still reading it through (i'm at book 2, and there's 4 so far) but this sounds extremely like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming) and its sequels. The Author keeps updating, so I doubt it will be abandoned, even if its a multi-year fic. And so far (again, I'm at book 2) I get the exact feel you asked, though not enough manipulation, at least yet. IDK if he'll join Riddle or create a third party as himself as the Leader, but doesn't seem like he'd be ok with Voldemort. They're relatively short books, around 30k to 50k words, so you'll read them quite fast.

  After being raised in an orphanage, Harry Potter is visited by his new headmaster and brought into the world of magic. How will an abused Harry fare in this new world? Slytherin!Harry, Dark!Harry, limited bashing. Sequel is up! HP and Salazar's Legacy

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

** If [[/u/darklooshkin]] would just write out the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8222091/16/The-random-craziness-file][chapter 16, the Damned]] of his Random Craziness File.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), is pretty much the only finished one, but I'm not sure Harry was really evil here.

*** The Sum of Their Parts is good, but it's lacking, with majority of the fic being dedicated to showing Harry's gradual transition towards the mindset of a Dark Lord, but not actually showing how he eventually manages to get control of the Ministry or how he gains majority of his power base.

**** Yeah I read it. It's a really good fic in my opinion but indeed it feels like something is missing.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

** If you happen to find a fic that is a good read and does not become cheesy or features Edgelord Potter, hook me up!
