  “Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt his living

  body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily's protection inside both of you!

  He tethered you to life while he lives!”
#+end_quote

I am confused about this part. If Voldemort taking Harry's blood tethered him to life why did he have to think he was sacrificing himself. If it tethered him to life, just an Avada Kedavra from Voldemort would have destroyed the soul piece inside him. Please clear my doubts if you have understood.


** He /did/ sacrifice himself and he did so to protect his friends and everyone else from Voldemort. If you remember, Voldemort's curses after Harry dies has very little affect and weren't long lasting.

** Because Dumbledore didn't bother to explain it to harry in a way that he'd understand before he died.

** AFAIK, Lily's sacrificial protection was always going to expire when Harry turned 17.

** My understanding is that Dumbledore couldn't explain properly or else the unknowing sacrifice wouldn't work, so he goes with the 'tethered to life' explanation. The link means that Harry is not Voldemort but Voldemort (in a way) is Harry. The AK kills a person, but not an object - my thought is that the sacrifice enables him to exchange his death with Voldemort's linked shard. Otherwise he'd have gone down with it, like Nagini.

Alternatively, there's no meaning whatsoever and Dumbledore was putting in a failsafe; if the plan didn't work, it would protect those left behind.
