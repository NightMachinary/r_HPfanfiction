This is for the fanfiction part of HPfanfiction.

Okay, for my entire life I've seen quotation marks used for dialog in stories. Be it in books or learning it in school. So when I started reading fanfiction and saw apostrophes being used instead, it threw me off.

I'm not talking about using apostrophes for differentiating between internal monolog and actual dialog, that's fine, but using them for straight dialog. It makes it difficult to know when dialog ends or begins because of the apostrophe S in certain words.

I just summed it up to being a foreign thing that my puny aMeRcAin brain couldn't understand. I still tend to avoid those stories though since they're harder for me to read.

My question is, why do people use apostrophes rather than quotation marks, is it a foreign thing like I thought or is it something else entirely? Is this actually how things are supposed to be? /dramatically falls to my knees/ Am I wrong?


** I usually prefer using "this" because I always think that when someone is talking using 'this' is an internal monologue rather than speaking aloud

*** Oh man, same! I can't make the words the right "volume" in my head when they use single quotation marks for dialogue.

** Currently studying English Literature in Britain, I was taught that in academic essays we use '/This,/' for direct quotations while also italicising the quoted text but in novels use "This" for external dialogue. Some people prefer to use apostrophes with both so they don't have to keep switching mindsets while writing. To make it even weirder, in some places they are taught to write speech like

-This-

which is even worse as I keep thinking they are line breaks.

*** It's not. I'm British and was always taught to use quotation marks. The phrase "Sixty six; Ninety nine; New speaker, New line" was ingrained into me from an early age so I'd format dialogue correctly.

Of course I don't use the “proper” rounded quotes when writing but still always use doubles and not apostrophes.

****** Sorry, that's not entirely right either! I can't speak for all European countries but certainly here in the UK and in quite a few other Euro countries we use the top format - the one you are saying is American.

****** No, you're not right. All my copies of Terry Pratchett novels that are British imports printed in the UK by Corgi or Victor Gollancz use the 'This is how "nested quotations" work in British English' form, while all the ones that were printed in America by HarperCollins use the "This is how 'nested quotations' work in American English" form.

I've never seen the single quotes outside double quotes form in anything printed in America, while I have seen it in books that were printed in the UK.

******** I probably should have qualified by stating that the choice of single or double quotes may be a matter of publishing house style. That said, books physically printed in the UK are the only place I've personally seen single quotes used in preference to double quotes.

I have found one source that claims that outside of America, single quotes are the standard in books and double quotes are standard in newspapers in the greater Anglosphere, but, well, it's a Slate article.

** I prefer "this" but will accept 'this' cause I'm pretty sure it's one of those things that's generally accepted as interchangeable, because of differences in countries.

I could also be totally wrong lol.
