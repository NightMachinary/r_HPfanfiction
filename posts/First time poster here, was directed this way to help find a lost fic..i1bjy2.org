:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read it maybe 10 years ago, and still think about it but have not been able to find it on my own. I read the fic on harrypotterfanfiction.com and it was a Sirius/OC fic set in their Hogwarts time, where an international quidditch tournament was taking place and they along with James travel to Russia (?) as part of the British team and it basically just follows the tournament. Must have been taken down off the site but I haven't been able to locate it anywhere else. If anyone recognises it lmk
