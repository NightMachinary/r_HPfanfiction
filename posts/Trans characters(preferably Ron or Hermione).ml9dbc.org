I've been trying to read them, currently working on one called Enigma of the mind but I'd like to read some.


** hey OP, sorry to see this post got downvoted into oblivion. It really shows how transphobic this sub really is. I remember I reccomended a trans!harry fic a couple months back and that got downvoted too. I thought that rule 4 would stop that from happening but I guess not.

Edit: I meant rule 3 but hit the wrong key

#+begin_quote
  What happens when a brain damaged Harry and a transgender Hermione both get sorted into Slytherin? Snape's not sure, but he thinks it's likely to be an interesting term. This story follows various first years through the trials of their first year.
