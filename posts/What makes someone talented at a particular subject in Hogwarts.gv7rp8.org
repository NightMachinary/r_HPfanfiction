For example; arithmancy is the application of numerology to predict the future using the magical properties of numbers. So, someone with a more analytical and mathematical mind would thrive in this subject, what about the other subjects?

By the way, this isn't for a fanfiction or anything, just something I thought about while eating my breakfast.


** I've seen a lot of "experience cooking" translates to being good at potions.

But I do think regular things like learning styles, investment in the subject matter, prior exposure, and time/ability to commit oneself to the work would do it.

For instance, some classes, like potions are very practical. People who do well with kinesthetic learning might do better in that class than people who do well memorizing facts and writing about them.

** For some reason I believe that physics/chemistry translates into transfiguration

and cooking and chemistry make potions too

History is, well, history

Language class turns into charms? English class in my mind (because where tf are the Latin classes?)

PE turns into Quidditch/DADA

Extra language classes turn into Ancient Runes (Spanish, French, German, whatever they can study in Britain)

*** Why PE for DADA? I jumped to it originally, but then physical training isn't really a core part of DADA. Of course, people who are fitter are better at dodging but knowing how to counter-curse or correct shield to use is more important.

**** Yeah, I actually don't know, it's more of a problem of "if not this then what"

** I guess it's similar to the way some people prefer STEM, while others lean towards the arts. Intuition and diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks.

*** Yeah totally, but say people who prefer Art or English are more creatively minded is that the same for Charms or Transfiguration? Potions is essentially chemistry, too. Divination is well, divination.

**** Oh, you're asking about equivalency? Hmm in that case I'm not sure. Charms and Transfiguration, the examples you mentioned, do seem to align more with the arts because you need creativity and imagination to envision those and create new spells.

Potions is meticulous and scientific. Divination is a hit or miss, depending on your beliefs, so it's pretty much the same as the muggle world.

Yeah, I guess I agree with you on all points! (While also not offering anything new, my bad ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

***** Well equivalency is a factor, if you can easily compare a Hogwarts class to a real world subject then it's easier to see what type of person can do well. But for subjects like Ancient Runes (archaeology?) it's harder to do. Dada has me stumped.

****** Ancient Runes seems more like linguistics to me. DADA has a history/maybe even law component to it? And a bit of martial arts as well if you focus on the physical aspect, though that's kind of a stretch.

** Natural aptitude plus willingness to put in work equals talent.

If you are looking for specific natural aptitudes that make student more likely to enjoy a subject and practice them enough to become talented I'd say Charms aptitude comes from attention to detail, precision, and steady hands. Transfiguration comes from strong imagination and will. Potions skill comes from exactness, potions talent comes from curiosity about the way things work and how things effect each other. Defense comes from desire. To protect and to hurt. Herbology comes from liking plants. Flying comes from body and geospatial awareness.

Memory aptitude effects all subject. Learning method preference also affects talent, through teaching styles of professors.
