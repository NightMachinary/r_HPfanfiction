** Ok, I liked HPMOR as a fanfiction. However, I totally agree with the reviewer in that a lot of the stuff Harry says isn't very... correct.

I feel that if Less Wrong had written this as just fanfiction, instead of trying to be extremely sciency and rational, the story would have been much better. It's hard for me to take the idea of a rational 11 year old seriously, even if you accept the story's explanation for why. Those who have finished the fanfiction know what I'm talking about.

There are obviously rationalists and skeptics in the world, people who basically are influenced by rational thinking in a lot of things they do. They needed years and years to get to the point where they could think like that. Young Harry, I feel, would be way too young and immature to behave like he does, even with his special little problem/ability that is explained toward the end of the story.

You should totally post this in [[/r/HPMOR]] OP. I don't think you'll get lynched as much as you think you will.

*** I searched [[/r/HPMOR]] and found [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/search?q=su3su2u1&restrict_sr=on][two threads]] about these wonderful reviews by Su3Su2u1. Those two posts have a combined 332 comments (!). Those were 5 months ago, so I think they are pretty aware of it. There were actually plenty of commenters who agreed with Su3Su2u1. So *The_Entire_Eurozone* is right: your chances of being lynched are not 100%.

** Thanks for posting this! I've read through a lot of his chapter reviews and thoroughly enjoyed it. He is is able to critique the science of HPMOR which I enjoyed. Harriezer throws around a lot of references to various scientific theories and it's nice to get a scientists take on it. He does a good job of giving Harriezer credit when he gets something right, and tears him apart when he's wrong. He gives a good description of how Bayesian theory fits in to the wider field, and the reasons why it's not accepted by many rationalist philosophers. Plus, he does a good job of critiquing on a literary level. It is just fracking hilarious to read him tear it apart chapter by chapter.

*** His review of ch. 6 is great. It is appropriately titled /Yud lets it all hang out/

#+begin_quote
  Apart from my rant about chapter 2, things had been largely light, and inoffensive up until this chapter. Here, I found myself largely recoiling. We shift from the broad comedy of the last chapter to a chapter filled with weirdly dark little rants.

  As should be obvious by now, I find the line between Eliezer and Harry to be pretty blurry (hence my annoying use of Hariezer). In this chapter, that line disappears completely as we get passages like

  #+begin_quote
    /Harry had always been frightened of ending up as one of those child prodigies that never amounted to anything and spent the rest of their lives boasting about how far ahead they'd been at age ten. But then most adult geniuses never amounted to anything either. There were probably a thousand people as intelligent as Einstein for every actual Einstein in history. Because those other geniuses hadn't gotten their hands on the one thing you absolutely needed to achieve greatness. They'd never found an important problem./

** Thanks for posting this; I find it interesting. I was peripherally aware of some of it, but I somehow missed that he has an 11-year-old Draco threatening to rape a 10-year-old Luna in the first few chapters. I'm surprised this isn't something that's brought up when criticizing this fic. I find it extra disturbing because, as far as I can tell, this version of Draco is actually supposed to be more sympathetic than the canon version.

IMO, the only way an 11-year-old would be going around spouting rape threats is if this is something they are hearing at home, so I suppose we are meant to assume that Lucius frequently threatens to rape people he doesn't like in the earshot of his son. Say what you will about the Malfoys, but that does not seem in character. If anything, Draco seems to be one of the more sheltered children in the books, at least at age 11.

** Thanks for this. Personally, I enjoy HPMOR as a story, so reviews that critique it on literary grounds are of 0 interest to me. Plus, most reviews don't bother with any critique at all, instead just ranting about the reviewer's dislike without any substance. These posts don't seem to have either of those failings. Quality criticism of fanfic happens so infrequently that it's /always/ worth reading, if I agree with it or not.

*** A lot of it deals with the science aspect, so it is not just a genre-savvy fanfic reader who spends all his time complaining. He also does give Yud credit fairly often, but I think his charitableness declined over time as he got grief from HPMOR devotees. Plus HPMOR is huge, so it's understandable that a chapter by chapter review would be long.

  - I don't think I'm beating up on Yudkowsky at all. I am instead discussing a story he wrote with a critical eye. In particular, HPMOR is explicitly supposed to be pedagogical, its supposed to teach the reader things. Therefore, we should keep on eye on what it is teaching.\\
  - I will probably occasionally also criticize the sequences for similar reasons. Nothing is more frustrating than getting a student in an introductory quantum mechanics class who thinks they've learned it all in the LessWrong sequences (this has happened to me twice). I fear one of the (erroneous) lessons the sequences implicitly teach is that you can know as much (or MORE) as physicists about the proper way to do quantum mechanics simply by reading a few dozen pages.
#+end_quote

I think this should help sum up why this person's put so much effort into this critique. This isn't just random ranting (for the most part, anyway), it's talking about the failures of the so-called science in the story.
