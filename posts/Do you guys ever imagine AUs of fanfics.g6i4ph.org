What it says on the tin, though I think said tin needs a little more explanation.So, I have always tended to weave my own stories in my head with characters from the fiction I read, sometimes combining them with universes and characters from /other/ pieces of fiction. I am sure most of us on here do that --- we would not be reading or appreciating fanfics otherwise. But I am wondering, does anyone do that with /other fanfics?/ Because I do it, a lot, and I was curious if other people did it too, and what kind of stories /they/ weaved.

So let's talk about which fanfics you have combined in your minds, and which characters from which fanfics do you want to appear in the universe of another fic. I will start with the ones that have been on my mind for a while now:

- I have been talking about MarauderLover7's Innocent series ever since I caught up with it a few weeks back, and recently, I have stumbled upon this fic called The Other Dursley by Petite Rouge, which features Daisy Dursley, a twin to Dudley and a Muggleborn witch who gets sorted into Slytherin. And I have been thinking; I would really love to see Daisy Dursley in Innocent-verse. In particular, I think the way most Slytherin students are depicted in the Innocent series, where there are no Slytherin points of view, would actually mesh pretty well with the way Slytherin students are depicted in The Other Dursley while bringing some Slytherin voices into the equation. The burgeoning relationship between Daisy and her cousin and /his/ friends will also be an extremely interesting narrative thread.\\
  And if these two authors ever decide to get together and write a crossover AU, I am pretty sure Daisy Dursley and her friends will benefit from moving away from the stations of canon, and having the somewhat wider vistas of Innocent-verse to play in.
- The other fanfic crossover that I have been thinking about is a bit of weird one, especially as it involves fics that are both very old. What if the Harry Potter from the venerable Nightmares of Future Past tried to go back to the past, except, instead of going back to the past of the canon universe, he went to the past of the alternate universe from The World as We Knew It? For those who don't know about the latter, Harry travels into an Alternate Universe in this fic, where Voldemort was never defeated, and the Potters are alive, and Harry has a sister. I feel a Harry like the one in NoFP would make for a /very/ interesting story in the universe of TWaWKI, especially if he decides to stay and help protect /that/ universe instead of trying to find a way back to his own universe.

So those are /my/ weird fanfics about fanfics ideas. The two most prominent ones, at least, I have another dozen combinations floating in the back of my head. Tell me yours in the comments.

All the bloody time. All though mostly AU's where characters from different fanfic AU's end up there, lol.

I'd love to see any of the Hogwarts Battle School characters get transported to a not-as-dark-AU like Magical Relations or the Hogwarts School of Prayer and Miracles.

Or have BlackInkRedRose!Ginny plus that AU's trio end up in The First Day or one of those AU's where Harry and Ginny have a soul bond.

I'd also love to have a Wizard!Dudley (like the one from Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's stone) ending up in a place where Harry got really messed up from the Dursleys like the universe of the Art of Self-Fashioning.

*** That last one is another one that's been floating around in my head!

Or what about the universe of a fic where the canonical abuse is turned up to 11, like The Hundred Acre Wood? How would a TimeTraveling!Wizard!Dudley react to that?

** Yes. I have frequently thought about how I would have continued Out of the Night by Raining Ink, or done things differently. It's one of my favourite fanfics, but I always had a problem with one aspect of the world building, namely that Dark magic was so powerful compared to normal magic that it made no sense that Dark wizards were an oppressed minority.

If I'd written an AU of it, or continued it, I would have wanted to rebalance things to show Dark magic as different but not /a priori/ better/more powerful.

The themes and arcs were so solidly set up that a satisfying continuation practically writes itself. As the fic stood at the time of abandonment, Harry is split between two identities. His character arc of having to reconcile his two natures and thereby establish a new path is very inviting. I'm not sure if that's how Raining Ink planned to do things - he was quite enamoured with Dark magic, so it might be that he planned to lean hard into that and have Harry side entirely with the Dark community - but personally I find the theme of moderation and reconciliation more interesting than picking your side and achieving victory for it.

**** Raining Ink gave blanket permission for anyone to continue the fic when it was abandoned. Too busy writing my own stuff to do so, however.

** I think most people have. There are a lot of fanfictions that start off with a very solid premise, and gets people hooked - and then as it goes along, and the possibilities narrow to what the author had in mind, it can obviously strike readers as less fun than what they might have dreamt up.

So I think it's only natural to find an idea that inspired you, and think of how it could have been different. It's no different than how fanfiction is derived from the canon series, after all.

**** Hmm.. Well, I'm a big fan of time travel/AU travel ones, so any that have a good premise for that have probably caught my interest as such. For instance, the myriad "Harry goes back to ____ time" is rife with possibilities, and even the best interpretation of it still leaves a lot of other ones.

I think some of the other ones are those like 'Harry Crow' or 'the Runestone Path' or 'Dodging Prison and Stealing Wenches' - where my problem is more with poor writing or overpowered Harry that makes it hard/impossible for me to read them, but the actual ideas for each of them are quite interesting.

** All the goddamn time. I've been toying with an AU of HPMOR, focused primarily on a Harry trying to apply the scientific method to magic rather than 'use science' to investigate matters. As little jargon as I can get away with.

Harry would be this supergenius who's already completed his first year of undergrad chemistry by the time the Hogwarts letter arrives. Has issues connecting with people, which is naturally why he's sorted to Hufflepuff.

I've been chipping away at getting the theory of magic down before I start writing, because this isn't something I can do without planning :p

*** Well, let us know when you write it! HPMOR had a great premise, but it had... issues. /So many issues/. I am sure quite a lot of people would love reading about the same premise without the same issues.

** That's how I get most of my ideas, either "That makes no sense, here, I'll do it my way" or "Why are there no fics where X happens". Sometimes even both.

** I detest bad endings. Sometimes, if I encounter a fic with one, I tend to think "nah this isn't how the fic ends, THIS is how the fic ends" and imagine my own end instead. If the ending isn't open-ended enough, I'm not able to "fix" things and just get sad instead. A similar thing happens in fics that end "haha everything up to this point didn't matter", I typically retaliate in my own head as "haha the ending didn't happen", because while those kind of endings doesn't make me /sad/, they just annoy me.

What makes this especially aggravating is that the ship I like the most has a lot of bad endings (not as in "more than 50%" but definitely more than most). To the point where I typically start reading fics with this ship by reading the last chapter first to see if it ends badly so I can stop before I get invested.

*** I think that fics that go ""haha everything up to this point didn't matter" annoy more or less everybody. I feel it just shows a lack of storytelling maturity on the part of the writer.

So what is this favourite ship of yours that so often ends in tragedy?

**** LESS. Around 30%+ seems to end in tragedy. Thankfully it's mostly oneshots that do this, which I typically don't really read much anyway and don't allow me to get invested, but there's definitely a fair share of longer fics that also end badly.

** [SELF-AD] That's what most [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/mcepl/works][my stories]] are: finishes or at least continuations of various fanfic stories.

If you like to have a variant of some other story, ask its author for permission, and just write it down. There are many stories with perfect setup, but horrible continuation.

Sit down and write!

** I've never thought about them being AU's exactly, but sometimes there are stories with brilliant premises that are tainted by poor writing, bashing, or other issues. Sometimes I persevere through the bad to enjoy the good, and sometimes I just end up stopping. Either way I have often imagined editing/rewriting a fic without those bad parts. Especially when the incidents of bad writing are clearly removed from the plot enough that it feels like it would take only an hour to snip out the bad and clean up the stitching to improve a fic by a ton.

** I think its impossible not to. I read the books a loooong time ago, and since then it's just been fanfiction after fanfiction. When I read a fanfiction now, it's not Canon I'm comparing it to, it's my own personal Fanon.
