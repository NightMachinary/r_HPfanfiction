I am looking for a specific remus and hermione story I believe the story was on fanfiction.net •time travel story •at least 15 chapters long • Remus finds out about tonks and blames hermione for br tellin him and he gets furious with her and I believe tells her to leave him alone I don't remember a lot but if someone can help me I'd appreciate it. Thank you


** Hermione travels back to marauders era?

Finds out what about Tonks?

For 'br' telling him what? (For not telling? For telling?)

If you can remember those parts it'll help narrow it down :)

** While hermione started to date remus, I'm te middle of the story he finds out about tonks and blames hermione for not telling him about her... That he was furious with her for keeping him from knowing about tonks. I'm sorry for any typos I am using a phone so it's harder for me to type :)
