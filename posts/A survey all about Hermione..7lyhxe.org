** A couple of the survey questions didn't quite have the choices I wanted. Like, for example, there's a pretty wide gap between reading Hermione-centric fanfiction "once or twice a month" and "almost never." And it's in this gap I'm residing... I don't really SEEK OUT Hermione-centric fanfics, but I don't AVOID them either.

I do like Hermione and I tend to prefer it if she is in a story, and a couple of my very favourite fanfics are Hermione-centric, but all in all I'm not hugely invested in her as a character, especially not in fanfics.

My problem with fanfic-Hermione is that she tends to be based on movie-Hermione rather than book-Hermione. Not a bad word about Emma Watson, but she IS rather too pretty and stylish to really fit as Hermione the way I saw her in the books... this wouldn't have been a problem if the scripts hadn't rather botched up her character, but they did. Not AS badly as they botched up Ron's character, but badly enough. She tends to slip into "Super-Hermione" mode, to the point where the movies really should have been named after her and not Harry... and she's become a lot more one-dimensional and less interesting.

I think this is the main reason I've developed a severe dislike for Harry/Hermione fics: The Hermione of those fics is almost never actually in character. Either she sheds her personality entirely to become this super-amazing-fantasy-girlfriend, little more than a cheerleader for Harry who agrees with him on everything and anything... or the author goes on about how well Harry and Hermione "complement one another," turning them BOTH more one-dimensional and less interesting by removing all their flaws (and Harry is ALREADY the least interesting character in the franchise, he NEEDS the few flaws he has to avoid becoming a piece of cardboard), and then turning them into the perfect couple, who are so much in tune with each other and so perfect for each other, and so UTTERLY BORING that I tend to fall asleep after chapter two.

At least Ron/Hermione fics have a greater chance of actually keeping Hermione in character.

*** Well, IF Hermione turns into a "Super Hero" mode, then its just, because the movies must have a runtime of 90 minutes, not much time for character developing, even if its for 8 Movies. The Runtime and the forced focus of the Directors to keep the 90 minutes is the most important flaw i judge Directors (and Warner Bros.) for, because it ruins the adaption. You, like others, commenting that Ron was made a Relief in the Movies. He had lesser to do and act like in the Movies (just one example: 2nd Movie, the Mudblood thing, RON is the one who explains the whole situation, while its simply hermione in the Movies). The Ridiculous Grawp scene in Movie 5 with Rons "stay away from her" or hermiones "brave" challenging to the Giant was just for the Purpose of showing Hermione/Emma to be a tough person, then the Humor (as near anything in Umbridges Year is) and a Reminder about Ron "Oah, you are still there?" I mean, Grawp wasnt really a important thing in the Books, but they cutted his agressive behavior totally (of course Ron had to be with the Trio to add another Ron/Hermione moment.....Ron jealous about a Giant....seriously?!)

** Hm...sadly this didn't give us the option to really give more of an oppinion on the character!

Still, it was reasonably short and I hope the OP gets what he/she is looking for here!

** The way I read fanfiction has changed a lot since the books and movies have come out. I started reading FF when the fifth book had just been released and all I read was Hermione and Ron, but I don't anymore for two reasons.

One, the movies butchered both those characters, in my opinion. Now it takes so much time filtering through the crappy fics written by authors that have their movie personalities (ie overpowered and flawless Hermione, drunk loser Ron who's just there for comic relief) that it's just not worth it to me.

The second reason is that the series wasn't finished yet so authors were free to write their own endings and each fic was more unique. Now it's hard to have a new and creative idea and I'm sure great fics are out there, but having to go through all the boring, repetitive ones is exhausting so I just gave up.

TL;DR I hardcore ship Hermione and Ron, but don't read fanfiction about them because for every amazing fic there's 50 crappy ones and I don't want to waste my time looking for the good ones.

Sorry for the long response, I just felt like I couldn't answer the survey well without explaining myself.

I'd argue this is true for every pairing.

**** You're absolutely right, but I think Hermione/ Ron is an easy beginning pair for people new to the series or new to FF so I feel like the floor's a lot lower with those fics

***** While this might be true, there are enough Ron/Hr stories in the fandom that there will still be more good stories with this pairing than all but the top HP pairings. Besides, average quality or number of shit fics don't really matter, it is the quality of the top tier fics that does.

** You should add a short comment section for us to say how we feel about hermione. Limit it to 200 characters. Also make it so I can pick more characters I don't want hermione to be with in fanfics. I don't like when she's with Ron Draco or Snape or really anyone but Harry

** So far the results have not really told anything new but did once again confirm that more readers would rather have had Hermione end up with Harry, and as such often seek that pairing out in fics.

Honestly, the only question that I really found fascinating was the almost dead even split between those who picture Hermione as Emma played her and those who don't (at the time of this writing 50.1 to 49.9 %).

** Hmm, Question 3 is difficutl for me to choose. Does it mean, if i imagined Hermione as Emma right after the Movies came out or if i imagine her today, if i see the Movies or read the Books? (could be a replacement process, meaning: i imagined Hermione differently, but Emmas Appearance slowly "shoved it aside" and now i cant remember my original Vision anymore.
