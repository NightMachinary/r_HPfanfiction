During which time would you have liked to attend and what would be your actual class at Hogwarts? The time of: 1) Dumbledore/Elphias Doge 2) Tom Riddle/Hagrid 3) James/Sirius/Lupin 4) Harry/Ron/Hermione 5) Albus/Rose/Lily

Me Number 3 would be the most fun and band of brothers like in Gryffindor.

Actual I'm actually lucky just a few years older than James potter 2 and Albus. James would start in my fourth year as I was 11 in 2011. Albus in my 6th

What house would you be in? Would you write a fanfic about you with your class or an a character in it? If it has a paring who would it be?


** I will go with the less popular response and say number 1 (Albus/Elphias). Hogwarts is way too crazy and dangerous in the others, and I wouldn't have the plot armor of a silly children's author protecting me.

*** I never liked how everyone would prefer to appear in the castle when it's deadly for them. No one who knows /Harry Potter/ should want to attend Hogwarts at the same time as Tom Riddle. Also, with Albus/Elphias, you get to actually be a trained, adult wizard by the time shit hits the fan.

** Oh, I'd totally love to attend at either Dumbledore's time or Tom's time because I suspect that Hogwarts removed some lessons. I'm actually only a little over a year older than James so I would be in my second year during his first, and my fourth year during Albus's first, and my sixth during Lily's first year.

I would probably be a Slytherin because that's most of my traits. I'm not really driven for most things, though I certainly am ambitious for others, so I probably won't make it to Slytherin, and I'm not really interested in schoolwork (because most are not practical) but if my love for reading and practical knowledge means anything then I could make Ravenclaw. I'm less suited toward Hufflepuff because I hate people and I'm not really loud at times, so Gryffindor is less likely. Plus, I lie a lot and I'm not really "loyal" so I don't fit into chivalry.

** Number 5, obviously.
