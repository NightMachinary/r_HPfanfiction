Looking for well written multi-chapters with Ron/Hermione, they don't have to be the main pairing, just well written.

Any rating is fine, am fine with het/slash/femslash if there are other pairings outside of Ron/Hermione.

Would like it to be completed, but if not a bunch of chapters is fine


** My favorite Ron/Hermione centric fic is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]. It has 200 chapters and 660k words.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11773877/1/The-Dark-Lord-Never-Died][The Dark Lord Never Died]], linkffn(11773877), is another favorite of mine.

Now, there are many great R/Hr fics with them as secondary main characters or even side characters. Among them are:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/Backward-With-Purpose-Part-I-Always-and-Always][Backward with Purpose I]], linkffn(4101650)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12382425/1/Like-a-Red-Headed-Stepchild][Like a Red Headed Stepchild]], linkffn(12382425)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/Strangers-at-Drakeshaugh][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126)

*** Thanks I'm currently reading Backward with Purpose, I'm really liking it because while it is a time travel fic it's different, which I really like.

I tried reading Delenda Est a long time ago, couldn't really get into it though. Will check out the rest, thanks.

If anyone knows any more let me know!
