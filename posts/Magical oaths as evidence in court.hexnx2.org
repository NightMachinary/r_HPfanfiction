Just a thought, don't magical oaths give a failsafe evidence of whether a person is telling the truth ? I mean if the arguement is that effects of veritaserum can be fought against and the memories in a pensieve can be altered then aren't magical oaths the best evidence a person can provide of their innocence since magical oaths directly affect the said person's magic if broken ?


** Magical oaths (aside from the limited exception of the Unbreakable Oath) are not canon.

** There are two ways to handle this, I think:

1. In the Muggle world, we have a strict rule against compelling someone to testify against themselves. That is: if you are charged with a criminal offence, you cannot be compelled to give evidence as a witness. There are many [[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/business/dealbook/when-to-put-the-defendant-on-the-witness-stand.html][good reasons]] for such a rule, and the simplest explanation is that the magical world has similar protections.

2. Alternatively, you simply say that magical oaths can be used to bind people to undertake certain actions, but cannot be used to verify statements. We've only ever seen magical contracts and oaths used in canon to force people to perform certain acts; we've never seen them used to provide warranties.

*** I think the way it would work is to swear an oath to tell the truth during the court hearing. Breaching the contract would have consequences enforced by magic and you could find if they are truthful or not

** Actually, the only magical oath that appears in canon is the Unbreakable Vow, which kills you if you break it. We don't really know how it interacts with memory charms - i.e. if you vow to tell the truth, then tell you're innocent cause you've been memory charmed to forget you did it.

** In theory I believe it should work. At the same time, it just feels too easy.

I try to avoid 1) Memory charms, 2) Unbreakable vows and 3) Magical Oaths in stories unless ABSOLUTELY necessary because it's simply an extremely easy way for authors who've written themselves into a corner to take a shortcut and break out of whatever conundrum they find themselves in.

You could argue magical oaths would make the entire judicial system pointless.

** Honestly, while there should be laws to prevent people from being /forced/ to take them, I really can't see a reason why an oath shouldn't be proof of innocence if freely given. Like they're described as pretty binding.

** I view oaths more as a social exercise. They have power mainly because people believe that they do - so someone openly betting their magic that what they said is true has value, because that's an awfully big bet. Similarly, someone on the other side of the question refusing to swear to the truth immediately makes their testimony suspect.

In other words, it's a court maneuver - you're not swearing to the truth to prove yourself, you're doing it to convince the judge/jury/wizengamot/whoever.

An oath before the fact would work better, but even then it could be worked around through phrasing. In one story, for example, I had someone swear an oath that they had spent 15 years in a Keep of Waking Nightmares after being tortured. Turns out, the man had been completely healthy after the attack, but was hiding out in a place called Keep of Waking Nightmares in Welsh.

**** The story is Who Dares Wins, on ffn. The relevant oath is in Chapter 14, with the fallout coming shortly thereafter.

** The level of corruption in the magical justice system is staggering. Which is why when the deatheaters (like malfoy) used the Imperius defense as an "affirmative defense" eg I did the crime but I shouldn't be punished for it because it wasn't my fault" they followed that declaration with lots of gold rather than being forced to prove their "innocence".

I'm surprised that I haven't read any fics that really pointed that out or used those "deatheater declarations" to both insult them or remove them from power.

Draco: wait until my father hears of this.

Harry: why would anyone care what a piss poor wizard like your father thinks? I mean have you already forgotten thar he told the world that he was a lousy wizard that was so weak willed and weak minded that he couldn't stop a simple mind attack. So who cares what he thinks. He already admitted to being a worthless wizard. And of course, if you fight to say he isn't then it means he lied in the Wizengamot about being Imperiused so he should either be in Azkaban or tossed through the veil.

Or Dumbledore in the Wizengamot at the first war's end: Esteemed members in order to protect the sanctity of our legislative and judicial processes we must strip all those accused deatheaters who claimed to have been imperiused of their seats on Wizengamot and ensure they have no possible way of influencing things by suspending the voting rights of their seat until they have passed unto their "next great adventure".

All of these individuals have admitted that they are too weak willed and weak minded to protect themselves from being taken over. Therefore we can not entrust the sanctity of our government to people who have admitted how susceptible they are to being under the control of persons who wish harm to our way of life. This voting ban of their house seat has to extend for their entire life span because a proxy or an heir could be influenced by an again imperiused member.

We should also required each of these "imperiused" members to take an Unbreakable Vow (on their lives) not to contact or bribe any Wizengamot member or family with the intention to influence our legislative and/or judicial processes.

While these actions may seem harsh we know that none of these previously imperiused members when in their right minds would ever want to subvert our processes by bribery or other methods and would gladly take these steps in order to ensure they could never be controlled again and forced to cause harm to our society.

** The magical world specifically excludes magical truth verification and compulsion because their preference for kangaroo courts and getting the fix in before the court ever convenes would be just too blatant if the evidence flatly contradicted the preordained verdict.
