So, any ideas how I could reincorporate Squib! Neville in my story about the muggle half-French granddaughter of Marius Black named Maia besides the first chapter. She moves to the UK the summer of 1994 with her dad and brother after her mother dies right before she finishes year 8.

Neville was meant to be Maia's love interest eventually. This story has turned into Black Family reunion fic since her older brother Fabian might become the Head of the House of Black.


** That first sentence is a doozy.

We're told that all the Purebloods know each other more or less. So it's plausible enough that they know of Augusta Longbottom. The catch being that Marius is canonically listed as 20-25 years older than Augusta. But no one is going to harp on them being away of each other in a society as insular and small as the Wizarding World. So it's fairly easy to just have them drop in to say hi to an old family friend on the return to England.

That being said, stories don't need love interests.

*** As much as they don't "need" them, if written well they certainly add a dimension to your story.

I've read most of what you have, and from your perspective it's true. You seamlessly integrate romance making it appear "normal".

On the flip side, not everyone can do that. I am not a strong enough writer to manage that so my options are either forgot the pairing or write it while the quality of the story suffers.

If I forget the pairing then I lose the opportunity to gain experience with writing romance and all that it entails. If the quality of my story suffers for it so be it. The goal is to improve my skills as a writer not the quality of a singular story.

** Callidora Black married into the Longbottoms right? So you could play with the relation to Augusta and make Augusta and Neville more closely related to the Blacks and have them turn up to whatever Black family drama you have.

*** Yeah, she did marry a relative of the Longbottoms. It could be Neville's grandfather's brother who married Calildora Black.

** Year 8? Did you mean year 7?

*** She's 13 nearly 14. I might be wrong with the term for school.
