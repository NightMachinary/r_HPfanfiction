Any good stories with Harry/older female? Maybe like Harry/Narcissa or Harry/Bella, Harry/Appoline, Harry/Molly, Harry/etc.

Smut fics welcome! Wouldn't mind a fic with some plot either. I'm sure most younger guys fight older females attractive xD


** Harry/Molly though?

***** Molly Weasley > Molly Carpenter. 'Tis True.

And this way Harry gets to bang both mother and daughter. That would make for some slightly awkward conversations. Surely you can see the appeal in that, Taure?

I'm sure [[/u/__Pers]] at least would agree with me.

*** Dawg, that's some /fertile/ soil right there though. Damn!

... I'm gonna stop being creepy now, sorry. -_-

Seriously though, I could see it being a thing except for one reason, I like Arthur. If Harry bangs Narcissa or Bella I don't care about that part since Lucy and Rudy are both assbags.

** If love to see a Harry/Appoline or Harry/Mrs Granger.

I'll always wait for the day that someone writes my idea for a twist on the Reptilia 28 challenge: Harry assumes "some granger girl..." is actually Hermione's (divorced or widowed) mum and when he's sent back in time starts hitting on her.

*** They aren't particularly good stories, but Harry/Hermione/Hermione's mother is a thing of [[http://kinsfire.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Kinsfire]]'s. For example, /Forever Yours, and Yours?/ has repeated injections of Harry's magical Ã¼bersemen make Hermione's mother into a witch. At some point, Hermione's father tries hooking up with his daughter up in a Vegas bar as well. Pretty family friendly stuff, like all Kinsfire--that is, if by "family friendly," you mean "pass the brain-bleach."

** linkffn(2127558) /Harry/Narcissa/ The plot is very well thought and realistic and shows their relationship from being just lovers to being in love.

linkffn(2896398) /Harry/Bellatrix/ Very Dark with lots of duelling/fighting
