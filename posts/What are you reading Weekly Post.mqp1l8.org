** Title: The Disappearances of Draco Malfoy Rating: M Link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23296162/chapters/55794568?view_adult=true]] Summary: “The night that Harry and Dumbledore return from the cave, the Death Eaters are delayed from reaching the top of the Astronomy Tower for one more minute. Draco Malfoy lowers his wand.

A Deathly Hallows rewrite in which Draco accepts Dumbledore's offer to fake his death and go into hiding with the Order of the Phoenix.”

Impressions: This week I read the latest chapter of this brilliant fic. The writing is top notch and the characterisation canon-esque. The plot is really intricately charted. All in all a joy to read. 10/10.

** I read You Meet in Paris for the first time this morning, and it has stuck with me the entire day. It is achingly bittersweet, and also the best oneshot I've ever read (yes, better than Cauterize). It's one of the rare stories told in second person, and it pulls it off flawlessly. If you haven't read it, I don't think there's a fic I would recommend more highly at the moment. And if you haven't read Enembee's other works, you should read those too.

I've also been reading Steelbadger's new fic, In Bad Faith, which features a pretty unique premise: fem!draco is the Girl Who Lived (Narcissa sacrified herself ala Lily, but Lucius is still alive and with even more influence than before) and Harry's family is still alive, but on Harry's seventeenth birthday Dumbledore reveals to him that Voldemort is not really dead and that he thinks Harry is the actual subject of a Prophecy. Normally I would just skip over the story based on its summary because the premise seems destined for failure, but Steelbadger is a great author (having written The Shadow of Angmar and all) and the chapters so far have been enjoyable. Something to follow at the very least.

****** This story is excellent. Really good writing. The fight scene in the Department of Mysteries here was badass. And the author has a great OC, Harry's younger sister Effie. I love the reinterpretation of Harry and Neville's characters, what they'd be like if they'd grown up with living parents (in short: much more confident and well-adjusted). And girl Draco is killing it.

** I've seen Pandemic by eldritcher recommended multiple times on this sub and I'm now in the midst of it. It's astonishing. Everyone is very OOC (Voldemort bakes and rescues abused children!) but then there are instances of interesting reflections on the HP world and I think 'yes, it could be like that'. The author writes beautifully although their grammar is a bit individual. My favourite part is the sentient Hogwarts castle - I love buildings as characters.

*** That series is something else! Like a fairy tale - once you look deeper it gets subversive and grimdark. You go into it thinking it's about anachronistic introduction of Muggle tech into Wizarding life with maybe something about the virus. It's got the craziest pairing. None of the characters are anything like canon but the canon timeline is still used to the end of OoTP. Normally fics which want to retcon need to start canon changes atleast before Goblet of Fire especially if they want a good Voldemort without bashing. I am still trying to understand how it works. Sentient Hogwarts is Chaotic Neutral in my head canon now. I don't know if you got to those parts but I also liked the parts with Malfoy Manor.

Do you have any sentient building fic recs? The only ones I have read so far are Two Lockets (sentient Grimmauld Place) and Hungarian Dances (sentient Nurmengard).

***** Pandemic was pretty hard to binge read. I am taking a break from long fics with those characters because the fic is still living in my head so vividly. It's really dense. I followed it as it was posting. Sometimes I felt some chapters had information which could be edited out or didn't add to the immediate narrative, but then the next chapter got posted and connected the dots. Ultra confident writing. It's crazy how something so dense actually got completed in two months. I still don't really have a name for the writing styles in the fics. Just unusual and beautiful.

I just finished House Proud and it is so good :) Funny and sweet. Just what I needed on a Friday. It's the Temeraire author! I think I have read the first three books of her novels! Dragons! Thanks for the rec!

** I've been going back and trying to find all of the old stuff I first read way back in the day when I started in on fanfiction. I'm up to Ruskbyte, and eating lunch while reading "Flying Without A Broom." It's not quite the first Harry/Tonks story, but it is definitely among the first, and it's what first made me really enjoy the pairing.

The basic story is, Tonks is assigned to guard Harry while at school, because they've caught word of an assassination attempt being planned, and she poses as a Hogwarts student to stay close to him. Somebody slips a drug into his drink that makes him high as a kite and completely irrational, and causes his magic to go haywire. Unfortunately, Harry is a strong wizard, so his magic going haywire is a lot more serious, and has a lot more side-effects, than it might have been. The plan was to make him easy for the Death Eaters to kidnap him, but unfortunately, they've accidentally turned him into an unstoppable, sexually aroused, childish lunatic with zero inhabitations and massive mood swings. The plot of the story is, of course, Tonks chasing after him and trying to keep the chaos under control.

Sadly, it is abandoned, and will remain so forever. But it's a great crack fic and, again, the thing that got me to like Harry/Tonks. In fact, it's reminding me so much of why I like Harry/Tonks that I might read A Black Comedy or Where In The World Is Harry Potter next. Nobody really writes good Tonks stuff anymore.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

Super!Harry is always a bit cheesy, but I actually enjoyed the Magus concept, because hell, if you're going to do a Super!Harry, why not just go all-in? Make him a magical super hero. Embrace the chaos. I'm actually surprised there were no copy-cats that used the idea: it was from the same era as the stuff that spawned the heir rings and magical lords, but it never seemed to catch on the same way.

** I've been wanting a serious self-insert and I finally found one! The author says it isn't a SI, but a guy is reborn into the HP world, so in my opinion it is one. But it's a good one!

Cato is Draco Malfoy's older brother. He's a prodigy, and his mother keeps telling him he needs to stop ignoring the other children. Which I really, really appreciated because if you really were reborn, you're not going to make friends with a bunch of eleven year olds. There are a lot of time skips, which I also appreciate, because no one wants to read another first year at hogwarts or diagon shopping scene. They didn't even include Harry's sorting, which was a breath of fresh air.

Also, when Cato does retaliate in a typical “dark” cliche-ish fashion, he immediately regrets it. Which is also realistic.

It is rated teen. It is a great story. It starts when Hermione is 7. Due to weird accidental magic, whenever she falls asleep she appears in Gellert Grindewald's time. It is long but definitely worth it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4745329/1/On-the-Way-to-Greatness][On the Way to Greatness]]: A Harry is sorted into Slytherin story. I'm really liking it! I love Harry, his portrayal is brilliant, perfect balance of snarky, sly and clever. I love the subtle differences to canon and its completely believable. I haven't finished it though.

​

Then I'm falling back on my comfort read of [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5252627/chapters/12651236][Break]]. Its a brilliant story about the 12 in between years of Sirius and Remus. It jumps between Azkaban and where ever Remus is and a few flashbacks too. We see Sirius interact with Hagrid and Bella in Azkaban, his discovery of Peter and the escape. We see Remus struggle with the prejudices of the Wizarding World, the discrimination by the government and society. Its a truly excellent and underrated story and I adore it and cannot recommend it enough

I believe I saw it recommended here in this thread already, but I wanted to get my thoughts on it in. When I say it's sloppily written, I mean that the spelling in it is just not even given much thought, the tenses are all over the place, and there are misused words tossed out everywhere like doubloons at a Mardi Gras parade.

I'm a major sucker for runaway/homeless Harry stories, but this one might be pushing the limits of my fortitude 😅 I'll stick it out for a bit longer, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it as is currently.

  Harry James Potter discovered he could change his face, so he did the smart thing, he ran away. He lived on the streets for years, learning to hide in plain sight, always wondering just what these powers are and who he was. One day, finally caught by the Magical society, he's thrust into a new world where the answers he wants await him. Oh & please leave a Review, my ego needs it.

same author as 'unsphere the stars' a great time traveling Tomione story.

I'm enjoying it because its not rehashing canon or if it does we don't have to read through it cause it is happening in the background. Just a fun story overall.

** I recently read the first 'Scholomance' novel by Naomi Novik so I had to go back and read 'Scholomance' by astolat, as well as have a fangirl moment, as I hadn't realised they were the same author before now. The fanfiction Scholomance is a well-written angsty Drarry, where Draco spends a few years in a dark mirror version of Hogwarts. It's only vaguely, very vaguely, similar to Novik's commercially published novel. I preferred the commercial version although that is probably because the writer is far more experienced now. I recommend both of them.

** I'm rereading Mr 3CP's “Harry Potter and the Secrets in the Shadows.” It has to be my all-time favorite one-shot. I know 3CP through author ACI100's Discord server, which did affect my perception of the story, although not in the way you might expect. You see, 3CP is one of the most prolific Hermione-haters I have ever met. And, yet, he chose to tell this story through the eyes of none other than Hermione. Knowing that facet made the choice of narrator even more interesting to my eyes.

Secrets in the Shadows is a Dark Harry fic and is masterfully written. I'll refrain from spoiling it for those of you who choose to read it, but it has twists and turns throughout it. There is one moment in particular, maybe three-quarters of the way through, that sends a chill down my spine every time I read it.

All in all, I absolutely loved all 15k words of it and would recommend it to anybody who asks!

*** It is a very strong story that does a good job of accurately distilling the danger a competent dark lord would pose to the world. I feel it also displays most of the people in the story as being largely in-character; they are realistically portrayed.

However, as well-written as it is, it has the same fundamental flaw that the Harry Potter canon itself does: namely, that there is no motivation. Voldemort had no clear motivation for doing what he did; if his goal was to inure himself against death, as his moniker suggests, then he succeeded long before he ever decided to try and take over Britain. Indeed, he was successful before he even left Hogwarts, for he created at least one and possibly two Horcruxes while he was there, and at least one more immediately after graduation. This by itself made him more immortal and more unkillable than anyone who had ever come before him. What reason, then, did Voldemort have, to become a violent political revolutionary? What was his motivation for trying to take over the Ministry, and presumably much more?

To this, we are never given an answer. Rowling never actually gives us any real motivation for Voldemort doing the things he does. I can excuse her never showing Voldemort being a clever and charismatic man, because a writer can only write what they know, and it can be difficult to fake a realistic argument on politics and ethics if you aren't intimately familiar with both positions. We never saw Tom Riddle convince people like Lucius Malfoy to his side with words because Rowling probably didn't feel like she could convincingly write it. So I can overlook her, and many other writers, glossing over these things, and having it be more of an informed ability. However, what I cannot excuse or overlook is her never bothering to give Voldemort any particular motivation or reason for doing anything of the things he did. Why try to conquer the world? Why not, it seems, is the answer.

This story shares the same weakness. Harry Potter is, ironically, the weakest character here, because he has no motivation. Why try to unify the world under a single imperial banner? For what reason would he attempt this? We have no answer. I can think of several reasons for someone to attempt this, from believing it would bring a truer and more lasting peace, to disdaining the chaos that ruined so many lives and seeking order above all else, to even simply hating what so many wars have done and wishing to create a world in which war is no longer possible (the so-called "last war"). He could even believe that humanity is destined for greater things, and they could only begin to pursue that destiny if they were united in their totality. If pressed, I could conjure up a dozen potential reasons that a broken Harry Potter in the post-DH timeline might think about doing something like this.

But none of these things were ever alluded to. Harry Potter, like Voldemort, is wicked merely for it's own sake: we don't know why he would go to these lengths, we don't know why he would torture his friends. Did he feel that they betrayed him, somehow? Did he think this was justice, or revenge? No good reason is ever given. He's just a bastard because he's a bastard, and that's boring. It's Snidely Whiplash tying women to train tracks, and Scooby Doo villains dressing up in costumes to scare people. It's the Wicked Witch of the West cackling "I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog, too!"

The Harry Potter of this story is at once far more interesting that Voldemort ever was, since he combines the better traits of Dumbledore and Grindelwald, but depressingly is still chained to the same fundamental flaw Voldemort has. The author was too lazy to give him a motivation, which means he will forever be a cartoon caricature of a character.

If Harry Potter had ever, at any point, had a reason for doing any of the things he did, it would be a 10/10 story. Instead, I'd call this a strong 8/10, because the real lesson here is that Hermione should have just ignored her friend until he committed suicide. If I wanted to be rude, I could go so far as to say it is clearly obvious that 3CP has a hatred of Hermione, because this Harry Potter doesn't actually exist to be a villain: he just exists to break her in the manner most suited to her character being broken. Harry doesn't have a motivation because he doesn't need one. The motivation is "fuck Hermione."

**** You know, I think that's an accurate analysis of Harry‘s character and my main issue with the story. 3CP neglects to explain why Harry goes dark, which is something that I would have loved to see and is a common theme within the reviews and comments the story has received on FFN and AO3.

As for 3CP's hatred of Hermione being apparent, I agree. Killing Hermione off at the very end of the story displayed that prominently. The reason I commented on 3CP's hatred of Hermione was not that he portrayed her in a positive light (that would be extremely OOC for him), but rather that he took a character he despised and based the events taking place on her perception of them, rather than Harry's, as is often done in Dark Harry stories.

***** Killing Hermione off actually surprised me. Given Harry's character, the specific lines of questioning he gave her in the in to verify that she had been properly brainwashed, and the fact that the Carrow twins were rebuilding her mind with a careful and specific purpose, I actually assumed that the story would end with him releasing her back into the world with instructions to build a resistance against him. That way, all of his enemies would be in one place and the leader of the resistance would have been in his pocket from day one. He would then truly control the entire world and everything in it, because he would effectively be leading his own opposition. I even felt he somewhat alluded to this by saying it was the New Year, and thus a "new beginning."

Killing her after rebuilding her was just a waste. I actually didn't expect it at all, and it's definitely the weakest move 3CP made. It clearly shows his bias against Hermione.

*** Hmm. I just read it and it was okay, but to me it seems like cruelty for cruelty's sake. The motivations aren't entirely clear, and in those few moments we get to see what the villain's thoughts are, they don't make any sense (what is funny to them is clear, but the punchline is missing or just bad, if that somehow makes sense? It's not a cynical approach, merely unhinged, which makes the tactical and magical domination all the more confusing). The author doesn't hide who is responsible for the chaos, or at least makes it obvious, and that's fine, but that's why the why of their actions is so much more important. Maybe it's different for other people, but just deciding the villain's motivation is that they're crazy, doesn't fit when they are also successful - much of what defeated Voldemort was his own fault, rather than the actions of three kids.

Overall, I'd also mention that it's noticeable the author doesn't like Hermione, since they focus on all of her negatives and failures. That's also fine, but I do want to point it out.

Basically, I don't find it particularly chilling, because so much of the context is missing. Actually the international war part was the most interesting in the fic. Overall a decent fic that is well written, especially since it's their first go at publishing!

**** I absolutely agree with your point on the lack of motivation. That is the story's biggest flaw. I wish that 3CP had given context for Harry's fall too, and I think he would have done so if it wasn't a one-shot. It's a common opinion throughout the comments and reviews on FFN and AO3 and I hope 3CP opts to write a further one-shot in this world explaining Harry's motivations.

As for your point about the Hermione-hating being obvious, I absolutely agree. Killing Hermione off at the very end of the story displayed that prominently. The reason I commented on 3CP's hatred of Hermione was not that he portrayed her in a positive light (that would be extremely OOC for him), but rather that he took a character he despised and based the events taking place on her perception of them, rather than Harry's, as is often done in Dark Harry stories.

Finally, as to not finding the story chilling, most of it isn't, I agree. The part I was referencing in the original post was the scene where the Veela turned on their allies in the international war segment --- which I agree was the best part of the fic. In particular, the scene where it describes how Fleur rips out Bill's spine and then proceeds to kneel to Harry, still coated in her husband's blood. That's what gave me and other readers I know the chills. Obviously, not everyone has the same reaction, which is something you pointed out.

** linkao3(A Beast's Virtue by Arliene) It is a shame this fic is abandoned. The writing is not great sometimes imo but it avoids all of canon rehash, the plot is pretty great. Every group has their own agenda. I enjoyed the secret society group in this fic a lot. Harry doesn't get his way but others don't either. It subverts a lot of tropes like getting that unique special wand but it is not a good thing and he gets rid of it and both getting the wand and getting rid of it is actually related to the plot. Underage kissing is between Harry and another student. HP/LV doesn't actually come into fruitation, it also subverts this relationship. (Voldemort only implies possesiveness in the last chapters and Harry hates it. Harry also kills Horcrux Tom after he has a body and doesn't even bat an eye, although the same possesiveness is also implied a couple times with Horcrux Tom and Tom also tries to kill Harry when it suits him)

The association(the secret society) reminded me of Bene Gesserit from Dune in some ways. Everyone's plans usually change according to other group's plans, and even when Harry wins it is through sacrifice and it costs him. He is better than any other wizards his age but he doesn't become OP, he is still hopeless when he is left with no allies and he doesn't compare to the powerful adults in the story, he just shows potential.

It is a dark story over all but in a realistic way, not in the way bolshevik muppet does it and it turns to torture porn for MC. It flows naturally and when I think back to some plot points, I tell myself yeah that was fucked up.

And I don't mean Harry Potter's Earth is the 40k galaxy, I mean it's a retelling of the story. You don't need to know much about 40k, really, as it should be explained as the story goes on. I highly recommend it, whether you're a fan of Warhammer or not.

  A retelling of Harry Potter 1, where instead of a wizard, Harry finds out he's a psyker, and instead of 1990s Britain, it's set in the Grim Darkness of the Far Future.

** I was rereading again “[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5141159][Breakfast in New York]]” by Radaslab and I don't know for certain why it aggravates me so much. Certainly there is the conflict between generally good and original plot and tiring execution. The plot seems to be not completely overused (at least in the HP-fanfiction universe) and it has a potential to be rather nice romcom story. Of course, when “romance”, “breakfast”, and “New York” are used together, one has tendency to think about different [[https://youtu.be/1JfS90u-1g8][breakfast]], but even that gives the start of the story nice feeling of expectations. It is setup for nice we-lost-each-other-and-now-we-found-us story (“When Harry Met Sally”? Something of that sort), but it just broke down on execution. I wrote two posts about it already:

- [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/live-like-you-are-not-a-christian.html][the first post]] or how to be brief and how not to write a Christian in your story
- [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/one-more-on-breakfast-in-new-york.html][the second post]] or how not to valiantly defeat a purpose of every story (also see this [[https://youtu.be/8aprQXvWRXU][explanation on the key character flaw]]).

  The first Battle of Hogwarts is over, but the war isn't won. Snape has found a Horcrux and he plans to destroy it, but he finds himself in a web he cannot escape alone. What or who else will he destroy in the process? How much of herself is Hermione willing to sacrifice to comfort him in his time of need? And how can she help if she is afraid to use her magic?

*** I found the romance in Pandemic to be subversive. There is Harry's idealized ideas - total obsession really! - about what romance should be which takes a life of its own with the Obscurial. It really reminded me of friends who don't want to settle unless they know it is the One. But the actual relationship was domestic like an already married couple without romance. The kind of signals I usually read about like physical attraction or constantly thinking about the other party were totally not there. The contrast between Harry's ideas and the actual relationship stood out to me. After the Obscurial is healed(?) it felt like Harry's ideas about love got practical like he is in other parts of his life. fixing the link. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28860678]])

There Will Be Love (Not Half as Much Privilege) By Turandokht

A truest excellent alternate universe story where Voldemort wins, kills Harry and triggers the nuclear apocalypse. Hermione and other survivors fight for the Russian coalition against the forces of Voldemort.

It's bellatrix/Hermione which I know is a turn off for many, but it does a startlingly good job of making it a believable relationship, and, in my opinion, even if you dislike the ship, the rest of the story is still totally worth it.

It incorporates a stunning amount of detail about post soviet Russia, military strategy and weaponry, middle eastern and Slavic mythology, into a really nail biting story. The few OC characters that receive much “screen time” are well characterized and fleshed out, as are all of the canon characters that survived. It's not quite done yet, but it started a year ago and already has 90 out of 100 chapters complete, the most recent one being uploaded today, so it unlikely not to get finished. I'm really excited for the grand finale. Go give it some love people.
