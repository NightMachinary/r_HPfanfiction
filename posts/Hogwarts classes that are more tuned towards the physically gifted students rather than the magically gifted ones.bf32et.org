Of course there are broomstick lessons, but they're only for first years. Quidditch is more of a school sport rather than a subject, and only a handful of students participate in it. Charms could get quite physical when duelling, but that also requires a lot of magic.

I'm writing a character who has very mediocre to weak magic, but is very athletic. Where do you think he could shine in the most?

These are the subjects I KNOW he will do bad on: - Transfiguration - Charms (not the duelling aspect) - DADD - Apparition

If there are no other good subjects involving physical activities, should I add a Physical Education/Wellness subject? Would readers be okay with that?

I'm reluctant to add this because it would contradict the entire purpose of Hogwarts, which is a school for witchcraft and wizardry, but I want to showcase my character's strengths.


** Rowling's magic world is loosely based on western magicks, particularly magicks of thelema, where intent is everything. To have strong intent, you need to have strong mind.

If a character is physically fit, then he has more healthy mind, that means he has slightly better chances to have strong mind. So physical excercises may indirectly improve your magic.

Everything is connected. "Magically gifted" and "physically gifted" aren't exactly isolated.

Also, if your character is more physically gifted, then his body parts are more used to faster reactions, which gives him edge in duelling.

So, you can make your character average in magical subjects, yet deadly at dueling.

Also Potions, Astronomy etc. don't need that much of "magical aptitude". So you can make him good at them?

Finally, I want to ask a question. What is your defnition of magic?

Is it something that is present inside the wizards, witches and other magical beings/creatures...magical cores or mana etc. etc?

Or is it something that is ubiquitous in nature (like an electromagnetic field), but only wizards, witches and other magical beings/creatures can consciously/unconsciously sense it, manipulate it and channel it through them?

I would suggest taking this and driving it even further.

Your MC is athletically gifted, so let him be "the youngest seeker in a century" instead of Potter. Now that he's on a Quidditch team with people years older (and much more physiologically developed) he feels /huge/ pressure to keep up. He starts doing pre-dawn runs around the Black Lake and early-dawn drills on the pitch and yadda yadda.

He gets his hands on Muggle books that relate to fitness and such (don't fall into the trope of "martial arts uber alles" but instead it's stuff like yoga and pilates and body weight fitness and such). The personal discipline and mental fortitude that it takes to keep pushing helps build his willpower, even if his IQ and magical power are still stagnant.

In a way, that's not all that different that Potter in canon. Not necessarily a magical powerhouse, but when it comes down to it, he can do remarkable things (win a battle of wills with Voldemort during the Priori Incantatem, repel 100 dementors with his Patronus, etc.). Show him stumble frequently in academics, but give him a few moments to really shine based on his willpower and perseverence.

Then, the place to really pull out all the stops is in the Triwizard Tourament. Make the MC a couple of years older than Harry, so he's able to enter legitimately. Gets mocked by friend and foe alike for thinking he even has a chance. And then... wonder of wonders, the goblet chooses him.

How does this new character deal with the Tournament when he struggles to even sustain a bubblehead charm? How does he stack up against powerhouses like Krum and Delacour? How does he react to Harry? Change the Tournament to make it actually interesting rather than the boring canon bullshit and you've got the bones of a really, really good story.

**** Yes, but an insecure mind can be scarily good at magic sometimes. Because he is insecure, he constantly double checks and triple checks his spells and tries to eliminate even most minor of errors.

This may either result in improvement of his spells or simply burn out

*** That's a nice take on it.

The character I'm writing is, though still young, extremely intelligent. A genius, even, on top of being extremely athletic, so that already gives him the edge against other characters.

That's why I'm toning down his magic. He's not even supposed to be a wizard, but somebody did something and voila.

I guess my take on magic is that it is ubiquitous in nature, but only magical beings such as witch, wizards, magical creatures, AND magical “things” influenced by magic have access to it. Their access is limited to whatever is present within them (magical core, charms, casted spells, etc)

In this case, the character I'm writing isn't a conventional wizard with a magical core, but is more of a magical “item”.

Anyway, thanks for the answer!

** I think Hogwarts is magic school what teaches magic, so none of the classes would be tuned towards physically gifted students. Just like there doesn't seem to be any tuned to artist, musicians and etc.

If you want to add more general curriculum to Hogwarts, I think most readers will welcome it. You can also add student sports clubs.

Or maybe you can have you character be torn between magic and potential sports career in muggle world.\\
Or you can invent am extra magic class. Something like Avatar martial arts style magic which is usually practiced in Asia or smth.

*** Bending magic would actually be interesting to see in the HP world. Maybe I can set up an event where witches and wizards from ALL OVER the world visit Hogwarts and share their way of magic, and the character I'm writing will improve his magic that way.

Thanks for the answer!

** Care of magical creatures immediately comes to mind. Think Newt in Fantastic Beasts.

Herbology and potions ("...there will be no foolish wand waving...") also come to mind.

** Maybe have him be only good at select magic from each branch, choosing what seems pratical and ignoring the rest? He could like cheering charms and summoning charms but finds charms to make your silverware dance pointless. Transfiguring your physical equipment to best suit what sport your playing is pratical, but who needs to make a rock into a dog? Potions that help relax your muscle aches and strains are good, but draught of living death is a downer and pretty useless.

You get what I'm saying by now. He can be smart and athletic, but academically apathetic to things that don't affect his interests.
