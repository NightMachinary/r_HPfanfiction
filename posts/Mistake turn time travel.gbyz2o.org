:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been searching high and low for this time travel fic. Basically a mistake happens when a curse is cast and Draco,Ron,Hermione and Snape are sent to the 1890s. They stay in a house of the headmistress at the time and befriend a ghost King Henry?. It's a very interesting story. Does anyone know this crazy story.
