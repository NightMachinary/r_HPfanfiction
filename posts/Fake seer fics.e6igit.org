i really love time travel fics where a character pretends to be a seer; however, the character inevitably comes clean, usually with Dumbledore or someone.

so, are there any fics where a character time travels to their past, pretends to be a seer, and keeps up the charade through the whole fic?


** Reminds me sort of linkffn(Oh God Not Again!), where Harry keeps telling exactly what will happen to everyone, gets proven right, and just answers its a Boy-Who-Lived thing.

**** It is. The sheer quantity of piss-taking he's doing makes it intensely frustrating for everyone who watches him getting proven right.

** I love fics like these too. But I had this idea that the protagonist has to reveal to people that he is from the future when they is no reason to do so.

You find that Harry is doing well in terms of saving people, then he decides let me tell Dumbledore I'm from the future for no apparent reason.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15439710/chapters/35837847]])

This fic isn't relevant to what you want to find and it isn't finished, not even halfway finished yet so I don't know whether Harry would "reveal" himself or not, but in this fic, Harry did travel to the past, did chose to present to be Harry Potter the muggle-born and his divination teacher, who is a seer, quickly saw through his mask then cornered Harry about who he really is. Harry, being a dork like he is, told his teacher he's a time traveler, then his teacher like: "Nope, stop talking, I'm too young, too love my life for this shit" then proceeded to teach Harry how (pretend) to be a seer. Spoiler: His great-great grandpa from his mother's side, also figures who Harry is without Harry tells him. Oh, he's also a pretend seer, magician.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

**** Harry doesn't pretend to be a seer here- rather he pretends to be a divination teacher. I really recommend this fic, although it's incomplete.
