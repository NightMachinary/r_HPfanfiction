Basically as the title says, I want to read a fanfiction where Harry behaves like a marauder, making pranks on students and staff, Harry doesn't let Snape humiliate him in class, etc.

/I prefer long fanfics, + 100k words./

I thank you in advance.


** The marauders didnt play pranks lol, they btoke school rules, but werent pranksters.

Harry acted alot like his father with his nighttime sneaking and whatnot, pranks are the twins, not marauders

*** Not to mention that James and Sirius were incredibly intelligent, more so than Remus, people often forget that and make them nothing more than 'dumb pranksters'. James is portrayed as a dumb jock whereas Sirius is a womaniser - both are incorrect.

  Harry Potter was not above doing whatever it took to get what he wanted. It often meant he'd have to go to extreme lengths to make people suffer for their stupidity, but the results were always worth it. This Harry Potter takes things too literally. ON PURPOSE.
