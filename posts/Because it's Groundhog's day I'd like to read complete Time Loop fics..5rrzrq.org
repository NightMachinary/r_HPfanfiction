For those of you who don't know, Groundhog's Day is a US holiday celebrated on February 2nd. There's also a movie called Groundhog's Day where Bill Murray repeats the same day over and over again. What completed fics are there with this same type of circumstances?

** The name slips my mind rn, but the only good one I know is a SnapexHermione fanfic that I didn't read on ff.net. There's something to do with a potions accident, and the loop ends everytime with Hermione dying. As they loop through, reality starts to unravel.

  It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?
