** 11/22/63 by Stephen King

31/10/81 (To go with British calendar): Harry travels back in time (with the same style of time travel as 11/22/63) to save his parents from their terrible fate. The date he returns to could be a couple years before, maybe even James and Lily's last year in Hogwarts.

** Ex Machina.

I even wrote a small chapter 1 piece on the idea that arose from it:

*** I had an idea kind of the same. A terminatoresque golem is designed by harry and built and sent back by his friends after he's murdered to try to change the past only for it to begin to develop a real personality as it falls in love with sirius.

** Well, I've wanted to see a Harry Potter version of [[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105695/][Unforgiven]], but not necessarily the plot. Unforgiven is essentially a deconstruction of Western movies and tropes [[/spoiler][but ends with a resounding reaffirmation of Western movies and tropes]]. I'd like to see something similar with a Harry Potter fic or even just a straight up fantasy novel.

** I think Stephen Kings It would be a great plot for HP. It would have to be fairly AU to have the losers club be HP Characters. I also imagine Pennywise being some sort of uber/alpha/ultimate combo of a dementor, Boggart, and maybe lethifold.

*** I've mused on it before. But Pennywise is such a great villain on his own. i also thought having a muggleborn kid whose fear is Pennywise facing the boggart in Remus's year and having that be harry's big bad because Pennywise was real and stephen king was relating a real event and took over the new body the kid made for him

** I really like the idea of a Revenant-style revenge story, about where Harry - wounded and left for dead in a hostile environment, with some great wrong being inflicted on him or his family/friends - has to survive and recover, becoming bent and twisted around his obsession with revenge.

Eventually he'd manage it, but I'd want him to have to take a long, hard look at himself at the same time, and realise how inhuman he'd become in his pursuit of vengeance, for a more bittersweet ending.

** This isn't really in a specific movie, but, you know how in some movies, your main character is either lost at sea, fighting in a war, or was generally thought to be dead and when he comes back, he finds someone else has taken his place in his family? I always thought that that would be interesting to see.

linkffn(The Prisoner's Cipher) Covered upon this briefly during the Flashback scenes when the war really hit the fan and Harry had to make his presence more known throughout Hogwarts, I generally enjoyed hearing about how Ron rose to take Harry's place when he left, because it gave the character a bit more purpose, and overall lightened the load Harry had to hold. There's also the fact that it heavily explored Harry's dealing with his inevitable destiny and being a Teenager, attempting and failing to juggle both, and ultimately having to choose being the Chosen One.

  AU. Years after his defeat of Voldemort, Harry Potter remains a willing and secret prisoner of the Ministry, but not all is what it seems. Harry has a plan, and the world will never be the same.

** I recently was reading a blog post about the movie Laura when looking up tragic romances and thought "What if auror Harry is sent to investigate the death of a muggleborn he's never met? He falls in love with the idea of Hermione Granger and her portrait as he investigates her notes and diary entries, trying to discern who may have had motive to blast her head off with a reducto as she answered the door." He would end up discovering it wasn't hermione but a friend who resembled her dimensionally, following the plot of Laura.

And then would diverge from my normal Harmony and have Harry go home to his empty flat while Hermione mourns the emd of her relationship with her attempted murderer(he hired someone), her fianc√© ron Weasley who was trying to inherit all her money. (Normally I'm not a fan of bashing characters just to bash but wanted to keep canon relationships.)

*** I like the idea of the loving the "idea" of a person, reminds me heavily of Detective Miller from the Expanse (if you watch that or have read the books). Can make for some super-interesting character development.

*** I think Ron may be a better Waldo, if not a little less flamboyant. He's got the connections factor, he's jealous of her fame, and he's actually her friend, yet his feelings for her and desire to have her drive him to do reprehensible things. Someone like Cormac, Blaise, or Draco would be a better Shelby..

But it's your story.
