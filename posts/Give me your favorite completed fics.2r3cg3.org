There hasn't been a thread like this in a while and I want some good suggestions for the new year!


** /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000][The Scarlet Pimpernel]]/ (50k words): Percy Weasley under Umbridge's Ministry is inspired by the Muggle story of an English aristocrat who spirited away French nobles during the Revolution.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005][Oh God Not Again!]]/ (200k words): A goofy rewind story; the fifth-most-favorited Harry Potter story on FanFiction.net, so you've probably read it already.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230][Concentric Wavelengths]]/ (20k words): A gory fiasco with Time-Turners in the Department of Mysteries.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690][Holly Evans and the Spiral Path]]/ (400k words, has a sequel on hiatus): While Harry is hidden in a secure location, his sister Holly goes to Hogwarts and writes to him through an enchanted one-way notebook.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086][Almost a Squib]]/ (50k words): Harry's magic is next to nonexistent, but he's still a very resourceful boy.

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6275865][Remus Lupin, PI]]/ (100k words): Unable to get a good job due to being a werewolf, Lupin becomes a private investigator--and happens to find discrepancies in the official story on Sirius...

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9408516][Hit the Ground Running]]/ (100k words): The Horcrux in Harry's head wakes up and advises him.

** I only read fics that are completed and >100k words, with a main character that is powerful (read: might not win every battle, but holds his own vs strong opponents. Strength progression - see denarian series- is ideal).

*In no particular order:*

A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles

#+begin_quote
  (/Unexpectedly outstanding/)
#+end_quote

A Black Comedy

#+begin_quote
  (/Didn't expect to actually laugh a lot, but I did. Great story/)
#+end_quote

Denarian Renegade/Knight/Lord

#+begin_quote
  (/read recently, this was stunning/)
#+end_quote

The Lie I've Lived

#+begin_quote
  (/Great bant, sorting hat my fav. character in fanfiction after this/)
#+end_quote

Delenda Est

#+begin_quote
  (/Fun read, all characters talk in the same way though but can be overlooked/)
#+end_quote

Wastelands of Time

#+begin_quote
  (/Excellent example of how to have an OP!Harry while making Voldemort even stronger/)
#+end_quote

Stages of Hope

#+begin_quote
  (/Strong MCs, dimension travel, bit of melodrama./)
#+end_quote

Innocent

#+begin_quote
  (/Hadn't read a Sirius raises harry fic before, I liked the great characterization. Has a sequel too/)
#+end_quote

Methods of Rationality

#+begin_quote
  (/flame shield/)
#+end_quote

Gryffindor's Never Die

#+begin_quote
  (/not 100k words, but I like time travel and I enjoyed the Harry/Ron bromance/)
#+end_quote

*For two fics that weren't as good, but were a fun read/guilty pleasure:*

The Darkness Within series

#+begin_quote
  (kinda angsty, tried a bit hard to be emotional)
#+end_quote

Harry Crow

#+begin_quote
  (gets repetitive and takes the Godlike!Harry a bit too far)
#+end_quote

Apparently the Sacrifices arc is good, although at 3.1 million words i'm not sure whether to start it. Would appreciate if anyone else could tell me if Harry is overpowered? Part of the fun of these stories is when everyone respects the MC for his abilities - if he's not the BWL then he had better be a badass.

*** I kept passing over the Sacrifices arc because I didn't like the whole not the BWL thing or the Harry/Draco. I saw it recommended so many times and was super bored of everything I usually read so I started reading it. i thought I'd end up not reading the whole thing because it would be stupid. I was wrong. It was absolutely amazing and so worth the time.

****** dude i'm around halfway through the second book. There have been moments when i'm literally yelling in frustration at how much of a bitch Harry is. Aside from the fact he's not even treated like a member of the family and more of a bodyguard, Connor is such an absolute dickhead it's unreal. I hardly ever stop reading fics but if this carries on much longer I think i'm gonna have to with this one. It's just unrealistic how much shit he can take from his own brother. When he see's Harry standing by the first CoS message, the little shit has no thought processes of "wait a minute this guy has saved me from like 12 different things because i'm a little shit" - instead he just jumps straight to "so harry how long you been serving voldemort wah wah". God damn. I want him to die so bad. Haven't felt like this about a character since Suzaku from Code Geass.

******* I remember that vaguely. I read these easily 8 years ago or so, so it's been quite a while. My idea of quality back then definitely isn't what it is now.

The main attraction of the series has to be its absolutely /absurd/ length, and that when it was being written, the author would update a 5k+ word chapter /every single day/.

To be honest, I've had no urge to go back and reread it, mostly because of exactly what you said. I hate when the MC is a pathetic bitch, and that's Harry for the first 5+ books.

The really annoying thing is that Harry is ridiculously powerful in this series magically. He's just got no fucking spine.

***** I read like 2 books of that fic a while ago, and from what I can remember, Harry was awesomely strong and competent, but that was evened out by his desperate need for psychotherapy, and no time to get it. Actually, pretty sure I stopped reading because it was getting depressing how the kid never got at clean victory at anything.

*** Fantastic fic. Link here: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BY.html][Beneath You by Cinnamon at FictionAlley]].

Summary:Draco had no idea that the repercussions of stealing Potter's journal and shoving it down the back of his trousers would be so extreme. Featuring nefarious plots, the mating rituals of Slytherins, double-crossing spells, Ron/Pansy, and Draco/Harry. Rated R.

Cinnamon's other fic, [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]], is also very good if you want more H/D.

Summary: Draco is afraid of living and Harry is afraid of dying, but sometimes the choice isn't offered. Draco's got to learn what it is to really live, while showing Harry how beautiful the world really is when you're not too scared to see it. Rated R.

** In terms of any completed fics, pairing and crossover irregardless?

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6031176/1/Tied-for-Last][Tied for Last]]/ by Speechwiter: "Hermione is killed by Voldemort, and is now dead. Well, sort of. Turns out that death is a little more complex than she knew... Ignores epilogue and last 50ish pages of DH."

(Personal note: This is, hands down, /the best/ Harry Potter fanfic I have /ever/ read.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6113733/1/Have-a-Nice-Day][Have a Nice Day!]]/ by Speechwriter: "Tom Riddle: secret, brilliant heir to the biggest company in the world, VoldeMart. Hermione Granger: sent to his prestigious school on full scholarship because VoldeMart outsourced her parents' jobs to China. Bridges burn. Sparks fly. M for language."

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8618289/1/Nightmare][Nightmare]]/ by provocative-envy: "A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened."

(Personal note: Rated M for lemons/sex scenes and near-constant use of the 'F' word.)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5034546/1/Ultima-ratio][Ultima Ratio]]/ by Winterblume: "Ultima ratio - the last resort. At last the day of the Final Battle against Lord Voldemort has come. Harry, Ron and Hermione fight bravely against their nemesis - but then something goes wrong. And Hermione finds herself alone in a precarious situation."

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2104141/1/The-Stag-and-the-Dragon][The Stag and the Dragon]]/ by Kenya Starflight: "Crossover and OoTP AU. It's Harry's fifth year, and a desperate Dumbledore hires a new Dark Arts teacher who might prove to wreak more havoc than Umbridge ever could... Darth Vader."

** Tread Softly ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1847353/1/Tread-Softly]]) It's Harry/Snape slash. I don't like this pairing, but this fic was sooo good.

Bottle-Specs ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10007867/1/Bottle-Specs]]) This is Sirus/OC het. I don't like this pairing either, but I think it really appealed to my adoration of cheesy romances, lol.

Give him love ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5675149/1/Give-Him-Love]]) James S.P/Neville slash. So good.

Stages of Hope ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope]]) This one is also very good.

Okay, so I went through my favourite list. This is why my opinions for each fic sound the same. Hope you find something you like!

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/496883][Pocket Full of Starlight]]

Summary: When Scorpius Malfoy and Jamie Potter meet at Quidditch camp, they take an instant dislike to each other. Then they discover their lives are more connected than they could possibly imagine.

Prompt: 'The Parent Trap (1998)' Identical twins find each other again after many years. After some disagreements with each other they turn their sights on getting their fathers back together. And Merlin help anyone who tries to get in their way.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6599633/1/Where-the-Shore-Ended-and-the-Sea-Began][Where the Shore Ended and the Sea Began]]

Summary: When visiting Draco in Finistère, Harry disappears. Draco is sent to prison for his murder on circumstantial evidence. But Harry's body is never found, and whenever Draco is near the sea, he senses Harry's presence.

"In the dream Draco was gliding through glassy water, watching shoals of silvery fish turn and dart away as he approached. The brightness of the surface faded away as he descended into the green depths with smooth, effortless strokes. The water was silky and cool and there was no danger here, only hope."

This is one of my absolute favorites that I truly think everyone in the H/D fandom should read as it is the single most beautiful piece of fanfiction I have ever read. The imagery is so beautiful and rich that I feel like I can taste the saltwater. I've never had a story feel like that before. This story stuck with me so much that I hunted it down again four years after reading it (when I couldn't find it) because I never forgot it.
