Just caught up in reading [[https://fanfiction.net/s/13802539/1/Breaking-binds-and-living-free][Breaking Binds and Living Free]] by Srijan, would want some fics where Harry is a pureblood, preferred complete or at least regularly updated. Don't mind who he's paired to and who he's parents are on the fics

  Pure-blood Culture: His name is Heir Harry James Potter, not Heir Hydrus Sirius Black. Nothing will change his mind . . . except for Lady Daralise Malfoy.

  REPOST: SLASH LV/HP: AU: Lucius has twin boys. Voldemort is asking for his servants' firstborn child. Thinking it's an honor; Lucius gives Voldemort the healthy child, Draco, who happens to be the younger twin. Harry grows up the black sheep of the Malfoy family and befriends Mudbloods and the boy-who-lived, Neville. Eventually, he ends up being disowned from the Malfoy family. Things spiral out of control when Voldemort finds out Harry is the firstborn. He'll stop at nothing to get Harry on his side. After all, the ritual Voldemort wants to use will not work without Harry. For the Dark Lord wants to eat off the children's magic once they are of age.
