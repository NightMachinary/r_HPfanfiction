I've only gotten into fanfics recently, and so I've been going through some of the more popular ones. Some of them are really, really great. And others are just...meh.

A few that are pretty popular and I think are really well done: On the Way to Greatness, Hogwarts Battle School, Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived. Unfortunately, two of them are on hiatus at the moment (and On the Way to Greatness is looking more and more like it won't ever be completed). But all three have great writing, good characterization, and intriguing plots.

A few that are pretty popular but I'm not terribly fond of: Nightmares of Futures Past and Backwards With a Purpose. I don't want to bash, and I will say that both of these have their moments. In fact, I genuinely enjoyed reading them. But I wouldn't put them on a Top 10 or even Top 20 list, despite their overwhelming popularity. If anyone wants details, I can explain more why I'm not huge fans of either, but I don't want to be overly critical, especially because I don't know if the authors are here.

Thoughts?

(BTW, why is Nightmares of Futures Past is the number one favorited fic on Fanfiction.net? I rarely see it getting recommended around here. Was the whole back in time thing really novel when it came out? Or do people like it for other reasons?)


** Popular fics I hate: HPMOR, Harry Crow, Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness

Popular fics I like: Backward with Purpose, Delenda Est, Heart and Soul, Oh God Not Again!, Seventh Horcrux, Stages of Hope, The Accidental Bond

****** I love Remus/Sirius, especially in the Marauder days.

linkffn(Casting Moonshadows) is great, probably my favourite Remus/Sirius out there. It's not completed, but it's also not abandoned, the author just takes six months to a year to post new chapters now.

linkao3(Cartographer's Craft) Harry/Sirius, but Sirius is Harry's age so it isn't creepy. Also acts as a good replacement for book 7 (written in 2005 no less.)

linkffn(Once in a Blue Moon COMPLETE) it's been ages since I've read it, but it's a great AU of the Marauder years.

linkffn(Hairy Snout, Human Heart) another AU Marauder year, but don't bother with the sequel. It's not only abandoned it's also not that great (James pretends to be a werewolf to get the heat off of Remus, honestly!)

Keep in mind these are /fairly/ old, so they may have a couple cliches in them, but over all I think they hold up great. They are also, by and large, 'focused' on the pairing. While they all have plenty of plot (and all of it quite good) they are primarily romance fics.

******* That's sort of the issue with slash stories, isn't it? Most fanfic authors can't do subtle. If they're writing slash, chances are, it's going to be up in your face. And let's face it, JKR said Dumbledore was gay, but the dude was over 100 years old when he died. When is the last time you think he got his freak on? 1930? It wasn't relevant to canon at all (nor was there anything overtly hinting at his supposed orientation), so it's a non-issue.

******** Isn't this the same regarding any fic where the main focus is a pairing? Like there's nothing "subtle" (whatever that means....) about fics with pairings, ESPECIALLY if the pairing is non-canon compliant. Like what's the difference between a draco/hermione and a remus/sirius in terms of "subtlety" or plausibility?

On the other hand, because some people feel so uncomfortable with slash, it must be explicitly stated that the story is about slash. But then many readers who like slash want to read a story where the romantic pairing IS the focus of the story. In addition, I feel like a lot more development is needed in slash pairings because these relationships are viewed as non-normative.

Like it'd be easy to have an adventure fic that has ron/hermione pairing in the background as a given, because it's easier to imagine them together (also because it's canon compliant). Have a slash pairing just hanging out in the background and people grumble that they don't want to read slash, and that it isn't plausible that those characters are together.

That's just my two cents.

********* What I'm saying, is that by subtlety, there's a sort of shock-factor involved. Like, if someone is writing Harry as being gay, they're almost always a pairing involved. Like, if someone is writing Harry/Draco, you can be assured that the author is going to be writing them getting it on at some point in time. Otherwise, what would be the point of writing it to begin with. That's not to mention, the amount of slash stories without a pairing is almost non-existent.

But, when you have normal, straight Harry, that's not necessarily the case. There's thousands of stories of him being straight and him going on adventures where him being straight doesn't matter at all. There's many, many stories where he's straight but there's no pairing. Many more where there is a pairing, but it's background and not relevant, or the story isn't about romance.

The Naruto fanfic archive has so many fics and 100x as many readers, so they get shunted to the top of the sort by favorites due to the raw amount of fans "favoriting" something, despite its quality or lack thereof. Ever notice how, when you're searching a crossover with /anything/, Naruto fics tend to be on top? That's the "Naruto Syndrome" at work.

**** I didnt know you read naruto fanfiction :3 thats great. Its my first fandom, and tbh, I still read it abit more than other fandoms... maybe we can talk some more on another thread lol

BUT back to the point, I would say that is an issue with EVERY major fandom. I get what you are saying tho, having read most of the major Naruto works, there are a massive amount that arent great just like harry potter. The biggest difference for me is that Harry Potter's fanfic list is around 1.5 times as large as naruto's (on FFnet) so its more prevalent to me there. Good point tho

***** Point to you.

I chose Naruto for the example because, personally, I see way more Naruto crossovers. Let's say you're looking for a Harry Potter crossover with, let's say, Lord of the Rings, of which there are 874 according to FF.net. If I were to sort by show all crossovers, sorted by favorites, there's a ton of Avengers, Marvel related characters, Star Wars and Naruto. (Admittedly I could do better buy just going to the HP/LotR subsection, but maybe I want to see the "top" (most favorited) crossovers.)

It's even worse when your base series to be crossed over is an anime, because they suffer really hard from "Naruto Syndrome".

I love reading just how drastic the contrasts are for magic and wizards in the two works. Having been a HP fan first, it took me a while to wrap my head around the fact that wizards in LOTR are basically lesser gods, and thus, why there are only five of them in Middle-earth.

Pet Project by Caeria is one of my favorites, Isolation by bex-chan and as previously mentioned Stages of Hope was pretty great.

/The Bad/

Poison Pen, Partially Kissed Hero, The Marriage Stone.

/The Ugly/

Obligatory anything by robst here, but a special horrible goes out to In this World and the Next. Yuck.

On a side note, I don't hate HPMOR, and honestly think its technical writing is decent, but I do dislike the inherent smugness and sense of superiority that come with rationalist retellings. I've read a Superman one that was decent, though, so they're not all bad.

However, I'm not a big fan of On the Way to Greatness - it's technically well-written, but treads too close to canon for my liking, and I believe that a good story should have a creative and original plot. Hogwarts Battle School is one of the popular fics I most dislike, partly for the same reason that I hate Ender's Game, which it's based upon. Anything starring Hermione is usually a terrible wish-fulfillment self-insert that treads dangerously close to Mary-Sue.

The list of terrible popular fics also includes Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Dumbness, What Would Slytherin Harry Do, Methods of Rationality, Make a Wish, A Black Comedy, Applied Cultural Anthropology, C'est La Vie, Stages of Hope, and everything by Shezza.

Really, most of the popular fics are massively overrated.

****** I haven't read the fic so I can't give any meaningful opinion.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what goes wrong in this genre, since it mostly stems from bad writing that is generally all over fanfiction. In most stories I've read, Harry and his companions don't really do much to change things, so you just read about them kinda going through canon events again in a different light, the plot is maddeningly slow, and they behave neither like children OR adults. Then there's a lot of wangst about seeing people that died in the original timeline, and Harry can barely stop himself from crying because of it (Harry was never that emotional in canon, and it annoys me seeing him being so emotionally weak).

It's supposed to be, like you said, "life on cheat-mode", yet they can't do anything right even on easy-mode, which makes them look dumb and incompetent - something that I have no interest reading about. Those time-travelers still fall into all those stupid pitfalls like picking petty fights with Malfoy or letting Pettigrew escape. The only story that actually did that right was Reunion by Rorsharch's Blot - not that I like the fic very much, but at least the characters quickly did what they came to do, instead of fucking around.

If Harry and his companions willingly go back in time, of course they're going to see people, then-alive, who die(d) in the future. In /Prisoner of Azkaban/, when Harry doesn't know what's going on with the Time-Turner, he seems largely confused. Even after Hermione explains their time-travel, however, Harry doesn't get weepy or emotional at the sight of Buckbeak or Sirius.

** NOFP is awful. It's mostly so high up on the popularity list, because it's a self-fulfilling, cascading sort of effect. Lots of new readers will search the fandom, and sort by most popular, and read the most popular fics, thus making them more popular. They don't yet have the experience to realize what classifies as a good or bad fic, so if they enjoy it, they'll likely forever think it's the best thing ever. This is true of nearly every story in the top 25. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/book/Harry-Potter/?&srt=4&r=10]]

Like, I look at that list, and there's only a handful of fics there that I would consider worthy of the praise. A Black Comedy is the best story on that list, and I really don't even think it's that close. Make-A-Wish is decent and his its moments, though I don't think it has aged well at all. Then there is Deprived, which despite being off the walls random and cliche-ridden at first glance, is readable and amusing at times, but shouldn't be anywhere near as popular as it apparently is. But then you got stuff like Poison Pen and Harry Crow, which are just terrible, Delende Est which should have been abandoned after chapter 20 to avoid the trainwreck it turned into, and things like The Lie I've Lived and Methods of Rationality which are super polarizing (and I don't think either are good). I won't go into fics like Isolation because I have no desire to read that pairing, or several of the other fics which are over a decade old and likely severely outdated.

Some popular fics (not on that list) the hold up are (off the top of my head) on the way to greatness, intoxication, out of the night, wastelands of time, ectomancer, incorruptible: the dementor's stigma, the unforgiving minute, timely errors, denarian trilogy, browncoat green eyes, thief of hogwarts

some popular fics that don't: Vincet, bungle in the jungle, harry potter and the boy who lived, I'm still here, passageways, letters, grow young with me, the darkness within (kurinoone), c'est la vie, a second chance at life, earl of the north, HP & the summer of change, a cadmean victory, to fight the coming darkness, prince of a dark kingdom, the well-groomed mind, everything by esama and clell.

Obviously, I find a lot of stories to be extremely overrated, and I'd likely be here all month listing all the ones I don't like. But, I've never been one to mince words. I've been reading fanfiction for long enough that I've entered the stage where I can see things objectively, and not get starry-eyed ove ra favorite pairing or genre, or succumb to a guilty pleasure and try and rationalize why it's good.
