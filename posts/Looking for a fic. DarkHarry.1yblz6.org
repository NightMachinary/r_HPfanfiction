I have read so many fics, I can't remember much from this one except that Pansy's father was a necromancer and she decided to become one as well. She has to dress in all black and cover her face and can only speak 2 days out of the year, on the Solstices, I believe. That's all I remember for sure.

I think it involved Harry doing a yearly ritual where he felt dark magic and being involved in it. He was good friends with Snape and Draco, I think. I feel like this is a relatively popular fic, and I want to reread it, but I can't remember what it is!

Please help!!!


** I just recc'd this in another thread actually... Its part of the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Saving Connor]], Sacrifice Arc... one of the later books. You meet her father in book three, but as I'm just rereading it for the first time since my hurried, marathon read originally, my details are fuzzy after this book. :D
