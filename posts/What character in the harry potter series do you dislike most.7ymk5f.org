** I think the hatred towards Ron is unfounded. If your best friend was rich and famous, while you are the forgotten child of a poor family, would you not be jealous? Insecure? Yea. Given Harry's closeness with Hermione, even though they only share a platonic relationship, its understandable Ron would be insecure. And as for Ron abandoning Harry, its negated by the fact that he's stuck by Harry and risked his life multiple times. Ron seems easy to hate when Hermione and Harry are portrayed as characters who can do no wrong.

But back to my most disliked character - it definitely has to be the greasy git. Doesn't matter if he served Dumbledore, he caused the death of Lily and James and probably left emotional damage on countless Hogwarts students.

** As a person? Fucking Snape. I despise Snape. I fail to understand how anyone can like him. The man was an utter failure that couldn't get over his childhood bullies. He was a creep who was obsessed with what seems like the only woman to ever show him any affection. He was responsible for said woman's death, but only because his first plan of "get my obsessions husband and child killed so she'll fall into my arms" went wrong. After that, he punishes a child for the sins of his father.

His only redeeming feature is that he worked to protect Harry's life, but he did so begrudgingly.

I /really/ hate how some people find his flat out obsession with Lily to be even remotely close to "love". You don't do the things he did to someone you love. The man arranged for the murder of her husband and child, and yet some people still celebrate his obsession as something worthwhile.

"Always" my ass. Fuck Snape.

*** Voldemort is almost cartoonishly evil, and less frightening for it; Umbridge is realistically evil, and entirely frightening because of it. She's an unquestioning ally to authority, and one who revels in the smallest taste of power, two things that make her more familiar than someone like Voldemort -- who /hasn't/ got on the bad side of some power-tripping, rule-abiding desk jockey?

** I hate Voldemort most, both as a literary character and his in-story behaviors. IMO, Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain.

Dumbledore could have easily killed off best of his supporters in the DoM and derailed his plan by who knows how long. But of course, the 'good guys' must not kill or they might sink as low as their enemies!

But even with 'good guys' fighting with both their hands tied behind their backs, this guy barely managed to hang onto power of a medium sized country for 10 months, before being overthrown by mostly teenagers. As the OP pointed out, he got killed while trying to take back a high school!

On the other hand, he was a genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills. In the end, his own foolishness (for example the excessive reliance on Avada Kedavra) got him killed and he was sent to rot in hell forever.

--------------

The pre-Horcrux Tom Riddle, however, could be far more interesting. I often wondered how much more he would have achieved if he had just followed more 'conventional' routes to power. Even the Voldemort during the First War might be a lot more interesting, and perhaps far less crazy. But unfortunately, his behaviors during both eras were not depicted in the Books, and we could only speculate.

--------------

I find it fascinating that so many would rather hate good characters with some personality flaws (annoying, bossy, lazy, passive) than those true sadistic genocidal maniacs.

*** On the good guys' side, Dumbledore gets my vote of most disliked character. I have ranted enough about him here and on [[/r/harrypotter]], but I now think Voldemort was really the cause for many of Dumbledore's 'failings'. Because if Dumbledore had just acted slightly more competent, as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], there would have been no plot.

I also hate that Roald Dahlesque Dursley scheme. But protagnists growing up in an abusive childhood is a time proven trope, such as Cinderella, Snow White, and Huckleberry Finn, so I can't really fault JKR for using it. One downside, of course, is that poor Dumbledore character gets the blame.

That's the Umbridge Paradox. You rarely ever see pure-evil people like Voldemort or Bellatrix or Nagini in real life, so you feel kinda removed from them --- they're just abstract fictional cutouts for the heroes to run away from. Whereas when facing an obstructive-goody-two-shoes-bureaucrat like Percy, or an elderly-person-in-power-who-thinks-they-know-best like Dumbledore, or a friend-who-turns-on-his-friends-in-stressful-situations like Ron, the average 21st century muggle identifies with the main characters a /lot/. They may rationally admit that Nagini is worse, but Ginny Weasley will trigger more of a gut-feeling of /annoyance/.

** Anyone with the Dark Mark. A bunch of sadistic, merry murderers, motivated by racism, attempting a coup d'etat out of selfish reasons. Every member (including Snape and Malfoy) believed their ideology at some point. They are open about their goals so no one can claim they were unaware since exterminating the Mudbloods was always their main goal. The two redemptions we see are for personal reasons when the "redeemed" realise what their choice is costing them personally, not when they realise that genocide is wrong.

*** Malfoy: totally. Snape, on the other hand... I think there's room for interpretation. It's totally possible that he was just a broken madman obsessing over Lily and doing things for her sake alone, but I like better to think that Lily's death was more of a catalyzer for his realizing just how far he'd gone and turning himself around altogether. Much like Regulus, for whom the "turning-point" was learning Voldemort was not only carrying out mass murders that Reg already felt queasy about, but had /mutilated his own soul/.

***** On the latter point, that's all a matter of opinion. Certainly, most Christian schools of thinking (though I am not Christian myself, mind you) would say that if Snape's remorse was sincere, he could be forgiven.

As to the main point: whether it /actually/ redeems him in the absolute is irrelevant to my point. I think that, whether or not he can ultimately be called a "good" person, he was no psychopath, and his long-buried conscience was part of what prompted him to rebel against Voldemort once he had a strong enough "incentive" as catalyzer.

I mean, we do have Regulus Black as another example of a "canonically" redeemed Death Eater, don't we?

First of all, why would Ginny believe him when he DIDN'T tell her. How can you accuse her of something she isn't even involved in? What's the next step? Accusing Sirius of not believing him despite him being dead? Secondly, why would anyone else believe him? Harry doesn't have friends except Ron and (shudder) Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna. He didn't tell it to the last three, so you can't blame them. And I do believe that it's normal that McGonagall didn't believe him, she isn't his friend, she is his teacher. The only one who can take the blame here are Ron and Hermione.

You mean to say that when Ron took his distance because he was jealous of Harry entering the Tournament, he is the devil. But when Hermione is jealous because Harry got better grades it's okay? You can't blame something on someone and pardon the exact same thing on someone else just because it happen to be Hermione.

Maybe, but she did chose Dumbledore over Harry. Remember the begining of 5th year? When Harry was depressed and needed Hermione and Ron to tell him what's going on? Hermione never did because of Dumbledore's orders. A true friend would have said him to go f*** himself and would have done everything he can to help him.

  He forced down some dinner after Divination, then returned to the empty classroom with Hermione, using the Invisibility Cloak to avoid the teachers. They kept practicing until past midnight. (...)

  At two o'clock in the morning, Harry stood near the fireplace, surrounded by heaps of objects: books, quills, several upturned chairs, an old set of Gobstones, and Neville's toad, Trevor. Only in the last hour had Harry really got the hang of the Summoning Charm.

  “That's better, Harry, that's loads better,” Hermione said, looking exhausted but very pleased.

  “Well, now we know what to do next time I can't manage a spell,” Harry said, throwing a rune dictionary back to Hermione, so he could try again, “threaten me with a dragon. Right . . .” He raised his wand once more. “Accio Dictionary!”

  The heavy book soared out of Hermione's hand, flew across the room, and Harry caught it.

  “Harry, I really think you've got it!” said Hermione delightedly.

  “Just as long as it works tomorrow,” Harry said. “The Firebolt's going to be much farther away than the stuff in here, it's going to be in the castle, and I'm going to be out there on the grounds. . . .”

  “That doesn't matter,” said Hermione firmly “Just as long as you're concentrating really, really hard on it, it'll come. Harry, we'd better get some sleep . . . you're going to need it.”

Just one instance where Hermione helped Harry survive a dangerous situation by helping him learn stuff. She was also the brains behind the DA, saved Harry's life when they were in Godric's Hollow, correctly concluded that Sirius Black sent Harry a broom (although her actions following that thought were not particularly great), stopped Quirrel from cursing Harry's broom and figured out the Basilisk.
