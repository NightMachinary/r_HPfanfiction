The Charms classroom was suddenly covered in a deathlike chill. The students turned to see a vulture crash through the window,landing in the centre of the room and morphing into a hideous old woman

"Tremble in fear, puny children. Bow before your new queen Mori-"

"STUPEFY"

"Excellent work Miss Bones. You've been practising. 20 points to Hufflepuff."

Later that day

"Excellent practice team. Slytherin don't stand-wait. Where's Katie ?"

"Harpies snatched her"

"Ah man,we were meant to study together"

Katie Bell would reappear at dinner,sporting a rather lovely harpy skin coat.

That night in Astronomy

"Ur...Professor ?"

"Yes Mr.Boot ?"

"There's a star in the sky"

"That's normally how those work Mr.Boot"

"But...er.. it's coming this way.....and it's got a face."

Professor Sinistra sighed. It was only Tuesday and already shaping up to be a long week

**** /me remembers one Russian-language fic (:[[https://www.ficbook.net/readfic/8674131]] or [[https://author.today/work/46569]] ) in which:

- Original Characters finds himself back in time (or so he originally think) in body of young boy (son of wealthy muggle aristocrat).
- He finds himself magical and understood it's HP World.
- He read some books, saw some movies and serial. Except that there are several remakes of movies and he was not very attentive.
- So he basically only knew for sure about threat from dark mage while he will be in Hogwarts. He doesn't knew who it was (some remakes changed that). He doesn't knew level of threat (later remakes were made while humaninity mastered interstellar travel so 'dark mage' is threat to earth as physical object).
- He don't want to be on Earth or even in Solar system if he is in version of HP world from later movies. He also dosn't wants his friends and family to be here.
- This mean that that Something Must Be Done. Something is Done. Kill dark mage. Or evaculate at least part of humanity.
- Something Is Done. Sucessfully.
- It wascanon world before his intervention.
- He found out canon version of events only after he was able to research parallel unverses. He didn't even understood Voldemort was super-puper 'dark mage' before that.

** When Tom Riddle put a curse on the Defense Against the Dark Arts position, Albus Dumbledore did not expect the outcome to be, well... whatever this was. It had been rough for the first decade after the curse was cast. No Defense professors lasted more than one full school year to teach the students how to defend themselves from the forces of darkness that constantly besieged the castle. But was the situation really so dire?

For the first time in years, more than half of 5th and 7th year classes were getting Outstandings in their OWLs and NEWTs despite the lack of continuity in Defense lessons. Alastor Moody was over the moon at the skill of the latest batch of Auror recruits. He was even planning to send some of the older Aurors back to Hogwarts for extra training.

A review and inspection of the present staff's lessons showed that all of the professors were teaching their students ways to defend themselves using their respective subjects. Albus was still a bit traumatized from watching a wee firstie subdue a boggart with the pineapple tap dance charm taught in Flitwick's class. It would have been ridiculous if someone had just told him the story had he not seen it with his own eyes.

And so in the latest staff meeting, it was decided that a separate Defense Against the Dark Arts class was no longer needed because its spirit was already incorporated into the school's every other subject.

** There is a fanfic like this. I've just spent the last bouse searching for it to no avail. Harry has a secret room located in one of the towers filled with books and stuff where he keeps Sirius's body suspended in a pyramid of energy. Hermione eventually joins them.

The bit that makes it like this is that Harry has to get to the room before sunset because at night Hogwarts turns nasty. All the shadows attack him. All the gargoyles want to eat him. The prefects patrol the corridors trying to keep the monsters at bay. Any kids who go wondering at night are likely to die.

I just can't remember what it's called! Something like Harry Potter and the Artifact Vault or Artificiers Vault or something like that.
