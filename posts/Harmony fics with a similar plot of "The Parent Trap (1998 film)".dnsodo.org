As the title suggests, Harry and Hermione have kids together but are split afterward because of some reason. The kids meet in a summer camp or a field trip or something similar and discover each other. They then get Harry and Hermione together with some effort and we have a happy ending.

****** Yep!

It's almost as bad as those fics that has /insert love interest here, usually Hermione/ leaving without telling anyone...

It's why I think romance should be mostly a sideplot.

******* To be honest, the "reconnecting after a few years apart" is one of my guilty pleasures... Though I would agree that the separation is never for any realistic reason.

(The only relatively good reason I have seen for that trope was; Hermione left for australia to find her parents, while she was there she found out she was pregnant, she sent a letter to the father and never got a response, because someone was throwing away any mail she sent to the guy. Guy doesn't know where she is and she thinks that he doesn't want anything to do with her because she never got anything back from her weekly letters.)

But really for the most part the trope is Hermione leaves and doesn't come back because... plot? I enjoy reading them, but it's usually the execution that shines not the setup.

I do agree, that I prefer plot heavy stories also. A mediocre plot based story is better than a mediocre romance based story. A good romance based story however can be... ya know, good.

******** Even then it just serves to vilify Ginny (Breakfast in New York comes to mind), or whoever threw away the letter. I get why they're your guilty pleasure (Rise of the wizards is mine, at least for the first half because a lack of information between Harry, his friends, and Dumbledore cause the plot, despite everyone's good intentions.). And the illogicalness of the situation in that Harry would just send an owl or something instead of just not talking to her.

You also get the trope that /insert magical destination here/ it's more advanced than Britain, which is either the result of American writers, or laziness.

I just don't get that heartwarming plot. It's just a rehashed movie romance. I don't want to read that.

I'm trying to think of a litmus test for it.

********* I might /might/ have been talking about Breakfast in New York, yes...

Honestly it also doesn't have the best setup, but it is the best of the worst in rationalising these sorts of things.

Yes, but no also, If you go to another part of the world, there will be things better and worse than where you started. The author is invested in the ideas that they made up for the other places and so tend to only talk about the upsides and not the downsides.

Also the fact that if you know nothing about any range, you should assume you find around the middle. Teleport into a universe to document smartphones, find a random one on the ground, it's a Galaxy S5, so you can assume that they probably made up to s10s in this universe. See a cop car with the number 163? law of averages, it is probably near the middle so they probably have about 300. We see the state of magical britain and we can relatively reasonably assume that that they are in the middle on most issues because we have no range.

But I do agree, they a lot of times miss on talking about the "worse" parts of other countries.

Most of the time that I enjoy it, it is paired with a good B-plot.

********** It actually wasn't that bad of a fic, but again, bashing Ginny was a bit unnecessary.

My rule is if you have to bash Ginny to do your pairing, you did your pairing wrong. Bashing should be avoided for any pairing fic.

I've seen quite a few that just ignore any issues or outright say magical America, Australia, or whatever place is better though. Fantastic beasts might not have been perfect, but having other, but similar hot topic issues to blood purity was great in the magical USA.

Although I'm not sure the law of averages works for everything, because you're assuming an even, finite distribution (although, I'm not sure whether it would apply if wizarding cultures are small-scale, non-technical muggle cultures).
