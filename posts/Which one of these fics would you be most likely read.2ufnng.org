** 2 or 3.

2 mostly because I'd like to read a DAYD without the massive sexism, power fantasy and torture porn.

3 sounds possibly interesting but kind of far-fetched. I have a hard time imagining Hermione refusing to go to Hogwarts. Maybe her parents refused? What kind of circumstances would draw her back in if that happened?
