Hey guys I'm once again asking for some recommendations. I'm primarily looking for fics that have harry take a more proactive role in the second war and please no stun first ask questions later kind of stuff. I'm looking for long(100k+ word count), harry focused fics. (romantic subplots are appreciated but not necessary) thank you all for your time.

  The mother in Molly reaches out to a grieving child. Harry starts worrying about Dumbledore once he sees the hand, and decides that they need a contingency plan. Over a bowl of too hot onion soup, the course of the war is changed. Voldemort is faced with an actual adversary in the form of the Order of the Phoenix. Mentors Bill, Moody, and Fleur.

*** Sure I'll try and take a look. I have just one question. Whilst it's seems grim please tell me they understand that to win a war you need to kill the opposition?

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** It's a very nice story. I think the writer also posted another version of the same.
