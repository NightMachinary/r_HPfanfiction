So I was reading this fic I'm pretty sure it was a marvel crossover and one line really stood out to me and it was “You we're a war general at 15?” and it made me realize that they really were just kids so does anyone know any fics that deal with the fact that they basically became child soldiers and an outsiders reaction who maybe didn't know about the war or Harry's part in it?


** It's maybe not exactly what you're looking for, but the gist of Four O'Clock in the Morning by Vera Rozalsky linkffn(5533537) is that post-war everyone needs therapy but the magical world has no mental health care, so they have to go to the Muggle world to get it. Some of it is told from the perspective of one of the healthcare workers.

*** Come on! Hinny IS the canonical pairing, so there is no need to have disclaimer for few weirdos who really passionately dislike what JKR designed. I am not saying that it is wrong to be Harmonian or another weird animal of such kind, but to have disclaimers against Hinny seems like too much. Besides, the blurb of it from the bot has Characters: Harry P., Ginny W., so it is kind of obvious.

**** To be honest it doesn't bother me at all. But there are some people that seem to absolutely loathe any Harry/ Ginny stories. Which is really weird to me since they are characters from a book and not real people. I was quite shocked when I started to read fanfiction and discovered the absolute hatred some people have for Ginny and Ron. I mean I understand not liking certain characters, but hate? That seems a bit like going overboard. They might be a minority, but it's a pretty vocal minority. The amount of fics bashing Rin and Ginny is staggering.

***** Given that I believe most authors (and readers) of fanfiction stories are teenagers (or close to it), I have [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/review-of-escape-and-mr-and-mrs-percy-weasley.html][my theory]] that this is mostly a teenage reversal of authorities. Everything good is suspected to be bad and vice-versa. Hence, so many “Light is not so light” (aka Dumbledore-bashing) stories, or good Death Eater stories (Dramione, Drarry). And thus the official pairing is rejected as wrong out of bat.

** Help of a Seer, linkffn(7548963), has quite a bit about the psychological effects of war on teenagers, and the outside reaction that you want is from the adult Grangers. It's a pretty good story, and it does have an actual explanation for Luna being a seer.

  OoTP. Harry, Ron and Hermione realize that they're going to have to save their own lives - because no one else will. Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.
