There are plenty of Slytherin!Harry/Gryffindor!Hermione fics and I was wondering if there are any good ones where the reverse is true.


** Linkffn(The Reclamation of Black Magic by ShayaLonnie) comes to mind. I believe it is on hiatus, but it's still a good read imo.

Edit: Fanfictionbot appears to be mad at me, so [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12058516/1/The-Reclamation-of-Black-Magic][here]] is the link!

*** Thanks for the link. I quickly skimmed through a few chapters and Hogwarts starts on Chapter 24! Yikes! This feels more like a story about the previous generation instead of Harry's. Is that correct?

**** I would say both?? The first part is certainly about the older generation but I thought ShayaLonnie had stated it was supposed to be a /long/ story about both generations. I could be mistaken, though.
