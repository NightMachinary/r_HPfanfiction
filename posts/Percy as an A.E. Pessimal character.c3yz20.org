If you're not familiar with A.E. Pessimal, his article can be found here: [[https://wiki.lspace.org/mediawiki/A.E._Pessimal]]

​

I'm looking for fics that feature Percy with a characterization or character arc similar to his, whether as a main character or a side character as he more or less has in S'tarkan's Nightmares of Future Past

​

Like, badass desk-clerk forensic accountant.
