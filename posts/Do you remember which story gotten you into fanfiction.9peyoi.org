For me, it was kurinoone's linkffn(The Darkness Within) . It was the first fanfiction I have ever read. After that trilogy I just keep reading. Now it's been like 5 years and I still read fanfictions. What was your first fanfic?


** Cursed Child. I was convinced there had to be a better fanfiction than that. I think I actually looked up, "Harry Potter fanfiction better than Cursed Child."

And so my descent into madness began.

**** Damn. The dialogue is a bit off, but the emotional weight of the story is immense. It needs more attention IMHO, because it comes closest to capturing the true magic of the HP world of any fanfiction I've read. Not "so mote it be's" and bad latin.

** For me it was linkffn(Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince). At first I was very reluctant to dive into fanfiction because I thought it would all feel fake compared to canon.

So I tried this one because it's canon compliant, a recount of HBP from Ginny's perspective. I was intrigued. It was decent enough. It read more like a YA novel targetted at teenage girls though. Ginny's whole world seemed to revolve around Harry. But it was good enough to get me interested in trying more stuff.

From there I ventured into post-war stuff because they're more compliant to canon minus epilogue. Then the general stuff. Been hooked since then. Binging about once a month.

There's also linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh; James and Me by Northumbrian).

If you're looking for next gen there's linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided). There's also a little known series that I think is fantastic and is a tragedy that it's so underappreciated - linkffn(Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard)

It isn't complete, but I was fascinated by how intricate i found the way it weaved around and through or replaced canon materials. It's been updated 8 times in the last 4 years or so, but I wish I was there when chapters were going up more often. Looking back, it isn't the best written story on the site, but it was certainly more restrained then a lot of oc inserts I have read.

** HPMoR - loved it, really made me see the unlimited potential of AU fanfiction, then promptly dove into fandom and never looked back. Been reading (and later writing) fanfiction ever since.

​

I'd technically seen a few others through the years previously; a short Fred-survives I think I found on the Amazon message boards, a few Bleach ones in the farther distant past, but they were mostly shorts with the specific intention of fixing my headcanon to correct something irritable in canon. I didn't really think of it as fanfiction at the time, somehow, and never got into anything beyond those few specific instances. It took something drastic like MoR to show me the real power of fanfiction which lies in freely imagined transformation.

** The first I read was HPMoR, but it didn't really get me into fanfiction, I just read it because a friend recommended it to me. It was okay I suppose, it didn't put me off fanfics forever, nor did it pull me in.

At some point several years later I stumbled upon linkffn(Backward With Purpose Part I: Always and Always). This (along with the other parts) was the fanfic that truly got me into HP fanfiction.

Some months later, I read linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds) and linkffn(A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles). These threw me into the rabbit hole that is SS-centric fanfiction, and to this day remains what I read the most. Especially after I found out that you could filter on characters, pairings (kind of), wordcount and whatnot on FFN.

** Harry Potter fanfiction:

Aside from an assortment of one-shots, the one that started it for me was probably The New Trio: The Helion Wands.

Long story short, Albus and Rose and Scorpius are the wielders of the Helion Wands, an experiment that Ollivander and Gregorovitch worked on together, trying to replicate the Elder Wand, but in fact unearthing secrets far older.

Sadly, I haven't been able to find it again...though in retrospect, that may be for the best. There was quite a bit of good stuff--a vampire DADA professor that was very loyal to Hermione for helping him get the job; a young Transfiguration professor who was a buddy of Teddy's from school; Ron telling Malfoy he raised Scorpius right, but also rather average writing.

Fanfiction in general?

That's easy--/Stars over Terabithia./ One of the best, though sadly unfinished, Bridge to Terabithia fanfics. Honestly, this one being unfinished hurts more than most HP fanfics.

** My first fanfic was a terrible Sirius/OC Marauders fic on HPFF.com. I can't even remember what it was called.

I was kind of hooked since then. Mostly on Marauders fics. My introduction to AU came in the form of a what if Voldemort won fic called Linkffn(Marie Antoinette)

Then I moved onto FFN around 2007 after DH. Looking at my favourites list, this is the first one I added. It's called Capture about Colin Creevey. It's kind of in the same vein as Cauterize. linkffn(4715736)

Another I really loved was Too Many Faces, a short drabble about Tonks from a perspective that to this day is rarely focused on linkffn(4362613)

And my favourite was a Discworld crossover with Luna becoming friends with Death. linkffn(3487744)

After 2008 I moved on from the fandom. I came back last year and I'm have mixed emotions about it honestly.

Lots of Josh/Donna stories way before the show actually gave in and put them together! So I went through the Yahoo Groups phase and then livejournal and now it's mostly ff.net and ao3.

Great fic (a trilogy, I think), but stupid, sucky ending.

I was reading the regular books in PDF, and the GoF was replaced with the Psychic Serpent. Great times.

** linkffn(Knowledge is Power).

Looking back, there are quite a few flaws, but back in 2009, when I first read it, it made canon look like horseshit.

Of course, canon is still horseshit...

Edit: The fic that the bot put up isn't the one. I was talking about [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5142565/1/Knowledge-is-Power][this one]].

  AU. Harry is two years older than canon and raised by Remus. Neville is BWL. Story of Harry's search for knowledge to cure his mother. Snarky characters, witty humor, Quidditch, deeply developed OCs. Harry/Fleur.

***** Yeah, some people prefer ffnbot because it removes the need for a click to read the summary and provides MOBI and EPUB downloads with a click, as well as providing stats right there in the thread. It's convenient and a large part of why it was originally created..

  When Hermione gets cursed at the Ministry, Harry and the Death Eaters discover the power he knows not. Unleashing this power has far reaching consequences. Weasley and Dumbledore bashing -- time travel story that's hopefully different.

** It was a Draco and Hermione fic. 'Merry Christmas, Mr. Malfoy', I think. And although I am strong on reading fics which comply with all things Canon, this story had crazy amounts of good smut. I couldn't help myself. It was my first foray into the dark world.

** For fanfiction in general, it was a Redemption, a Transformers story about Starscream and Skyfire.

linkffn(3480900)

And into HP fanfiction it was Isolation, as I really like Dramione stuff.

linkffn(6291747)

​

Edit: and now I wonder if I got downvoted because I like Dramione or StarscreamXSkyfire slash

  G1 This is our big, huge story about Megatron, Starscream, and Skyfire. It's the first story of an AU, but this particular story is not AU until the very end. It's also slash. First chapter is an author's note. Please read it first!

  He can't leave the room. Her room. And it's all the Order's fault. Confined to a small space with only the Mudblood for company, something's going to give. Maybe his sanity. Maybe not. "There," she spat. "Now your Blood's filthy too!" DM/HG. PostHBP.
