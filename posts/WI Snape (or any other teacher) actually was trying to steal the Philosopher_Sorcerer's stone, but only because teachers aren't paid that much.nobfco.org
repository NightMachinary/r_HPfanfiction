So this dumb little idea came when I started riffing on the first movie (having seen it a bazillion times)

(the only real fic I can think of that has someone stealing the stone because they're broke is Bart Simpson and The Boy Who Lived...)

‚Äã

I just think it's a funny idea, and also a biting social commentary on teacher pay... (that being said it's still not my favorite Harry Potter Riff... that honor goes to the scene when Harry gets a Nimbus 2000 and I say something like "So that's where our tax dollars go...")

‚Äã

are there any other cases where you make a riff and realize it'd be a funny fanfic prompt...


** "But Minerva, why did you do it?"

"Two words, Albus - Weasley Twins. Frankly, they've knocked enough years off my retirement with their shenanigans, I deserve Hazard Pay and all the Gold this little gewgaw can make."

A few moments later and Dumbledore is helping her, bitching about the Wizengamot and Fudge and the Wizarding World in general. :D

Most of us just drive our teachers to drink - it's only fitting the Weasley Twins would drive theirs to grand theft. :D

** Severus scratched his cheek, legs bound in the chair of that damned Headmaster's office.

‚ÄúSeverus --- why did you do it? Surely you aren't in cohorts with the Dark Lord?‚Äù Albus said subtly, but his intentions might as well have stabbed several times into Severus.

‚ÄùI do hope that isn't a jab at my... previous standings, Albus.‚Äù Severus drawled out, with light distaste.

‚ÄúIt is if it is /true/, my boy!‚Äù Albus exclaimed, eyebrows raised.

Severus gave the old man a blas√© look, ‚ÄúI did it because you do not pay me enough to handle several grades of insufferable, incompetent children. Clearly, you do not have enough perception of the students --- as well as myself --- to realize both parties are completely miserable.‚Äù

Albus stared at Severus, eyes significantly wider than usual.

‚ÄúAnd god's sake, Albus, have you seen how /expensive/ potion's ingredients have risen these days?‚Äù

** Haha yes great idea. I also love fics where Harry ends up keeping the stone for himself like ‚Äúdon't mind if I do‚Äù üòé
