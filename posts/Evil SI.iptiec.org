Anyone know any fics where the SI is evil? Maybe joins Voldemort and becomes a death eater? Or gets so fed up with having to live around and interact with moronic wizards that they go on a killing spree?

I think the most evil character I've ever read in an HP fic was the Harry from For Love of Magic (which I won't link and don't recommend, Noodlehammer needs serious professional help) where Harry eventually causes the magical apocalypse and kills off like 99% of all humans. Now, while that is a bit extreme, it wouldn't surprise me if an SI decided that I Could Do It Better and becomes a new and improved Dark Lord. I just don't think I've seen it yet.

I'm actually fiddling with a couple different fics in this direction but they're very preliminary and if someone's already done it then I'll probably stop bothering.


** The SI in /I Am Lord Voldemort?/ (linkffn(12980210)) basically takes over Voldemort's body and continues his reign of terror during the First Wizarding War.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

*** Good fic, but I'll admit it feels more like the SI was stuck in a situation where he had to maintain a certain appearance... for the most part, there was a lot of experimentation on muggles...

  Sequel to Alexander Dantes: The world has moved on from the dark shadow created by Lord Voldemort but all is not well. Millions of mysterious coins have appeared, thousands of magicals have gone missing, and a new Dark Lord rises. The ever present threat of discovery by muggles looms, and nobody is safe. The fate of the world rests in the hands of one man. Post Epilogue. PART TWO!
