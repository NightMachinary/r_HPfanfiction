Im quite in the mood for fics where Harry has to teach himself magic, doesn't matter if it is pre hogwarts, or crossover where he has to teach himself wandless magic, as long as Harry is somewhere without a wand/no idea how to use one, and is forced to teach himself. Bonus for survival in wilderness fics/crossovers.

No slash pairing for Harry please. Longer fics are preferred :) Am reading linkffn(the games we play by respite88) and is where i got it from.


** Some ideas:

- linkffn(Reluctant Ally by Harry50) --- writing is not very good, but there is a very sweet relationship pre-Hogwarts between Harry & Hermione, who discover magic on their own and semi-sympathetic Aunt Petunia (the reluctant ally from the name of the story). WIP
- linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) --- very strange behaving kids are institutionalized by their helpless parents in the special kind of lunatic asylum. Thus Harry, Hermione, and Dean meet. By their diligent work they discover (long before Hogwarts letters) basics of magic, which works for them wandlessly quite better than what they are going to learn at Hogwarts. Unfinished.

  At age seven, Harry wants to control his "freakishness". A book in the library calls to him. He finds that he needs to get stronger in order to control what is probably magic that causes all those unexplained events near him. That brings some unexpected changes to his life. Petunia, [Harry, Hermione]

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

** Linkffn(Fantastic elves and where to find them)

Working out magic on your own when you only have not too accurate muggle fantasy books available leads to.... confusion, to say the least.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

*** Possible spoilers in this question. I really liked that one but I was confused on some things. Who was the evil witch in the end? Was it the one Hermione read about in the books Harry got her from helping the bank? If so did it ever say how she lived so long and got so powerful, or anything about her really? also I know Harry and Hermione speculated about the 3 brothers and where the hollows came from, along with the veil but did they ever find out? Like which came from which and in what order? Not sure if I missed it or if they just speculated without finding out.
