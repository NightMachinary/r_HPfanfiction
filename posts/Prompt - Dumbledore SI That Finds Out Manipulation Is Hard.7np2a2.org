The "manipulative Dumbledore" trope comes with underlying assumption that the writer would do things so much better than Dumbledore. However, I think that even with knowledge of canon, it's reasonable to assume that a SI in Dumbledore's position would struggle. The first changes they made would likely invalidate all their future knowledge (butterfly effect), plus you could have plenty of tension with the SI trying to get by without Dumbledore's years and years of magic knowledge. Alternatively, you give them instinctive knowledge of all that magic (i.e. any spell you'd ever want) and see how long they attempt to gently manipulate stuff before they give up and start slinging spells on the Wizengamot floor :P Anyone seen a fic like this before or interested in writing one?

Who the fuck cares? That's my main gripe with all the peggy-sue and SI fanfics: No one cares about the timeline in Harry Potter.

Sure, if you want to simultaneously gain power, future knowledge is definitely a big plus.

But just look what you can infer about the /state/ of the world that would be super helpful:

- Location of all the Horcruxes
- Knowledge about Dumbledore's past (Grindelwald, Ariana)
- Knowledge about loads of secrets at Hogwarts (CoS, RoR, Marauder's map)
- Knowledge about who is a true death-eater
- Knowledge about Pettigrew's guilt
- Knowledge about Sirius' innocence
- Knowledge about Barty Crouch Jr/Sr
- Knowledge about where Malfoy hides his illegal stuff
- Location of Voldemort

This is all stuff that you'd know at the beginning of Philosopher's Stone. If with all this information you fail to resolve the plot and need to follow a stupid timeline, then you have serious problems. Because you'll end up changing it anyways. The knowledge about the state of the world at one point in time is enough to probably win the war outright, with no need to know the future mutations of said state.

The biggest problem is the Horcrux in Harry's scar.

*** So basically every SI should be linkffn(A Little Child Shall Lead Them)?

 

 

 

 

I agree.

**** Not necessarily, no. But it's a great version - my favorite fic of white squirrel, yeah.

I mean you can solve the problems in a ton of different ways, but I just don't want to hear about "the timeline" anymore.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

*** That's a fair point. I hadn't considered how much Voldemort's survival depended on just secrets. Getting rid of him would be fairly easy with that information I guess. Once he's gone, do you think that the remaining DEs/blood purists would just settle down? You could still introduce some tension by then having the SI have to deal with blood purism, without the threat of Voldemort looming over them. Could lead to some interesting questions, like whether it's worth revealing that Voldemort DID survive Halloween but IS dead now.

But at that point, it's largely turning into a Wizengamot/politics fic, which is hard to do well :\

Doesn't have to. Even without Voldemort really coming back you have the death eaters acting up (for example, during the quidditch world cup), so you could do a fic based on the death-eaters being violent differently, with no clear head to cut off. Or you can have a different threat altogether.

** At what point, chronologically, would they be inserted as Dumbledore? Because there are a few... interesting points of possible divergence, earliest of which might be Dumbledore's introduction of Riddle to the Magical World - that could have been handled differently.

*** I think you could get an interesting story out of pretty much any point. In your situation, does blood purism just go away if you keep Riddle from going bad (or can you even stop him)?

If the SI appears during the first war, can they end the war for good? What happens to the DE and blood purists in that case? How does Magical Britain change by the time Harry and his generation are ready to attend Hogwarts in that case?

fflai noted the lack of tension with a SI Dumbledore appearing at/around the time Harry attends Hogwarts, but I think there might still be some interesting elements there.

You could even put them in really late, like post-Horcrux Cave. Have them race against time with the hand (which, even as readers, we don't know if that's curable) and try to keep themselves alive and find the rest of the Horcruxes and having to deal with a resurrected Voldemort.
