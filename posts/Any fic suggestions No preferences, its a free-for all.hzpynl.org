** All I have are slashfics but this first one is one of my favs. I highly recommend it even if u are not into slash. There is a lot of focus on the plot and I just beg you to give it a shot since it's so well planned out and the relationships between the ppl are so well written. (Of wizards and heroes)

A WIP where Horcrux Tom is Harry's daemon

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14476725]])
