Just want to read a fic where Harry just snaps and becomes the next dark lord.


** If you're looking for some evil shit, I'd recommend the Downward Spiral Saga linkffn(12867536)

It's a /long/ series, with six books total. The first one is OK, but there's a pretty sharp quality increase in books 2-3 and onward. I'm actually just finishing the series now, and I'm going to publish a longer review on this sub in a couple days :)

**** Oh wow, I didn't know you were on this sub! That's so cool!

Great series BTW - super compelling. You're the reason I've been sleep-deprived this week ;)

****** Seriously one of my favorite fics. It draws you into the story emotionally and makes you feel like you're on the same spiral as Harry. While reading, I felt his highs and his lows and even bits of his insanity. Excellent fic.

  A twist of fate sends Harry down a much darker path. The question is not how far he will fall, but how many others he will take with him.
