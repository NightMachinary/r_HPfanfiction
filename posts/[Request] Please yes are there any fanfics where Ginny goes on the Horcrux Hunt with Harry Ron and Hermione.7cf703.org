Please see the title! Please I was rereading Half Blood Prince and I found something that is so upsetting and also I want it to be a DIVERGENT POINT now! I would like to read any fanfics where when Harry is being a stupid misogynist and an untrusting person and breaks up with Ginny and orders her to stay away from him and his mission, Ginny refuses his stupid treatment of her and convinces him to let her join them for Horcrux Hunt! Yes please, because it was so fricking anti-feminist because it robs Ginny of any agency she had! No free will and no choice! It is ALWAYS like that with superheroes leaving their girlfriends to protect them. Why do THE GIRLFRIENDS NEVER GET A CHOICE? Why do they NEVER get to say "Screw that, I am staying with you and you can deal with it!" I hate that stupid trope it is so frustrating and upsetting! So yes PLEASE are there any fics where Ginny does this and goes, "Screw that, I am going with you, deal with it Harry!"


** In [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/story.php?no=27958]["Harry Potter and the Deadly Heller"]], Ginny triggers as a Vampire Slayer at the end of book 6 and joins the trio in the Horcrux Hunt.

*** Well, she had one year of school less than Harry, Ron and Hermione, but that didn't stop her from going to the Ministry with them.

The big problem would have been the Trace, but I think there would have been a workaround for that. After all, her brother is a damn good cursebreaker.

**** Exactly yes. She went to the Ministry and fought Death Eaters and held her own, and she had experience with Horcrux possession, and Harry STILL didn't trust her with the knowledge of WHAT possessed her OR that he was going to hunt them. I hate that so much. That is the dumbest and cruelest kind of logic ever. To deny HER of all people that after how close she has been to it all and what she has done. Yes the trace would have been a problem, but the trace did not exist until seventh book so the fanfic could just go by how magic was detected in the first six books.

****** That depends on how JKR wanted to move her plot forward.

If it's Tom Riddle murdering some people, then he could bypass the Trace using a different wand.

If it's Harry needing magic to save his life, then the Trace would always get him.

JKR even said herself that her story is plot driven, and consistent world building takes a backseat.

So fanfic writers should have significant degree of freedom in implementing the Trace.

As for how Morfin became the fall guy, Tom memory charmed him into believing he had killed the Riddles. Morfin's wand also showed three killing curses being cast in the Priori Incantatem. Only decades later, when Dumbledore carefully examined Morfin's memory in the Pensive, was Tom's crime finally exposed.

***** They might have caught the underage magic, but having (1) a known muggle-hater confessing to the crime and (2) the weapon of choice (easily confirmable with Priori Incantatem. The underage magic was still detected, but it just became very unimportant. The case was closed, wasn't it?

If the Trace was on the wand, they would always know who did it, regardless of place. Canon makes it pretty obvious that the Trace wasn't. I mean, wouldn't Moody just have lent him a spare wand if that was the case - et voil√†: no underage magic?

This is just an example of some throwaway fanon becoming "canon", right along with deus ex Glamour and the Stealth-I-Need-Not charm.

*** Please do not insult people for no reason. Thank you. Also no she would not have been, I disagree because she went with Harry at the Ministry and held her own. Which makes it even worse than he distrusted her and told her to just sit tight and stay away when they went to Horcrux Hunt.

**** I'd like to expand my response by saying I definitely do not see Ginny as incapable, but with the trace she would not have been able to perform any magic without giving away their location. I think she would have been more frustrated just sitting around in the tent than she was while productive at Hogwarts. I also didn't mean to insult you, I genuinely thought this was a troll.
