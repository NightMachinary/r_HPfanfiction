** I like linkao3(4876630) ... it is bit too smutty (so much that it is really necessary to skip over the deluge of smut, because it hurts story), but otherwise I liked it.

** I don't really know whether they deal with the topic realistically, since I'm Cis and have never experienced gender dysphoria directly myself, but I think Magical Metamorphosis and Pranking The Tournament (Links below) both at least cover it in an interesting way. The Girl Who Lived (again) is also quite interesting (Link below).

Pranking and Girl Who Lived are complete, magical metamorphosis isn't.

The Unbroken Saviour (Link below) is also a 'Male Harry gets Reborn as a Girl' story, but I don't know if it's any good as I haven't read it yet. It's currently updating, though, unlike all the others.
