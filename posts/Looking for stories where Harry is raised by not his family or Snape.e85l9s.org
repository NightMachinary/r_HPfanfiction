I've read a lot of Severus Snape raises Harry stories, I love them, but at the same time, want to read stories that focus on someone else raising Harry outside of the Dursley's and Snape.

It can even be Harry raised at Hogwarts, but not have Snape be a major part, if possible.

It can be the Weasley's, it can be the Longbottoms, the Lovegoods or whoever else. Bu like not have it be the Malfoys or the Parkinsons or something like that, that wouldn't make sense.

It can be before Harry gets his Hogwarts letter, or sometime after it where Dumbledore and co realize what kind of life Harry has led with his family. It can also be Sirius, if he was pardoned by the Ministry.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine

No Dark Harry Potter, or anything like that please.

Also if Harry is somehow raised by someone like Hermione's family somehow, please do not have Harry and Hermione end up together, as that's... a bit strange, they're not related, but they'd see each other as brother/sister, so that'd be a bit strange to me.

  When a chance meeting reveals Harry's planned fate to Lockhart, he knows what he has to do: rescue him and raise him as his own to properly manage his celebrity status. Harry gets a magical upbringing, Lockhart gets the Boy-Who-Lived...everybody wins!

  To escape the cold night on November 1, 1981, little Harry Potter's accidental magic kicks in, and he manages to turn himself into a snake and slither away before his aunt can find him in the morning. Raised by snakes, he forgets that he is actually a boy...and then one day he accidentally wanders into a place known by humans as the "Forbidden Forest".
