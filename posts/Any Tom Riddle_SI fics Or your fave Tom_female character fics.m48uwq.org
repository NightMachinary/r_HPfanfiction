I've been reading [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24196849/chapters/58283563][Seven Devils by please_dont]] and it's soooo good. It's an SI/OC fic so the main character decides the best way to prevent the outcome of the war is to help Tom Riddle and it's a Tom Riddle redemption fic.

I'd love to read more like this, or other fics you know with a Tom Riddle/Voldemort pairing (preferably no slash). Bonus if it's Fem!Harry but it doesn't have to be. I have also already read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14695419/chapters/33957573][Historical Importance by samvelg]] and [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15676317/chapters/36419703][When Harry Met Tom by The_Carnivorus_Muffin]] (so so good!)


** You're in luck! I have a category for this in my google doc. I love Historical importance too, I happen to be re-reading it now :)

linkao3(nightmare by provocative_envy) completed Tomione time travel fic, brilliant development of all characters (even side characters). Mystery and plot twists galore. This Hermione has a similar personality to Harry in historical importance.

linkao3(his persephone by Reneehart) another time travel Tomione except rather than being sent back to stop him, she is sent to join him.

linkao3(blood and gold by obsidianpen) /another/ time travel Tomione with manipulation on both sides, I love the power plays. It's not set at Hogwarts so the ideas are fresh.

linkao3(ink and parchment by rose_by_another_name) fem!Harry/Tom, she gets sorted into Slytherin. It's a bit too tropey for my tastes but the writing improves as the fic progresses, it goes from Years 1-7 so quite long.

linkao3(unbecoming by turnpike) fem!Harry/Voldemort. Features threadmagic, like Historical Importance.

linkao3(Byzantium by TreacleTeacups) fem!Harry/Tom. Fairytale elements AU, featuring the Fae and a curse.

linkao3(we are kin by artsydeath) fem!Harry/Tom in which she runs away from the Dursleys and lives as a wolf animagus for years until she comes across Nagini, who in turn introduces her to Tom.

linkao3(appetance by elysian_drops) fem!Harry/Voldemort in which he discovers she is a Horcrux in the graveyard.

**** No worries! I've got one more as well because I was thinking of a different one when I tagged ‚Äòwe are kin' - the one that I described is actually linkao3(charred paws and heavy coils by undead artist). Although ‚Äòwe are kin' is also a fem!Harry/Tom one so they're not that different, lol.

  The summer after her fourth year is the worst one yet and Harry knows with grim certainty that her Uncle is going to kill her before she can even reach her fifteenth birthday. So she leaves. Finds herself by the edge of an forest - knows that no one is going to look for her out there.And she's content on her own - finds the rhythm of survival. Learns.She knows that the day she meets Nagini that she should have left. She's had dreams looking out from those exact slitted pupils - knows that she puts her life in danger every day she stays with Voldemort's familiar. But it's hard to be scared when Nagini huffs about her 'silly speaker' and complain about him working too hard and praises him for his toasty winter bed.But then, it's not Harry Potter who Tom meets that day in the clearing.It's Nagini's 'Little Wolf' - and that changes everything.

  A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it--smashing it--nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century.

  This should not have happened.

  Hermione Granger is in a losing war, one causing the world to fall apart at the seams. Ever since the Battle of Hogwarts, things have only grown more dim, with Voldemort creating even more horcruxes and his army growing larger still. The order has been disbanded and those she loved are either dead or soon to be dead. But even when the world is at its darkest, light will find a way to break free, and she may be the key to turning the war around- long before it took a turn for the worst."1943? And you'd like me to...kill Tom Riddle?" Dumbledore shook his head, that annoying twinkle glowing thrice as bright as before. "No, my dear. I'd like you to join him."

  The true time-turner was slammed savagely into Hermione's throat. It shattered against her neck, bits of glass and gold piercing into her skin. The last thing she saw before blackness consumed her was a plume of metallic dust and vitreous fragments, tiny prisms dancing behind her eyelids. (In which Hermione accidentally ends up in 1950, pitted against an ascending Dark Lord in his prime, caught in the entanglement of pureblood politics, dark magic, and Tom Riddle's interest)

** linkao3(appetance by elysian_drops) fem!Harry/Voldemort in which he discovers she is a Horcrux in the graveyard. Such a nice and pleasant writing and the author is a sweetheart who updates often. It's really well written.

linkao3(we are kin by artsydeath) fem!Harry/Tom. A sane Voldemort who discovers that she is a horcrux. Harry can't handle having to embody two active souls in her body and unravels entirely. Implied assault/torture from the Order allegedly which left Harry traumatized and sought out her enemy for help. (on hiatus but not abandoned).

linkao3(corruption by itsjustsilver). Hera goes to meet her death in the Forbidden Forest but there Voldemort discovers that she is a horcrux. He takes her at his side and things starts to go downhill from there on for Hera. She didn't die but that would have been a better deal for her than what is gonna happen later. Definitely a heavy fic.

linkao3(Grace Potter and The Great Mistake by RonChee). Starts to take place at the graveyard in the end of HP and The Goblet of Fire where Voldemort kidnaps Grace for a ritual. HUGE TW for sexual assault and torture. It's not a soft fic but it's very well-written.

Enjoy!
