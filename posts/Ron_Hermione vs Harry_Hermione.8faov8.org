** Ron/Hermione

Harry and Hermione are really good friends, however, there has never been a mutual romantic interest, see [[http://www.sugarquill.net/index.php?action=goodshiprh&st=angua][here]].

** Neither, leaning on "Ron/Hermione" if I had to pick one. Essentially, I agree with Rowling's statement that essentially: Harry/Ginny > Harry/Hermione > Ron/Hermione (although all three /can/ work). Overall I think Ron and Hermione would both be better off /not/ marrying so quickly, and waiting to see if they meet someone /really/ right from them later in life.
