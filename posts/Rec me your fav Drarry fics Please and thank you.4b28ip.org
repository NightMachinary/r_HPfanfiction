Some how, despite being in this fandom for most of my life, I have only recently jumped on the Draco/Harry bandwagon. And, boy howdy, have I jumped hard - pretty sure this is my new fav OTP.. I've already started writing a fic! [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5632201/chapters/12972256][#shamelessselfpromotion]]

So - what're the best Drarry fics out there? Hit me with all your favs. :)


** I love Drarry and I have a huge bookmark list on AO3, which can be found [[http://archiveofourown.org/bookmarks?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Brelationship_ids%5D%5B%5D=99&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bquery%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&user_id=Fionaxyz][here!]].

Obviously I love all of those fics but if you want to start with the /really/ good stuff read literally anything by Saras_girl or firethesound. They are both amazing authors.

I would also highly recommend you check out [[http://my-drarry-recs.livejournal.com][capitus rec page]]. She's the best reccer out there and she updates her page with new fics all the time. She's also got her livejournal set up with a fantastic navigation system so you can sort by genre, rating, trope, era, etc. etc.

Edit: also, for some older fics, I'd check out Skyhawke. Pretty much the entirety of the most popular fics on there are Drarry. [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/popular.php][You can find them here]]. I'd recommend reading those and then looking through the authors pages of any you liked :)

** I second Capitu's rec page!

Here are 10 of my favorite Drarry fics so far:

1.  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6435092/1/Turn][Turn]] by Sara's Girl

    #+begin_quote
      One good turn always deserves another. Apparently. Epilogue compliant/AU.
    #+end_quote

2.  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea with no Sympathy]] by who_la_hoop

    #+begin_quote
      It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again.
    #+end_quote

3.  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1273078][Stop the Clocks (This is the Last Time I'm Leaving Without You)]] by firethesound

    #+begin_quote
      Living with Draco was difficult; living without him is unbearable. But if there's one thing Harry learned from the war, it's that even when one life ends, the rest of the world goes right on living.
    #+end_quote

4.  [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/cinnamon/BW.html][Beautiful World]] by Cinnamon

    #+begin_quote
      Draco is afraid of living and Harry is afraid of dying, but sometimes the choice isn't offered. Draco's got to learn what it is to really live, while showing Harry how beautiful the world really is when you're not too scared to see it.
    #+end_quote

5.  [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3727][Draco's Boy]] by empathic siren

    #+begin_quote
      non-magic AU. A mysterious little black-haired boy moves in next door to Draco, and he's determined to make the boy his friend and find out all of his secrets. Later, when they grow up, Draco's determined to make Harry much more than a friend.
    #+end_quote

6.  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4726251/1/Must-Love-Quidditch][Must Love Quidditch]] by dracosoftie

    #+begin_quote
      Through a series of emails from an online dating site, Harry thinks he's found his perfect match. Will the bond they've forged survive after their identities are revealed?
    #+end_quote

7.  [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=3386][Secrets]] by Vorabiza

    #+begin_quote
      Beginning with Draco's unexpected arrival at the Dursleys, Harry's summer after sixth year becomes filled with activity and many secrets. As his summer progresses, Harry generates several unexpected allies as he finds himself actively becoming the leader of the Light side.
    #+end_quote

8.  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7429542/1/Twist-of-Fate][Twist of Fate]] by Oakstone

    #+begin_quote
      Draco asks Harry to help him beat the Imperius curse during 4th year. The lessons turn into more than either expected. A story of redemption and forgiveness.
    #+end_quote

9.  [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5277644/chapters/12179633][A Convenient Impracticality]] by firethesound

    #+begin_quote
      Somehow Harry ends up agreeing to a fake relationship with his ex-nemesis-turned-friendly-acquaintance-with-benefits, except for some reason it involves an awful lot of actual dating and, sadly, not much sex. Confused? Harry is too, but when has anything with Draco Malfoy ever been as straightforward as it seems?
    #+end_quote

10. [[http://www.thehexfiles.net/viewstory.php?sid=11491][He Was He and I Was Bunny]] by Bryoney Brynn

    #+begin_quote
      The war is over and “eighth year” is about to begin at Hogwarts. But for Harry and Draco, nothing is quite the same. Harry's looking for an escape, Draco's looking for a friend. Does a little black bunny hold the answers for both of our boys?

** One of my favorite and first drarry fics is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/4373594/chapters/9926705][Temptation on the Warfront]] by alizarincrimson! Beautifully written fanfiction. I also agree with all the previous comments. Saras_girl, firethesound and who_la_hoop are probably the best drarry authors EVER. All of their fics are so good!

#+begin_quote
  HPDM slash. There is no reason for the Ministry to pull Unspeakable Draco Malfoy off his Dark artifacts detail and assign him to negotiate with Harry Potter's werewolf pack. Draco suspects a set up. When he meets Harry, however, he has to wonder if it's a different kind of set up than he anticipated. Updated every Tuesday. COMPLETE.

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1049966?view_full_work=true][Azoth]] by zietgeistic

It's an 8th year fic. Harry decides to become a Potions Master, and Draco helps. One of my favourite fics ever, from any fandom. It's 88K words, I've read it several times, and I know I'll read it again in the future. Great world-building, great characterization, a rewarding ending.

** I know I am a little late to this thread, but I have about 100 bookmarks on Ao3 (mostly Drarry, but some other ships too) and I break them down with recs and some thoughts on each story. I would love to find some other people who do the same, so let me know if you find any other good bookmark lists!

I'm not even a Drarry shipper and it's great. Bring tissues.

ETA another great one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4940335/1/Said-The-Tortoise-to-the-Hare][Said the Tortoise to the Hare]]

Summary:

Let others fling themselves at Harry; let them confirm his bad opinion of them and slobber down his sleeve with their adoration. Draco knew that the best way to win Harry Potter's heart was to be his friend first, and go so slowly he wouldn't even realize you were doing it

On mobile, sorry for weird formatting.
