Either he's been raised his whole life to fight Voldemort, augments himself with rituals or spells or runes or whatever, or is in some accident and decides "hell, I'm losing bits anyway. Yeah, stick that experimental stuff on me, let's see what happens". He's a special kind of soldier.

Slash, bashing, crossovers and dark!characters are fine. Please no harems, romance/smut-centric plots, mpreg, genderbending or pottercest. Thank you!

*** As OP specified "no harems, romance/smut-centric plots" I think that pretty much rules out for love of magic. That fic starts off interesting but devolves into an incel fantasy pretty quickly. At least if I'm remembering it right.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.
