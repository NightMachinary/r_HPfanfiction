I know AngelaStarCat's /Blindness/ is wildly popular from the discussions/debate about it on here, but I hadn't realized until the other day how common it is for Harry to be blind in fanfiction. For example,

linkffn(10824203; 12726275; 4499916; 12400607; 11804873; 9540519; 10460523; 10112405; 6673903; 6554218; 13160266)

Is there a reason that the fandom collectively decided to write epic stories about every possible way Harry could be blinded? Is it because one fic (maybe AngelaStarCat's ?) was popular and inspired others? Is it that the fandom is huge and there's a ton of every conceivable sort of story? If it's about finding a way to tell stories from the perspective of someone who is physically disabled, why aren't there also a million deaf!Harry and paralyzed!Harry fics scattered around? (Or are there?)

I'm not passing judgment on the quality of the fics or on the people who love to read every blind!Harry story out there. It just strikes me as an oddly specific, not particularly obvious change to be made so frequently. Making Harry a girl is an obvious change; making Harry raised by person XYZ is an obvious change. Making Harry blind... what precipitated this?


** I'm not sure, you literally mentioned almost every (there is a very good Snape mentorship one) blind!harry story out there, and when considering the vastness of hp fanfictions that's less than 0,01%.

A blind protagonist is intriguing. Every hero needs to overcome some obstacles, that's why most protagonists in novels have tragic backstories, and being blind is probably one of the largest ones ever.

I don't see any issue with it and I think you overplay the occurence with the prominence.

I've wondered about a /mute/ Harry before as well - either from the start, or some side-effect of magic/time travel/something else. It'd be interesting to see that be the reason for a focus on, say, rune magic.

**** oh dear, it would take me a while to look for it. If it's even on ffn anyway. Gimme an hour. Then I'll edit this post if I find it or not.

EDIT: I can't find it. I don't know if it's still out there, but it would me days to scour through everything. If anyone wants to search, be my guest.

The main points were:

Spoilers below, but as few as I can manage, while giving the main points of the fic that will help you in finding it:

>! It was complete. !<

Snape taught Harry how to operate despite his blindness.

He was very Snape-like and cruel in his teachings. Harry was blinded by the Dursleys via hitting his face into a mirror.

>! He was left blind because Snape decided to take his time in checking up on him. Dumbledore asked him to do so, and he thought it was nothing to worry about and Prince Potter was just spoiled. So he took a bath (literally) and generally waited until the last possible moment, so Harry's blindness was his fault.!<

Also it was quite old, probably before DH came around,. Or perhaps not, but it was old. I remember there were no horcruxes, so it was either very old, or disregarded that plot point.

Okay, found it, it's worse than I remember... it was a long time ago in my defense. But if anyone is interested:

** I think a large part of the popularity is romanticizing a disability. It's true for a lot of disabilities; if you look at fics with a character who has asthma, an attack is treated much more like an anxiety issue and a chance for the characters to bond instead of the life threatening situation it is.

Another possible reason is that there's already a huge focus on Harry's eyes in the books. Taking that and messing with it is interesting from an author perspective since characters like Snape are influenced into action by Harry's eyes.

Though Blindness is the most OP Harry, overrated bullshit I've had the misfortune to read in my life. I'd love to reread it and give the author some advice so they can improve it but I don't think I can survive another read. I'm not trying to bash the author but ooh, chiiile!

If you want Blind!Harry done right, even if in a very small fic, read this:

** I think blindness is a common woobie style trope in fanfiction in general because there's usually something that let's the blind character 'see' anyway in some form, so it's a somewhat easy way to make a character disabled while keeping them attractive and still completely capable except where the plot requires it. It's rare in my experience to have a blind main character who doesn't somehow see using sonar or using their magic or echolocation or whatever other hand wavy daredevil esque plot spackle.

The Snape mentorship one was okay (don't remember the name), but while it had a good dynamic between Snape and Harry it also failed in many ways (mostly by giving Harry a magical ability to see again, which runs contrary to the premise, even if limited).

Writing blind characters is difficult for a non-blind author, almost impossible. There are nuances that able sighted people don't consider and it throws everything off.

  AU. Harry is blinded in an accident at a young age and then disappears from the watchful eye of the Order. What happens when he reappears in the wizarding world? What dangers will he face? No horcruxes and Voldemort is dead. Warnings for some descriptions of child abuse and the aftereffects, nothing too violent. Rating may be a little higher than necessary.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  Maybe if things had been different he could have lived a normal life, but they weren't. No one had bothered to check the aftereffects of the killing curse, and so no one noticed that little Harry Potter was blind. A cry from his magic called a friend to him. Missing from society and believed dead no one believed it when his name came out of the Goblet of Fire Blind!Smart!Harry

  When some of the Death Eaters capture Harry, their curses go awry and instead of killing Harry they blind him. How is he going to return to Hogwarts and ultimately fight the Dark Lord? He'll have to find a new strength and cunning he didn't know he had.
