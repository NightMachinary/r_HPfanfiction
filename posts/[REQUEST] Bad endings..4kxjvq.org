Hi! Requesting again for your suggestions.

This time... Bad endings! LV wins, or the muggles get involved and good bye wizards! A pyrrhic victory works too.

Hopefully completed fics, and the longer the better!

***** Seconded that you're missing out. Not just on Playmate --- I think there's a great potential in ~70k, tightly-written fics, and there are some great oneshots in the fandom as well. Many of my favourites fall well short of 100k words.

In fact, I'm almost the opposite to you in that I rarely read things much over ~150k words any more. I think it's just because a long fic needs to reach a higher level of quality and interest for me to feel like the extra time taken is going to be worth it.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
