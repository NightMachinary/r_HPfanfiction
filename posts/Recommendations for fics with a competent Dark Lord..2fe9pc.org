I've read too many fics in which Voldemort was a buffoon and too few in which he has a clue.

** Part of the problem is that canon Voldemort was a shallowly written villain. A few fanfiction stories with interesting Voldemort characters:

jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2686464/1/To-Fight-The-Coming-Darkness][To Fight the Coming Darkness]].

Lady Khali's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]].

Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]].

**** Many people on this subreddit hate HPMoR. I imagine it's the perceived preachiness. Even if it weren't the most intricate and complex fanfiction I've ever read, it would still get credit in my book because it's much better written than the average.

EDIT: and yeah, his antagonist is fantastic and actually formidable, unlike many stories.

****** Author is not just a fanfiction writer, he's a scientist and an outspoken futurist. Some people vehemently dislike him.

The story changes dramatically a few chapters in -- many critics give up before then, which is understandable but still a bit odd. I see people on this subreddit recommend works with 15 typos in the first paragraph but they stop with HPMoR after ten minutes because the protagonist is "annoying." Deeper into the story is the most memorable prose having to do with Harry Potter ever written.

******* I've read nearly the entire thing and my main issue is nothing to do with what you've said but rather he takes about 50 chapters just to get to Christmas of first year and never answers any of the mysteries he sets up.

EDIT: also he makes FAR to big a deal out of his own theory that there's no afterlife in HP despite JK making it pretty obvious otherwise. Normally i'd have no problem with that but he just pushes it in every other chapter and it's annoying.

You'll note that I'm treating what I consider a ridiculous complaint about fiction as legitimate and it still doesn't apply to the story. I consider "everything ties together at the end" a plus -- you must not be a big fan of Agatha Christie, Conan Doyle, etc.

*********** Not even close to enough IMO. The author introduces new things at every oppertunity and it just didn't work.

There's a difference between Christie and Doyle and this though. For one thing none of their stories have 15 different plot points that are totally unrelated and some totally abandoned halfway through a novel.

Also the pacing of their novels is pretty consistent whereas HPMOR is absurd.

************ Yeah Christie and Doyle are paced differently. However, two clarifications: the author has stated that not a single plot point will be dropped/forgotten (and I believe him); he has also stated that he's writing in the form of a serialized group of novels, or maybe a better analogy is the scripts of an HBO miniseries. /Not/ as a book, is the gist.

************* He can say that all he likes, it doesn't change that having written that amount of story he should have progressed further in the timeline and I'll believe it when I read it in regards to not dropping any plot points.

Even if that isn't something he just said once people started criticising his writing, it just doesn't work.

I honestly think he started with a decent story but got so caught up in being clever he ruined it.

************** Well, he's condensed the timeline. All events will culminate in Harry's first year. I honestly think you've got some misconceptions about the story. (However! Pacing is a fairly ubiquitous criticism of the work, and it's understandable -- although interestingly the common exegesis usually says that the start is off and the rest gets more readable. Just quoting what I've read elsewhere.)

*************** I get that, it's not a misconception, I just think it's poor writing to cram all of that into one year rather than spread it over seven.

I think the start is much more interesting than further in. The further in you get the more caught up in the hype of the story the author gets and the future from the original concept he gets.

I very much enjoyed the start, but that's where the perceived "preachiness" I mentioned earlier comes into play. My favorite parts of the story are the attempts to codify magic with the scientific method, and some of the prose in the more intricate later chapter arcs. Like many, I'm not a huge fan of the so-called feminism arc (a description the author despises). Also, I'll just mention that Yudkowsky had a fair amount of the last half of the story written before he began. The vast majority of the plot is set in stone. I've read many criticisms that involve him getting to clever for his own good or trying to adapt the story midway, etc -- just not true. Early chapters have quotes as foreshadowing directly from later chapters. It's all outlined in advance.

In any case, thanks for a very good discussion. I always like to talk out my views on HPMoR to refine them.

** I'm currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6610684/1/Stranger-In-a-Too-Familiar-Land][Stranger in a Too Familiar Land]] where Harry is summoned to an alternate dimension. I haven't finished yet, but the Tom Riddle of that time never created Horcruxes and seizes power through politic manoeuvring, or so it seems.

It doesn't focus on Riddle but the story is really good anyway imo.
