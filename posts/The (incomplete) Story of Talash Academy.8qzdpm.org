Okay. So. *Exhales* First fanfic. It's largely incomplete and it has come so far but, I am reluctant to complete it.

(I might have writer's block too. It's taken every ounce of creativity in me to do this.)

It's about the founding of a Wizarding School in the Southern United States.

Opinions? Advice? :

*/Carved into a mountainside in what Muggles call "Nantahala National Forest" lies Talash Academy./*

*/The cavern that would become the Academy was found by the witch Talash in 1705. She was born in America to Muggle parents/*

*/Talon and Ash Stavros in 1680 as Janess, in what would become the British Carolina colony./*

*/Her parents noticed her magical ability from an early age and attempted to hide it. Janess only wanted to show her gift/*

*/to others and couldn't understand why she was ushered away from the world, creating a great source of frustration/*

*/for many years. When she was 12, she was nearly caught up in the histeria of the Salem Witch trials./*

*/Fearful townsfolk came to the Stavros cabin and burned it to the ground. But before that could happened, Janess's parents/*

*/ushered her away from their home and told her to run. Obeying her parents, she ran and ran, never looking back, and/*

*/collapsed when she became too exhausted to continue, losing consciousness in a wooded region. When Janess awoke she/*

*/realized she had no idea what this place was. Foraging for edible nuts by day and sleeping in trees by night, she was barely/*

*/scraping by. This way of existing could not sustain her and before long, she became too weak to continue. Tt might/*

*/have been the end but, one evening Janess awoke in a strange house of tree branches and animal hide./*

*/Though she was in and out of consciousness, she made out the figure of a woman nursing her./*

*/When she was able to maintain consciousness, Janess asked the woman her name and was surprised to actually/*

*/hear a response, And in English no less. The woman, only actually a girl a few years older than Janess/*

*/introduced herself as Shkona. When Shkona asked Janess her name, she hesitated, filled with sorrow as she suddenly/*

*/recalled the muggles burning her parents' house, along with them inside it. She decided to make a new name for herself,/*

*/combining her parents' names, and called herself then on as "Talash" ./*

*/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/*

*/Talash spent many long years in the village of Shkona's tribe, the Tsoranalii, Shkona becoming a close friend, and the village/*

*/shaman reconizing her powers subsequently taking her on as a pupil. Talash absorbed the shaman's knowledge like a sponge/*

*/to water, an in time became quite the medicine woman herself. It was here in the valley of the Tsoranalii that she learned/*

*/Branch Weaving, the art of channeling magic through wooden staves made from tree branches. (Wands did not yet have an/*

*/established presence in all of North America.) As she explored the valley, she encountered a cave when she was 25./*

*/Inside the cave Talash encountered what the tribespeople call "Whill stones" , glowing natural stones in the rock/*

*/with a mysterious energy. The stones appeared to speak to her mind with whispering voices, imparting knowledge upon her/*

*/and hinting at her future. The stones taught her to apparate, and in return for these things, told her to seek out the Wizarding schools across the world,/*

*/which were until then unknown to Talash, and bring this knowledge to them. They saw in the young woman a future of travels and/*

*/greatness./*

*/And so she did for seven long years travel the world, learning the knowledge and magical techniques of Wizardkind, Chronicling/*

*/it all in journals that would come to be known as the Whill Books. Accompanying her were Shkona and later a monk Wizard/*

*/from Scotland by the name of Garth Black. Garth taught her ways of making magic more acute through emotional control./*

*/(Garth Black would eventually become her lover and husband as well.)/*

*/Along the way, she was taught of wand making by Henri Ollivander, of Ollivanders wands. This would cause later staves to/*

*/be infused with magical cores, and the introduction of wands into Southern North America. She also took a short detour/*

*/into greece and learned much of the Greek Language./*

*/Finally, in Japan, Talash learned of "Maho no kendo" , of which a rough translation is "Magic Sword Way" , which/*

*/allows one to temporarily encase any magically compatible tool in a sword blade of pure magic./*

*/These things written in this section are only a summary of Talash's Odyssey. (for full details, read a copies of the Whill Books.)/*

*/Before returning home, Talash realized she had neglected to see all of her homeland, and set off on one final short journey across/*

*/its length and breadth. On this last journey, she learned of many magic creatures, but these were the one's/*

*/she remembered most and so gave new names:/*

*/Lakerno - Large, Alligator-like animals with eight legs, razor sharp scutes and two prominent fang-like teeth./*

*/Fiderra - Close relatives of the Horned Serpent, with two straight, short, backfacing horns near the backs of their heads./*

*/They are sympathetic creatures for, they can use the same venom used to kill as to heal, depending on their moods./*

*/Liugenn - Liugenns resemble cougars but are the size of common house cats. Their sides and backs are covered in durable scales,/*

*/roughly matching the hue of their fur./*

*/Thus after eight long years in 1733 did Talash return to the Village of Tsoranalii and the Cavern of Whills./*

*/She delved back into the cave of long ago and communed with the Whill Stones. They said one word: "Tsoraeno."/*

*/This greatly confused Talash. Pressing the Whill Stones yielded only silence. Thus she brought her questions to/*

*/one who had been as a father and mentor to her: The old Tsoranalii shaman./*

*/He knew of what she spoke and told Shkona to reveal the secret of this mysterious "Tsoraeno" ./*

*/Shkona led Talash into the trees, deeper and deeper, eventually coming across a gargantuan tree./*

*/It had many hollows and outcroppings, all of them strewn with what looked like owls. Looking closer, she could see/*

*/many types of ornaments tied to tree limbs, and necklaces of shells and beads around the bodies of the unusual owls./*

Supplementary information of some magical creatures:

/Lakerno - Based on the American Alligator. Name comes from Latin "Lacertus" , /la ' ker.tus//

/A Lakerno is a large, Alligator like Magical Beast with Eight legs. It has razor sharp scutes and/

/two prominent fang like teeth./

/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

/Fiderra - Based on North American Snakes. Name comes from Greek:/

/Fidi - Snake/

/Poniria - Cunning/

/Fiderras are close relatives of Horned Serpents and have two straight, short, backfacing horns near the backs/

/of their heads. They are quite sympathetic creatures, and the venom they secrete can either kill or heal/

/depending on circumstance./

/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

/Liugenn - Based on the Cougar. Name comes from Greek:/

/Léon - Lion/

/Gennaíos - Brave/

/They are about the size of house cats but resemble Cougars. Their sides and back are covered in tough scales,/

/roughly matching the color of their fur./

/---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------/

/Tsoraeno - Based on the American Barn Owl./

/I was inspired by the character Soren from Guardians of Ga'Hoole, who is a Barn Owl./

/Tsoraeno resemble a cross between barn owls and Long-eared owls. The first wizards who encountered them/

/thought the Tsoraeno dumb beasts, but were soon corrected when they were telepathically contacted/ */BY/* /the Tsoraeno./

/The Tsoraeno are proficient at Telekinesis, and if threatened will use whatever means of defense they can./

/In fact, They are quite capable of using many of the same magics Witches and Wizards do, channeling spells/

/through two straight talons, one found on each foot./

/They are patrons of a magical tribe of Native Americans who call themselves "Tsoranalii" ,/

/Which roughly translates to "Friend of the Tsora" ./

/_______________________________________________________________________________________________/

I have some ideas for the wooden staves the Natives use in place of wands like, the way they're held and used by default is reminiscent of muskets and if held vertically, a magical bowstring and arrow can be conjured for hunting and combat.

Also, if you guys think you have any better ideas about the location of the school (nantahala national forest current) please let me know. My one condition is that it has to be somewhere in the American South.

*P.S.* Sorry about any errors in the post, like words moving down a line, I copied this from windows notepad.


** It's a fascinating story and it has a lot of potential however it doesn't exactly have the /harry potter/ vibe to it, obviously it's an AU but it didn't feel like reading HPFanfiction, more like an entire new book...

** I'd read this. There's a couple of spelling mistakes but if you use a spell checker you should catch them.
