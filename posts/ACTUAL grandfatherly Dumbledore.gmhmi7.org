I've read way too many Dumbledore bashing fics and I'd love to read a fic where Dumbledore is actual a kind, caring, grandfather figure. No bashing of anyone please, but other than that I'm not picky. Thanks!

This might be crossing a line, because it does sort of bash Dumbledore, but this takes a Grandfatherly!Dumbledore after he dies, and drops him into an alternate reality replace and fix the mistakes of a Manipulative!Dumbledore, because he was leading the world to destruction.

**** Definitely this. The story prided itself on not bashing anyone, but evil dumbledore was still bashed. Hell, at some point I began questioning who the hell was in charge of the afterlife in this story - because evil!dumbledore didn't even know that what he'd been doing was wrong, and had good reasons for pretty much every action he took. So from an objective viewpoint, he was working to defeat Voldemort and then finally retire, was suddenly yeeted out of his body (an action that can only be accomplished through soul magic, which is the darkest of the dark, so he likely had grave suspicions about the entity inhabiting his body), placed in a transcendental torture chamber filled with facsimiles of the dead around him jeering for the imposter as he systematically dismantles every carefully laid out plan to defeat voldemort, wastes time, money and opportunities and slowly but surely (and insidiously) gets closer and closer to his friends.

The author didn't realize this, of course, but the perspective of evil!dumbledore was all I could think about the entire time. From evil!dumbledore's perspective, the most logical conclusion as to what happened is that he's being possessed by some immensely powerful spirit entity that is slowly torturing his soul into madness and dooming the world into darkness - something that it has perhaps been doing to innumerable worlds in the past.

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

*** He has a bit more presence and is written similarly in one of TheBlack'sResurgenge 's other fics, linkffn(Stepping Back) IMO the problem with both of these Dumbledore's is that Harry is so powerful, Dumbledore couldn't really control him even if he tried.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.

When Harry returns to the Dursleys after the events of PS, his summer gets off to a terrible start. Albus intervenes, taking Harry back to the castle.
