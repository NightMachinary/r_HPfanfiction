Hello. Just finished the time travel tale Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past and The Dangers of Foresight (Star Wars: Adult Anakin as Young Anakin) and enjoyed the depth of the stories. I began the Prince of the Dark King and enjoyed the depth, but so far felt the contrast between Old Voldemort and New Voldemort was a little unbelievable in character style/personality. If you have any suggestions thank you.


** Oh man I LOVED dangers of foresight. I realise it's not HP, it's SW, but are you reading Of Queens, Knights and Pawns? If not, I'd look it up, it's excellent.

*** Be forewarned that this is abandoned and will likely never be finished, Vance McGill never completes anything. The writing is rather subpar in my opinion but it is readable.

**** The story I mention obviously is completed, but you're right the sequel of the sequel is not finished and I don't know if it'll ever be finished. It's not officially abandoned (yet?).

And you're right, ever since the author has decided to focus on harem stories and the like, his writing has adapted to this genre. However, I think his earlier stories have been quite well-written.

  COMPLETE. When Regulus is five, he nearly drowns in the sea off Blackpool. When Regulus is eleven, his brother befriends a ghost. It's not until Regulus is eighteen and ready to die that the Black family's darkest secret finally unravels. It might, perhaps, change everything. (A coming-of-age story with mind magic, star charting, pink petit-fours, two diaries, and a ghost.)

** The Wastelands of Time (or something to that effect) is really good. Time travel, well written, and Harry is just epically powerful but at the same time he doesn't steamroll his problems. Exhausting to read, confusing at the beginning, but such an amazing read.
