I had this idea for an SI set during the Marauders Era, and I was wondering whether the HP Fandom even likes SI fics.


** It's more the quality of the SI fics than the genre itself. SI fics, for most authors, tend to be wish-fulfillment fantasies. The bad authors run with the fantasy; the good authors know it's a fantasy and just treat it as writing practice, really. So, for the most part, SI fics just have a really low standard. That's not to say good SI fics don't exist, though.

I have a few low-hanging fruits for your SI: - Skip the ‘oh no I'm in the Potterverse' scene. It contributes nothing. - Write from the POV of other characters. This tends to be fascinating, because we don't immediately know the consequences of the existence of a new character. - Please, for the love of God, don't have your character take Ancient Runes and discover something in three days that the Wizarding world couldn't figure out in hundreds of years.

I would be more than happy to read your fic once it's out. Shoot me a link!

*** It's also something that I think has to do with it being rather easy to solve the main big conflicts in Harry Potter with outside knowledge. I think other series lend themselves to good SI fanfic better than HP does. Like, look at Worm, any self insert has the problem of “well fuck, I'm in worn, doesn't matter that I know how to “win” it'll still be a massive struggle” or Star Wars, or Star Trek or A Song of Ice and Fire. The HP plot just makes it harder to write a si fic that is good.

Most HP SI fanfics I've read just tend to basically be a Peggy sue fanfic... but worse. The plot of speed run Voldermort kill is just done better in time travel fanfics and with characters people care about. The couple good ones I remember one didn't focus on fighting Voldemort and the other took place in the marauder era

**** This is true for a SI in the 90s. However, we know very little about the Marauder-era, and the little we do know lends itself very little to trivial solutions. Sure, you might be able to hand Dumbledore early knowledge about the Horcruxes, but you wouldn't really solve everything that way, it would be nothing more than an advantage.

** The HP fandom has a very small amount of SI fics given its size compared to other fandoms like worm or naruto but they aren't necessarily hated just less prevalent for some reason.

I personally enjoy SI fics and think that they can be great if done right, my only problem is that a lot of the protagonists either become completely broken without any effort (which gets boring fast in a non-crack fic) or are extremely average which is strange as not only are most self inserts essentially adults amongst children but also tend to have near encyclopedic knowledge of the setting which makes a lack of motivation to learn any magic kind of jarring.

** Just give them some dimension and they'll be fine. A lot of SIs lack faults in their characters. Like if they're really good at dueling, then make them bad at potions or give them a horrible temper or make them a snob. My SI is a terrible duelist she makes up for it with runes/rituals and relies on other characters as hype men.

** I can't speak for the fandom as a whole (but as a general rule, the story speaks louder than the subject, and most SI/OC fics tend to be bad), but personally I don't hate them, I will just never read them. I read fanfiction to read about the characters from Harry Potter, I really have no interest in the author as a character. I feel that way about most OCs as well, unless the author does a really great job grounding them in the universe.

** Harry Potter is so central to the setting that is dificult to diviate from it, you dont see many SIs but there are many SI! Harry and Hermione fics.

The most important thing is really making it interesting and for that you need conflict.

SI frees Sirius during third year, goachs about the SI and invs him for Christmas as thanks-> Harry recents SI because it was suposed to be Harry first year with his family and fells inadequade because he wasnt the one that saved him.

They dont even need to be friends in first place but now it kinda gives another dinamic to these two characters.

*** A Curse of Truth is an excellent work from start to finish, with an excellent twist ending. Highly recommended.

+I found the writing is good up until about half-way (where I'm at) and then the storyline becomes very rushed. Also, there are religious parts that are a bit weird.+

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.
