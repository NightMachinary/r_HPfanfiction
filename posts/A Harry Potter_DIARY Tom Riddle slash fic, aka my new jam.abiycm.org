I've always been passioned about this pairing, partly because of all the reprimated tension between what is moral and what is desired, but mostly because of Riddle. I really love his character and personality, and usually read time travel fics in which Harry is thrown back in time just to have this version of the young Voldemort-human, calculative, charming and soo intelligent. Someone once recommended me a fic that dispayed the relationship between Harry and a young Snape, they communicating through a similar model of the Riddle's diary and i was enchanted by the possibily: The plot of a slash fic that involves Harry Potter and Diary Tom Riddle. Soo... any suggestion? Pls P.s. without any Fem!Harry, thanks so much


** I do like these fics quite a lot, sadly it's been a while since I found any I considered keeping for a reread :( though ones I read turn to Harry becoming 'dark', or at least 'grey' - is that all right with you?

My absolute favorite though is Horror of Our Love ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/419407/chapters/698700]]), sadly unfinished, but does have quite a word count, and is a pleasure to read :3!

While not specifically diary!Tom, you might also enjoy Strange_Soulmates' Harry/Tom fics ([[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Strange_Soulmates/pseuds/Strange_Soulmates/works?fandom_id=136512]]) - while heavily AU, I really enjoy their character interpretation :)

*** Thank you, in all honesty dark!Harry isn't usually my cup of tea but it doesn't matter as long as the quality of the fic compensate it and more importantly, is sustained by it. I will check these fics out now ;)

** You would probably also enjoy Harry/Sherlock crossovers.

**** If you have free time and enjoy intelligent, charismatic but anti-social characters, Sherlock (tv series) is your man.
