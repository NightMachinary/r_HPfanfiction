** That's your concern? That's the least confusing thing of that night. Compare it to others:

- Harry survived AK? How? Most common theory is that he survived because of his mother's love. But Lily wasn't the only mother who love their kids or died for them. Why only Harry got this strange AK survive ticket but not other people in magical world.

- It's thoughtful of Dumbledore to send Hagrid exact to pick up Harry.. No? I mean his godfather was still alive. And Hagrid didn't hand over Harry to Sirius because "Dembledore asked him to bring Harry" to Pivet drive. How did Dumbledore even know Voldemort attacked Potter family that night? Did he have someone 'watching' over Potters like he had Ms Figgs watching over Harry?

Any many more!

Yes, well, that one is a misconception that some people can't seem to be able to get over. Lily's love did play a part, yes, but it was only one piece of the whole puzzle; certainly, it is a very visible puzzle and it is not a lie to say that Harry did survive because of Lily's love, but it did not happen /just/ because of it.

The whole thing begins with Severus bringing Tom the prophecy. In doing so, he'd earned something, be it gratitude or trust or something else, and upon realising he'd condemned Lily to death he used that which he gained to ask a favour of the Dark Lord: to spare Lily, to give her mercy. For /some/ reason, Tom chose to do what Severus begged him to, meaning that it was one of the few, if not the only, situations when he would genuinely offer someone mercy.

And so Tom did give her mercy, he did proclaim that one person can survive and he is offering it to her. Unknowingly to him and to her, his own magic, and mayhap Lily's as well, bound them when the deal was made. Then, in desperation, Lily begged him to trade mercy for her for mercy for Harry; but she did not attack him, she did not break the deal he gave her, and so in killing her because she annoyed him he accepted her deal, he took the mercy he'd offered Lily and gave it to Harry. That left him with the target, whom he could not strike down now, but he did not know and thus he did try, making the very magic that bound him to honour the deal he himself had offered strike back and slay him.

So, in the end, why was it that Lily's sacrifice was the only one that did work? Because she was the only person who genuinely could choose, whose choice genuinely did matter, who chose to sacrifice herself. All the rest of the mothers of children slain by Tom either weren't given mercy and were simply collateral damage or chose to run when they were. And as for Tom himself, well ... he was a brilliant kid, certainly, but time and again we've seen that at times he has problems understanding that intent and feelings can actually matter.

**** This extensive, far fetched and distorted theory is not needed. Just say that Lily did some insane ritual that protected Harry.

She tied that protection to Harry's blood and Voldemort's spirit or magic. that's why every time Voldemort tried to hurt Harry he wasn't able to do so.

It's far better than the lame "Lily's love" theory. Seriously! The only mother who 'chose' to protect her kids?

***** Proposing that she “did a ritual” is even more far-fetched. And considering the reputation Tom had by that time, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that when he personally was involved there nobody who tried to get out of it alive by not fighting actually had a choice.

****** It's far fetched? Yes!

It's logical? Yes!

Better than 'you mum loved you so you survived AK' theory? Yes.

Not only Harry was protected but his blood relatives were protected too due to connection through blood. And the thing that finally trumped this protection was resurrection ritual that used Harry's blood.

So yeah, Ritual based on blood does make more sense than 'sacrifice and love' when all the mothers love and die for their kids anyway.

******* Even so, you pointed out that it was “far-fetched”, when my theory at least has a basis in the books because Harry did precisely the same thing, i.e. made a deal with Tom to spare someone (or in this case many someones) in exchange for his life; seventh book, by the way. Meanwhile, your own counter-theory to my “far-fetched” one has no basis in anything the story gives us and is nothing more than a random idea.

You can put whatever you want in your own stories, but when you say that someone's idea, one that actually has some kind of basis, is far-fetched, and then give a counter-proposal that is even more far-fetched and has no basis whatsoever, it will not make people think that there is any logic in what you are doing because it sounds like denial.

Also, the blood protection thing could be Dumbledore's doing, for all we know. After all, he was the one who wrote the letter for the Dursleys, and he certainly knows some obscure magic, so it's not a given that Lily's sacrifice is responsible for the whole “protected due to living in the Dursleys' home” thing. That one /might/ have been a ritual, for all we know. Though, obviously, you are free to think differently when you write your own stories.

******** Harry's deal did practically nothing. His 'sacrifice' didn't save anyone.

And don't forget that it was Dumbledore that told Harry that his mother's sacrifice deflected AK. Dumbledore isn't exactly the one to tell the RIGHT thing when he is actually actively molding his lamb for sacrifice.

Remember:

“Five years ago you arrived at Hogwarts, Harry, safe and whole, as I had planned and intended. Well - not quite whole. You had suffered. I knew you would when I left you on your aunt and uncle's doorstep. I knew I was condemning you to ten dark and difficult years.”

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - page 624 chapter 37, The Lost Prophecy

And the scene with Snape! Dumbledore had been preparing Harry for ultimate sacrifice. Harry's survival meant Voldemort will have at-least one Horcrux alive. He had to die.

Anyway the point is 'love and sacrifice' didn't do anything when Harry did it. People still died! No one was miraculously protected by anything.

Inb4 No, his sacrifice didn't contribute to him surviving AK. He actually got hit by AK. AK, by nature, rips off the soul from body. Harry had two souls. After AK Voldemort's sould left since Harry's soul was whole and powerful than tiny piece of Voldemort. Had Harry chosen to die at King Cross then Harry's sould would have left, leaving behind an empty body of Voldemort's soul. Thus creating two Voldemorts.

***** It also explains the shape of his scar, if the final part of the ritual was a rune, which the Horcrux lodged itself in. (It is a real life nordic rune.)

** In the AU I'm creating, I have something along roughly these lines:

[there is a well-known but forbidden ritual (that is tied into the history of the idea of 'purebloods') that Lily finds info about somehow. Considered very Dark b/c it requires human sacrifice. She constructs the ritual circle in HP's bedroom. Plan is that if Voldie gets to them, she'll trap him in the circle as the human sacrifice. James delays Voldie long enough for Lily to prime the ritual. Voldie AK's Lily, then, unknowingly, steps into the ritual circle. It triggers when he starts to cast the AK at Harry. B/c Horcruxes, the ritual consumes only part of his soul, the rest escapes. The scar is actually sowilo carved into his flesh and bone by Lily to begin ritual.

Conveniently, this allows me to have a good, but severely misunderstanding Dumbledore (for example, he thinks either Sirius was the true betrayer, and deserves Azkaban, or he gave Lily the info on what he thinks is a very Dark ritual, or forced her to do it, and therefore deserves Azkaban. He is afraid of prejudice against HP if him having had ritual performed on him becomes known, so he purposely blocks trial, thinking Sirius is guilty either way, and this way protects HP](/spoiler)

** I believe Harry did die, and that it was Voldemort's soul that kept him alive. We know that Voldemort intended to use Harry for his last Horcrux that night. He prepared his soul to be split and inserted into a Horcrux, and I think that Lily's sacrifice destabilized the ritual. Hence, Voldemort's soul was successfully ruptured, but in the process he lost his body. This would also explain why other children never survived the AK. Though their mothers sacrificed themselves, the attacker wasn't intending to make a Horcrux.

Another possible theory is that Voldemort's last soul container belonged to Gryffindor, and Gryffindor's lingering presence in it refused to be occupied by dark magic. The artifact was destroyed, and Tom lost his body in the backlash. Without a soul container, the Horcrux went into Harry.
