My memory isn't the best but it went something like Harry was a heir of a founder and to train him they teleported him back to the past or something like that. 3 of his friends were also heirs so when he came back he told his friends (I don't remember who but I'm sure it wasn't Ron, or Ginny). Near the end Hermione betrayed them and Voldemort destroyed the world or was going to.

Sorry if it's to vague like I said I read it years ago. Also I apologize my English skills aren't the best.

Thanks in advance for any and all help!


** Maybe Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny? Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2771223/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Manipulator-of-Destiny]])

It was published in 2006, and one of the main plot points is Harry, Hermionie, Luna and Neville traveling across/back in time through a painting to train with the Hogwarts founders so they can defeat Voldemort. The only thing that doesn't seem to match is that as far as I remember Hermionie doesn't betray them at all.

  Post OotP. Harry finds that Dumbledore has been less than honest or helpful with him, takes control of his own life and finds the training he needs from others. HHr, NL, no slash. COMPLETE

** Could it be the Draco trilogy? Draco dormiens, draco sinister and draco veritas?

Remember 4 people traveling through time and being founders heirs, not sure about the betrayal...
