Why would Barty Crouch call Percy 'Wetherby' when Crouch knows that Percy is Arthur's son and knows Arthur's name is Weasley???????


** Because Percy is his assistant and won't correct him anyway. It always felt like a petty powerplay/assertation of authority to me, he does it because he can get away with it.

*** I agree with the last bit but for the first, Barty is supposed to be a very put together man and calling someone by the wrong last name when he has known their father for years sounds stupid to me

**** Only real people. Percy is an assistant and unimportant. Or at least beneath Crouch's notice unless he needs things.

It sounds stupid but it's also the sort of thing a petty person would do when they've missed out on a lot of things are are stuck in a department they don't want to be in. He's gone from a potential minister to what was essentially a disgrace and he's ambitious enough that knowing he'll NEVER get that ultimate authority role would needle him and get worse over the years.

Ever had a boss that doesn't want to be there because they think they should be way higher up in the company? They do petty bitter things and get joy out of making someone else's day worse.

***** Yeah, this is my take on it. Obviously he knows Arthur's last name, but he cares so little about Percy that he can't even be bothered to call him by his real name or possibly even to realize that he is Arthur's son. He is just merely a lowly assistant. It is like how at service related jobs, customers can be complete assholes and literally treat people like they are not even human because they matter so little. They are just nameless, faceless, and so unimportant that their entire meaning revolves around doing that they are told by others.

****** I've always felt like at one point he's had an assistant with that name. He's just called every assistant after that Weatherby too because he doesn't care enough to learn a new name when they'll just change in a few months anyway. (because he's terrible and the assistants leave to work for someone better)

******* This could be true as well. Bottom line: Crouch didn't care at all about Percy, so he called him Weatherby.

******* Ooooh. Now that would be an interesting story. Who was the original Weatherby? Was this assistant just a random name he picked on a whim, or was there something special about that one? Were they the best? The most devoted? Or just the only one who stayed? Who believed after Crouch's Fall from Grace? So much potential there. Definitely adding that to the ideas list to flesh out. :)

******** With Crouch's personality my idea of him is someone who was with Crouch from the start as he worked his way up, so has seen him in lower positions. Maybe a colleague at first who Crouch respected? Or at least respected enough to value him on his upward climb. As for what happened next who knows? We haven't seen them so maybe they were killed in the war? Took an AK for Crouch?

I'd love to see your take on Weatherby! We don't know anything and it's always neat how different people can take things like that in different directions. There's so many possibilities for it.

** Well. Does he?

That's kind of the question here, isn't it? Implied by 'Weatherby' is that does not, in fact, know Percy is Arthur's son -- because (as the satire in that case goes) Important Percy is too inconsequential to be of note to Crouch. He doesn't even spare the five seconds it takes to make the connection. Percy is Just That Irrelevant.

Alternatively, he can of course just call him Wetherby for shits and giggles. It's an effective enough way to clarify the power dynamics and who is the boss here.

** Family power and class mean a lot in the Wizarding World from what I can tell. Percy comes from a powerless and low class family. Arthur is just Dumbledore's pawn, and we see in fifth year that being on Dumbledore's side has little pull, his influence has waned significantly.

An ambitious person who has been disgraced will care little for his position, and more for influence peddling. Percy is a stick in the mud who focuses solely on doing his job perfectly, and has no influence. Like the annoying guy who wants to do things by the book, but has no mind for office politics. Aka ignorable.

** I think Wetherby is a wordplay on Weasley but since Percy doesn't act like Arthur at work I don't think crouch connected the dots (or maybe it was a joke, idk)
