Kinda dark. Are there any fics out there that are darkharry where after someone, probably malfoy, makes a comment about Harry's parents being dead and being an orphan and Harry retaliates? Where he goes out and kills their parents that night or something and then asks the same question back to malfoy. Don't know if it's a thing, or if it's never been done. Just wanna see how that would play out

**** Just be warned, it's a crack fic. It's based on the premise that Harry Potter is Nyarlathotep from the Cthulhu Mythos, and being the Crawling Chaos he's gonna do some fecked up stuff.

** Basically half of this story is Harry sneaking out to torture and murder purebloods for orphaning him twice.

*** I've read that from around when it started. Reading wrath and remorse right now. I'm talking more about when Harry kills them, doesn't have to own up to it, but goes out and seeks their children and asking the same rude questions about their parents as they asked him.
