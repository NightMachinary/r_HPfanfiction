Ok, so, I just finished reading the most amazing thing ever, the Denarian Renegade series. I just have to ask, are there any fics similar to this that you would recommend? I would prefer over 70k words and if you have slash- I will murder you! Yay! :D

One is a similar premise except without evil Harry. The other is Loki in his head so its a Marvel crossover instead.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.
