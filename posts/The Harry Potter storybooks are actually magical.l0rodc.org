Turns out, the Harry Potter series of adventure books are magically enchanted, to tailor the story based off the wants and desires of the person who's currently reading it. That's why when Ginny read them, they were a very innocent wholesome adventure story, starring Prince Harry saving Princess Ginevra.

So what happens when Harry himself, during the summer before third year when he's living at Diagon Alley, decides to read them?

Or anyone, really. What would Hagrid read, or Dumbledore, or Voldemort himself?


** Great concept. Really ambitious, though.

***** More like the same story featuring thematic typesets depending on the desires of the reader.

You have the bare bones story, which are the main events of the plot, and they're either augmented or diminished depending on preferences.

Like this:

Bare bones: Harry and the current damsel in distress cross a bridge while the pirates chase them.

Action: Harry pants heavily as he parkours across the timber struts of the bridge. The Pirate werewolves behind him soon learn about the importance of wearing nimbleness boots as some fall through the gaps and into the river below. That did not stop some of them from trying to fire their firelegs, barely missing Harry and the damsel as they jump into some bushes on the side of the road.

Romance: Ellina the princess hung off of Harry's rugged frame as he led her across the treacherous wooden bridge. The howl of the pirates sounded behind them, along with some shots, but Ellina didn't feel scared. After all, her Harry was right beside her all the way.

Horror: The pirates finally ran into view. Their slathering jaws and twisted faces looked at him across the twilit path, the madness and hatred of beings that had lost all but the worst of their humanity burning a hole through Harry:s confidence. Harry could feel exhaustion creeping up into his skull, but he knew that his one and only chance to escape was to keep running. To run across that bridge, find shelter and wait for the moonrise. It was the only option that saw both him and the girl he'd stumbled across during his escape survive until the next day. Swallowing down his rising panic, Harry grabbed the girl's hand and began to jump from rotten plank to rotten plank, the howl of pursuit ringing in his ears.
