I don't want they to ended up together just friendship with you have something like that and that is complete please let me know and why I am talking about snape going to the next gen era


** In all of the fanfics like that I have seen, they end up being a couple. However, I always wanted to read a fanfic where Snape goes back in time to fix things and Lily STILL chooses James because that would be hilarious.

*** I actually like the ones he is still friends with lily and move on,although this would be chaotic to Harry Potter lore,if it wasn't for their fallout snape wouldn't have earn the trust of voldermort by being a death eater and telling him the prophecy,so he couldn't be a spy,and if he moved on he wouldn't ask Voldemort to spare lily and Voldemort would kill Harry that night it is ironic to think that if snape asked Voldemort to spare James,both and lily and Harry could survive,well if you only knows the ones he ended up with lily in the future give me them anyway

**** linkffn(The Moment it Began by Sindie) is a really good one where they end up together. Another one is linkffn(Second Start by 8thweasleykid) but in my opinion The Moment it Began and His Greatest Wish are both better.

The only one I know where they don't end up together but stay friends is linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds by LucyLuna). I stopped reading midway through so I can't comment on how good the later parts are but the first 20ish chapters were good!

  Deathly Hallows spoilers ensue. This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters. AU Sequel posted: The Moment It Ended.

  ' I'm not dead,' is his first thought upon waking. His next thought, after opening his eyes and seeing the mold-blackened ceiling of his childhood bedroom, is, 'What the bloody---' He touches his neck. It's whole, slender -- like a child's throat -- and just as smooth. His third, and final thought before the banging at his door starts, is: 'Did any of it happen at all? ' Time-Travel.

** The title confuses me. Are you looking for fics where he skips through time into the future? Or where he Peggy-Sues into the past? Assuming you meant the former, I fail to see how that allows him to befriend Lily, considering that she died in 1981. Unless you are looking for an AU where that death never happened (presumably a ripple effect caused by the lack of Severus)? Or are you referring to Lily /Luna/? Either way, they ending up a couple is unlikely if he is thrown into the future given the resulting age difference. Sorry for being unhelpful, I don't know any fics like this.

There's several fics of Severus ending up in the past, generally caused by his death, but the only one I know where he doesn't end up with Lily in the end is linkffn(They Didn't Know We Were Seeds by LucyLuna). They do actually try a relationship, but it doesn't work out. I'm not sure how good the fic is after that, because shortly after, the fic "ended" as far as I had read it then (it has since gotten further).

EDIT: Thinking about it a bit more, I suddenly remembered one fic matching your request: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10245276/1/The-Impossible-Mister-Time]]
