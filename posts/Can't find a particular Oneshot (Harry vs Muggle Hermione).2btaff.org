I'm pretty sure it was a chapter in a longer collection of oneshots, but I've gone through some of the ones I know and can't find it. Can't find it via google either.

Spoilers/Plot: Post-War Harry is meeting with authorities in UK Muggle Government (maybe PM). He is confronted by Hermione Granger, who, in this world, practiced magic before going to Hogwarts, had her wand snapped, and the ministry obliviator hurt her family. As a result she hates all magic. She wants to convict Harry as a vigilante. He proceeds to threaten to destroy the world if she threatens him or his family.

Any help is appreciated!

Edit: Sorry about putting the exclamation mark at the wrong place, didn't notice it before I hit submit.
