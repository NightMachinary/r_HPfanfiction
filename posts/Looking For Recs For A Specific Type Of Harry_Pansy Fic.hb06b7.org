So, I've decided I wanna try and read Harry/Pansy fic cause...I dunno, seems interesting, people do fun things with Pansy and it could be an interesting pairing if done right! That being said, my searches through Archive of Our Own have not really borne fruit. So, I thought I'd come to you lovely folks for some recommendations! That being said, I need to make some requests, as this is why I'd call my AO3 hunt a failure.

- /I don't want Draco/Hermione to be the focus./ So much of the fics tagged Harry/Pansy are actually Draco/Hermione with H/P as a background thing to explain why Pansy's not dating Draco or some such. Ideally there'd be no Dramione, but so long as it's majority H/P I'll live.
- /No bashing/. I don't want a fic where they explain Harry not dating Ginny with bashing her, the Weasleys, Hermione, etc. I can accept mild to moderate Dumbledore bashing, since this ship seems like it'd primarily lean towards Indy!Harry fics, but still.
- /No harems/. Just...not what I'm in the mood for right now.
- /No smut fic/. Ditto. The fic can have sex scenes, but not really looking for porn right now.

Fics set at Hogwarts, preferably before the defeat of Voldemort, are preferred but I'll take anything really. Sorry to be so picky, just really having trouble finding any good fics on AO3 that don't fit one or more of those criteria!


** Here's one I really enjoy: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23434150/chapters/56168614?show_comments=true&view_full_work=false#comment_315901597]]

The author also has other Harry/Pansy fics that are so good! I hope this helps!

** I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but this is a post Hogwarts fanfic, ignores the epilogue, and Harry and Ginny broke up due to some newspaper rag which apparently accused him of some indiscretion, that Ginny took at face value.

It doesn't appear to have much romance

The author is still active, but it looks like said author has abandoned this particular story, I'm afraid.
