Ok, so I'm writing a story from the perspective of pureblood Slytherins and I've been thinking a lot about their beliefs about muggleborns. If you had to put yourself in their shoes, how would you argument against the integration of muggleborns, or how the magical society deals with their influence? Think of culture, history, ramifications, magics, etc.

Also, are the muggleborns doing anything to escalate the situation unnecessarily?

There's no need to actually agree with the logic and/or opinion, it should just be sound. :)


** In my fic I had Stan Shunpike recite the misinformation he had been brainwashed with - that muggleborns enjoy the benefits of Hogwarts and general wizarding society without having paid into the system. This is the accusation thrown at immigrants a lot in the UK. Just as Muggleborns grow up to be productive members of British society, various studies have shown migrants contribute more to the British economy than they take out. But it's easy for some people to see it in a different way to justify their prejudices.

You could also argue that muggleborns bring new ideas and values into wizarding society. In General, people don't like change, And many horrible or plain stupid practices continue under the guise of tradition, with a lot of resentment and even anger when people suggest alternatives or even dare to act differently. This could vary from things like house elf and goblin rights, to the down right silly, old man yelling at clouds issues like using pens instead of quills.

We also see ideas of purity in the books - the slur is mudblood. Like racism, it doesn't have to be rational. People might even think they are being kinder - my ancient grandmother doesn't think people should marry outside of their race because their children will be teased. No matter how much you tell her it's not like that any more, she continues to, I think, genuinely believe it's unfair on mixed race children. She doesn't think that those marriages can ever last or be truly happy either, because she thinks there will be too many arguments about culture and belief. She is a racist woman but it comes from ignorance rather than malice.

In fics it's not as clear cut because visually muggleborns don't look any different to witches and wizards. It's probably closer to homophobia- with certain "tells" that reveal their blood heritage, but that some muggleborns could potentially hide.

** You could very easily argue that bringing Muggleborns into wizarding society is a real threat to the International Statute of Secrecy. For example, Lily Evans was invited to attend Hogwarts, so her Muggle parents and Muggle sister got to find out that magic is real. Then, Lily's sister got married, and then Lily's Muggle brother-in-law learned that magic is real. Then that couple has a Muggle son, and now he knows magic is real.

And that's in a family that actively hated the wizarding world and tried to ignore it and pretend it didn't exist (undoubtedly the ideal situation from the wizarding world's perspective, if you think about it). What if they had been fascinated by the world? What if Petunia asked Lily to transport her via side-along Apparition all the time, or asked her to share some Pepperup Potion, since the Muggle world doesn't have a cure for the common cold? Lily could say no of course, but if she had a good relationship with her sister, there's a good chance she'd do it on the sly.

And what if Dudley and Harry had been close? Would Dudley ever ask Harry for magical favor every now and then? Would Dudley tell his wife about magic, even if it's clear he's not supposed to?

It just gets very messy very fast, and suddenly, “everyone'd be wantin' magical solutions to their problems,” as Hagrid puts it.

In my opinion, that's not a bad thing, but the wizarding world /definitely/ views that as a bad thing.

** Economic: Not all muggleborns stay completely in the magical world. That means the cost of training them for 7 years doesn't give full benefits to society compared to someone who stays entirely.

Cultural: being apart from the magical world for the 1st 11 years means they have their own Culture beliefs and traditions. These are often contrary to those of the wizarding world (Christmas vs winter solstice). Muggleborns reproducing will dilute wizarding culture overtime.

Magical: things like being a parselmouth/metamorphagus are hereditary so it stands to reason that their are other magical traits not mentioned that are also hereditary. Muggleborns would not have these established traits.

Fear: with their connections to the mundane world muggleborns are more likely to expose the magical world.

Social: muggleborns don't know magical culture as well as others so they are more likely to commit faux pas and make wizardborns dislike them.

Fear(?): with the rate the muggle population grows compared to the wizarding population the proportion of muggleborns to wizards will increase possible becoming a majority.

Culture: muggleborns took offense to muggles being hunted for sport which ruined one of the wizarding world's greatest past times. Also ruined being able to use muggles in sacrificial/blood Magic

These are aggravated by many factors. Muggleborns not bothering to research magical culture and assuming that since it's still Britain it's all the same. Muggleborns proclaiming wizards do things backwards and muggles are better especially without true understanding of why things are done the way they are. People not wanting to hire muggleborns so more of them leave leading to more economical waster. Muggle lovers like dumbledore not wanting to make muggleborns feel uncomfortable so celebrate Halloween instead of samhien at hogwarts. Same reason for no wizarding culture course at hogwarts. Muggleborns cant practice over the summer and so all wizard can't bc mugglelover's complained about unfair advantages.

Cannon is something you can use to shoot yourself (as much of overkill would that be).

And why would it make sense? Real world European esoterics (which inspired HP heavily) are heavily connected with Christianity. Trithemius, Cusanus, Agrippa, Mirandola, Bruno. Those are people who were deeply religious or outright connected with religious organisations.

** I see things in another perspective when we are talking about purebloods on magical society. I understand where they are coming from, and is not some argument based on the Statue of Secrecy or the lack of "paying for the system", which could be just consequences of the act on integration, but the problem doesn't lie there. It lies on the integration itself. It's about a sense of Nation, Community and Belonging.

A Nation is made of three pillars: Folk, Culture and Territory. For exemple, we have Israel, which is a Country with a strong sense of Nation because it has those three pillars: Jewish Folk, Jewish Culture and Territory. This also rings true with Japan, some of the African Countries, etc. We also have some senses of Nation that don't have the formal Territory component (but the Territory component itself is still there), like Catalunians, Kurds and so on. The thing is these components are the necessity for a Country to be constructed over time. This is what happened to Europe and its Countries, the United States, Egypt, India, China, etc.

With a sense of Nation firmly set in place, we have a sense of Community. You simply know you can trust and relate with the people around you on some level, because you are the same folk, have the same culture and your families lived there for centuries. Your grandfathers knew each other, their grandfathers did as well. It creates a super strong bond between everyone of the Nation that isn't just on your lifetime, but comes way back. Let's take the "tribes" of the modern world. We, here on this subreddit, are part of one of them. We share the bond of liking HP fanfics. We disagree on a lot of things, but in the end of the day, we can agree that we like HP fanfics and this bring us together. This sense of Community brought by the sense of Nation is similar, but on a much, much deeper level.

After that, we have a sense of Belonging. You know you are a part of the Community and the Community knows you are part of it. Your place is with it, and its place is with you. You belong there, that is your place.

This is the core of the pureblood way of thought.

Muggleborns are not the same folk, do not have the same Culture and do not shared the same Territory for centuries. Now imagine hundreds of these people entering your Community and disrupting your sense of Nation, until you don't feel Belonged anymore.

Imagine that, suddenly, people from Naruto Fanfic subreddit (idk if it exists) came in numbers to this subreddit and every post they made were about Naruto fanfics, not related with HP at all. We can agree that some of us may like Naruto fanfics, but we can also agree this is not the place for them and its propagators. Its called [[/r/HPfanfiction][r/HPfanfiction]], after all.

** For the logic to be sound, the argument has to have true premises and be valid. The problem is, "blood purity is more valuable" isn't true. The series doesn't even leave that up for debate, that's why the antagonists are literal magic fascists.

The only possible avenue I could see is something like "Oh well Muggleborns expose magic to more Muggles, so we're always antsy about them." Of course, the problem is wizards are terrible at blending in with muggles as we see at the World Cup in GoF. So unless they decide to stop having kids I can't really see how they can hold a consistent position where "Muggleborns are bad" is true.

*** Their main justification of exterminating Muggleborns was Blood Purity. But the Canon couldn't be more obvious where 'bloody purity' eventually led to:

Voldemort's maternal family was already in terminal mental and magical degeneration, then his squib like mother raped a Muggle, and suddenly the most powerful wizard in generations was born. Nothing could be more ironic.

Dumbledore's mother Kendra was a Muggleborn, and he was darn powerful.

Snape's father was a Muggle, he was both powerful and talented.

Harry's mother was a Muggleborn, he was powerful (Patronus cast at 13 years of age strong enough to repel 100+ dementors), and his mother was intelligent and powerful.

Hermione was Muggleborn, she was intelligent and powerful.

Weasleys were looked down upon as "blood traitors", meaning they intermarried with Muggles before. But they were all fertile and powerful. Molly Weasley, supposedly a housewife, killed Voldemort's 2nd in command in single combat.

** There are two paths I can think of you can take to make the purist argument stronger.

The first is to go AU and describe a world in which muggleborns really are less powerful or capable than purebloods, intrinsically. I think the moral conflict of such a world potentially would be more complex and interesting than the one JK Rowling presented to us. Ultimately, even if muggleborns were weaker, murdering them wouldn't be justified, but it's a little easier to see how people would embrace the negative rhetoric if they lived in such a world. You could do other things in this vein too, like make it so that the wizarding population is /always/ a certain number, such that the birth of one more muggleborn means the death of one pureblood heir, so that the idea of stolen magic becomes actually reasonable.

The second is to play up the danger that muggleborn ideals represent. You might describe a history of muggleborns pushing well-intentioned reforms that backfire, like granting vampires or acromantulas or something rights. Or, you might describe magical innovation as being a major threat to society or the planet as a whole, with tradition and patience being some of the only safeguards against its dangers, and muggleborns tending to be reckless and uninformed or disrespectful of cultural norms.

Your only other option is to make purebloods unapologetically selfish or paranoid, I think.

Burn them.... with the same fire they gifted to them?

To protect the wizarding community from the muggle filth some ingenious wizards used the greatets magics the world had seen and brought the wizarding community into safety. What they didnt know was that the filth had already succeeded to steal some magic for themselves because among the muggles now devoid of magic the muggleborns were born. Without wizarding ancestery those born of lesser stock wielded the magic meant for real wizards.

Time went on and the wizarding community went trough great pains to keep the muggleborns happy. Those of muggle ancestery being treachoures by nature could betray the statue of secrecy any time. So every real witch or wizard is vigilant for the betrayel in their mids. What mother did not read to their children of the great muggle borns tales of the past. About great wizards and witches slaying those that would destroy their community?

Long has it been since a breech in the statue and the young go together to Hogwarts but under the muggle loving liberals the real magical culture isnt preserved anymore in oldest institution of magical brittian. What real magical would ever celebrate christian hollidays? But no Dumbledore forced all into the modern times of muggle loving.

​

Stuff like this it can be easily far more sickening and facist if you like.

*** Stolen Magic makes very little sense, Magic is a recessive gene and their are two forcefully seperate genepools but with squibs there is the possibility that the gene is passed on to other muggles to be held and to lie in wait until it can burst forth and manifest in the form of a muggleborn witch or wizard.

The muggleborns being innately drawn to break the statue of secrecy is true within some cases but cannot be generalised for an entire group. A muggle could most likely break the statue easily if they were to wander somewhere and demolish the wrong building.

Truthfully I don't disagree with the fact that the muggles were lower life forms that attacked and killed the wizards for the sake of anger. I just think that reacting this harshly to people that have the ability to do all the things muggles do with a few flicks and a swish seems a bit harsh, compounding the fact that they could easily solve most problems together but won't out of a fear of ages gone by.

The pureblooded method is correct in some ways, but wrong in others as is the mudblooded method is. Everything is complicated and exceedingly stupid from originally stupid things.

TL:DR Mudbloods and Purebloods are both wrong we should allow both to exsist with occasional interactions.

** Well they think muggleborns "stole" magic. I think a lot of the resentment towards having to be in hiding from muggles gets shoved onto muggleborns. Living with these god like powers, but having to hide from your neighbor who has to mow his grass by walking back and forth for hours instead of waving his wand... I can understand the mentality even if its wrong.

This never comes up in the books, but a dark lord could very easily run with the idea that muggles are destroying the planet and we have to take them over to protect everyone. It would even be true. Now that I think about it... that's probably how you'd get a Hufflepuff dark lord. lol

** I think the fic the well groomed mind presents a fairly reasonable argument. Particularly this [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/26/][argument between Neville and Hermione]].

Magical folks live in a world where 11 year old children can casually violate the laws of physics. Accidents in math class result in wrong answers. Misunderstandings in arithmancy could trap everyone in a time loop for all we know. This is a universe where humans are not the only sentient beings. Where humans must coexist with giant man eating spiders with human level intelligence and horse people that can see the future in the stars.

So muggleborns swagger in with their enlightenment ideals and mindset and basically no parents. It's a recipe for disaster.

Add in some justifiable resentment of having to hide from the cripples that dominate the majority of the planet. Which we pollute and destroy to accomplish things that magical folk can do with a word and a gesture.

** I think On the Way to Greatness did this best in this dialogue between Blaise and Harry. Huge wall of text:

#+begin_quote
  "No, I don't. I'm getting confused who thinks what about Muggles and Muggleborns."

  "Confused how?" Blaise asked.

  "Dumbledore is called a Muggle-lover, but he's not pushing for any adaptation programmes that I can see. He's just for freely admitting Muggleborns into our world. The Ministry doesn't seem to have any legislation on them---positive or negative. On the other hand, I don't believe that the Purebloods can possibly want to kill all Muggles; that's not practical, and the wizarding world would die out. I know that, when the Dark Lord was rising, Muggleborns looked like they were flooding the wizarding world with their numbers, wanting to change the wizarding world to be more like the Muggle one, and that the Dark Lord played on those fears. I don't see what he suggests as solution."

  "These fears are still very real," Blaise said. "The Pureblood families are dying out, that's obvious, but the Mudbloods are coming in, and they know nothing of our culture. They complain about being treated badly, but they do not try to integrate. They want change and equality, but to them it means just what you said---making the wizarding world more like the Muggle one and converting the Ministry into some bullshit populist institution. They've been trying to do this for decades, completely missing the point that this is not what the Ministry is supposed to be about."

  "What is it supposed to be about, then?"

  "The Ministry was founded upon signing the Statute of Secrecy, for the purpose of concealing magic from Muggles. It was not about governance, not about controlling the population, and for Merlin's sake not even nearly about controlling the magic. They've grown like a parasite and have tried to encroach on about every part of our lives---to the point that even learning is institutionalized. How they're expecting to progress while stifling the life out of us all, I have no idea."

  Harry eyed Blaise warily. He'd never heard Blaise speak in such an impassioned tone.

  "Of course, the Purebloods have tried to infiltrate the Ministry as much as possible," Blaise said after a few moments, in a more normal voice. "After all, one has to try and keep some control over the Ministry. But it has not been easy. The Dark Lord saw the same damn thing. You can't blame a good chunk of the old guard for agreeing, because it's the perfect truth, and there's no getting away from it. The status quo has had us languishing in stagnation, while the Mudbloods incoming en masse mess it all up even more."

  This was not helping. Harry wanted someone to prove to him that Voldemort was wrong, not detail how he made sense. All of this he'd already figured out from his readings, more or less, including the way the Ministry of Magic had expanded over the last three hundred years. Established amid witch-hunts---in fact, the Statute of Secrecy was signed in the year of the Salem witch trials---the Ministry's purpose had been, at the start, to keep magic users from displaying magic to Muggles. But then, slowly, and always with a good excuse, its powers had expanded.

  Gradually, it had acquired Aurors to enforce rules, and a judiciary to try offenders, and a prison to put them away. The Ministry had needed a department for controlling magical creatures that could reveal the wizards' existence; they had grown to outlaw keeping some creatures in private homes. They had founded a Department of Games and Sports, in order to keep track of Quidditch lest it be seen by Muggles. Of course there also had to be a department for cooperating internationally with other signatories of the Statute. Obliviators had to be controlled by the Ministry; then, there had remained only a step towards controlling Hogwarts curriculum and demanding that new spells be approved by the Ministry in order to be deemed legal.

  It seemed that the wizards had never truly agreed to the existence of the Ministry as a whole; it had just sort of happened, and its very nature precipitated a number of oddities. It seemed very strange to Harry, for example, that the wizarding world had no standing army. He remembered, back from Muggle school, that countries always had armies, but the Ministry only had domestic police forces. However, later he realized that, unless wizards wanted to break the Statute of Secrecy, there could be no wars between nations! It seemed that, back before the separation, wizards would participate in Muggle wars---the Muggles would have the numbers and the wizards the power. But after the separation, it became impossible.

  The wizarding world, apart from anything else, did not have enough people to have a true army, but it was a weird society in which every single person was a potential combatant, because every single person over eleven years of age carried a weapon. Harry thought it was similar to the Muggle world a very long time ago, when it had been completely normal for everybody to have swords and pistols and fight duels to their heart's content. In certain ways, before the separation in 1692, the societies must not have been all that different. They had grown apart, of course, since.

  Harry did not acquire all that knowledge from listening to Professor Binns' lectures, nor from reading Ministry-sanctioned literature. He wasn't sure just how heretical his views were, according to the Ministry, or what Dumbledore would have said of all of this; inevitably, of course, it made him feel like he understood even less about the war than he had before he'd started reading about it. Hermione's words rang out in his mind: it was easier to be content in the knowledge that Voldemort was simply wrong, no matter why.

  "Killing off all Muggles and Muggleborns is not the way to go about fixing anything," Harry said, grasping onto the one thing he was sure of. "It's not that I don't see what you're saying," he added, seeing Blaise's look. "I just can't believe that anyone would seriously consider getting rid of the Muggle element a solution to this problem. You said it yourself---the old Pureblood families are dying out. They die out, and what then?"

  "Surely you see that the issue is not in the Muggleborns as such, but in the Statute of Secrecy that prevents them from knowing anything about the wizarding world before they enter it," Blaise said calmly.

  "Salazar Slytherin was protesting the Muggleborns' presence at Hogwarts a thousand years ago!" Harry countered, incredulous. "You're not going to make this a recent issue, are you?"

  "He was protesting what he saw as a danger then," Blaise said. "If he saw what's going on now, he'd turn in his grave. Do try to use your imagination, Harry---how much of a problem would the Muggleborns be if they knew in advance about the wizarding world, and were aware of its customs? Conversely, how much more different would the wizarding world be, if not so disconnected from the Muggle one?"

  "But you can't abolish the Statute of Secrecy," Harry said. "Too much hinges on it. Who knows what will happen if you expose the wizarding world to Muggles! There might be a war, or something like that. I mean, not necessarily, but Muggles don't believe in magic. They'll think we are---aliens, or something!"

  "And therein lies the problem," Blaise summed up. "The wizards are tired in living of fear of exposure to Muggles, and living under the Statute of Secrecy is making true development impossible. The Muggleborns try to change the wizarding world in ways they see fit, but that's not true development; that's just blindly copying from what they know. The Ministry is set firmly on maintaining the status quo; and something, somewhere, has to change."

  It sounded to Harry as if Blaise believed what he was saying---and what he was saying was believable enough, to be sure.

If you only take it purebloods, you avoid contact with muggles and half muggle blood wizards. Humans advanced texhnology could wipe out wizard kind, so keeping muggles and wizards seperate makes sense.

It did evolve into madness though, but with Volde at the helm of the anti muggle movement, it makes sense. He did split is soul into 7 objects. Thats bound to cause some insanity! And Volde wasnt exactly nice to his followers. So fear alone would motivate his followers to do as he says and to frighten others into following him.

They might, they might not. Certainly, there was little to like about the inhabitants of tenth century western Europe, and while the enduring myth of the Dark Ages is just that, a myth, there was some truth to the notion that something of value had gone out of the world with the fall of Rome. Europe had fractured into a patchwork of petty kingdoms that, while perfectly reasonable places to live, weren't a patch on the Pax Romana. The tenth century was the tail end of about four centuries of one damned thing after another - the Umayyads, the Goths, the Franks, the Danes, three centuries of re-outbreaks of the Plague of Justinian, the Reconquista, the list goes on.

The people and cultures shaped by that shit-show were probably, to a wizard who was demonstrably their better - magic was /much/ more of an advantage back then - not worth bothering with.

Whether he /really/ had a hardon for purebloods can't really be determined from what we see: the only primary source shown in the books is the Sorting Hat, but we also see that magical artefects can be 'hacked' to do whatever is needed, as witness the Goblet of Fire. JKR has suggested that the term 'pureblood' is from the 15th-16th century, and was part of the movement toward separation of the magical and mundane worlds, after all. The reason for Salazar flouncing out of the school he helped found could be /anything/ at this remove of time, and the fact that the only intra-human racism the wizarding world has now is against muggleborns doesn't mean things were the same back then.

For all we know, he could have been a thundering racist against the Franks, and resigned rather than, in the years following 1066, teach the new Norman nobility's kids. We'd never know at this remove of time, since making up history out of whole cloth to justify current politics is a long-hallowed tradition in the British Isles.

What we /do/ know is that his feelings can't have been strong enough to keep him out of a joint venture with three mages who were willing to teach anyone who pitched up seeking instruction.
