Don't get me wrong I don't hate Snape as a character but he is quite the asshole and people have different things that tick them off so I was curious.

To be clear this isn't the worst thing he did. Just the thing or things ( if you can't pick just one) he did that irritated you the most.

Which could be the worst thing he did , but might not be, not necessarily. Kinda like how Voldemort objectively worse than umbridge but most find her more irritating.

Edit: For me personally its outing Lupin as a werewolf


** "I see no difference."

It's just blatantly, casual, petty cruelty.

** When Hermione is hexed with growing teeth and Snape says he doesn't see any difference. That situation didn't even involve anything that might trigger him (like marauders, death eaters, Potter(s), etc). It was just a hallway fight and a clearly hurt schoolgirl, and he's a teacher who's supposed to, you know, help, not make it worse.

*** That was seriously so cruelly petty. I felt so bad for Neville. Honestly he treated Neville worse than Harry and he didn't even have reason. He didn't have a good or justifiable reason for treating Harry like that. But he had a bitter petty reason. For Neville he doesn't even have a bad reason. I think thats kind of revealing about his character. Not in like a wow he's a asshole but just he has a tendency to lash out is general not just at people he thinks he has a reason to hate.

**** He does have a reason to hate Neville. It's not a good reason mind you, but it's a reason nonetheless. Riddle targeted Harry, when he could have easily targeted Neville. In theory, Lily would be alive.

** Using his death to give Harry carefully selected memories, designed to confuse Harry enough to martyr himself and on the off chance Harry survives, white-wash Snapes legacy of hatred and bigotry?

Ohh and I don't /hate/ Snape, I hate that his actions don't really have consequences... (yes he dies, but joing the DE's signed his death warrant so he was living on borrow time anyways). Now I don't like him, but it ticks me off when he is portrayed as a paragon of virtue, or as evil personified....

He was a bitter man who took it out on children, but out of guilt worked for the white hats.

** The fact that he (and other people) considers him a teacher. It doesn't matter if he is or isn't imparting knowledge in a competent way, teaching involves interacting with children and he utterly fails at that. Scratch that, fail isn't a strong enough word for how inadequate he is at interacting with people, let alone children.

He has to insult a man that was dead for over a decade, to son of that man's face. He is so biased towards his own house that it makes a mockery of the whole house and point system. He has Neville so terrified of him that he is the boy's boggart.

Sure, he might have been helpful at times. But he is such a failure of a person that it's surprising he hasn't been offed by a student's parent yet. Neville's grandmother certainly would have if she knew.

** Calling Hermione an insufferable know-it-all. In the books it was frustrating, but when you get a person playing such a hateable character, yelling at a 14 year old on screen is borderline infuriating. Though I will say, both Emma Watson and Alan Rickman give stellar performances in that scene.

** That Wait What? collection of one shots highlights a lot of them.

Probably the entire way he acted in the shrieking shack in book 3. Planning on getting Sirius and Remus both killed, having heard the entire story and knowing the truth but just not caring, and then having the gall to imply he deserved an award for it. Pro Snape people will claim he went to the shack to save the children, but that's due more to Alan Rickman than Rowling. Book Snape makes it very clear he went there to prove himself right about Sirius and Remus both and remained convinced of his opinions even after being proven wrong.

Otherwise, all of his interactions with Neville to the point that Snape was Neville's boggart. And then the fact that rather than taking this as a wakeup call he was even more nasty to Neville due to how he defeated the Boggart. Trash human actions.

This thread was about things Snape actually did, not about what fanfiction writer with poor reading comprehension imagined he did. "Wait, what?" is a terrible fic and this is one of the worst chapters: the author is actually citing the text that completely disproves his claims! Snape msot certainly did not learn about Pettigrew being alive before being knocked out and his reaction at the "entire story" (how the Marauders had been secret Animagi, how they had let out Remus as a Werewolf and how Remus had neglected to inform Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus who could enter the school through hidden passages) is certainly understandable.

** Snape: /exists/

While I appreciate Snape as a character, I hate him as a person. While I respect and reluctantly accept Snape as canon character, even with his spite, prejudice and petty hatred, to my mind he did most of his evil after he died. Lord save me from Snape fangirls.

** For me its talking shit about Harry's father.

Now I know some people may argue about this, but the point of the matter is that James Potter has been dead for over a decade and this teacher talks shit to the son, who cant remeber anything about his family apart from the fact they died for him.

What a piece of shit, and I quite like Snape.

** “Well, it's more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean. ...” (yes, I understand the irony)

I agree with all reasons given here, but I think there is more. I really deeply hate that anything which is labelled “love” is the universal excuse for anything. No, he didn't love Lily Evans, it was some kind of obsessive idée fixe. I don't mean that love should be cool and dispassionate, but even the deepest healthy love should after fifteen years either move on (“there is more than one fish in the sea”) or, if it is not possible, at least get to the state of the melancholic celibacy (“when not her, there is no woman for me”). Hurting son of your dead love just doesn't make any sense.

And I am generally for-canon guy including Epilogue, but Albus Severus Potter is just too much even for me. I can with some suspension of disbelief accept naming your son after Dumbledore, he was even with all his many flaws probably great leader in the style of Churchill or people like that (read some criticism of Churchill to know what I mean), but Severus is just evil bad person who just happened to choose the right side for his benefit. Yes, “Those to whom evil is done // Do evil in return”, but it doesn't change anything on the fact that evil is evil. After all that poem was about Hitler.

** That scene with Hermione's growing teeth. I get that he pretty much always favors his own house (at least in front of Harry, which is all we see in canon), but there comes a point where it becomes too much. Severus was the adult. Act like it damn it.
