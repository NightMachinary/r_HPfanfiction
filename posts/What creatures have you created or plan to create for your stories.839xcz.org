For now I've only really worked out the ideas for two creatures, both used in stories I've since shelved.

Creature one is a unicorn/thestral hybrid i've yet to name. It retains the coloring and horn of a unicorn but takes on the skeletal physiology, reptilian skin, silver eyes, and bat like wings of the thestral. Have yet to name but Thescorn or Thescorned is one i'm debating due to how it looks like 'the scorn/ed' portmanteau'ed and how they'd be looked at as horrifying more so than thestrals, corrupting the 'perfection' of a unicorn. I may bring the idea back for Darkness Ascendant but doubtful.

Creature two is my favorite. I mused on the idea of how a Basilisk is formed: a toad sits on a chicken egg. But what if a phoenix were to hatch a dragon egg? I saw a small dragon, maybe fifty pounds with butterflyesque wings, jeweled eyes, and loyal to a fault if you can befriend it with its favorite food, bird of paradise flowers. Its fire is weak, only a few inches and only hot enough to cook its food. Unlike the Phoenix its tears won't heal but its song will strengthen the will of the good and its urine is a potent hallucinogenic when fermented and crystallized then powdered. Okay, i just added that last bit as a partial joke but i think it would be hilarious to see it be reported then all the fae dragons(one of the many names I debated) all of a sudden being regulated after being an insanely popular gift to give to little kids and women you want to impress.


** Ink imp - a small gelatinous thing usually shaped like a whiptail gecko. Excellent hearing, but very nearsighted by human comparison. Can absorb content of books by having a transcription charm cast on it while standing on the book. Mostly survives on nontoxic fluids (milk, honey, ink, blood). Can exude ink from any of its limbs, but typically writes using the tail. It can also erase fresh ink by absorbing it out of the paper.

**** Exactly that - the first one was derived from hybrid egg brewed to life with a Quick-quotes quill used to stir the potion. Ink imps are of human intelligence (once they absorb enough books) and enjoy acting as stenographer to a witch or wizard, so long as they are living an interesting life.

******* In Darkness Ascendant there's the Academy, a company that has thousands of Master level mages taking every book written, distilling the knowledge, and creating a comprehensive Encyclopedia Arcana, all while able to work on their own projects to expand their own knowledge in the potterverse's version of a PhD program. As well as other very profitable and some not so profitable projects, such as the MARS project, the Mission to Arcadia[Planitia], Residence Stratagem, a goal for Mages to colonize mars.

Angela [messenger of god, thus the WORD] Carpenter [uses a HAMMER], a muggleborn working in the experimental pets section will accidentally inseminate an axolotl egg clutch with something magical I think. She'll demo them to Harry who thinks his girl friends will love them.

** For my story, a Nuckelavee will appear as an antagonist.

Blast-End Skrewts in my story are made by incubating Fire Crab eggs in boiling Manticore blood. Hagrid had to get a permit from the Ministry to breed them.

There will also be a newly-discovered breed of dragon that is only three feet tip-to-tail, and can be domesticated. Hagrid is understandably ecstatic that he can legally have a dragon.

Also, Naga will play a major role.

** I haven't straight up created any creatures out of whole cloth, but I have taken existing mythological creatures and put my own spin on them.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7619716][The Water Horse]] features a, uh, water horse that lives in Lake Merced in San Francisco. He is paired with a dryad and together they take care of the water and land environment that they live in. Ginny gets to touch him and says that he feels like a combination between a soft newborn kitten and a cool drink on a hot summer day.

Both [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8907268][The Thunderbird's Egg]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/12132915][Learning to Fly]] have thunderbirds which feature in Native American mythology. When they take off to fly they generate sonic booms and lightning sizzles along their feathers. They also need a thunderstorm to hatch their eggs.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8759671][The Selkie's Wife]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/10470342][The Selkie's Gift]] feature selkies--legendary seal-like creatures that shed their skins on land to become humanoid. In legends, they needed their skins to transform back and forth and fishermen that had fallen in love with a selkie woman would hide the skin away from her, forcing her to stay with him. In The Selkie's Gift, Harry and Ginny need a bit of extra help to conceive their first child and they're still not sure what the full repercussions of that help will be.

Your cross between the dragon and the phoenix reminds me of one of the World of Warcraft pets--a sort of butterfly dragon. I remember I managed to get one on one of my Horde toons back when they were super-rare. Good times. There are so many more legendary creatures out there. Sometimes I grab our old D&D Monster Manual and page through for inspiration!

** Not actually original, but if I ever actually get around to writing my own fic I'll definitely include it:

Mongolian Death Worms: Colloquially known as Graboids. An ancient magical species of predatory worm. Considered a XXXX species. They tunnel through the ground at surprising speed and ambush their prey, which they detect via vibrations, drawing it into their maws with their strong tongue tentacles. They can be surprisingly clever, similar to other apex predators. They use their magic to aid in moving through the earth, though solid stone seriously hinders them. There are a couple sub-species capable of shocking their prey, spewing acid, or simply reaching unusual size. They are very hardy, able to resist large amounts of physical damage, and extreme environmental conditions including vacuum, radiation and high heat, though extreme cold sends them into hibernation. Their resemblance to thresher maws, sarlaccs, asteroid worms, and other types of giant worm beast is coincidental. They have an unusual metamorphic lifecycle that aids in their spread, though they can reproduce either sexually or asexually at any stage. Their eggs can lie dormant for millions of years waiting for the right conditions to hatch. While Mongolia's Gobi Desert currently boasts the only active population, solitary examples pop up every now and then around the world when their eggs are disturbed. Most recently a small mundane town in Nevada was assaulted by a group of awakened Graboids (providing this new name), and miraculously managed to fight them off.

** Like most people here, it's bending existing creatures. Since I adore turtles/tortoises I have used a 'diluted' fire crab in one of my stories. Or; a tortoise with the jewels, without shooting fire, a lovely pet for the average witch or wizard. Made by breeding fire crabs with regular tortoises. And also a variation of the 'island turtle' as seen [[https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e8/de/fd/e8defd14184da95f59a4181d3b3a162b.jpg][here.]] This is concept art for The Huntsman; Winter's War, I think. And I love it.

Also, somehow I thought this was canon, but I can't find it anywhere? In magical homes, dust gathers into actual animate dust bunnies that hop around and run away from you when you are cleaning.

***** Nah, nothing mentioned in 'Fantastic Beasts'. I feel like they were once mentioned in passing. Like cleaning up Grimmauld place and then a vague mention of dustbunnies? Nothing that's really expanded upon. Perhaps it's all in my own head upon discovering the word /dust bunnies/ or perhaps I've seen it in a fic before. Not a clue.

** "Creatures" might be stretching it, and I wouldn't say I created them, but I'm planning on having nymphs play a semi-important role in my extremely AU fic, "Holly Potter and the Witching World." Basically they're nature spirits that have taken the forms of beautiful naked women, and like house-elves they have magic capable of doing things human magic can't.

My story is VERY AU. :)

** My fic has several newish creatures. Two new species of dragon have chapter or two of screen time. Mountain Rocs are mentioned in passing, and more. I plan on there being much worse than what I have mentioned. In a way, the Goblet of Fire in my fic is a creature... a twisted sadistic monsterous creature that ravages in the pain and suffering of the contestants...

** Some creatures I've imagined over the years, witch anyone has my permission to use should you want to.

Canadian Silverback Dragon: The Canadian Silverback is the smallest of all dragon species, mejuring only four 4 1/2 feet in length when fully grown. They are blue in colour with a patch of silver running down one end of the back to the other. You can tell the difference between the males and females by color of their horns and claws, they are a darker shade of grey on the males. While they are the most docile of all the dragon species, they are still extremely dangerous. They can be found in the mountainous regions of Canada and the northern US.

Shadowfish: A magical species of fish found in the ocean. While they can be found almost anywhere, but are most common in the water around Africa and India. They are pretty mush harmless and eat marine plants. In appearance they look similar to an angelfish only they are completely black. They are capable of becoming invisible to hide from predators. Their scales are used in the brewing of the invisibility potion.

Quickhund: A breed of magical dog bread in Germany. They started out as regular old German Shepards, but over time through breeding and lots of complicated spell work they have become magical. Basically they are German Shepherds that can run as fast as cheetahs.
