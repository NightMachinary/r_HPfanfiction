I remember seeing as story on here a few times that only had some of its chapters updated to ff.net. I think it was this one, but I don't know where the full story would be found. Thanks for the help.


** Yes, they can be found on DLP under the Works By Author section. You'll need an account and a valid posting history (I believe it required ~7 posts) before you can access it, so a 2-3 day effort if you're willing. I think there's an additional 6 chapters (takes it partway into the Triwizard Tournament) or so to be found there that can't be found on FFN.

**** It might be a bit annoying, but it's not tough to do. I've been on DLP for years, we're a friendly bunch as long as you're not an idiot.

Just post a few reviews or check out our other sections, topics range from politics to league of legends. You might even like it there.

The downvoting of anyone saying anything remotely negative about DLP in this entire post says otherwise. Oh, irony.

I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of downvotes came from non DLP users.

**** It is annoying, but it's also somewhat understandable, since apparently someone was spamming new accounts and then ripping off fics from the WBA section and posting them on FFN as his own. I don't quite know how their new policies are intended to combat this (other than raising the barrier to access said fics slightly), but I don't much care as long as I have access without anything overly tedious.

tl;dr: It's less of a hassle and more effective to take the steps to gain access than it is to complain about it.

** Is the story still being worked on? As i have never written a story, I dont feel like Works by Author is a place I should read in. If it id still being worked on, I'll just wait until it is published

*** It's hard to say. There hasn't been an update in a while, but then again, the last time he updated it was after several years of silence. So there's always a chance.

The reason why it stopped updating originally is that the author went to law school, so it's understandable. I suspect he's now more or less left the fandom entirely.

****** There's actually a lot of good stuff to be found in the Works By Author section, works that can't be found elsewhere, so I would recommend exploring if you like fics of similar quality to HP&tBWL.

Further, though this aspect doesn't really require an account except to contribute your own vote, they have a pretty extensive archive of already-screened works, so you don't have to wade through as many badfics as you would if you just browsed the FFN archive.

****** The elitism. They hold fics to an impossibly high standard, and it severely discourages new writers who might not be good /now/ but with the right *constructive* criticism would improve.

Not only that they have an annoying "boys club" clique vibe in their forums.

******* If they held fics to an impossibly high standard then they wouldn't have 690 fics, from the HP fandom alone, in their library. Additionally new writers are offered constructive criticism but unfortunately the majority do not take that onboard and are offended when the /major/ flaws in their stories are pointed out.

All DLP authors were new to DLP at some point, the ones who stay are the ones who take constructive criticism on board and want to continue to improve their writing.

Don't they know that every single story ever written is perfect, and every writer beyond rebuke.

******* You say elitest like it's a bad thing. It really isn't. Holding people to a standard only increases drive and ability in the long run.

Plenty of DLP writers want to transition to being professional authors, some have succeeded. They aren't going to get there without proper criticism and high standards.

If it's not for you, than that's fine, but there's a reason a disproportionate amount of great fics in the fandom come from DLP writers, and that many outside writers come to improve.

**** As I understand it, the main reason why he hasn't uploaded to FF.Net is that he hasn't yet made the edits to the chapters based on the WBA comments. Whenever he gets time to write he chooses to work on a new chapter rather than editing the old ones.

**** If you based your entire use of the WbA section around thread ratings then you're doing it wrong. The appeal and benefit of WbA is the replies.

However, let's go with your 'use' of the forum which treats ratings as basically the review counter on FF.net.

If your thread has been consistently rated 3-5 stars and averages around 4 stars, and then suddenly you take a deep dive to 2 stars, with no apparent reason, then clearly either a) someone doesn't like your story at all, or b) as you say, someone is downvoting it out of spite/troll.

Actually, this reminds me of something. Were you the guy that messaged all the Moderators with an in-depth private message detailing how the system could be abused, and then when we assured you that it was so uncommon it was downright impractical to 'guard against', that you went ahead and down voted every story in the library to 'prove your point'?
