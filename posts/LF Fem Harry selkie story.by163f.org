:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a semi old (maybe 2 years old?)female Harry x selkie Tom Riddle story and am having a hard time finding it. I think it was in 2 parts, and Hagrid was a fisherman. That's all I can really remember about it. I wanted to draw the pair, and wanted to reread it for some inspiration. Anyone have any ideas of the story I'm talking about? Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: I found it. It was a story by Nocturnememory. Does anyone know if she/he writes anymore, or are they gone for good?

Another edit: the story is called Uisce Dorcha for those who were wondering.

*** Like it's any weirder than any other creature fic out there. It's just an au drabble/one shot about voldemort being a sea monster/creature. At least it's completely au and not just shoving weird changes into canon-verse without reason/logic like some fics do.
