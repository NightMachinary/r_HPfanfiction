Unfortunately for him, she wants absolutely nothing to do with him, because from her perspective he's giving off major 'creepy old man' vibes.


** Honestly the closest I've come to seeing this is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Sarah1281's /Oh God Not Again!/]], and even then, it's not remotely central to the plot.

** That's not fair - I read at least one where Ginny was still 9, not 11

But really, the concept of a redo fic is really ruined by the attempt to force awkward romance on pre-teens

*** If they are both there then it turns into them both somehow sneaking out on the first night to meet up in a abandoned classroom to talk about it and ofc do the iconic 11yr old kiss scene

**** If I was to write a scene like that, I'd have them stop before any kissing happens with them feeling weireded out by the other looking too young for them to feel comfortable doing such thing; then agreeing to wait a few years, until they were physically 15 or thereabouts.

***** Yeah that's more appropriate. It is horribly weird when they still want to kiss what's essentially a 11yr old.

****** I remember a Hinny soul bond time travel fic where they kiss infront of entire Weasley family and no one says a single thing. Like are you not freaking out that your daughter suddenly got a lot more mature, hits it of with Harry Potter and by the time they are going to Hogwarts they are kissing?
