**** I never leave reviews. Mostly because I'm in the terrible habit of not writing reviews. I have old stories that I've read multiple times that I've never reviewed. There are stories where I can't wait for the update, but I don't leave a review when the chapter comes out. It doesn't necessarily mean I have nothing to say. I just don't review. I know, I'm terrible. So don't take it personally. On the other hand, I'm very discriminatory about what I follow or favorite. So don't discount those.

** I only really review if I have something to say, and I only really have something to say if there's something about the fic that brings down an otherwise good story.

If the fic's just poor all round, I won't bother as it's a lost cause. A fic that's good but could have been great? That's impossible to resist. The sweet spot for getting a long review out of me is to write a good fic that presents itself as keeping to canon, but does some kind of violence to canon that I feel I must address...

** Because writing a review takes way more effort.

With YouTube videos, experiments have shown that a quick "Like & Subscribe" at the end of the video increases those rates the most, and I guess it's the same with FanFiction.

Idea: No ANs, but a single sentence:

#+begin_quote
  For a short bonus-scene, leave a review! I will PM it to you.
#+end_quote

I think that should encourage people to review, and people don't skip over it. People tend to skip over long ANs.

I have no evidence that this will work, but we can try it.

*** It's just that another writer I follow who does the same ship as I do gets like over 20 reviews per chapter and her reader count is maybe only 100 more than mine. I'm just wondering what the difference might be. She's more standoffish and doesn't PM with her reviewers, I know for a fact because I comment on most of her chapters, and she doesn't AN either. The only major difference between us is that she's been posting stories for years and I've only done 1 story, so maybe she's built up more of a talkative following that way.

Maybe more aloof writers are more intriguing and readers want to try to talk to them more? Idk.

** - It's annoying to unfollow a story on ff (compared to ao3) so it can takes me a while to do it after I lose interest in a fanfiction.

- I don't really know what to say apart from "it was good" / "not bad" so I prefer to not post this kind of review.

- Sometimes, I don't like some parts of the story (character, plot, relationship whatever..) but since the fanfiction has potential and can be interesting, I follow it in hope it will get better.

** Usually, I leave a review for every chapter I read, no matter if the story is already completed or WIP. Mostly, I write a few words more in the hope to get an answer from the author. As much as I like writing reviews I also like to get a reply from the author.

I don't bother to write a review for each chapter when I'm sure the author isn't around anymore. In this case, I only leave a thank you for the final chapter. I usually stop writing reviews if I didn't get a reply after 20 or so reviews. The reviews also help me keep track of the story I've already read.\\
Sometimes, when I find a new story, I'm surprised that I already left a bunch of reviews two years ago, lol. My reviews usually consist of the thoughts I have while reading. They often consist of a lot of questions, but I don't expect to get answers. I think it might be interesting for the author to see what impressions and questions a reader might have.

Of course, I also enjoy every review I get for my stories, and I write at least a thank you for every review, even if it was just a "good work, keep it up".

I don't get a lot of reviews, probably because I've only written one-shots so far. The best story got 31 reviews in total so far (spread over the two sites I'm posting my stories). On the other hand, English isn't my native language, so there are probably far better stories than mine. In the end, it's all just for fun.

** 400 hundred not a ton? It's still a lot better than most stories. Be proud of how many are interested in your fic :) I'm in the same boat, though, with only 10-ish reviews per chapter on my story and it has a thousand more followers than you! I've also done all of those same things (asked my reviewers questions in A/Ns, left chapters on cliff-hangers, and was updating weekly for a very long time, PM'd reviewers...).

I think readers in general don't say much, because they're just that, readers. They aren't looking for a dialogue, just to read. They don't know what it's like to put so much effort into a work, only to post it and receive nothing, nor just how exciting it is to receive feeback, so they don't see why they should as long as the stories keeps coming.

It's also good to keep in mind on FF that the follows are also used as something as bookmark feature for stories TBRL. So there's a decent chunk of your followers who likely haven't read your fic at all yet and are waiting for you to complete it or for when they have time to put the effort into reading it. So, you probably have a few less readers than you actually think, which, still, doesn't make the lack of reviews any less frustrating, but at least it means there are possibly less silent readers out there?

** I think in general most people review if the story gets them emotionally invested. An extremely well-written story with a more sedate plot might not have as many reviews because readers don't get the same amount of ZOMG so cool from an OP Harry story, for example. Especially early on when the story is still being set up and the pace has yet to pick up. It's also why I think romance and pairings tend to be the focus of quite a lot of reviews, and fics that promote a certain pairing might spark more reviews; pairings are an easy way to get invested in a story, because for people who ship the pairing, it's familiar and sparks all kinds of feels.

That being said, the amount of reviews a fic has, or how favourable said reviews are, does not always point towards a well-written story because of what I've said above. What many of the fanfiction community (on [[https://ffn.net][ffn.net]], at least) finds appealing tends to be power wanks, or a kind of fast-paced plot with plenty of wish fulfilment plugged in. And of course, those would be the exact opposite of a well-written plot in reality. Many readers seem to have a relatively short attention span when it comes to fanfiction, and a slow plot with an explosive ending will have fewer high-satisfaction moments that bring in massive amounts of reviews. Conversely, a fast-paced plot with plenty of moments where readers can go, wow that's so badass, or omg, cuteeeeee, will bring in more reviews per chapter.

I don't think the number of reviews really relates to the author's personality. This might be because I personally don't tend to read A/Ns (and am consistently surprised whenever one of my readers reads my rambling A/Ns) and so don't feel like the author's personality impacts on my feelings of the story beyond what can be gleaned from the writing itself.

It's not a failing to avoid reviewing, people shouldn't need to feel that they have to defend themselves or offer excuses as to why they don't. Yet there is always a constant barrage of posts demanding that they explain themselves.
