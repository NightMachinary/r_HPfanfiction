In every AU there is either one or multiple changes to cannon that impact the entire story. Most of the time, these changes are to Harry's character. At what point, what change, does Harry stop being himself to you? (Ship of Theseus, anyone?)

For some reason, you can change most anything you want about Harry's personality with the right circumstances and I'll happily read on. But if you try and tell me that Lily and James aren't his parents, then you've made him an OC. It just seems so integral to who he is. His mothers eyes, his fathers looks. Love and Loyalty. His freaking patronus is James' animagus and his dementor moment is Lily's death. And yeah if it's an AU those two things might not be happen, but it just stops being about Harry Potter if he isn't their kid.

I'll read the fic and might have just a good a chance of liking it, but he's now an OC. Any opinions?


** As long as Harry's a well-written character, and /something/ out of the world, mechanics, themes, &c is the same, then I could potentially enjoy something. That being said, a good rule of thumb is to keep one's fic!Harry within the bounds of extrapolations and interpolations of canon!Harry about particular highlighted aspects or points of divergence.

** I headed out pretty quickly but I remember reading one where first harry parents weren't James and Lily and his real parents where muggles and his name was actually David and then he moved to a muggles school in America and the was no mention of magic again like that's not even a harry potter fanfic at that point

** One idea is Harry being born a month premature, ensuring he will not become the Boy-Who-Lived.

*** "Prophecy you say? Well bugger that!" shouted Lily as she headed to a muggle hospital to induce labor.

**** A Harry born June 30th would have been developing for 35 weeks and a bit, assuming he was conceived on October 31st, 1979 (That just seems thematic). He might have some very minor issues from being born almost two weeks premature (July 31st is 39 weeks exactly, babies are not premature if born after 37 weeks), but from what I could find, about 99% of babies survive being born at 35 weeks and a bit. With Saint Mungo's and Muggle Hospitals being well up to scratch by 1980, Harry being born a month before his canon birthdate would not even be that big a problem.

** If Harry is intentionally cruel, studies obsessively as a character quirk, or doesn't have some backbone, he's not Harry.

** For me any of these I consider it an OC and usually stop reading:

- *Different parents*
- *Different age* - I saw a story (WBWL trope) where his brother was literally Harry's age and Harry was older by few years. Like what the actual F!?
- *Different gender* - I've yet to see a compelling fem!harry story that is more than just to avoid slash when pairing up or at best a canon rehash with few "girly" lines thrown in.
- *Different name* - this I can live with if good enough reasons in the story. Except /Hadrian/ et al. bullshit name changes.
- *Squib Harry*

Not a bad idea if you want a more mature Harry dealing with canon events.

**** Idea isn't bad if Harry is still same age and born same time. Not when he is made several years older. I think in the story he was in the same year as Weasley Twins. So yeah for me it was an OC and no longer canonical character. But yes it can still be a good story - not arguing about that.

*** Different Gender: A Long Journey Home and Victoria Potter are both genderbent Harry that are excellent without being cannon rehashes. While Victoria Potter follows cannon it also diverges into interesting subplots, while A Long Journey is simply incredible.

** For some reason, I have a hard time with fics where they drastically change Harry's looks. Fine with the occasional creature inheritance fic, but if it causes him to suddenly grow long hair I'm out. (I admit that I have no idea why I'm like this.)

That said, I'm far more into AUs that diverge at some point in the middle or towards the end of canon. Keep his formative years exactly the same, but if something huge is changed in like... fourth year? Gimme.

** I agree with you and imo changing the gender of a character also make them an OC.

** As long as it's well-written, I don't particularly care. The ship of Theseus still gets you from port to port, and alternate-personality genderbends with different parents can still be worth reading. (Not that I can think of any with that specific combination of traits off the top of my head, but I'm sure they're out there.)

*** But are you even reading about Harry Potter at that point? Like I said in the post, I might still read, but it's not about Harry Potter to me.

**** It's hard to say, since there are a lot of changes that make it 'not Harry' in certain ways, but I don't know that they really harm immersion or anything. I guess I just don't really make that a divide in my mind, whether a given version 'is Harry' or not, when reading. I can't say I've ever picked up a story and said 'well, this Harry is too different, I need to imagine him/her as an OC instead of Harry'.
