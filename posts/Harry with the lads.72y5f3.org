Any good fics where Harry and Ron just bro it out? Have a guys night out with the other Gryffindor boys? Try to hook up with the Quidditch Girls?

Been watching a lot of The Inbetweeners lately and I was hoping there was a Harry Potter fic like it. I already read the one where Harry and Ron have a bet to hook up with Daphne and Hermione respectively where Riddle was the DADA teacher.

I'll also accept fics where Harry isn't friends or even on good terms with Hermione, because I'm getting tired of her being his best pal in pretty much every fic I've read this week.

Ron and Harry are basically two constantly drunk old men who can't take anything seriously. Kind of fits your request.

  Harry and Ron, both 58 and both alcoholics, are sent back to their 4th year and given a chance to do everything again. Will they be able to do it right this time? Or will history repeat itself? Canon to Epilogue, then not so much... (Reworked)

  AU In Seventh year, Harry and Ron make a stupid bet about a couple girls. Fairly light-hearted, fairly explicit, fairly slow paced coming of age story. No bashing, pairings TBD.

**** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431454/1/What-Would-Broz-Do-A-Harry-Ron-Series-of-Events]])

The bot didn't refresh because the full title of the story is "What Would Broz Do?: A Harry & Ron Series of Events". It was published and updated in April-May of this year, so it may be too early to say RIP since it may just be on hiatus.
