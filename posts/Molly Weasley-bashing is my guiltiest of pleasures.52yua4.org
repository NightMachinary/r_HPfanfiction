Of all the tropes, characterizations, story lines, etc of fanfiction that I shouldn't like but do, the bashing of Molly Weasley is my favorite.

Now, I know Molly isn't a perfect person. She can be a bit overbearing and stubborn. But the books clearly aim to show her as a wonderful mother and kind-hearted person.

So when I read a fic that takes the one negative trait of hers and exaggerates it to the point where she only exists to be a terrible shrew, I should hate it. It's bad characterization, unrealistic in any world, and simply bad writing. Yet I can't help but enjoy it immensely.

I just read an alternate-DH story where Ginny was being smeared in the press as a "scarlet woman" and engaging in Dark Arts. While every friend of hers and her family knew it couldn't be true, Molly Weasley believed it was. Every single Weasley and Harry had to read her the riot act and she only begrudgingly accepted it.

Of course, this is ridiculously OOC. But what can I say?

Does anyone else have similar feelings about Molly-bashing?

What is your guilty pleasure?


** I don't like bashing of others but there is something so nice in bashing Molly.

  "Yes" said Mrs Weasley her lip curling, "the thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?"
#+end_quote

This is Mollys reply to Sirius in OotP when they're fighting in the kitchen.

It made me dislike her thoroughly.

*** That was a very low blow. It was the Ministry's and Dumbledore's fault that he was in there, not his own. Also, Molly's "looking After" Harry was a few weeks in the summer for a few years. Not exactly heroic. No one had been there for him most of his life.

**** Well she kinda was a jackass to Sirius, but not ridiculous for her to be that way. Imagine if 12 years into Charles Manson being tossed in prison, it turns out he was innocent and setup and is actually the godfather of your son's best friend who you have practically adopted as your own. You'd find it pretty difficult to just go all open arms with the guy. Sirius Black was the most hated and feared prisoner in wizarding Britain. It would be unrealistic if everyone made any easy transition.

**** That comment is only really bad if you consider Sirius a good role model. Could she have said it nicer? Yes, but if I recall the scene they were in the middle of a rather heated argument. The fact of the matter is that Sirius is a terrible role model for a child. He's a depressed, angry man with psychological issues from being tortured for 12 years and should honestly be allowed no where near children. He's short tempered and petty with an unwillingness to give up the past and imposing the image of his dead best friend onto said friends teen son. He has a clear problem discerning Harry from James and therefore has a hard time seeing why it might be a bad idea to let a fifteen year old kid in on the inner workings of a resistance group.

From a responsible parents point of view Sirius is a terrible guardian/parent/role model and Molly Weasley has every right to question his decisions when it comes to Harry since she's been more of a parent to him then anyone else at this point in his life.

**** heheh, Molly was a lovely mother, who cooked excellently well. However, she was also a bit of a snark, with a bit of a temper, and something of a badass, who managed to out-duel Bellatrix. I believe it's one of those weird things, where teens have trouble readjusting their view of adults as teens themselves start to grow up - Molly wasn't just a mother. She was a veteran, who had lost much inside a war, and was seeing another war coming, without taking an active role in it. She was a witch who had seen shit, and had raised five kids and just birthed the sixth when the war ended. She wasn't perfect. She had demons. Life was no doubt very stressful for her. Arthur, although he fought for what he believed in at the cost of a better income, wasn't a stand-up dad or husband (flying car, lack of discipline, low income, bad with money). She nearly lost her daughter to Voldemort and a Basilisk, and all the other near misses her boys have had, and she always knew he'd come back.

It may not have been a fair comment of hers, but I do like how it shows the snarky side of Molly.

** I'm not a big fan of Weasley bashing in general, but I make an exception for Molly. My opinion of her hit rock bottom after Hermione received her tiny toffee-filled dragon egg in GoF. Molly had spent weeks getting to know Hermione at the Burrow when she spent the summer there, but instantly tossed her own opinion aside in lieu of Rita Skeeter's obviously biased reporting.

I was extremely disappointed to see that the woman who ended up becoming Harry's (and Hermione's!) mother-in-law and served as a semi-surrogate mother throughout his youth could be so petty. Would it honestly have killed her to /ask/ Hermione if there was any truth to the rumours about her and Harry? AFAIK she never even bothered to apologise after she was proven wrong, just this:

#+begin_quote
  Harry looked between them, then said, "Mrs. Weasley, you didn't believe that rubbish Rita Skeeter wrote in Witch Weekly, did you? Because Hermione's not my girlfriend."

  "Oh!" said Mrs. Weasley "No - of course I didn't!"

  But she became considerably warmer toward Hermione after that.

*** Rita Skeeter was a household name, and well respected, there was usually some truth to what she wrote. Her book about Dumbledore was factual. I suspect she was just influenced, or even paid, to have an anti-Harry bias, and to try to hurt him. So it's not hard to believe that the average citizen would believe what she wrote. Teen girls are funny creatures, even after about two weeks with a girl you can't say you truly know her. I knew lots of lovely girls in my teens, who could be absolute dicks to boys

** Molly is one of my favorite characters in the series. She has great dynamics with so many characters: with Harry, with her family, with Sirius, with Fleur. With Harry, it is how readily she takes him in and accepts him as one of her own, and Harry's feelings for her change from seeing her as his best friend's kind-hearted mother, to GoF: /"He had no memory of ever being hugged like this, as though by a mother."/ She is the heart of the Weasley family: her reltionships with Percy, with Arthur, with the Twins, with Ron and with Ginny are major parts of all of their character arcs. The whole scene with the boggart: where her greatest fear is revealed to be her family's death, is excellent. I love her relationship with Arthur: there is something really authentic in the way they complement each other, a perfectly balanced old-school couple.

Her dynamic with Fleur is great too, a brilliant look at how the attitudes of different generations clash. Fleur is arrogant and snobbish, lazy and vain. Fleur finds country life boring, hates British food, does not understand the need for all zis ‘ousework, disdains Celestina Warbeck. Molly... does not understand her at all. She simply cannot fathom how on earth could her darling Bill fall for such a strange and loathsome creature. She then proceeds to deem their love superficial and shallow; their marriage a mistake. Oh, she tries not to show it - she scolds Ginny for calling her Phlegm - but subtlety was never Molly's strong suit, and Fleur's behavior isn't helping matters any. But her dislike of Fleur is ultimately based on the fact she thought she would be bad for Bill. This cannot possibly be stressed enough: Molly /loves loves loves/ her family, and if she thinks you'd be good for family, she would welcome you with open arms. So when Fleur displays her love for Bill after the battle, she is struck speechless. Molly had expected Fleur's love to broken at the first signs of physical disfigurement, for attraction to turn to repulsion. But if anything, Fleur's love for Bill burns brighter after the attack, which makes Molly sees her mistake. She embraces Fleur, accepts their marriage, accepts her into the family - because Molly loves Bill and Fleur loves Bill, and to Molly that's all that matters.

Sirius, I think, has to be my favorite. Her protective side, which would try to shield Harry from the harsh reality of war as much as possible, clashes with Sirius's far more liberal outlook. And, of course, my favorite Molly quote:

#+begin_quote
  "Yes," said Mrs Weasley, her lip curling, "the thing is, it's been rather difficult for you to look after him while you've been locked up in Azkaban, hasn't it?"
#+end_quote

Oh my God. There are burns, and there are /burns/. But this is on a whole different level: this is fiendfyre level of heat right here. The execution: the curl of her lip, the sheer disdain dripping from her words; Voldemort himself would kill to show that level of authentic disdain. The best part is, she's 100% right: Sirius hasn't been around to look after Harry. Molly has. Sirius still looks at Harry as his father reincarnated, he doesn't know Harry well at all. Molly does. Sirius may have been appointed as Godfather, but Molly has taken him in, fed him and taken care of him. Molly has done far more for Harry than Sirius ever has, even though she bears no responsibility for him, asks him for nothing in return.

One word I repeatedly used to describe Molly is /authentic/. I personally think that Ron and Molly are two most authentic characters in the series: they strike a little too real to life, which is partially the reason they're disliked by large segments of the fandom. Everything about Molly strikes me as real: her all - encompassing love for family, her love for Harry, her disdain for Sirius and Fleur, her sometimes overbearing protectiveness - which partially comes from losing her brothers in the first war, her willingness to kill to protect her family. I haven't nearly touched upon everything about Molly: her relationship with each of her children (bar Charlie, perhaps) is worth exploring in detail. And Arthur, and Harry too.

TL;DR: Molly is a complex, highly flawed character, easily one of the best characters in the books. She is awesome, and I love everything about her.

*** Hey no arguments as to her being a great character and ultimately good character. I personally don't subscribe to the idea that she is a bad person or character. That's why I said Molly-bashing for me is a guilty pleasure, since such characterizations of her go against her canon character. But I definitely think I like it because her worst traits can be quite infuriating and realistic for many children of overbearing parents. It's a bit similar to why so many people hate Umbridge more than Voldemort. Because Umbridge reminds them of people that actually exist.

I am not writing about Hermione, so I've no idea where this JKR self-insert stuff is coming from. And if any part of what I wrote paints Molly as a saint, then you have reading comprehension issues.

#+begin_quote
  Disliking British cuisine and a particular singing style are very thin reasons to argue with someone.
#+end_quote

It represents the cultural divide (in the first case) and generational divide (in the second one) between Molly and Fleur very well, which yes, is a rather important issue. And if said daughter-in-law chooses to loudly and openly state said issues, in the most obnoxious manner possible, then it becomes even more of an issue.

#+begin_quote
  Fleur, who seemed to find Celestina very dull, was talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling Mrs. Weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control, so that Celestina grew louder and louder.

  [..]

  Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined in with enthusiastically.

  “Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, what an ‘orrible ---”

  [..]

  Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone, once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley's expression, to be the cue to go to bed.
#+end_quote

Not quite so harmless, then, I'm sure you'd agree.

The 'lazy' bit comes from Fleur's apparent disdain for housework. She hates the Burrow because supposedly the only things to do there are cook and take care of the chickens, both of which Fleur hates doing, at least at the Burrow. I thought it rather evident, that in relation to Molly, the laziness there would refer to housework.

I was actually quite generous to Fleur in the OP. If I needed to make her look worse, I would have just quoted more canon material. Fleur is determined to be as obnoxious as she can possibly be, and Molly would have been well within her rights to turn her out of her home. It was only in judging Fleur's love for Bill to be shallow that Molly erred, and here she did indeed make a mistake (lest I be accused of whitewashing her), and this was something I made very clear in the OP.

Let's keep it classy, okay? If you want to be nasty, please go somewhere else. Here's why I thought (and still do think) that you're attempting to canonise Molly.

You painted Molly's good qualities with the broadest brush possible:

#+begin_quote
  She has great dynamics with so many characters

  she takes him in and accepts him as one of her own

  She is the heart of the Weasley family

  perfectly balanced [relationship with Arthur]

  Molly loves loves loves her family

  most authentic character

  all - encompassing love for family

  one of the best characters in the books. She is awesome
#+end_quote

You also took great pains to excuse her faults:

#+begin_quote
  overbearing protectiveness comes from losing her brothers in the first war

  try to shield Harry from the harsh reality of war as much as possible
#+end_quote

This is the worst bit to me:

#+begin_quote
  She embraces Fleur, accepts their marriage, accepts her into the family - because Molly loves Bill and Fleur loves Bill, and to Molly that's all that matters.
#+end_quote

Her inability to accept his choice is a major blind-spot that you've glossed over. It didn't /matter/ to her that Bill loved Fleur. Throughout the series, we had absolutely no cause to doubt his judgement. He was Prefect and Head Boy, which indicates that McGonagall and Dumbledore held him in high regard. His career as a Curse-Breaker seems to be prestigious and I can't imagine that the goblins would permit someone with a history of making bad calls to remain in their employ. If Bill's educators, Headmaster, and employers are so keen to accept his judgement, why can't his mother do the same?

Because Fleur insults her [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Celestina_Warbeck][favourite singer]]?

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Banshees are frequently associated with beautiful voices, right? Is it at all possible that the music is maybe unpleasant to listen to? I agree that Fleur could have been nicer about it, but that doesn't give Molly cause to attempt to torpedo Tonks' growing relationship with Remus by pairing the metamorphagus with Bill.

#+begin_quote

He was in Azkaban! You're expecting him to instantly forget about spending a decade in an environment designed to depress the occupants, immediately dissociate Harry from James (when memories of James are among the happiest Sirius has left), and become a perfect father figure when Molly has decades of experience raising a happy, well-adjusted family (something Sirius never had). That's a /completely/ unfair comparison.

#+begin_quote
  Fleur is determined to be as obnoxious as she can possibly be
#+end_quote

I don't see this at all at this point in the story, but you're entitled to your opinion. Fleur was pretty awful to Harry in the beginning of Goblet of Fire, but he forgave her readily enough. If Molly Weasley is so great, why can't she look past Fleur's obvious faults as well and accept that she makes Bill happy?

Er.. are you insinuating that Molly wanted Harry to sit out of the war for shits and giggles, and not because she wanted to shield Harry from the dangers of war? That is so self-evident that I needn't take any pain to 'excuse' it. And her brothers' death was an attempt to contextualise it, not excuse it. People never act the way they do for no reason at all - even Draco Malfoy's racist beliefs have context. It would hardly be a character analysis if I left it out.

#+end_quote

I'm not sure where you're getting that quote from, but this isn't a valid argument anyway. Claiming objective good or bad in music is silly. Clearly there are enough people who like Celestina that she appears on radio.

#+begin_quote

Molly does no such thing. Ginny was wrong about this. Molly had supported Remus's relationship with Tonks from the start. She probably invited Tonks over because she knew how bad things were for her.

#+begin_quote
  “And I've told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor... too dangerous...”

  “I've said all along you're taking a ridiculous line on this, Remus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur's shoulder as she patted her on the back.
#+end_quote

For Sirius:

#+begin_quote
  That's a completely unfair comparison.
#+end_quote

Sure. Doesn't make it any less true. Molly has greater parental rights over Harry than Sirius, for all the reasons listed in the OP.

#+begin_quote
  Her inability to accept his choice is a major blind-spot that you've glossed over.
#+end_quote

Hmm, you might have a point there. I did say that she was unable to accept their marriage, which does kinda imply her inability to accept both of their choices. But if I did gloss over it beyond that, it is because the books gloss over it as well. Never once in the books is Bill's choice considered to be of importance. It is not part of Molly's character arc and not part of the story, and I would be overstepping my bounds to include a theme that is not present in the books. We don't really have the slightest inkling about how Bill feels about the family drama. He is a prop in the Molly/Fleur feud, nothing more.

I also think that blind faith in Bill's judgement wouldn't been any better on Molly's part, especially after the whole situation with Percy (also head boy, btw) that came around from the latter's poor judgement.

#+begin_quote
  If Molly Weasley is so great, why can't she look past Fleur's obvious faults as well and accept that she makes Bill happy?
#+end_quote

I have written on this in length in the OP. For various reasons, Molly does not think their love is true. She thinks their love is entirely based on physical attraction and other superficial causes -- which is why she expected Fleur to leave Bill after the werewolf attack. And yes, superficial love can also make people happy in the short run, yet make them miserable later. Molly herself states that her problem with their marriage was that they were rushing into it. Once she sees that Fleur truly loves Bill, that she can keep him happy in the long run, she indeed looks past her flaws and welcomes her into the family immediately.

#+begin_quote
  Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur mopping up Bill's wounds with a most curious expression upon her face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like everybody else, he was waiting for the explosion.

  “Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a long pause, “has a very beautiful tiara --- goblin-made --- which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.”

  “Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be lovely.”

  And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks.

Pure conjecture. It's easy for Molly to say she 'always' supported Remus/Tonks, but I didn't see any evidence that she did beforehand and the way she reacted to Bill/Fleur doesn't make me want to give her the benefit of the doubt.

#+begin_quote
  Molly has greater parental rights
#+end_quote

No she doesn't. Legally, Sirius is his godfather. Molly is only his best mate's mum. I don't see that she would have any moral claim to Harry's well-being either if Sirius had survived OOtP and continued to heal from Azkaban.

It's not blind. I gave reasons for saying that Bill probably has a good head on his shoulders. I'll also freely admit that this is just my best guess.

#+begin_quote
  Molly herself states that her problem with their marriage was that they were rushing into it.
#+end_quote

Yes, and she offers no rebuttal when called out on the similarity of the pace of Bill/Fleur's relationship to her own courtship with Arthur. It's blatantly hypocritical and another unattractive character trait that you didn't mention in your hagiography.

#+begin_quote
  Once she sees that Fleur truly loves Bill
#+end_quote

She had all summer to arrive at that conclusion, but didn't care to get to know her future daughter-in-law. Sure, Fleur didn't make it easy. Fleur's choice to be nasty doesn't give Molly carte blanche to act the same way.

#+begin_quote

Do you think Molly would have ever accepted Fleur without Bill's mauling? I don't know for sure, but it doesn't seem likely.

******** Oh please. My Immortal is literary diarrhea. Robst is articulate, grammatically polished, and generally completes the stories he starts.

Is his work quality fiction? Hell no. It's empty calories in a pretty package. What does that describe...gee, awfully similar to junk food.

** I like a little Molly-bashing every so often because she is overbearing.

I don't know if I can call it a guilty pleasure list when I don't feel guilty for liking, reading, or writing the things I like. But a few of them are Hermione with an older man, polyandry or 'reverse harem', and dubious consent.
