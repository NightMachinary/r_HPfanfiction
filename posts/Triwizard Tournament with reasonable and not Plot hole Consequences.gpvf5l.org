"Oh, I know Voldemort is coming back. Oh look the Triwizard Tournament. Let's enter Tom Riddle in it using a piece of School work and the binding magical contract will make him a squib" is about the plothole of the "if you don't compete you lose your magic" fics.

Are there fics where the consequences are just political, or to do with your enrollment at the 3 Schools listed, and not "MAGIC SQUIB DEATH CONTRACT WHERE ANYONE CAN ENTER ANYONE JUST BY USING THEIR SCHOOLWORK AND A CONFUNDUS CHARM!" that fanfics use. We don't actually know the consequences in canon, but it'd clearly not be unbreakable vow level, based on how serious they are, and "Oh, someone is in a coma. Looks like they're a squib now, lol, silly tournament" could happen.


** IIRC, in canon, it was a magical contract.

A Barty Jr. was apparently very skilled or received instruction from Voldemort of how to Confundus the Goblet so it would accept Harry.

** We just had a longish discussion about the nature of magical contracts on one of the earlier threads. My take is that magical contracts like the Goblet and the Parchment tend to play fast and loose with intent to be bound, as long as all the formalities are respected.

In the case of the Goblet, my current headcanon is that BCJ was able to enter Harry because he was Harry's teacher and therefore had some [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_loco_parentis][in loco parentis]] authority. Since Voldemort is no longer a student, nobody can do that to him.

A completely different, but very elegant, headcanon, found in linkffn(Forging the Sword by Myst Shadow) was that the contract bound not the champions but their schools and governments: they were obligated to force the champion to participate by any means necessary. There was nothing stopping a recalcitrant champion from fleeing their jurisdictions---but that covers much of Europe, and how many would be willing to do that?

** I feel like a lot of people miss a fairly obvious explanation for the “its a binding magical contract” line.

Barty Crouch Sr *lied*.

At that point, his son had him under the imperious curse, and everyone there knew of Sr's strict adherence to rules and laws, and took him at his word. So it's plausible that Harry was under no contractual obligation at all.

On the other hand, it could be that the judges/organizers were the ones considered “under contract” and they would be compelled to ensure that Harry competed.

Or it could just be a magical ass goblet who don't need no logic.
