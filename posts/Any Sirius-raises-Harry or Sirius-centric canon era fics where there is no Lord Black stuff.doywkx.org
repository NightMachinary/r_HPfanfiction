I'm looking for fics that have a lot of Sirius in them, either raising Harry or being an important influence on him after he escapes Azkaban. However, I tend to dislike fanon "Noble and Ancient Houses" stuff. I prefer fics where "The Ancient and Noble House of Black" was just a pompous affectation Walburga Black and her inbred relatives put on, instead of an actual political/economic reality of Wizarding Britain. Slytherins prancing around with Regency-era manners, weirdly blank facial expressions and holding champagne flutes is also a pet peeve, but I can tolerate that in small doses.

I've read The Dogfather by Hollimichele and I'd like more in that vein if anyone knows of any fics that fit requirements. Thank you! linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/]])


** Yes please HAMMY I agree can we not get a fic with just Harry and Sirius living like normal people in a normal house?! :( Why is it always huge manors and getting rings and social bullcrap!!! :( :( Why can't they just be an ordinary loving family? That was all Harry wanted!

  In an alternate universe where Sirius Black never went to Azkaban, Harry divides his life between the Dursleys' house and Mr. Black's bookshop -- until Sirius realises what the Dursleys are doing to him, and takes him away from their care.

*** This is nice thank you, but just like with Hail Odysseus, it starts after all the raising has been done. Harry appears at the start of the story essentially an OC, a large chunk of canon divergence already happened as exposition. If someone took the concept and actually covered the years where the raising is done I'd be so happy.

Seriously, pretty well written. I personally found the pre-Hogwarts section of the series a bit long, but I loved the first three years of Hogwarts, and the fourth year is being actively updated. Highly recommend.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.
