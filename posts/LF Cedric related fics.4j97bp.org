I like Cedric. He deserves more love, so hopefully I'll find some via this request. Don't particular care what the story is about, nor do I care who he's paired with, as long as he plays a big part.


** linkffn(10758358) has Cho and Cedric as Harry's best friends. It hasn't been updated since August last year but I'm really enjoying it.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.

** linkffn(4654242) - has a couple of sequels, though unfortunately they appear to be abandoned. Can be read as a stand-alone story though, and is quite decent.

** It may not be what you're looking for, but one of the only ones I've read personally is linkffn(twist of fate by oakstone730) . I remember Cedric being a really important character in it, but I honestly don't remember if it's canon compliant re: GoF, and it's pretty much Harry-centric.
