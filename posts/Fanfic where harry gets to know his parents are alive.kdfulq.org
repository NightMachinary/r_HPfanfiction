I remember reading this fanfic where harry and angelina ( I think? ) get killed while playing quidditch and then they both end up in some place where harry's parents are alive and harry has two siblings ( brother and sister) and harry becomes the duelling champion after defeating the previous duelling master and angelina is master in languages or something like that and then harry and angelina along with a few others are sent to protect hogwarts and then harry kills voldemort
