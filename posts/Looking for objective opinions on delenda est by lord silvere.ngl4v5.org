Came across this fic while looking for something else. Can anyone who has read it give me honest opinions on how well it is written, etc?

The pairing appears to be harry/Bellatrix, which I'm open to /if/ it is done well and it doesn't mean harry is the next dark lord


** The first half is one of the better fics in the fandom. The second half is... acceptable and readable. If you read it you'll know what I mean by second half, it's not defined in the fic, but there's almost a clear first/second half divide. I'd recommend giving it a shot, I don't think many people regret reading it.

I'm pretty sure it was co-written by someone else, and I'm not actually sure on this, but I think they are responsible for the second half and the absolutely horrible abandoned sequel. If I'm wrong about that I'm sure someone will correct me.

With all that said, it's in my top 5 favourite fics, and I've been reading Harry Potter fanfiction for over 20 years now. So in my opinion it's definitely worth the read.

*** Can you give me an over view of the storyline? Is it dark lord potter or gray potter or goodie boy potter? And how is the Bellatrix ship done if harry isn't dark lord potter?

**** Plot without spoilers but it's not great because that's hard:

Harry and Bella end up on the same side and join together to take down Voldemort before he becomes a problem.

Harry is kind of chaotic good/neutral, and because of the plot Bella isn't evil.

With spoilers:

Harry and Bella end up in the same dungeon cell after she betrays Voldemort and Harry is captured. She kills herself sending Harry back in time where he meets young Bella at Hogwarts and she falls for him. He reluctantly agrees to let her help him take down Voldemort before he becomes a big bad dark lord. Bella is never evil in this fic and is more Grey. Harry isn't a goodie goodie, but he isn't dark either.

** The quality hugely fluctuates. Sometimes, it reads as if one chapter is written by a very competent author, and the next totally tanks and can't possibly have been written by the same person.

Also, it squanders a lot of potential, e.g. in plot decisions; it could have been much better than it was. This alone probably makes it one of the better stories out there: Most stories /can't/ be better than they are, they are /just/ bad, not bad-compared-to-the-potential. (Personally, stories with wasted potential make me more mad, though. I just can't keep help wishing it would've been better.)

*** I totally agree with this assessment. It has such great potential and it falls a little flat of what you want it to be or it could have been. It's still good, better than most, but it has the makings of a masterpiece it just doesn't quite get there.

** I really like it a lot. There are others I like a fraction more, but this is a quality fic in my book and the pairing it totally believable and not dark lord related

** I really enjoyed it, as the comments here says it might be a slight drag at later points but it's quite a banger, and I usually heavily dislike lordships and noble houses.

** It's... not the worst I've ever read. The grammar is consistent, changes in characters are given adequate cause, and some non-canon elements are well introduced and explained away (I don't know how to block out spoilers, so I'll be as vague as possible and mention a shop that goes out of business by the time it because a problem), thus avoiding unnecessary plotholes.
