Hello. I'm searching for any HP fanfiction where Neville is bashed/hated/criticized/not friends (HP may even dislike/hate him) .... just please makes sure the grammar is good (not perfect or something, just good, don/t want to read something that a 2nd grade pupil might have written)...also, please not too many cliches...


** What did poor Neville ever do to you???

** I get that, I love Neville, but fandom never allows him to have any flaws except for maybe being meek (which he eventually overcomes).

Democracy linkao3(16064114) is really good. Neville goes down a very questionable political path after the war, but you can see the logic of his decisions from his point of view.

If you are serious about searching for ANY HP fics where Neville is criticized, I have a fic about Harry investigating a student's disappearance in Hogwarts undercover as a Divination Professor, which has a scene where Hannah Abbot, Neville's wife, basically tears her husband a new one for a couple of well-deserved reasons, and Harry himself is not very fond of Neville after a bad break-up. But the main pairing is much hated in this sub Harry/Snape, so take it or leave it, I guess linkao3(17157173)

  Alternate Universe. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** What in the world would even cause such a fic? What would the plot be? "Neville the Nobody is bashed and hated on for no reason"?

Or you could go with any of the fics where he's the Boy Who Lived (which usually have him bashed), but then you'd be swimming in cliches, which you don't want.

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5)

It's from Neville's point of view how he ends up opposing the heroic trio. His decisions are understandable from his perspective but he's definitely one of the baddies from any other perspective.

** I just ALWAYS see him in every fanfiction being friends or even ally with HP and I'm frankly tired of that....the reason I .... dislike him so to speak is 'cause he's a coward until 5th year when he "magically" transforms into a brave no-faults guy ... I also dislike Granger for that matter...I simply do not like condescending people and she's exactly that....

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...
