Inspired by [[/u/kidicarusJr][u/kidicarusJr]] 's post from earlier. What's the deal with this pairing? She's not really a meaningful character in canon, we don't even ever properly meet her. What's the reason this ship seems to be one of the most popular random-pairings?

** I haven't read a lot of Harry/Daphne (I guess I read one fic of the pairing, given that I am not keen on romance focused stories).

I almost included her in my fic for a few reasons, which I think are the same why people do include her in theirs:

- She's a blank canvas that can be made into anything, and has the bonus of being Slytherin and pureblood (drama potential), and never openly opposed Harry/doesn't come from a family of Voldemort supporters (that we know of);

- Not technically an OC, which works better to not alienate people who are put off by OCs;

- Is in the same year that Harry, which gives opportunity for interaction.

I guess that other reasons people write Harry/Daphne is because... she's blonde, I guess. And fanon has stereotyped her into 'Ice Queen of Slytherin' or something like that, and that blew out of proportion at some point in time.

This is my impression. There is also kind of a fanon consensus that she's kind of smart, with a dark personality, and kind of punk rock? There are exceptions but this is common enough that I'm surprised if she's not like this.

People want Harry to be with "a Slytherin", and Pansy and Millicent have already excluded themselves by being described as unattractive, and Tracey Davis has a name that's too ordinary, I guess?

*** The other facet is she's considered aristocratic, whereas Tracy Davis is a halfblood, and therefore obviously only minor aristocracy at best, since most of them are Purebloods. And only Lily Evans is allowed to marry above her “station.” Most Indy!Harry stories have some element of Harry being some sort of solo-Illuminati mega-rich VERY IMPORTANT PERSON, and such a personage can't be with a /peasant/. Imagine if they started get ideas above their station!

Plus, as a blank slate not explicitly friends with Malfoy and his ilk, like Parkinson or Bulstrode (conjecture from Chamber of Secrets & Inquisatorial Squad member), and not even a member of the inquisitorial squad that we know of, she's therefore “neutral” and the perfect person to help Harry create his own super-awesome-faction-of-edginess(TM).

Personally I can't stand the pairing nor the character itself, like, 90% of the time is just bullshit politics played by 11 year olds or harem fics that feel the need to add a slytherin into the mix ''to teach Harry how to be cunning'', cunning being just giving long ass speeches and dumbing down everyone else while making them scared of a CHILD playing politics.

** too lazy to check if any other comments said the same thing, but personally I think it's because the author wants to see what could happen if Harry pairs with a Slytherin. Given that we don't really see much development of any likable Slytherin characters (or any Slytherins, really), she's an easy "blank slate" for the author to use. Also, I think it's done for a similar reason that Sirius was/is so often paired with Marlene McKinnon (when not paired with Remus); it's easier to accept a little-known (but still canon) character than an OC.

** Basically what everyone else said, but I like when authors attempt a “not all slytherins are evil” type fic and pairing Harry with a slytherin is an easy way to do that. I think the gryffindor/slytherin pairing makes for an interesting dynamic, and because Daphne is a blank slate that means she can be whatever the author needs. Although at this point she usually ends up as the “ice queen” pure blood that teaches Harry about pure blood culture.

** I was attracted to write for the pairing because she is 1.a blank slate canon wise and 2. she is a Slytherin to boot, making it more compelling.

I personally have no interest in Draco/Hermione because Draco in canon is such a garbage human being...specifically to the trio. These types of stories can be written well but either characters need to go wildly OOC or the author needs to come up with a really great narrative explanation (Delenda Est with Belatrix/Harry for example) to make me buy it and believe it.

The fact that Harry never really mentions or makes note of her in canon speaks to how discreet and quietly she behaves. So you can have the interesting dynamic of Harry in a relationship with a Slytherin without all of the emotional baggage and awfulness associated with 'known' Slytherin peers of Harry.

** There are two possible options:

1. For all lovers of Lord Potter and stuff like that (which I am certainly NOT), she is an ideal replacement for Ginny or Hermione, when they need to drawl on Lordship, wealth, high etiquette, and otherwise feel smug.
2. She could have the same advantage of any other non-central person in the HP universe. By having no history of her own, she allows to write original character with her own story. Although it is not strictly Haphne (technically, Harry ends up with Ginny, most likely, the sequel is unfinished), I really like linkffn(3912184), because it adds its own strong character with her own story, which adds something.

** Harry/Daphne is my 2nd favorite pairing for HP fanfics (after Harry/Hermione).

From my perspective, I like the character for many of the reasons others here have already stated.

1. Pro inter house unity (to an extent) in stories because she's a Slytherin (and presumably a wealthy pureblood since her little sister in canon married Draco).

2. She's a blank slate. She's barely mentioned in the books aside from name and house, meaning authors have a lot to work with. The most common trope is the “Ice Princess of Slytherin”, but I've seen many other versions of the character aside from that. As some have said, this means she isn't a OC character (and I don't read OC docs aside from the occasional FemHarry ones). Further, because she's never mentioned as being someone who teases or pesters or antagonizes Harry, it allows authors to separate her from Draco and Pansy (often as the trope “grey faction” children)... supported in fandom by the fact no Greengrass is ever named as a death eater in canon.

3. Potential inter house conflicts (given that most of the House has death eater parents).

4. Potential political involvement of stories (due to her pureblood nature).

5. It allows for an inter-house relationship that isn't Dramione. Like another poster, I hate Draco. So seeing him paired as the main pair with my favorite character (Hermione) is awful to me.

6. “Ice Princess” - there is a reason in Japanese anime the Tsundere character is often the most popular. Daphne's trope is a tsundere (a character who is cold at first, but warms up over time to become loving to the lead).

In Canon, the only Slytherin girls in Harry year we learn about are Pansy Parkinson who is just nasty and like Draco or Millicent Bulstrode who is big and ugly. Both Daphne Greengrass and Tracey Davis are blank canvas you can use to make them whatever you want before they fall in love with our MC Harry, but with her pureblood statut and member of the Sacred 28, Daphne is a bit more interesting than Half blood Tracey, hence why she is THE character to use when you want a Slytherin romance.
