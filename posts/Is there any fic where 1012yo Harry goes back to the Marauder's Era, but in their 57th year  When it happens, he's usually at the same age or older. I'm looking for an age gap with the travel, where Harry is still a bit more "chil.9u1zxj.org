#+TITLE: Is there any fic where 10~12yo Harry goes back to the Marauder's Era, but in their 5~7th year ? When it happens, he's usually at the same age or older. I'm looking for an age gap with the travel, where Harry is still a bit more "child-like".

** I read one when 5 years old Harry go back in time. James and co were in their 6-7 year but I can't remember the title. But it was only 5 chapter or so and was unfinished.

I really would like to read something like what you looking for :)

  A lonely four year old Harry Potter falls into the Marauders life and they can't help but fall in love with the baby Prongs, how will they react to his relation to James, and his abusive home life? He must go home, and 12 years later, a lonely Harry Potter falls into a war he ended- to a time when his parents are alive. Time Travel fix it, Young!Harry, master of death!Harry.

** Copperbadge has a story similar to that, where 17 year old Sirius comes through the veil or something and then it's Harry/Sirius. Can't remember the title but I'm sure you can find it.

#+begin_quote
  In the summer after Harry's sixth year, Harry and Remus uncover a section of the Marauder's Map which has been hidden for the past twenty years, releasing a carbon copy of sixteen-year-old Sirius Black from its depths. As they prepare for the impending war, Sirius must find a place for himself in this new world, Harry must find a way to destroy Voldemort, and Remus must face his own past while trying to build a tenuous future with Tonks.
