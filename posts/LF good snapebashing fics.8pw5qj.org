Lately i seem to have run into a lot of redeemable!snape and fics where he is evil like cannon. But no resolution to his bullying, so now im in the mood for some hood old snapebash! Get him fired, throw him in prison, kill his deatheater ass, any fic where Snape gets whats coming to him for bullying 11 year olds and beeing a death eater is wanted :D


** Heres a classic: Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past)

Snape is a real piece of garbage in this one. Dumbledore finally wises up at one point, and it feels rather cathartic.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

** /The Grass is Always Greener/ is one that's often recommended for this. Other characters are bashed as well, though.

  During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG

**** Ron and Molly more than anyone. kb0 has a soft spot for Ginny. Frankly though, what happens to Snape kind of makes Harry look terrible.
