Please help. This is making me really depressed and I don't know what to do.

Edit: Thank you for the responses. For some reason this post was deleted by the mods, but maybe it was due to some error. Thank you to them for restoring it.


** There's a 'Block Users' option in the Account tab - I haven't used it but that would seem to be its purpose. If it isn't a logged-in user, you could turn off anonymous reviews and Private Messaging.

** don't let them get you down. 99% of flamers are just stupid jerks who have never written a word in their life. What do they get out of flaming you? some kind of perverse satisfaction at demeaning your ideas or story? Lame. Just because I do or don't like your ships or plot devices, doesn't mean I have license to call you out. Write for you. Try to improve yourself and your writing, Get better at grammar and spelling, or whatever technical thing you need to do. But write what you would want to read, make it good, and if you get flamed or called names, ignore it. There are plenty of us readers who will give you advice and encouragement.

** How are there six comments here, but I can't see any?

Anyways, I don't know if there is any way to deal with it in FFN, so really there is probably nothing to do other than some combo of:

- Ignore it

- Drink heavily (do not recommend)

- Feast in defiance of their anger

*** Could be a couple shadowbanned accounts. It happens sometimes without any reason. It happened to me once because a subreddit's automod thing thought I was a spammer because I posted a link. Very odd but I got it fixed asap.

That's not the way to resolve a conflict. For example: what if the user is lashing out against OP because they're going through troubled times themselvesâ€‹? Antagonizing others often tends to make the problem worse.

** If a signed review, you can always reply with something like, "Are you autistic? You are presenting yourself as such." And then ignore them. (If they're persistent flamers, there's a good chance that they are and questioning them on this can be effective in getting them to at least look at what they're doing.)

"Block user" is another option; I tend to use it infrequently, however, since flames amuse me (and my penning scathing replies to same, even more.)

You can block anonymous reviews entirely. I tend not to because, again, flames and amusement.

If the review is particularly abusive, you can report the review to the site mods (there's a button next to the review to do that), though I doubt you'll see a particularly snappy response. They tend to be too busy dealing with incipient plagiarism accounts, which happen several times a day.

Yeah, don't do that. Ever. Not only will it make you sound like an idiot, you'll be engaging the person who's trying to goad you into an argument.

There we go. Do that one. If OP's that upset by the flames, they don't have to deal with them. Why bother? There's no need to respond. Just block them. Enjoy doing what you're doing.

That. Is stupidly offensive to a large minority. If you said that on the street, and not in a place where people have time - though rarely use it - to think about what they say, you would be stupified faster than you could blink. Please, look up autism. Look up brain damage. They don't have control, they aren't /normal/ in a manner you would consider. Unless you know someone with that condition or are suffering through it yourself, it is not something you should throw around lightly. I don't know how else to say that and I'm not in the mood to make this seem brash and eloquent. Just, please, think about what you post before you post it. We have all been there, and it has ruined more people than you can count without the aide of magic.

**** And "stupidly offensive" is itself offensive to mentally challenged people, themselves a large minority. "They don't have control; they aren't /normal/ in a manner you would consider..."

How insensitive you must be to bash vulnerable people in an attempt to scold.

***** I'm bad at putting words to paper in most situations and, I wasn't trying to scold you. Rather, put down my thoughts. I'm currently enrolled in a psychology class and am coming to terms with the fact that the brain controls a large part of our personality. I know that sounds daft, but it's hard to understand that I'm not me because I'm me, but that my genetics and the things I've witnessed in my life dictate that.

I know your not here to listen to my ramblings and are probably just trying to justify your own actions by lashing out at my poorly worded attempts to show what I think of your words, but I didn't mean any harm. I'm not trying to be offensive and will once again enforce reading things over more than once before posting them. I don't like offending people who don't possess control, and don't condemn that because any medical study will say virtually the same thing.

I can try not to be blunt, but in regards to people with conditions such as autism they are not normal. Their brains do not act in the manner which a majority of the planets does. That's not to say they are wrong, or that they should be held up as a paradigm of miss behavior, it's just to say that it's more difficult for them to act and react in certain situations. I can't justify it, I'm not a doctor, but you can do the research. The internet is a wonderful and dangerous tool.

****** I've friends with kids on the autistic spectrum and I have spent time around autistic children and adults (I work with one of the latter). It's a medical fact borne out in my own observations that one of the patterns of behavior that someone on the autism spectrum commonly may present is a dogged repetition of phrases, words, or actions with little or no awareness of how such are received.

Repeated flamers can exhibit a similar pattern. My suggested reply was not intended to slam autistic people, but rather to mention that the behavior evokes certain assumptions that one might make. One could, of course, take the coarser (and less healthy) tack of simply telling the flamer to fuck off and wishing him or her a slow, lonely death.

******* You are correct in most cases. Still, I'm of the belief that you shouldn't hold someone that typically cannot control their action to the same pedigree as an obnoxious individual that enjoys throwing vicious words at other people's work.
