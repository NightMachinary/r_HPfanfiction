As the title says, what are some fics that you've read where you think "Jesus Christ this is awful" but you keep reading anyway? My Immortal is disqualified for obvious reasons.

Mine was the Girl Who Loved: linkffn(5353683) Dumbledore reveals a plan to turn Harry into a girl and have him marry Snape, Harry apperates to China and ends up in Jusenkyo and falls into the Spring of one Drowned Sailor Moon. The story has alot of bashing and while i was reading it i kept telling myself to stop reading but I couldn't, the story itself hooked me in and i did eventually finish it... so what about you guys?


** linkffn (Savior of Magic). Magic is might and muggle bashing.

** Pretty much every single independant!Harry fic I've read. Like I hate them, but I still end up reading them till the end if they're decently written.

One exception being Harry Crow. I tried forcing myself to finish it, but like 1/6th of the chapters in I just stopped, closed all my FFN tabs and moved on to different fandoms for a bit. My Immortal ain't got shit on Harry Crow, at least it has substance.

** self inserts in general, like, the moment the MC gets perfect memory from just meditating you know it's gonna be a power wank but I still want to know how it goes.

Unless it's a harem fic, I won't even look at those.
