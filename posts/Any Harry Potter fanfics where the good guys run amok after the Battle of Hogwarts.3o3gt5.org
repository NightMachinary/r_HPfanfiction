*** I was thinking more along the lines of getting revenge on their prisoners and such. I was just reading Ginny Duty where it happens and wonder if there were any other fics it happens in.

** It's actually to be expected, given what they had suffered and the scope of their victory. Most people are NOT as forgiving as Harry Potter, and Harry went to a long slumber after the victory so they had all the time in the world to exact their retributions.

I think the DA kids and many other Hogwarts students would thoroughly "work" on the Carrows after the battle. War-hardened teenagers would definitely be a cruel bunch after seeing their comrades murdered and themselves being tortured. Testimonials and biographies from real-life war veterans can all attest to that. The one paragraph in E.B Sledge's 'With The Old Breed' about how a young American Marine "worked" on a wounded Japanese soldier after the Battle of Tarawa was really stomach turning.

In fact, there was foreshadowing in HBP, when Dumbledore had a brief exchange with the Carrows about their fates on top of the Astronomy Tower. Also, J.K Rowling announced a book named 'Dumbledore's Army: The Dark Side of Demob' that was supposed to show some light on their nefarious deeds.

There was also the monetary incentives in going after the old pure-blood oligarchy. Battle of the Hogwarts offered one golden opportunity to solve the financial problems of many families once and for all, especially the Weasleys. Just as love is a powerful emotion, so do greed and vengeance.

*** Just to clarify - the Dark Side of Demob is a fictional Rita Skeeter title referenced in Rowling's where-are-they-now short piece released in July 2014; there are no indications, so far as I'm aware, that it's a real book she's working on. Also random trivia demob is short for demobilization in British English, it's not just a pun implying the DA was a mob.

**** I know the book has no content so far, but JK Rowling is a master of foreshadowing, so I think we will eventually see something in there.

***** It would be fun. I'd love to see more about the post-war than the "oh everything was fine even though it doesn't look like anyone has reformed Hogwarts' questionable House divisions or curriculum in 15 years" we got in the epilogue.

*** On the monetary incentives point:

One thing I've noticed is very common in a lot of post-war fics I've read is that any time the Malfoys are brought up, it's almost always stated that they sort of /paid out the ass/ as punishment/reparation for their allegiances since none of them go to Azkaban. Whether or not the sums they had to pay cripples them financially or not varies by author, though.

** There is linkffn(10595005). The "running amok" is slightly delayed. Things stay status quo after the battle, long story short, there is a coup and the muggleborns take over leading to a constant conga line (sarcasm) of Death Eaters and purebloods being pushed through the Veil.

*** A long line of mass-murdering Death Eaters and their willing, eager helpers was executed. Purebloods who didn't think that helping with genocide and rape was a-ok as long as it was legal were not pushed through the veil.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

** Vera Rozalsky's Amends has Slytherin reprisals and an alcoholic, vengeful Ginny being played by Gryffindor auror death squads, as well as Hermione running a truth and reconciliation process. Probably my favorite fic. There's a Dramione (not sure by whom) where Hermione plays "Lady of the Lake" character with a Slytherin takeover cabal after breaking up with Ron and getting bounced from the Order as they indulged in the fruits of victory (Harry knocking up Astoria, Percy and Kingsley taking kickbacks, Ron sleeping around on his fame.) I'll find it.

edit: it's called "Lady of the Lake." convenient.
