There are countless good but unfinished fics out there, and I've accepted that most will never be updated and am ok with it. But there are a few that just were just so goof or left off at such a crucial part of the story that it seems like a crime they likely won't be finished.

I just started another read-through of Northumbrian's works and remembered that Aurors and Schoolgirls was unfinished just as the pace was about to pick up and we were going to see some resolution to plotlines. I think I liked this fic the most because I'm really interested in that year after the war just on a character-level and felt that his version was the best and realistic. I had messaged the author and he said he would return to it after finishing Strangers at Drakeshaugh. So there's hope it will be finished.

So which one or maybe two unfinished fics would you most like to see completed? If you can, please indicate why and if the story ended on a cliffhanger of sorts. I ask because there are a lot of great unfinished fics that probably don't need an ending since you know where it's going. Conversely, there are great fics that have a lot of build up to some major moment and then end before it happens.

  Harry Potter always knew he'd have to fight in a Wizarding War, but he'd always thought it would be after school, and not after winning the Triwizard Tournament. Worse still, he never thought he'd understand both sides of the conflict. AU with a Female Voldemort.

** So many but most of all, Linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19). Watching the relationship between Harry and Abby develop has been such a pleasant read but also very much a slow-burn. It is kind of painful that the story is incomplete right as things start to get romantic between the two of them. Not to mention, there are few great romance fics with OCs and in my opinion, this is in the top 5 of the genre. Hope they update but it's been almost a year so it might be abandoned at this point. I never know when to consider fics abandoned since some writers reappear after 1-2 years.

**** I check Inverarity's blog once in a while. He has good reviews of books and he does write updates about AQ there..

But AQ is supposed to be a long series (7 books I think). Inverarity doesn't do things half-ways; it seems to me he has the series very well planned out and I don't thing he would published work he is not satisfied with.

Many people have difficulties with finishing such long series. In my opinion there are two main problems -

1. As a story progresses, there are more and more storylines/characters/subplots and books are getting longer and longer.
2. RL - it takes years to write a series. Fanfic authors have nothing for writing. You may start when you have a free time, no worries, writing is fun for you.. But what happens after lets say five years? You may travel, you may get married, have kids, time consuming job and one million other things. You may want to finish what you started but even if you try, it is not possible anymore.. IMO longer the author is writing a fic, the less likely is it will be finished.

I don't think I'm pessimist, but if I would have to make a prediction, no fics mentioned by me will get ever finished. I think we can get AQ5, but I don't believe we will see ever AQ7. But I would love to be wrong :)

** The obvious answers are for me, The Santi's Boy who lived and the Fettuncini's Knowledge is power. While they both have tropey and questionable parts I love how different they are, how ambitious they are. These fics hold so much potential and in a way perhaps its better they remain unfinished so the author wouldn't have a chance to spoil it but still.

0800-Rent a hero is a fic I wouldn't mind seeing finished. The author might be an arse of the highest order and the story was for sure flawed but it was fun. A lot of great fics lack the fun element, this isn't an enlightening fic, its not one that gets you thinking but its quite good for being mildly amusing so long as you don't take it seriously.

The song of trees is an honourable mention for me. One of my favourites but I get the sense its close enough to being finished that I can piece together the end unlike the two others I'd mentioned which could go in many different ways.

** I have my fics stored into groups and my WIP, Hiatus, and Abandoned categories are all well stocked.

WIP wise I want to see the Prince of Slytherin finished the most. I am not usually a fan of wrong boy-who-lived stories but I absolutely love what The Sinister Man has built and added to the world of Harry Potter. He's still updating so it's just an impatience issue right now.

On Hiatus I would have to go with Nightmares of Future Past. It was one of the first fan fictions I read and it really pulled me into the community. I know it has its share of detractors but I love the story and really hope S'TarKan continues with his recovery.

When it comes to Abandoned fics I'd actually say Mysterious Thing, Time by Blueowl. It was a collab and Blueowl and his writing partner were having troubles collaborating. It hasn't been updated since 2012 so I'm not holding out for a conclusion., but then again the last chapter came out a year and a half before the second to last, five years is not that much more right? It has a very strange premise with Dumbledore and Harry traveling back in time to their bodies the night Voldemort attacked the Potters and had Dumbledore raise Harry, whose mind is a mix between the adult he was and the child he is. The thing I loved most about the story was the OC Unspeakables. They are my favorite original characters in fan fiction and I would love to know more about their stories. It does end on a cliff hanger.

It's part 3 of Miranda Flairgold's AU. It's one of the best AUs of the early fics. I'd like nothing more than to get closure on it, but it's not going to ever happen. The running theory is that Miranda has passed away. I've read a lot of incomplete fics, but this is the trilogy I keep going back to and re-reading without looking, just hoping that if I keep doing that it will update magically while I'm reading it.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5200789][The Life and Times]] by Jewel5. 600,000+ words, and then it just stops so abruptly with SO MANY plot lines left to resolve. Basically a quintessential Jily fic that was well written and developed. It didn't seem contrived at all felt realistic.

I mean, it's not like we don't all know how it ends. It sticks to canon pretty well considering it was first published in 2009 before we got Pottermore. Yes. James and Lily get together and have Harry and die in ‘81. But it 600,000 words to get where they are kinda together and I need to see what happens to Remus and Sirius and all the OCs.

It's the curse of reading a long fic- you get attached. And when updates stop randomly, you never know if the author just stopped updating, or died. Not bitter at all.

**** Yes, it is! I think it's the best Slytherin Harry fic in the fandom. Even though Harry is in Slytherin, he doesn't immediately become a political-savvy, scheming 11 year old. He's quite recognizable as Harry, if more cynical, snarky and willing to use amoral methods. This fic has my favourite characterization of him. Some things don't change, like he's still enemies with Draco Malfoy. Side characters like Blaise Zabini and Millicent Bulstrode get the spotlight and they work well as his friends. It might seem a bit slow in the beginning but it picks up the pace in 2nd year and moves fairly quickly from then. I highly recommend it.

*** That is updating, not regularly but somewhat. And honestly, that fic doesn't have an ending, much like life. So once it resolves this current plotline I'm fine if just stops updating, as good as it is.

Speaking of little0bird, the story she really needs to finish is More than Words. It was a great insight into Ginny's struggle being in a real relationship with Harry since he wanted commitment for obvious reasons and she was desperate for her independence. Little0bird latched onto Ginny's desire for independence and "doing it herself" as a bit of a character flaw, which the books had shown to somewhat be the case. Moving in with Harry so soon after Hogwarts would be something her natural self would fight against but actually could be a good thing for her. It's a shame she stopped the story right as Ginny was coming to that realization. Very few, almost no other writers have tackled that storyline.

Also Deprived and Thief of Hogwarts. Just please. I'll sit through a thousand other ghastly awful Harry/Fleur stories just to see those finished.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]])

It's probably too ambitious to ever be finished (satisfactorily).

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/harry-potter-and-the-boy-who-lived.17021/]]

More of an honorable mention, since I'm not even sure where that story would go and it's more exciting for me because of its world-building than for its plot. So.. it's kinda okay for it to be abandoned.

** I really would like to see linkffn(The Thief of Hogwarts by bluminous8), its mostly silly but it is a good fun read, an unfortunately the author seems to be long from fanfiction. linkffn(Whiskey Time Travel) is another, the author is apparently super busy but I really love what little there is of it. One that I do miss is linkffn(Retsu's Folly), it is the only good Bleach crossover I have ever read, and though the author is still rarely updating other fics, nearly 3 years since an update makes me doubt there will be any more.
