Let me just get the obvious x-ray vision suggestion out the way.

Okay, so I'm looking for ideas for magical glasses. I'm interested both in enchantments you might put on the lenses/frames and for unusual frame ideas. I'm not interested in discussion on healing one's vision; I know that's been done before and it's not the direction I want to go with this fic.

Obvious enchantments are those that imitate Muggle abilities (varifocals, reactive lenses, anti-glare, etc) and protection against breakage and smears. (Imagine never having to clean your glasses again!) Perhaps something to let you find them if you misplace them.

But I'm sure you clever clogs can come up with some more interesting charms.

As for frames, my imagination is failing me. In particular my scene has Harry accompanied by Dumbledore while he's glasses shopping, and I'd like at least one crazy pair of frames that Dumbledore would suggest as a good idea while Harry's going, "Uh, no, that'll get me laughed out of school."


** Also an omniocular kind of function? Zoom in, record, etc.

More choices include night vision, reflecting basilisk death stare, accessing the internet, sentient glasses that talk to you like the sorting hat, showing the eyes being open when you are actually asleep in Binns â€˜ class. If you don't have them on and can't find them, you call them and they come running as if they had two little legs and feet.

I think what's more interesting is that magic in a Harry Potter is kinda quirky. Instead of glasses being impervious, have them clean themselves as if they were alive, using a hidden cloth or even squirt tees and wipers like a car (and you need to refill the cleaning liquid). Or if they see a spelling mistake they pinch your ear. Or the Enchantment is to see through walls, and you literally don't see walls at all anymore and keep walking into them - if you're in the griffindor common room you'll literally see all the way to the ground, as floor and ceiling are also not visible (might have been useful in philosopher's stone and chamber of secrets, although seeing does not mean accessing). Or they're usable in strong sunlight, but instead of becoming sunglasses a visor pops out of the front to shade the eyes, making him look like a golf player. A calendar function that zaps him if he forgets entries.

For frames Harry might not want, what about those aviator-style glasses that make some people look like a serial killer. Actually maybe each type of frame should remind him of someone: wayfarer style reminds him of that weird guy with the tattoos who listened to strange screaming music, the bright red horned ones of a lovely librarian who let him hide during Harry hunting and so on. Remember it's the Wizarding world: monocles, glasses that just sit on the nose, and who knows what other whacky weird old fashioned stuff could be there as well.

Shit, now I need a hilarious one shot of Harry buying glasses in the magical world. The brands could sound sound like knock-offs as well: Raywand, Etc.

** Its the Harry Potter world, mix whimsical with a somewhat interesting idea. The frames heat up whenever the wearer has gone too long without a cup of tea. Lenses that will show your eyes open and alert while you nap behind them. Glasses that massage your nose. Glasses that make poor handwriting legible.

** You could have something like the [[http://fairytail.wikia.com/wiki/Gale-Force_Reading_Glasses][Gale-Force Reading Glasses]] from fairy tail that let you read faster.

Also mabye glasses that let you read any language, after all some of the books in hogwarts are probably hundreds of years old, so being able to buy glasses that translates stuff like old English and other languages into modern English would be useful.

** Camera glasses. Just tap them or say the magic word to take a picture of whatever you're seeing.

Much more discreet than regular cameras, quicker to bring to bear too if you need to catch a picture of a dark wizard on the move or the rider of a speeding broomstick. Downside is that someone can't really double check your shot until you go print it.

** For glasses, I always thought being able to see the compositions of things would be cool.

Or if you go with an arithmancy theme, something numerical would be fun.

Maybe seeing shadows of an object or person's future/past/potential for a divination theme?

Glasses frames could be around the themes of certain metals or woods kind of how wand wood lore has certain meanings
