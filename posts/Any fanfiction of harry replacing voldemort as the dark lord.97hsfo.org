I always liked the idea of harry just replacing voldemort. Are there any (preferrably good) fanfics based on this? Preferrably on wattpad


** Not replacing Voldemort, but succeeding him as the next Dark Lord: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167). Even more interesting, this Harry stays true to his canon nature and both Ron and Hermione joined him on his endeavor. Neville and others got on board later.

*** I love this story to bits but I can never find it in me to recommend it. It ends too early for it's premise and I feel like it fails to deliver on what it promises. Great read, but I wish I'd known that going in.

You hit the nail on the head. The writing is good and the characterizations spot on, and then it just fast forwards to an unsatisfying ending and Epilogue.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
