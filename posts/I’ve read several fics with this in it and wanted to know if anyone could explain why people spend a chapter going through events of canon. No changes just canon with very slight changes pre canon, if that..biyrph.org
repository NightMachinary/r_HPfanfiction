#+TITLE: I’ve read several fics with this in it and wanted to know if anyone could explain why people spend a chapter going through events of canon. No changes just canon with very slight changes pre canon, if that.

** This is a huge pet peeve for me, too. If you want to have a scene that happened in canon, shake it up or gloss over it. I've read a few fics that are good at doing that, but a vast majority tend to spew barely rehashed canon, especially during intros

** I think part of it is that alt!Harry fanfics are focused more on Harry's character and how he would react to events in canon without considering that a lot of alt!Harrys would change events enough that canon events wouldn't necessarily follow. I think Prince of Slytherin tackles this trope well by giving viewpoints of other characters to show why some canon events happen while others don't, i.e. Lockhart still teaching at Hogwarts despite WBWL and Quirrel still stealing the stone despite Smart!Harry.

Some events are immutable because they just have storytelling potential, like the Tournament, the Chamber, and others.

As much as I malign HPMOR on this subreddit, I have to admit that it does not going through canon pretty well while still centering around Harry, even if the events that happen instead are kind of inexplicable (we shall break bellatrix black out of azkaban for no real reason except that it shall be very very clever also instead of quidditch we'll do scenes from enders game but with magic.)

Aside from that, being creative is /hard/. On top of that, it's kind of scary to write something new and different and throw it out into the world, because the fanfic community is established so you're inviting judgment for sure.

*** I'm not talking about this. I can understand what you're saying but I'm talking about a chapter basically skimming through canon like what would be expected if you had no idea anything about what the books are. Like explaining some of the character but not really fleshing it out. Like “the dementors were bad but luckily he learned the patronus charm” type of explanation. It's not fleshing a character, it's just words being there in the slight chance a person reading it hasn't seen the movies/read the books/heard about the plot.

My thoughts exactly. I can't imagine many readers wanting to read Harry Potter (or any other story) without already being so familiar with it that they want to read more of it. Some stories even go so far that they try to surprise the readers with basic canon stuff.

"... but he's no ordinary boy, he's a /wizard!/"

Wow. Amazing. How come I haven't heard about this before.

JK Rowling did this kind of recap in books 2-4. So if a writer is seeking to emulate the style and tone of canon (which depressingly few do try) then this kind of recap makes sense.

** 1) They've probably read a lot of fanfic, and had seen it done in other stories. Assume it is normal / want to mimic successful authors. ie "it's a Trope!"

2) They approach their stories as if this is the first time someone has read Harry Potter and just stumbled onto a fanfic. They do not want to assume the reader knows HP as well as they do.

3) The story does not feel complete without the backstory...even if they have to rip if off word for word.

--------------

For me personally, it was a bit of Trope (every story I liked did something similar) and approaching it like a first time reader. I don't think I ripped off huge portions of the original books, but I'm sure I summarized or used a paragraph here and there. I generally diverge from canon in 6th year, so no need to rehash the first 5.

My biggest peeves are "Marauders read HP books" type stories, where it is literally Book 1 with reactions thrown in... a guilty pleasure if you want to re-read the entire series anyway...I guess. My other peeve is *BOLDING* the borrowed parts...only for the entire page to be bold; just put a disclaimer at the top and copy/paste the thing. If you really feel bad about your plagiarism then don't do it...or just add a citation do an authors note at the bottom.

*** If I include a scene from canon, it's usually for #3. Even then I change the wording to blend with my style. Usually it's dialogue I take. Even then, it's always been set up for something in the same scene that is different from canon.

I can say I do it because, for example, if it's Snape who finds Harry instead of McGonagall after the Remembrall incident, it's not going to seem natural to jump from the last divergence to that point, even if you include a little gloss over bit.

When I do it, I mostly just take dialogue that I can't see conceivably changing. Maybe a phrase or two from the exposition. Other than that, I try to rephrase it into my own words.

Maybe I'm biased, but I think a little bit of a rehash, /within a scene you're changing/, is okay if it helps the story flow better.

And also, totally agree with the *bolding* and /italicizing/ thing.

That said, people will probably recognize lines and exposition lifted from canon. It's not usually hard to recognize JK's style in relation to the fanfic author's and people who read fanfic are pretty well versed in canon anyways.

**** IRT the last line, fanfic readers are most likely to know canon better than JKR herself does. But it still sometimes feels like we need to tell the "whole" story just in case.

** I myself am currently writing a fic in which the prologue starts with the selection of the champions and deviates from canon when Harry enters the Gryffindor Common Room, with only a few sentences omitted. My reason is that I want to set up a deviation from Canon by taking chapters from the books leading up to the point where it becomes fanon. This way I can clearly show where it deviates, as well as give a bit of background on the off chance someone hasn't read the books and I'm in a part which isn't in the movies (like the Weighing of the Wands in GoF). This is not even a full chapter though, so I'm not sure if it fully applies as an example here.
