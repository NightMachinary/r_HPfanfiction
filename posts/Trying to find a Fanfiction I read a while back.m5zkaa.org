All I remember was like there was this bunny that he found but it turn out to be a vampire and she lived on this forest with her mom and dad who had connection to the Dracula family and apparently Merlin had sealed them because of a prophecy so they couldn't leave the their homes

at one point he starts taking her to Hogwarts since she is able to transfer into a bunny but both of her parents die n He starts taking care of her

and there was like this big conspiracy in which someone wanted to use her because she had the power to walk on the sun without dying
