Do you know of any continuations of Out of the Night? Alternatively, fan-fictions of a similar ilk?

It strikes me that OotN hasn't white washed or bashed characters, the author has a wry tone in depicting characters as ambiguous and grey. I also like the semi-absurd layers of deception, it reminds me a little of The Pureblood Pretense. I'm also interested in fics exploring light/ dark as a societal faction mirroring world balance kind of thing. The internal vs. ambient magic system is really intriguing.

Many thanks!


** As you said, Pureblood Pretense is the best we're ever going to get. An update is coming at the end of the month, so we can look forward to that at least.

*** I look forward to having the free-time to re-read The Pureblood Pretense from beginning to end. It's so, so wonderful.
