Like its obviously super not canon, but if someone wants to have a more detailed rule based magic system it seems like a reasonable explanation or whatever to me. It's basically just a mana pool. Why do people hate when fics do this so much?

**** Some people are more powerful than others but it's not really quite as simple as that sentence would suggest. There are all sorts of factors at play, from intelligence to knowledge to emotional state to intuition and creativity etc which all add up to what is collectively termed "power". Power is a product of a number of static and dynamic factors, it's not a base, fixed, factor.

In so far as some of those factors are determined by genetic factors, yes, some people are born with greater potential to be powerful, just as some people are born with greater potential to be good at non-magical skills. And similarly, to the extent that many of the factors can change but do so only slowly over a long period of time in response to experiences, changing those aspects can take years of concerted effort and work. It can work both ways too: a change in long term emotional state greatly aided Neville, but being depressed robbed Tonks of some of her powers.

On top of those considerations, you have to also appreciate that wizards aren't really powerful in general. Rather they're powerful at specific things. So Lockhart was useless at most magic but very powerful at memory charms. Harry is above average in most magic and absolutely excellent in the Dark Arts and related magic. And some wizards like Dumbledore are excellent at everything. So like I said above, you can see the comparison with non-magical skills: just as some people are born with greater potential to excel in the skills that contribute to being a doctor, or an artist, or even a polymath, some wizards can be born with greater potential to excel in the skills required to be good at transfiguration, or charms, or multiple areas of magic.

He's amazing at everything else simply because he's old and has had lots of time to get good at things, as well as being a genius.

****** Dumbledore taught transfiguration but we don't have any evidence that it was his best subject. From what we have seen, he could easily have taught Charms and DADA as well, and Alchemy besides.

Also, Dumbledore is simply in a completely different league to Hermione. He did things with a wand as a teen that his examiners had never seen before, and was already publishing papers in academic journals when he was still at Hogwarts. I'd actually say two leagues above Hermione, because Hermione doesn't seem to be even on the same level as the Marauders and Snape, who were animagi, inventing spells and casting non-verbal magic by fifth year.

Hermione is quite clever, has a good memory and works hard. That makes her a very good witch, but she's not a great one.

******* Trying to rank characters in canon is stupid - they were as skilled or dumb as the plot demanded. Dumbledore is the best example of that - for all his claimed brilliance, we never see it in action in canon because that would have stopped the whole plot in book 1. Hermione, too, was only allowed to shine - like brewing polyjuice as a second-year, solving a riddle created by Snape to stop Voldemort, finding out what monster was prowling Hogwarts in second year when no one else could - when it served the plot. On other occasions, she received the idiot ball so the plot could go on. JKR herself said that half her plots would have been solved easily if Hogwarts had had a helpful librarian.

Same for the Marauders, Snape, and everyone else. Trying to derive some ranking from the actions of characters in canon is an exercise in self-delusion and only shows the writer's bias.

Harry Potter is all about the plot. Characterisation and world building suffers for it.

******* I agree with you on that one, on the marauder's (James and Sirius) league I have wizards such as Mcgonagall, Snape, Flitwick, Slughorn and likely Lily. This leads to my next question, in your headcanon, do you have a correlation between magical skills and duelling skills ?

******** A correlation yes but not a perfect one. There are a couple of things to note in this area:

Firstly, though magical specialisation is possible, I think there's some areas of magical theory that are transferable between branches of magic. That's why you get genius generalists like Dumbledore and Voldemort - because they understand magic well at a deep, fundamental level, that understanding works to underpin /all/ magic they do, meaning they show great ability in all areas of magic.

So in many cases, skill in one area of magic may be indicative of skill in magic in general. We do see this borne out beyond the Dumbledore level - Snape, for example, while said to be particularly good at Potions and the Dark Arts, holds his own against McGonagall in DH in transfiguration too. Specialisation would occur when a person has gained a lot of subject-specific theory without really paying much attention to "general magical theory".

What all that means is that I see there being a general correlation between all magical skills, not just duelling and non-duelling skills. But of course there would still be a lot of outliers and variation within the correlation.

Secondly, we have to consider what skills go into duelling. My own interpretation of duelling is perhaps more magic-heavy than a lot of the fandom's, in that I place a lot less importance on issues like physical fitness, reflexes etc, and a lot more importance on magical skills as well as magical intuition and inventive thinking. I look at things like Slughorn being a great dueller, Dumbledore fighting Voldemort without breaking a sweat, and I come to the conclusion that duelling -- or at least duelling by people who are good at it -- is a lot more cerebral than physical. As I've said elsewhere in this thread, if you're fighting a magical opponent who is of roughly equivalent skill, it's about out-thinking your opponent in your application of magic, not about overpowering them.

I think one of the major skills that goes into duelling is one's understanding of (and thus ability with and connection to) Dark magic. I think the better one understands Dark magic, the easier one will find jinxes, hexes and curses, and they will be more powerful besides. I also think understanding of Dark magic will aid you significantly in your defences, both in terms of their strength against Dark magic and in terms of you selecting the appropriate defence in the first place.

The importance of this area of magical skill to duelling explains one of the most notable outliers in the correlation between general magical skill and duelling skill: Harry is much better at duelling than Hermione, despite Hermione having greater magical skill in other areas. I believe this is because Harry understands the Dark Arts much better than Hermione. This is shown by various things, including his DADA OWL grade, his ability to teach the DA, the fact that he has read significantly on the subject thanks to the series of books Sirius and Remus bought him, and the fact that Dark magic comes very easily to him - Sectumsempra. On top of those I think Harry's experiences have given him something of an intuitive understanding of the Dark Arts and those who practice them maliciously. And on top of that I think Harry's mindset and character is one suited for combative magic. All of this combines to have the effect that not only is Harry good at casting jinxes, hexes and curses, but he's also good at magic from other disciplines which are oriented around Dark Magic, such as the shield charm (Harry seems to be particularly talented at it) and the Patronus.

********* That is an interesting concept. That's a bit saying a student good in mathematics should be good in sciences.

On your duelling skills requirements, I admit I put more importance into physical abilities as you do. While this is true that magical abilities and ingenuity remained a major part of duelling, the physical part of duelling shouldn't be undermine imo. It's one if not the reason why Lupin lost his life to Dolohov a great dueller, when Pettigrew was believed to be dead Fudge described Black as obviously quicker to which Mcgonagall responded that Pettigrew was always a bad dueller, as though his poor reflexes was enough to rank him.

On the understanding of dark magic, I agree with you which is why I always find ludicrous the idea that 'good' character has no knowledge in dark arts when it was proved at numerous times the contrary. However I think aurors who are trained extensively in the art of DADA should be top dueller yet despite being above average we never came across a formidable duellist.

Your last paragraph is really interesting and led to another question. Dumbledore stated he was /a shade more skilled/ than Grindelwald which was the factor of his victory, we might as well assume that his understanding of Dark Arts is equal to the greatest dark wizards. However we've seen Molly defeating Bellatrix, Flitwick (a duellist champion) defeating Dolohov, Mcgonagall pushing hard Snape. In your headcanon what do you think of those cases ? And of the wizarding community as whole ?

** A. With 'magical cores' it comes down to Harry having a stronger magical core than everybody else with no work, which is boring. In DBZ, which is often compared to on this issue, they at least /worked/ and /worked/ *hard* for their strength, and is in fact of the great themes to the damn series.

B. The visualization of magic cores that you see around as a glowing ball of light is just... not good.

C. It changes magical fights from contests of wit, will, instinct and knowledge into a dick measuring contest.

D. It's a lazy way of limiting protagonists and lesser antagonists.

E. There is damn near /never/ good worldbuilding that goes along with it. A good (but abandoned) fic that has good worldbuilding and magic cores is linkffn(Wit of the Raven).

F. Often leads to absolutely terrible and stupid plot points, like Dumbledore binding Harry's magic. Actually, just make that binding magic in general.

G. Generally used in absolutely terrible fics, filled with all the 'bad' cliches used in the most generic, cookie-cutter way. So some of it is guilt by association.

This doesn't mean that mana pool magic systems in general (ie, across other works outside HP) are bad. In video games, for example, it works since resource management is important. In the Elder Scrolls Lore (and it is important to know that with Elder Scrolls, gameplay =/= lore), it works because the Elder Scrolls universe is composed of what is easily the most bonkers worldbuilding ever. In the Wheel of Time it works because of what magic in that series is.

*TL;DR* Because it's almost always boring, lazy and stupid.

** While it can be usefull, if used well (i.e. if it gives something to the story), the HP world is among the very rare ones where one does not need to have enough mana to cast magic. Hard work, knowledge, intelligence, courage, the defining characteristics of the four houses of Hogwarts are the qualities of the best wizards; including a core, which most of the time either severely limit what the character can do or allow him to totally bypass one or several of the universe requirements, feels cheap; a super-harry whose core is 10 times bigger than Voldy can be fun (when not taken seriously), but this universe has so much more to offer than just that.

  SQUIBS

  I have been asked all sorts of questions about Squibs since I first introduced the concept in ‘Chamber of Secrets'. A Squib is almost the opposite of a Muggle-born wizard: he or she is a non-magical person born to at least one magical parent. Squibs are rare; magic is a dominant and resilient gene.

  Squibs would not be able to attend Hogwarts as students. They are often doomed to a rather sad kind of half-life (yes, you should be feeling sorry for Filch), as their parentage often means that they will be exposed to, if not immersed in, the wizarding community, but can never truly join it. Sometimes they find a way to fit in; Filch has carved himself a niche at Hogwarts and Arabella Figg operates as Dumbledore's liaison between the magical and Muggle worlds. Neither of these characters can perform magic (Filch's Kwikspell course never worked), but they still function within the wizarding world because they have access to certain magical objects and creatures that can help them (Arabella Figg does a roaring trade in cross-bred cats and Kneazles, and if you don‘t know what a Kneazle is yet, shame on you). Incidentally, Arabella Figg never saw the Dementors that attacked Harry and Dudley, but she had enough magical knowledge to identify correctly the sensations they created in the alleyway.

  Do all young people in Britain's Wizarding World go to Hogwarts? For example, did Stan Shunpike attend Hogwarts? Or is Hogwarts a school just for those who are particularly good at magic while others go into trades without formal schooling? [Mugglenet/Lexicon question]

  Everyone who shows magical ability before their eleventh birthday will automatically gain a place at Hogwarts; there is no question of not being ‘magical enough'; you are either magical or you are not. There is no obligation to take up the place, however; a family might not want their child to attend Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  “I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk, shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August,” gabbled Mrs. Figg at once, as though she had learned what she was saying by heart, “when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk. On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running ---”

  “Running?” said Madam Bones sharply. “Dementors don't run, they glide.”

  “That's what I meant to say,” said Mrs. Figg quickly, patches of pink appearing in her withered cheeks. “Gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boys.”

  “What did they look like?” said Madam Bones, narrowing her eyes so that the monocle's edges disappeared into her flesh.

  “Well, one was very large and the other one rather skinny ---”

  “No, no,” said Madam Bones impatiently, “the dementors . . . describe them.”

  “Oh,” said Mrs. Figg, the pink flush creeping up her neck now.

  “They were big. Big and wearing cloaks.”

  Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like: the eerie way they moved, hovering inches over the ground, or the rotting smell of them, or that terrible, rattling noise they made as they sucked on the surrounding air . . . A dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor, a frizzy-haired witch, and whispered something in her ear. She smirked and nodded.

  “Big and wearing cloaks,” repeated Madam Bones coolly, while Fudge snorted derisively. “I see. Anything else?”

** Mainly, it's a poor fit with canon. They're never mentioned, there's no such thing as 'magical exhaustion' and it's made pretty clear that a spell's power is a function of execution, intent and prior practice. In fact, aside from Voldemort, there's no sign of any wizard with 'naturally stronger' spells than their peers.

Magical cores are a pretty lazy magic system. They just impose a simple limit. They don't explain the vast array of spells and counterspells in Potterverse; horcruxes and Lily's sacrifice; dark magic and rituals etc.

Trying to enforce rules on Potter magic is /hard/ because there's an exception to nearly everything. ([[/u/Taure]] did a pretty good job outlining some basic principles [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VOF1eu_B7qpTeTUykW5ZGK2HJmVAG5WouY71a5AiRPo][here]].) Magical cores are a broad, uninspired limit that explain almost nothing in Potterverse.

EDIT: I should clarify that I don't think there's anything wrong with the idea of 'magical cores' in and of themselves. They're a popular fanfic concept and I've seen plenty of good fics mention them in passing. It's when authors try to construct plot points and elaborate magical systems around them that we start to run into problems.

In general I get wary when I see the words "magical core" or "magical exhaustion" (or similar stuff). Those are often plot devices that are either annoying because they cancel a fight because of exhaustion, or they're useless side info that could have just kept out and the story closer to canon.

** There are numerous reasons why I dislike magical cores. To be clear, when I say magical cores, I am primarily referring to the idea that a wizard has a quantifiable source of magic which, like physical energy, is used up by casting spells and thus depletable.

My biggest problem with magical cores is that it means wizards can run out of magic. Not only is this completely uncanonical, it also does not make sense to me within the HP world. Having magic is an essential feature of being a wizard: a wizard running out of magic is like a Muggle running out of Muggleness. Does Vernon have a Muggle core with which he fuels his Muggleness? Further, wizarding society depends on wizards being able to cast magic all day every day, as they use magic casually, to complete everyday tasks.

Another problem I have with magical cores is that they make magic too simple. A single source of energy which has a single numerical value associated with it (whether or not wizards are aware of that value), which fuels all magic like petrol in a car. It's boring. Magic is a technology analogue in the HP world. You have to go to school and study to use it. Knowledge and academic study directly correlates with wizarding power. There's a government department dedicated to studying magic. Magical theory should be at least as complex as its Muggle analogues.

I would be fine with it if someone wrote an AU in which "magical core" referred to a kind of complex magical-biological system, with analogues for organs and tissues, blood, lymph, hormones, etc, and if wizards had only partial understanding of this system and studied it to understand it better, and if it was suitably complex, with numerous factors affecting not only power but also having different types of powers which interact in complex ways and which influence spellcasting in a more interesting manner than 1 to 1 fuel. But they don't.

A third problem I have with magical cores is that I find wizarding conflict to be more interesting if it is determined by the application of magic. As Scrimgeour said in HBP: the problem is, the other side has magic too. In a magical core scenario, conflict is resolved by either one person being more powerful than the other, or one person running out of magic before the other. Dull. No complexity. Magical conflict is so much more interesting when its outcome depends on how different characters use and apply magic, which shows a lot more about their character, and allows for far more elegant and interesting conflicts than merely "value A is bigger than value B, value A wins". In the no-cores scenario, winning a duel becomes more about outsmarting your opponent in the way you use magic.

My final problem with magical cores is more general, and reflects the fact that they treat magic like a form of physical energy which is expended to do work in changing the physical world. That's not how HP magic works.

It's a nod to physics that tries to fool you into thinking that magic could possibly be compatible with actual physics by making it seem that there were some rules with the thinnest possible similarities. But of course HP magic and physics are equally incompatible regardless of whether you give magic some rules that are vaguely reminiscent of physics.

** It's a bit cheesy, tbh.

I did once read a fic where the concept was used, but it was never called a magical core. Ron was dying of a rare and incurable magical disease. Long story short, Hermione discovered that he was actually suffering from liver failure, and 'magic' was generated in the liver. He got a transplant in a muggle hospital (I believe Bill donated half his liver) and he thus became the first known case of a person surviving this disease in the magical world.

The term 'magical core' was never used, but that was an interesting way of using the concept. Unfortunately, authors rarely go that route and just have Harry discover his magical core and suddenly he is a master of occulumency and is supah powerful.

** Anything you do that deviates from canon has about a 25% chance of getting hate. I think that's the majority of what's going on.

Magical cores tend not to add anything to stories -- it's a way of explaining how someone is more or less powerful without requiring much thought or depth. You can add thought and depth on top, but you don't need magical cores for that.

They usually don't detract -- if the author wants Harry (because it's pretty much always Harry) to be powerful, then Harry will be powerful, with or without magical cores.

** It's because the stories that put it in don't, in at the very least most cases, actually use the oh-so-necessary mana pool system that they introduce by using magical cores for anything that would serve as a handicap of any sort and at any point for Harry; instead they tend to use it as a cheap cop-out for why is Harry oh-so-great-and-powerful without need for any /actual/ training or savviness.

The plot device that is the magical cores is, by itself, sound. That said, it is most definitely /not/ canon---at least part of the hatred comes from efforts of authors who write fanfics in which magical cores are shown as a “hmm, yes, this is definitely how it has to be in canon so I say it's canon and thus it is”---and most people using the concept use it really really badly which makes it easy to see it as something that does not give a good prognosis as to the quality of the story it is found in.

Seriously though, from the top of my head I can think of two stories that actually used the concept of magical cores well, and in one of them it was used pretty much to mock it. On the other hand, I can think of a two-digit count of stories in which it wasn't explicitly bad but wasn't good either (so “meh, this exists”) and there are a plethora of stories with magical cores that plain suck and that have them used as a way to fan-wank at some character.

PS. I think more people actually mock the concept than hate it outright, at least here.

Kidding aside, The point is that you don't run out of magic.

It is acknowledged multiple times that Voldemort is a significantly superior wizard to Harry in terms of conventional magical skill and particularly duelling. Harry is Voldemort's equal only in so far as he was the one who would choose to take Voldemort down.

This is explained by Dumbledore to Harry in HBP. The prophecy merely describes what Harry would have done anyway, it doesn't enforce anything. Harry would not rest until Voldemort is dead, and his and Voldemort's decisions have equipped each of them with certain weapons, abilities and pieces of knowledge that give each of them the chance to win.

Secondly, what on earth makes you think Harry is stronger than Voldemort at age 11? His burning of Voldemort in the climax of PS was Lily's sacrificial magic at work.

Thirdly, there doesn't need to be something preventing wizards from casting all day. Indeed, given that magic has the place of technology in wizarding society and is used by them for everything, wizards very much need to be able to cast magic all day.

As far as combat is concerned, you're failing to appreciate the fact that both sides have the ability to spam spells. You can spam offensive spells but I can spam shield charms (or rather, just keep the one I have up). If your first time casting the spell doesn't break my charm, all your subsequent tries with the same spell is just going to get the same result. If you want to defeat me you're going to have to find a way around my shield charm. Just hitting it again and again with the same ineffective spell isn't going to do anything, because like you I am not running out of magic. The result of such a system is that wizards have to be clever in their application of magic in order to win duels. The system also rewards wizards who have a better and broader understanding of magic as there are more spells and tactics for them to change to if one fails.

That would be nice if I had ever seen that happen once. The exhaustion always happens after the fight, never during the fight invalidating the need for cores.

***** Why stop there? There's a high degree of correlation between being alive and that life being awful. Existence is suffering. Even if that suffering is just bad fanfiction :')

****** The point is, stereotypes are stupid, and so is relying on them to judge a fanfiction story. Just because another story using magical cores is shitty doesn't mean all stories using them are shitty.

** Name a good fic that uses magical cores. Can't? That's why readers dislike them.

Cores almost always herald bad writing where fights and power relationships reduce to the size of the cores. Harry has the biggest of course!

*** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) has the end plot focus on magical cores, and Harry cures an artificial 'illness' that traps students in their minds/blocks legilimancy and induces comas by taking a back way into their heads through their magical cores and showing the comatose students how they can destroy the trap from the inside. It's really cool actually.

**** I forgot about that one! That author can actually write well and build a believable world. I'm always wondering when the deception will fail and harry/archie get found out.

I do want to note that you don't really see the cores introduced until late in the first book after the author has built up the world. The cores in this fic get used as a plot device.

I'm having a really hard time thinking of any fic that turns out "decent" where the cores are mentioned by the 3rd chapter. Pureblood pretense and it's sequels first build a believable world and then introduce cores as a plot device.

--------------

The fictions with cores I'm thinking of tend to introduce them early when harry is introduced to the wizarding world. Almost always his core is large and it gets used to explain why harry more powerful then his peers. They get used as [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechnoBabble][technobabble]], not as plot devices.

In most fictions, you can improve the writing by removing the scenes that mention magical cores and simply state or imply that harry is powerful. So seeing cores introduced early is a good indicator of poor writing in my experience.
