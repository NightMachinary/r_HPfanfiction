I just finished the 5th book in the Sacrifices Arc by Lightning on the Wave and all I can say is holy shit. This series is a reimagining of Harry Potter where the titular character is sorted into Slytherin, has a twin brother who is the boy who lived, and Lily and James did not die.

I tried reading this series almost a decade ago in highschool but couldn't go past the 5th book. It was too dark, and hopeless. Character development didn't seem to stick. There'd be progress and then just some chapters later Harry would revert back to his old habits, sometimes worse. It was just so frustrating. I couldn't handle it.

I still held good feelings towards the series for its astounding world building. I no longer read fanfiction, haven't in years, but I figured I'd give this series another try. For the nostalgia.

I've grown a lot this past decade. Went through a lot of things. Got diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Dealing with what may be depression. Mental health has been a real struggle. I'm saying all this because my experiences have made me understand that what I thought was bad character development before was actually a disturbingly accurate representation of what it's like to struggle with mental health.

The sacrifices arc has many themes and one of its most central is mental health. You don't fix your mental issues with single ground breaking revelations. It's an uphill struggle. You take small steps, make little improvements, and often yeah you do end up rolling back down the hill, and it sucks. It sucks so much. But that's the reality of struggling with mental health. That's the reality of trying to heal from trauma. That's the reality of trying to become better.

The sacrifices arc is an amazing series so far and I am excited to start the 6th book. I am glad I will read it now as an adult, and did not as a teenager, because I am now capable of appreciating it as it should be appreciated.

I highly recommend this series to anyone who can commit a lot of time and emotions. It is gorgeous and I wish I had hard copies to put on my bookshelf.


** I had a similar experience with the series but framing the story as you have makes me want to go and give it a go again. From what I remember I finished the 4th year and the series it's a million words long or something like that.

I hope you are doing well, as you say mental health issues are an ongoing effort and it's important to be forgiving and steadfast in dealing with them.

It's actually about /three/ million words long, by FF's counting. And by upload/update dates, was written in about sixteen months. I still have no idea how the author put out that much high quality writing that quickly.

**** Rowling's series is only ~1M in comparison. Also Rowling took 6 years to write the first draft of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. She spent years on world building. Compare that to Lightning who wrote her entire series with all its intricate world building on the fly over the course of one year. The only explanation is that Lightning is a genius.

*** I think not having read Harry Potter or other fanfiction itself in a long time helps with the series. I was put off by certain characters because they were so different from the canon. For example Hermione not being with Ron felt wrong, but now I don't care. In fact I prefer her relationship as it's written in sacrifices arc over her relationship with Ron in canon. It doesn't feel like I'm reading Harry Potter fanfiction now.

And thanks. I'm in a much better place now.

** I remember reading it and liking it too but somewhere along the line I just stopped like you. I'm sure it's great and I know how much of a struggle mental health is but I just don't like tragic things. Somewhere along the line I want to see the hero prevail and get better. That doesn't mean that I want it to magically go away but I really like seeing characters find that coping mechanism and strength. Real life is already such a struggle so I guess I always want to read stories were the characters strive for more and see how strong they can be inside (I know this is cliché and sappy). It's not that I don't like pr appreciate dark stories it's just that if it ends tragically on top of that I'm like nopee

*** I believe it does have a happy ending (I skipped to read the very last paragraph of the last book during my first read because like you, I didn't want to invest in something with a sad ending back then) but there's a lot of hardship you go through before it's reached.

** I remember staying up literally all night to finish this series, ha. My brother came downstairs at like 8am and found me still sitting at the desk from the night before.

One thing I really liked and hadn't come across before was (er - spoilers I guess) the idea that while a Horcrux can only be created through murder, it can only be destroyed by willing sacrifice. Very neat imo.

** This was the first fanfic I ever read and it put up a high bar for all the others to come. I love this fic, I try to do a reread every few years. Harry's characterization was so amazing and I too appreciate how well his struggle with mental health was. Someone once told me they couldn't get into this fic because Harry was too perfect and I was like keep reading he is the most flawed character.

*** Harry could so easily have been written as a Gary Stu that I am amazed he wasn't. This fic is a standard of its own for me. I find it better than the original series in many ways, so I don't think it's fair to compare to other fanfiction. It really doesn't feel like fanfiction to me.

*** Didn't mind the fact it was slash, but I hated the Draco part thoroughly. In like 90% of the story he remains the same rude, conceited, spoiled, greedy, entitled little cuntbag like in canon, though he does have some (very rare) great moments.

While the 6th and 7th books were being posted, I remember leaving Lightning the same review quite a few times: "/It's to time to kill Draco and ship Harry with that nice sworn companion girl that he has so much in common with./", lol.

***** Why don't you try reading the first book before making hasty judgements. It's the shortest and only took me a couple hours to read.

Every single one of Lightning's characters are flawed in some ways. There are characters you meet that you grow to love and admire, then you learn about their past and a little hate grows inside you. While you still love them for who they are /now/ you don't resent those that try to get vengeance against them, because you know that is what's just.

Lightning can spin such complex characters that your feelings towards them are equally complex. The only character I truly hate is Voldemort, Fenrir Greyback and another OC deatheater. Beyond that every character has both good and bad in them, and I often hate their actions but not the character themselves.

Also with mental health being such a huge theme, Lightning doesn't let "being shitty is just a character trait" be an excuse. Snape and Draco are /not/ nice to most people beyond those they love and care for, and that is not something brushed aside. It is addressed and dealt with and their words and actions have consequences. They grow and revert and grow again just like many other characters in this series.

**** I like Draco for all his flaws and strengths hahaha. He's certainly not someone I'd ever want as a partner, but neither is Harry. Hell neither of them are even people I'd want as friends. But in the scope of the book, I found the build up to their relationship and the relationship itself to be natural.

Also character wise he's a fantastic character. Sometimes people really are little pompous shits that need a lot of growing up to do. I just love that lightning never turned him into a caricature where that's /all/ he is, like Rowling mostly did.

*** The romance doesn't come into play till book 4 and it's build up is splendid. Also Harry and Draco in this series are basically entirely different characters from the original by that point. I rarely read romance, slash included, and this series isn't really romantic lol

**** I just don't care for romance in fanfiction in the first place. Sometimes it can be done well, but it's often not, and it's never what I'm looking for. A story specifically being slash means there will definitely be at least a romantic subplot, which is a strong point to "I'm not going to like this fic." Not an instant no for me, obviously - Arc of Sacrifices is fantastic. It's just a general red flag.

**** To use a quote from a good friend of mine, “Slash fics are almost always written by young women who don't actually understand how to write the relationship between two men well.” Slash, to me, has become partly synonymous with hurt and angst fics that use emotional drama as a replacement for actual storytelling ability. A good slash fic is, unfortunately, rare. The best kind of slash fics are those where the relationship is shown as just that: a relationship between two people. I generally avoid the slash tag for the same reason I avoid harem tags: both are generally tied to poorer writing quality, poorer storytelling quality, and a generous dose of hormones. That being said, saving Connor is an excellent fix that does slash better than most.

**** Hahaha it's really not a ship fic. Romance doesn't come in till the fourth book and the buildup is gradual. But if you are extremely loyal to ships it may be hard to digest because there aren't many canon ships. For example, when first reading it I could not get used to the fact that Hermione doesn't end up with Ron. But now, reading it after not having read canon or fanfiction for years, I don't mind at all. Lightning's characters are also reimaginings in many ways. They retain core aspects from Rowling's books, but they also change to adapt to the changes in plot in Lightning's book. Harry Potter being the most different. Draco Malfoy is the most similar in the first couple books but once he finally grows up after some trials he morphs into his own character as well.

** I've read the sacrifices arc at least once a year for the last 8ish years. i am often only able to read up through part of book 6 because of how emotionally heavy it is, but i read the early books multiple times a year. it is easily the most impactful fanfic i've ever encountered, if not most impactful /story/ i've ever read. i honestly realize something new about it each time i read it (foreshadowing, references, etc).
