Like the title says, I'm looking for any fics which have the main character, preferably fem!Harry but regular Harry is fine too, discovering that his/her parents weren't quite as light as they were painted. In the case of Lily, using dark magic and being a dark witch---she /was/ friends with Severus after all, and he did think that joining the Death Eaters would impress her iirc. Or in the case of James, discovering that he did things which would by any reasonable person be considered war crimes. As I recall there was a fic where he was plotting to blow up the Malfoy's house including the noncombatant Narcissa and the infant Draco, for example.

Important though is that I want the focus to be more on their child finding out the truth and reacting to it in whichever way the author likes.

(With regards to the definition of dark magic, I don't care whether it means "magic used to hurt", "unsavory magic", "illegal magic", or "secret magic". All are acceptable here.)


** Mirror certainly fits as Harry discovers the Wizarding World as his parents role as traitors, giving up the secret to the Longbottoms to the Dark Lord. Sirius doesn't raise Harry (preferring to leave him at an orphanage) and they loathe each other once they meet.

*** Hello. I am the author of this story, and I would like to know how I can contact the person who has it available on GDocs to ask them to delete it.

Reason is that this version has many characterization problems - mainly that Harry and Cassiopeia are not the people I wanted them to be - but nowadays I've learned more about writing and I am correcting this and other problems in a rewrite. I have deleted it myself from my computer, and don't want it available, but I am aware this is internet and maybe I can't really delete it.

Thanks.

** This fic takes place the night of Halloween ‘81 and the following day(s). Harry's still an infant so he's not discovering anything but James, Sirius, and Remus do some things that are pretty fat over the line of “well, it's war.”

  The Battle of Camlann never happened, thus the legacy of Arthur lives on. The blood of the founders still walk the halls of Hogwarts, while ancient enemies clash to this day. Years later, Harry Potter wakes up a stranger in a strange world. Between over competitive house relations and never ending mysterious plots, he must struggle to find the truth about that fated Halloween. AU

  Well, that is Snape's tragedy. Given his time over again he would not have become a Death Eater, but like many insecure, vulnerable people (like Wormtail) he craved membership of something big and powerful, something impressive.

  He wanted Lily and he wanted Mulciber too. He never really understood Lily's aversion; he was so blinded by his attraction to the dark side he thought she would find him impressive if he became a real Death Eater.

***** See, that quote and a few others are why I'm not really convinced by J. K. Rowling's portrayal of Death Eaters. I mean, Snape thought it would impress Lily to join the Death Eaters, and TMR tried to recruit Lily at least once.

It just doesn't jive with the idea of TMR hating all muggleborns so bad that not only did he try to kill them, but he created a magical artifact that would carry out that exact plan, and then went on to found an order of people solely about hating muggles and muggleborns (for seemingly no reason at all).

Like, he hates muggleborns that much that he goes to all of that trouble to try to kill them... And then tries to recruit one? And we're expected to believe that Severus thought joining a group based around hating muggles and muggleborns would impress a muggleborn? It just doesn't add up.

i don't have the exact quote but i remember her making it awhile ago. I interpreted it as more like voldemort was trying to recruit james potter (since he was a well known pureblood and head boy) and was like "if you work for me i won't kill your wife" type deal or that he would overlook his marriage. not that he specifically recruited and wanted Lily as a death eater. Not even Narcissa was a death eater as very few women were.

** linkffn(6995114) - The Wizard of the Kaleidoscope. It's not a huge plot point, but a bit more than a throwaway comment regarding Lily Potter's use of magic and such. The story is OK at least for the first half or so and the writing is decent, but it gets tedious at the end.

​

There's another one on the tip of my tongue but i just can't remember it.

  What does it take to destroy something completely? Some would be fine with eradicating its soul. Others would argue that you must erase even the concept of the object from existence. AU, with a notoriously complex Magic system.
