** A very Slytherin Harry by geoffaree

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/737220]]

Aged 8, Harry finds out he can talk to snakes. He then runs into a magical snake, learns about being a wizard and keeps a magical snake baby as a pet. He gets determined to be able to provide for the snake when he grows up and decides to learn more about magic.

Sounds very cliche for one of those "super-power" Harry-stories, but he is not. He is very much a typical kid doing stupid kid things who messes up big time more than once.

** Linkffn(9464342) has a time traveling Harry to Tom Riddle's era where his behavior is quite canon-compliant and is sent to Slytherin. No romance but Harry develops a frenemy relationship with Tom. Also Harry spends the first third of the story in the body of a cat.

  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?

** It's been a while since I read this, things were like in canon up until the train station iirc. Although, there might be other revelations that comes later that are not exactly canon but not exactly not canon. (Person X was the best friend of person Y sort of deal, where canon doesn't confirm nor deny this)

** Maybe someone knows which fic I'm talking about: Sirius and Remus raise Harry and it goes through all the years not sure when it ends but there is a sequel involving a multiverse which I thought was really good. Harry is a Slytherin and there is a bit of drarry, frantic and parental wolf star at the end of each year, canon compliment. I'm gonna go find it but it's really good in my opinion :))
