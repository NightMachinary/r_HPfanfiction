** Turns out, there are knowledge potions, but they require you to brew a whole book into it (as in, the book is an ingredient). When you drink the entire thing, you'll have encyclopedic knowledge of the matter. And we know that Hermione is really good at potions.

*** I think it would be a cool piece of accidental magic for her.

Other types of accidental magic I could see being cool thing for kid Hermione to do is stuff like Animating her books so they can read themselves to her or doing something like Legilimency on a book and diving into it to go on adventures with with her favorite characters or visit the places in her books.

*** I have no problems with this prompt.

just- Dude, seriously, don't you have anything better to do than comment on every single thread about Hermione how awful she is and how everyone who doesn't hate her like you obviously do is a rabid fanboy and a terrible person?

Like, I don't know... drawing? Writing? Going out with friends? Sports, maybe?

Even your flair is about Hermione. Cringe.

  or coming on threads to downvote

You just come on threads to throw shade for absolutely no reason. No joke, literally every comment I see of yours, whether on the discord or this subreddit, is either about how much you hate hermione, how much you hate Harmony, how much you hate fans of either or sneakily throwing shade in requests or comments by doing the same covertly.

But you are so calcified in your opinions that you will just ignore people telling you, and/or call them stans when it cuts particularily deep. I have never met a harmony fan that is so obsessed with hermione as you are.

It's just unnecessary. Stuff like your first comment on the post - why make it? It's a specific, tailored request, and you come in to spread hate under the guise of some haha funny joke.
