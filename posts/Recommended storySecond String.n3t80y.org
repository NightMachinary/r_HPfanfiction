Probably not the usual sort of post for this sub, however.

A week or two ago someone commented on another post that they kept on and would always keep on recommending the fic â€˜the second string' by Eider Down. Although I wasn't a fan of the light but well written slash in it (I don't believe stories need as much detail on relationship scenes) the story was very well written and I enjoyed it much more than anything I've read in a long time. So, whomever it was that recommended it, thank you very much for a thoroughly enjoyable read.


** It's a perfectly reasonable post, but the "Review" flair normally suggests a bit more in-depth discussion. I think there's a "Recommendation" flair, which might suit your post better.

*** I've changed it now, thank you for pointing it out. It's my first post so just tried to wing it!
