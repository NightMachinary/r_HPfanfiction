:END:
It's a Voldemort wins AU, and Hermione is sold/turned into a sex slave and is moved around the death eaters homes to keep the order from tracking her. She escapes and Draco recognizes her on the night bus and takes her back to his place. I believe Harry can't walk in it? If you can remember the name please let me know because I'be been wanting to reread it


** Change the flair to "what's this fic"
