I have seen many fics with the prompt being Draco the Headboy in Hermione's 7th (Draco's 8th) year. I just want to know whether it is canon (can't keep up with the stupid additions to canon) or just a headcanon that gets overused. And if so why?


** Not Canon, and its used as a way to pair him with Hermione since they would be forced to spend time together.

Its a miracle that Draco avoided going to prison after the war, I dont think anyone could ever seriously consider to give him such a position.

** Come to think of it,who would realistically be Head Boy during the Eight Year in canon ? It sure as hell wouldn't be a Slytherin and Ron and Harry are away at Auror training

*** Neville. He protected the children from the death eaters together with Ginny so most would trust him and he was also pretty heroic during the BOH

***** True,but in most eight year fics everyone redoes their year. Probably because crucioing 1st years and being fed death eater propaganda isn't the best education :D

And I don't think James Potter was a prefect and he was made head boy anyway.

***** u/wandererchronicles:

  Usually, shouldn't it be a former prefect who would make the Head Boy?
#+end_quote

This doesn't actually seem to be a rule, given that James Potter was Head Boy but never prefect.

****** He was Quidditch Captain, and we know that they enjoy the same benefits as prefects.

******* They have access to the Prefect's Bathroom, yes, but we never see them giving/taking points, assigning detentions, or doing night patrols. There seems to be quite a difference between Prefects and QC.

Of course, I don't believe the duties of Head Boy/Girl are ever spelled out in canon, either.

******** The book says equal status, and the punishments perfects assign are their duties, not really their benefits.

  The day after this rather gloomy birthday tea, their letters and booklists

  arrived from Hogwarts. Harry's included a surprise: he had been made

  Quidditch Captain.

  "That gives you equal status with prefects!" cried Hermione happily.

  "You can use our special bathroom now and everything!"

***** James was head boy even though he was never a prefect.
