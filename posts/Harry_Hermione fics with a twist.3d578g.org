I like Harry/Hermione romance fics, but obviously you've read all the standard scenarios after a while: He takes her to Yule ball, they are soulmates, they loved each other since the first time they met, etc.

So I'm now looking for fics that have this pairing, but have some sort of twist, that differ from the standard formula in one way or another.

Examples:

- Harry or Hermione gets enslaved through a curse/artifact/law/etc. to the other person
- One (or both) of them are creatures or have something else going on that causes problems for them
- Harry is pissed off from having to save everyone and everything all the time and decides to leave the wizarding world together with Hermione
- They switch bodies and still get together
- Age difference between both of them for some stupid reason
- female!harry or male!hermione?
- Hermione timetravels (I've probably read every harry timetravels story already)
- Hermione is the usual bibliophile and Harry is literally a book

You can probably think of even more things than I can - so any suggestions?

I think you meant figuratively, literally means...

...oh. OH.

I didn't know until now, but if that exists, I want to read it.

**** Maybe it's also BDSM. Studying hurts so good, and Hermione is literally chained to her desk until she finishes /all six inches./

...I'll be in my bunk.

-edit: BookHarry goes from a paperback to a hardcover; she teases his pages, /marking her place/ with a coy finger, then using a nice thick bookmark; and, of course, she always finishes a book once she starts.

I might have to write this...hmm. Reporting back soonish if I do.

-the risque double-edit: Already 2k words in. Looking like a hot little one-shot. I'll be posting it on AO3, as this is less crackfic and more actually erotic book-on-lady (and vice versa) action.

You heard me right. Seventh Year return to Hogwarts after the war, so all books and people are of age and consenting. Just go with it, okay? I'll post a link to it on this sub (though not this thread) when it's done. Current working title, /No Greater Lover of Books/.

I don't normally say this, but: don't like sexy crack-fics? Don't read. I just finished writing a book climaxing, and it only gets weirder from there.

I'm immagining in-universe Hermione discovering there are parallel universes in which their story is a fantasy books and her best friend is the main protagonist.

I would be too amused by her reaction.

***** The first chapter (3435 words) of a two chapter story called /No Greater Lover of Books/ is done. Just a little delayed by life in getting the second chapter done and everything cleaned up before posting. It's part crack, part erotica, part I-can't-believe-I-wrote-this.

I will be posting it soonish, with an announcement in [[/r/HPfanfiction]]. Sorry it's slow, but I swore not to post partially finished works and won't break that for this story. Glad you're...excited? I think people looking forward to this won't be disappointed.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** The creature stuff has never been my cup of tea.

Some of your examples recall specific fics to my mind, not sure if you meant them to (like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6685668/]] which isn't exactly showing signs of HHr.)

Both are time travel fics, but different from most of the established clich√©s.

You could also check out some Portkey or Livejournal stories, a lot of them are DH stories or post-Hogwarts

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

** linkffn(Patron by Starfox5): due to a mix of a Life Debt and the rather oppressive law in this AU, Harry is Hermione's "Patron" --- someone appointed to "guide" her into the wizarding world.

[[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire]], where, due to an interaction with a protective Charm Hermione had put on Harry, it is her name that comes out of the Goblet. Could be edited for length, and the ending is weak, but it's a unique view of how someone like Hermione --- not as athletic or fearless as Harry, but more disciplined and better at magic --- would handle the tasks. Also features a rare dynamic where Hermione is the action protagonist and Harry is the sidekick.

#+begin_quote
  Harry is pissed off from having to save everyone and everything all the time and decides to leave the wizarding world together with Hermione
#+end_quote

I think that this sort of premise tends to strip away an important aspect of Hermione's personality --- her drive to fix the world, whether the world wants it or not.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
