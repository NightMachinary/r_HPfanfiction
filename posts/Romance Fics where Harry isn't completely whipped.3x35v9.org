Seriously, who writes these stories?\\
Harry is scared shitless of Hr/G/D/Fleur, though he's likely the most powerful wizard in the story since Dumbledore.

Read a story where Harry joins Hogwarts in 6th year (I think) becomes Hermione's first friend, and she teaches him about relationships. First big confrontation, Harry gets hacked off at Sirius for training him for 15 years and then sending him to Hogwarts to waste his time and not let him fight the big battles.\\
Hermione immediately takes offence to "wastes his time", makes everything about her, and sets her foot down that he shouldn't be going and that love is the most important thing, etc etc.

I hate fics like this where an otherwise cold blooded ruthless BAMF becomes a complete kitten around the girl.

Are there any romance fics where this doesn't happen?

Sounds like linkffn(What We're Fighting For by James Spookie) and I agree that the moments of purposeless drama were mostly couched around the romantic subplots of the novel. IIRC there's also a lot of angst between Neville and Hannah Abbott that receives no exposition, but over all the story is better than most. You're absolutely right: these moments are silly, waste the reader's time, and make the characterisations suffer. That being said, the only alternative that most fanfiction authors seem to be capable of producing is a romance where everything is /always/ perfect and no one ever disagrees about anything.

I'd be curious to see some responses to this, too. Most of the superpowered Harry I've read tends to devolve into purposeless wish fulfillment or inane author tract, but I'd very much like to read a story with a powerful Harry that /also/ does romance very well.

*** Exactly. On one hand, we have Jeconais who makes Harry the wizarding ubermensch and is nearly flawless (Hope/Matryoshka Vignettes) and on the other hand, Harry frightens Dumbledore, Snape and TMR but is scared of 4th year Daphne Greengrass when he's around other women.\\
In a sense, linkffn(A Cadmean Victory by DarknessEnthroned) does a decent job of this.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  The savior of magical Britain is believed dead until he shows up to fight Death Eaters. Hermione Granger is a very lonely young woman without a single friend until she boards the Hogwarts Express for her sixth year, and her life take a major turn. SERIOUS WARNING. Rated M for a reason. DO NOT READ if easily offended.

*** I sound like a broken record and it is Fem!Harry but I think A Long Journey Home does powerful Harry and romance quite well (the Merlin arc).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9860311/1/A-Long-Journey-Home]]

Its not everyone's cup of tea and a lot of people don't like FemHarry but the romance between Harry and Merlin was pretty amazing.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** Thank you for pointing out Grow Young With Me. I very much enjoyed it. That is the best OC character I have seen written.\\
Of course VC is an old favorite, but a great story if anyone hasn't read it yet.

  HBP AU. It's hard enough being a teenager; add nefarious plots, the Dark Lord, and house rivalries into the mix. A story about enlightenment, darkness, growing up, and getting over yourself. Harry Potter/Daphne Greengrass

** I'd love some of those as well (I often think that most fanfiction writers must be women because most men don't like a damned puppy (at least the ones I know!), no: They want an equal, someone who'd argue with you if they thought you are wrong (and who would themselves also argue, rather than just say "yes, dear!" -.-)), as having a supposed powerful hero bossed around by his GF and being totally pussy whipped? Damned that just sucks (reminds me of my father - he's not totally whipped, but sometimes he says stupid shit like "That's not worth fighting for/arguing over!" and just does what she (my stepmother) wants...sometimes I wounder how my stepmother survived all those years she spent alone before meeting my dad (as a single mom no less!), with non one to boss around with no one as a handy-man to fix stuff in her home (she had a rented house all for herself and her daughter!))
