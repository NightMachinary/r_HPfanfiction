** Good luck in finding one. I did an extensive research about the Lord theme at some point, and haven't come up with anything worth to read. Most stories have Harry being Lord Potter at 11-15, where he starts to wreck havoc and bring Voldemort and Dumbledore down with his fortune and his political outplay as well as his extremely big magical core and thus magical power. A lot of stories are post OotP after Sirius death, when he starts to realize how fucked up his life was due to Dumbledore, goes to Gringotts, becomes Lord Potter (-Black (-Gryffindor-Slytherin)), and inherits the majority of gold in Magical Britain.

Asking for a good Lord Potter story, is like asking for a WBWL- story, where Dumbledore and James/Lily (in some occasions the other marauders too, although Sirius is often one of the "good" guys) aren't jerks and neglect him, and he has an arrogant twin brother/sister. Atleast there are a few exceptions in the WBWL genre, where Neville is the BWL (in that case Harry is often still abused by the Dursleys and Dumbledore is secretly stealing money from the Potter vaults to finance himself, Neville and the Order), or some of the better stories like "Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived" and "AntiHyphen"...

What I can see working, is a Lord Potter after the Battle of Hogwarts, trying to change the Wizarding World to the better, and even that is difficult to write, due to lack of ideas for a decent plot since Voldemort is dead.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] has some lord elements and is pretty good. Harry ends up in an AU with serious after falling through the veal when researching it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11191235/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin][Harry-Potter-and-the-Prince-of-Slytherin]] has lords in it, and is also quite good. Its a WBWL story, but a fairly good one that at least attempts to explain some of things that are usually unrealistic in them and some original plot elements. Especially in year 2.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The-Accidental-Animagus]] has some lord stuff in it IIRC. In it harry accidentally becomes an animagus during a Dursley triggered bout of accidental magic.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
