** That one was based on linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool by the mad mad reviewer), if you haven't followed up on Racke's recommendation then you should.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
