** linkffn(Forging the Sword)

One of the greatest examples of realistic character development, characterization, and trio interaction I've seen in the fandom. This story is, tied with On the Way to Greatness, is my all-time favorite fanfiction.

The point of divergence is in the Chamber of Secrets, where [[/spoiler][Harry has to choose to kill Ginny in order to destroy Tom Riddle's Diary]]. From that single point of AU, the canon plot and main characters gradually and subtly changes, with some truly excellent exploration of magic and character/magical growth.

**** If you're able to enjoy non-Harry-centric fics, then you definitely should check out linkffn(The Changeling by Annerb; Applied Cultural Anthropology, or). They are very well-written, well-characterized AU Slytherin fics, featuring Ginny and Hermione respectively, and are generally considered as must-reads on this subreddit. I normally tend to read Harry-centric stories, but that didn't stop me from really appreciating these quality works.

Here are a few excellent Harry-centric stories featuring canonical divergences, good development, and a more active, competent Harry: linkffn(The One He Feared; Harry Potter and the Forests of Valbonë; Dagger and Rose; Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge; What Lies Beneath)

Also, here are some Harry-centric AU fics that you may enjoy: linkffn(The Skitterleap; By the Divining Light; What You Leave Behind; The Other Side of the Coin)

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

this is what immediately pops up into my head when 'On The Way to Greatness' is mentioned, not because they're similar but because I read them both at the same time. Harry is in some ways (forced) to make tough tough decisions and be independant. You'll most probably like it. I did.

**** It's frustrating to read. The author has some skill in writing but for me, it comes across as if he's trying too hard to balance things. I.e Harry is stronger, but because he's a Slytherin a lot more people are against him. Also a lot more people are giving him shit and he doesn't react. And events progress pretty much like canon, even though things are wildly different.

[[/spoiler][Despite Harry remembering to use the mirror, the department of mysteries thing still happens. Because of Lucius fucking Malfoy. I shit you not, Harry gathers his "gryffindor" friends (including the Weasleys...) to go and rescue *Lucius Malfoy* from Voldemort. Because he thought that Lucius and I quote "was on Harry's side the whole time". Ludicrous horseshit.]]

One of the author's notes discussed this. For him, he wanted to explore how a Slytherin!Harry would have handled all the canon events: how would Slytherin!Harry take on the Chamber of Secrets and the Basilisk, how would he and why would he go to the Department of Mysteries and so on.

Like what the fuck, he even says later that Lucius was like a father to him? But he still participated in the ressurection ritual? Not fatherly behavior at all son.

The story was tolerable up until DoM. But that whole thing was a debacle, writing-wise.
