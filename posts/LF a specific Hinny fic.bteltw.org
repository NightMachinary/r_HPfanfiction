:END:
So it was like Harry took Ginny to the Yule Ball bc she was his only friend- I think both Hermione and Ron left him after the Goblet incident and he didn't forgive them but I'm not 100% on that- and they started dating and such.

And Hermione was obsessively in love with Harry and learned Dark Arts and went mad from it, and Ron was trying to be a good friend to her but she just hated on him the entire time.

Harry and Ginny ran the DA with help from other people (Daphne Greengrass was one) and later Astoria Greengrass took down Malfoy bc she was in love with him before but he sucks

They and some other people were also known as "Downfall" a mysterious vigilante who killed Death Eaters

And Harry brought Lily back to life as a 16 year old

And they and the DA raided Gringotts and took over, and that's where the final battle was.

Oh yeah, Harry and Ginny were also the MoD, both of them, but Death as a character was never mentioned.


** That's “Aspiration” by megamatt.

I used to like it, but now think it's a horrible piece with tons of grammar and spelling errors.

*** It's still probably MegaMatt's best work. I like part of the premise (a decreased reliance on Hermione), but heavily dislike the excessive bashing/hypocrisy of the main character.

**** MegaMatt doesn't actually seem to like anything about Harry Potter other than Harry himself.

******* I agree completely. They're just mindless sex objects and that's not ok.

It makes the stories boring and isn't real plot.

** For anyone else looking for it. linkffn(Aspirations). It's probably MegaMatt09s best work.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
