Legit curious, thanks in advance. :)


** I'd say Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time for plot

The Rise of a Dark Lord and Again and Again for Slytherin!Harry

Saving Connor for au

The Lie I've Lived for a different spin on the plot without going too au

And Full Circle for its general crackiness.

Crossovers:

Finding Home universe for plot and gorgeous writing. (Avengers)

Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous for best crack fic I've ever read. (Lord of the Rings)

Percy Jackson and the world of magic for being one of the first fanfic I've ever liked (Old feelings die hard)( Not harry-centric, crossover with Percy Jackson.)

A New World to Conquer, liked the Slytherin!Harry in the world of Westeros (Game of Thrones)

Itachi, Is That A Baby? not really many hp/naruto crossovers I found interesting, but I'd consider this one the best one of the lot.

  I DO NOT OWN THIS STORY. This story was removed due to some reasons and its one of my favourite stories. So i thought i should share with everyone. One chapter a day Reposted. Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

** Out of my list of completed and like, non-ship focused fics... I would say linkao3(189189; 5103614) just because of how much I come back to them both. They both engage me so much, both as coming-of-age stories and for the magical world-building.

The Harry in the latter might as well be an OC, but for me the writer was absolutely brilliant to create a character-development-focused (or a tragically static character, rather) story that uses "self-transfiguration."

  In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. But while Harry deliberately hides his growing skills, Minerva worries more and more about the mysterious, brilliant student writing to her who may be venturing into dangerous magical territory.

** I may get a lot of hate for saying this one since I know that Snape is one of the least favorite characters on this sub but "A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles", which is a Snape biography from his birth to his death, is my favorite one. It was loyal to the canon (or what was canon in 2012 anyway) and it could really stand as a novel on its own. The author does a great job reintroducing us to a world that we are familiar with so much so that even people that haven't read the original series know what they are talking about yet it doesn't feel like rereading the novels because Snape's perspective is very different from Harry's. Also I like the fact that all the scenes in the original series that make you think "wow Snape is such a piece of shit" are twisted so that they naturally make you think "I guess he has a point too". You can clearly see that he is not a nice person but you remain sympathetic to him as well (just like the 2019 "The Joker" movie made us sympathetic to the Joker despite clearly seeing he was an unstable lunatic with murderous intentions).

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
