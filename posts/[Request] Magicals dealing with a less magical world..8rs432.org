Either magic grows gradually weaker or it flat out disappears one day.

No Mugglewanking though. I dolike it, but I'm looking for a magical focus.


** That one shot where the goodies agree to leave Magical Britain but take the heart of hogwarts with them. I totally forget the name.

** The Firebird Trilogy linkffn(The Firebird's Son: Book 1 of the Firebird Trilogy)

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
