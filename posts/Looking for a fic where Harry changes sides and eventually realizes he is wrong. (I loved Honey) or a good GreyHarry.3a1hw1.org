** I'm writing a story that fits this description (which gives me hope that someone other than [[/u/CrucioCup]] will read it lol) but it's far from readable at this point. I'll be sure to promote it here if I get far enough. The beginning and ending are all planned out, it's just that darned middle!

There is a lamentable dearth of really good grey!Harry that isn't all about how evil Dumbledore is or whatever. It just isn't plausible that impressionable young Harry would turn against him so easily. The challenge is making it happen without twisting Dumbledore's character or making Harry super smart for no reason. Fortunately, I believe Voldemort is up to the challenge!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10267302/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Dark-s-Rise][HP & the Dark's Rise]] (W: 206,192; Complete) fits the first request perfectly but I will not wager on its overall quality.

Can you give some definition restrictions to “Grey”?

*** In my headcannon, Grey is just neutral, not caring for either side, ranging from noncombatants that just want to be left alone, to the "Some men just want to watch the world burn." types.

** Could you link the story you're talking about? Never heard of a HP fanfic called Honey. I agree that HP & the Dark's Rise fits the bill.
