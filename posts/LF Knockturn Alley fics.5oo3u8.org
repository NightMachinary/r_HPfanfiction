I just finished reading The Pureblood Pretense linkffn(7613196), and I really liked the Knockturn Alley dynamics. Basically, the whole slumming it and dodgy underground dealings thing. So, does anyone know any fics that focus on Knockturn Alley?


** [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][Out of the Night]] - Very AU fic about Harry hiding in Knockturn Alley. Interesting take on wizarding culture and dark magic. Sadly dead.

  Growing up in such an infamous place hadn't been easy, but Earl made it. The same couldn't be said for all of the children that grew up there, however. One-Shot.
