Is Dumbledore really Harry's magical Guardian or truly just his school's headmaster?


** The entire concept of magical guardians is purely fanon.

** "Magical Guardian" is a pure fanon concept, and the Magical World recognize the authority of Muggle guardians (which is why Harry had to ask Vernon to sign his Hogsmead permission).

Dumbledore also doesn't have any authority over Harry during the summer. As the Headmaster of Hogwarts, he can refuses to let Harry stay there during the Holidays, but that's all. In canon, he only "asked" people to leave Harry with the Dursley for at least 4 weeks, but there was nothing he could (legally) have done if Harry had ignored his advices and went somewhere else.

** No. In canon he only represents underage Harry on magical legal matters such as making arrangements for his foster home, defending Harry during hearing and dealing with Sirius's will. If anything, he acts more like a magical social worker.
