Hello! I just read [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15275916][there will come a time, you'll see]] that's a lovely story that focuses on Harry, Hermione and Ron's friendship by having Harry regress to his younger self when Ron and Hermione are in their 20s. It shows their love for each other and captures the character's voices perfectly.

​

Are there any other stories you could rec me that focus on these three being lovely together? Preferably post-books, but I'll read whatever, and OT3 if that's what you have.

​


** I just read that and loved it. I read the other HP story by that author as well and loved it. It had wonderful trio dynamics. Did you read that?

This series has lots of sweet Harry/Ron/Hermione moments. The focus is on their kids but also about their relationship with one another. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/13075]]

  “Nearly there,” Hermione is telling him softly. “You've done it, Harry, you've done so well. We're nearly there, and then you can rest.”“Hell, you can check out now if you'd like, mate,” says Ron, with a lightness he doesn't really feel. He's counting Harry's heartbeats, matching his breaths, compiling this proof that Harry came back alive because it's so much a miracle Ron almost can't believe it. “I'll carry you to the castle like a proper knight, and everyone will be too impressed with your victory to take the piss out of you.”“Ron, honestly,” says Hermione. Harry's shoulders shake, the ghost of a laugh, and then the woods don't seem quite as dark.

  Sirius is dead, but Harry's doing alright: between a brand new Quidditch Captaincy, private lessons with Dumbledore, and increasing suspicions about Draco Malfoy, he's got enough to keep him busy. And if an uncomfortable encounter with a classmate ends up leaving him with another challenge to face and even more secrets to keep, well...he's still fine.Really. He is.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/137248]]) is one of the best fics I've read that shows the Trio's relationship (and their developing romantic relationship as well). I found the emotions really shone through in the writing - the aftermath of the battle, the hesitancy of a changing relationship - it's well done. I thought it captured the characters well and there are some very sweet moments.

A devastating attack on Hogwarts leaves Harry trying to navigate a foreign Muggle world where his life is a fantasy, if a lucrative one. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione must help Harry's Muggle counterpart pass himself off as the real Boy Who Lived.
