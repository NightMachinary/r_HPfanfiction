:END:
I remember reading a fanfiction where Harry time travels using "noodling" ends up sometime in the past and dumbles seems slightly insane, but I sadly can't seem to find it. I think he time traveled using zucchini noodling but I can't be completely sure. Many thanks if you can find it.

Edit: I've found it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23478781?view_full_work=true]]
