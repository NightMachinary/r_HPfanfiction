  When Harry and Ginny broke up, they thought they were each doing what was right for the other But is it possible for them to be "just friends", especially when it seems like someone keeps trying to kill them? Mature sexual themes.

** linkffn(Hail Odysseus by Brennus)

If you distill the "Harry & Ginny are the only characters I like" feeling enough, you get this story. Every other character is bashed to oblivion (with a few exceptions) and are shown to be worthless scumbags. There is violence and sex aplenty (nothing /too/ graphic). Despite all this, or maybe because of it, I found the story to be extremely enjoyable. I've read it three times in as many years.

Basically the formula is this: Take one part Tarantino movie, one part Natural Born Killers, add one part hopeless romantic author and stir by a rabid Harry/Ginny shipper. And you get the above.
