I been looks from some Of the fanfic. But it was purge from most sites. The best one I read was jiml9 and the book from the future where the weasley family read the books.


** I like [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/977403][Dramatic Reading]], it is very well written, but there is only one and half year of the Harry's schooling.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1779118][Hogwarts reads the books by spirithorse16]] has more years covered, but it is not that well written. It is just text of JKR books slightly commented, not the real stuff as the other one.

** I really wish there was a good fic that had the Marauders (and Lilly and Snape) reading the books, I've found a few but it seems none ever get too far, it'd be so cool in my opinion seeing how the characters react to future events, especially Snape and his future as it's easily the most interesting out of all those characters that remained alive and were in the books

** Oh man, I'm in the same boat! There was a really good series of them on ffn by someone with pencil in their username. It got deleted somewhere during fourth year and I was really upset.

**** Yeah. And the worst part was that there was actual plot development and a hopeful future! It started halfway through fifth year and Sirius went free and Snape was getting yelled at for calling Hermione and idiot! I was upset.
