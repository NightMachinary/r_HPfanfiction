im mostly imagining Harry and Bellatrix are stranded in a "Limbo" like universe or dimension and struggle to escape. During their time there and the circumstances (loss of sense of time and the time they spend together already) they more or less begin to be attracted to the other. It should result in Sex...in Bellatrix case i can imagine it would be reverse rape, although Harry would give in at some point. Or they may have some sort of Love-Hate relationship.

It doesnt have to involve Harry and Bellatrix but can also be other Persons. it also doesnt have to include a Universe or dimensional thing, as long as the content above happens

***** Well, that's bullshit. You (or anyone else) can't simply say, this is normal rape and that isn't rape is rape and really disgusting. Wheter it's carried out by a male or female it makes no difference. So, my rant is at an end. ;) Thank you for explaining that phrase tough.

****** it is a category like lolicon or (straight)shotacon. Shota means Boylove, but while the Word "Shota" collect homosexual content, Straight Shota differs in older Woman with Younger Man/boys. If you ask for Rape fictions you get thousands of it with males rape females, but if you ask for reverse rape...you get maybe a few Dozens of it

  In the aftermath of the Final battle a misplaced spell sends HP and Bellatrix to an alternative world. It holds everything each of them have lost to the war and yet they find themselves inexorably drawn back to each other. HPBella done right.
