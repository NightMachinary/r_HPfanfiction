** Well, one thing would be that you seem to have invented the Amnesia spell instead of using Obliviate. Also some grammar mistakes like were instead of where, etc.

*** Amnesia is the earlier draft of the same spell, used in the 2nd book. Rowling just forgot that she already made a spell that can make people forget. In my headcanon, Amnesia whipes parts of memory, while Obliviate allows to change things. And I will try to clean up the grammar mistakes. Thanks!

EDIT: Scrap what I said earlier, Amnesia is only in the movie. I feel like a pleb now.

** First thing - you need a beta. I don't know if it is just a mobile issue, but there's all sorts of formatting issues. Some paragraphs don't have the right spacing and there is dialogue nested within paragraphs. Go back and edit it so there's a double space between paragraphs. Right now, it's pretty difficult to read just based on the formatting.

*** I actually have a beta, and the formatting /was/ pretty well, but ff.net does not allow PDF upload, and the PDF to .odt converter mangled the whole thing. Thank you though!

**** With Fanfiction.net, don't upload with pdf. It will mess with your formatting every time. Either put it in with a word processor or use the DocX program. People will literally walk away from fics just because they don't look pretty. Good luck!!!! ðŸ˜Š

***** Is the formatting really that bad? I knew it isn't perfectly beautiful, but I thought it okay.

****** No, it's not terrible. I looked at it on my phone first and it was not great so I commented.. But then I used my pc and it was better, so it may have been a mobile issue.

**** Uploading with a pdf. Bold!

Once you can upload it in a better format, I can give a better opinion on it. Right now, it's just kinda difficult

***** I do everything with LaTex, so pdf is the easiest for me. Could I pm you the original pdf? That would be more pleasant to read I hope.

****** What if you rendered to HTML ([[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Export_To_Other_Formats#Convert_to_HTML]]), then uploaded that? Or, is that what you ended up doing?

** There are some grammar mistakes. Also you should try to include british colloquial isms because seeing mom really throws me off. I read most these stories with Sirius black talking as Gary Oldman so hearing him say mom instead of mum throws the reader off. I like your premise but there are some holes in your plot already unless you wish to resolve them later. I can understand how they put Sirius away without a trial but if the ministry or Dumbledore found Hagrid passed even though you basically memory charmed him. They would immediately suspect Sirius to know where harry the boy who lived is and they would stuff veritiserum down him until he talked. The only way this works is if Dumbledore believed harry fulfilled the prophecy and is now dead. But in your story Sirius doesn't transfigure anything into a fake body of Harry. Also another hole could be when you are knocked out I believe your active magic would fail revealing Harry. Even if it doesn't, Azkaban is a high security prison containing a part of the population that isn't affected by dementors on a daily or close basis. Now assuming from canon Sirius Black was the first ever to escape as usually un-escapable prison that means they have really tight security that would reveal high end concealment charms. Unless you can phrase it as a rare Black family hiding charm. The only thing is I think it might be dangerous to put baby harry in such a charm anyways. I assuming harry is attached to Sirius black and not in some magical subspace that might keep harry alive or safe. Other than that good luck. Starting to write can be unnerving but stay strong and enjoy. I hope you don't take my review negatively, it's just a few things I noticed that would bother me as a reader.

*** Thank you so, so much for the thorough review! I'll try to keep it British, bit because I am not even a native English speaker it will be hard to accomplish. Many of the things you mentioned are indeed going to clean up as the story goes along. Like the thing with Hagrid for example.

My version of Azkaban is basically... pretty complicated. It will be all explained over the course of the story though.
