I did this two times before. Sit down with coffee and just write whatever jumps to mind, not thinking about any loopholes or whatnot, just write and write and write. Thats how you write 11600 words a day.

Is it any good? The hell if I know. I'm way too exhausted to be the judge of that. I just enjoy the feeling of sore fingers, twitchy tendons and an emptied head.

You decide. This is "Operation Loop" for you: [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oDcYOevMl6_s5ihSEoi0P25nZjiQ4InkRoV7b63xWlc/edit?usp=sharing]]

For those of you who are undecided about looking at this story: It features Super!Harry who travels back in time to squish Voldemort before his reign of terror gets started a second time. It's bash-free.

**** Super!Harry is a tag I've seen around; it's basically used to indicate when the Harry Potter of a particular story has exceptional magical powers and blows past challenges with ease.

Nothing comes to mind for fic recommendations, though...sorry.

...Wait, I thought of something. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot][Barefoot by Zaxaramas?]]

It's got a pretty powerful Harry, he learns by copying spell memories from wands he touches to become a powerful wizard really quickly.

** Nice. I quite like the ruthless, pragmatic Hermione in the future setting. A horcrux in orbit? That's the stuff of nightmares.

*** As so many people asked me that by now, I think I will, after I finished some more chapters and figured out where to go with it.

Bloodmoon and Salem Settlement are as hard to write as ever, so why not?

** If this is you writing with a hangover, what is your writing like when you're fully sober and /not/ hungover?!

I would totally read something like this once you polish it up!
