Tl/dr: A story where Lily offends a faerie and Harry is a changeling.

Lily Potter was a muggleborn, despite her intelligence one could not expect her to know the nuances of the new world she inhabited. As such, none could blame her for offending a faerie.

The Fae had no treaty with the wizards and witches. They did not bow to the Ministries or ICW and they very rarely followed the Statute of Secrecy (mostly for fun or on a whim). They were a mysterious, potentially deadly force. Very quick (and very easy) to offend, with only the purebloods, and those raised in the magical world, with any ideas on how to navigate their complicated and finicky social norms.

Lily only learned the basics AFTER her betrothal to James, by then she'd already desecrated a faerie ring...

She'd lashed out as a teen, obviously unaware of what it was (as she stomped through the Forbidden Forest). Far more focused on her best friend destroying their friendship and just lashing out at the shrubbery with kicks and curses.

The Unseelie she offended barely stayed her hands from inflicting horrific illness on the impertinent child, taken by her pretty hair and gorgeous eyes. Thus a nasty, but not uncommon plan took place.

And years later, as predicted, the Spriggan she sent brought back an adorable baby wizard with his mummy's gorgeous eyes. A new toy for the court, raised lovingly alongside the other faeries.

What they left in his place was a doll, a being of sticks and straw glamoured to look like the stolen child. A fetch. Not a living being, and not a very long-lived replacement.

The Dark Lords spell failed to kill the animated object, but the Dursley's mistreatment of it hastened the already short-lived beings early demise. The Wizarding World left to mourn.

Meanwhile, little Harry was raised as a servant to the court, until an owl from the human world blundered into his home with a familiar letter and an iron bracelet.

The boy, somewhat proficient in the magic of the Fae (and very much NOT a human anymore) allowed to attend Hogwarts on a whim...


** Ooh, sounds interesting. Its rare for HP fics to do a fair representation of The Gentry.

I should say that the one that Lily disturbed is unusually mild for a Scottish fairy, and also that spriggans are particular to Cornwall just as pixies are

** I don't like the servant part cause that sound like that's lowkey slavery

*** Having sensed that there was something special about the child (regarding his destiny), Harry is raised by one of the Fae queens as her own (subplot is the bickering/potential conflicts with deposed queens trying to retake the throne from his mother).

He has a very orange and blue mentality, like a fae's, but has human intrigue, hence his decision to go to Hogwarts.

Once there, Dumbledore and the other professors try to, essentially, teach him humanity ('red versus blue' thinking), so he can at least consciously understand it than "becoming" human.

They have to step in because he very often tries to resort to "fae justice"/meets out cruel (by human standards) punishment to slights on him.

It's also embarrassing because various fae try to meet him and 'blow his cover' among his classmates.

Of course, a few of the more superstitious purebloods end up recognizing something is "off" about him, and they decide to steer clear (like the Weasleys, though Ginny being fascinated with him complicates matters).

If the Triwizard goes down in this butterflied universe, Fleur ends up recognizing him immediately: Her surname 'Of the Court' is very literal, as she's part of a lower-in-rank family in the fae caste system. They're also viewed with general disdain because her grandmother married a human, despite their heritage.

It also makes her very nervous, as she knows of him and how he could obliterate her family in a heartbeat, if slighted (literally: He could have them /all/ put to sword).

Her maternal family is pressuring her to pursue him: Marrying into the highest parts of fae royalty would wipe out any stigma.

Fortunately, he seems to have taken a brotherly shine to Gabrielle, albeit his lessons in fae politics/behaviour do frighten her mother and father.

*** That's often what happened, faeries often stole babies as revenge against the parents. Hence why Harry was sent some iron
