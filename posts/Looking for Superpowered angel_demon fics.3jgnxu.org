*** I'll definitely try that one after I have read some of the stuff from Dresden files, since the story is quite confusing!

**** You actually don't need to know anything about the Dresden files to read this. When I first read it I knew absolutely nothing about the books but I absolutely enjoyed it.

** My one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/13/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Strange Aeons]] might qualify. HP/Lovecraft crossover.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957424/1/Illusions-of-Grandeur][Illusions of Grandeur]] meets your specs. I don't know if you like Supernatural, but it's a crossover with the show. Pretty funny. Also, it's completed with a WIP sequel.
