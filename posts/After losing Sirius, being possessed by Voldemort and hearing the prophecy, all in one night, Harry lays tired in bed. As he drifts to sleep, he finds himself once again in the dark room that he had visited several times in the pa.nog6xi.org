In fact he is kneeling while sobbing in front of two figures, a man and a woman, whose faces are hidden by shadows.

"I... I... am sorry my lord. If it wasn't for Harry Potter..." he cries

"Your quarrel with the boy is not our concern," the man interrupts him.

"You have failed us again, Tom," the woman adds.

"I beg you, my lord, my lady... give me another chance... I'll prove to you..."

"We have given enough chances to you, Tom, only for you to ruin them with your foolish pursuit of the Potter boy. We have given you all the help, we have even had Fudge help you through out the year and you messed it up. Now we lost a key person in the Ministry."

"Please... please... one more chance... I beg you."

"Don't you understand Tom that the Aurors are losing their patience and the more we delay operation Rotfang, the more money we're losing? I'm sorry Tom, this is the end..."

"Please... no... I'll do anything..."

"Dear," suggests the woman, "with him revealing tonight, the Wizengamot will give the Aurors extraordinary powers so I suppose all is not lost. Maybe he deserves another chance."

"You might be right, dear. This is your lucky day, after all, Tom."

"Thank you, Mrs. Granger, thank you, Mr. Granger. You are so very generous," Voldemort says as he bows to kiss the woman's feet and then the man's.

"Just don't mess up again Tom. Don't forget that operation Rotfang has to keep going," the man threatens as the two people leave Voldemort behind, still on his knees.

**** - What does that make Hermione? A sleeper agent maybe?
- Was she the one that influenced Harry to wanting to be an auror?
- Is she even a kid or an adult witch under disguise or a magical creation even?
- What else did she do other than slowly indoctrinating Harry to her masters ways?
- Why didnt she kill Luna in Department of Mysteries Fiasco even though Luna clearly knew too much?

****** Hmm... Maybe

- Hermione is indeed a sleeper agent planted to Hogwarts in order to influence youth of magical society.
- She did influence Harry to wanting to be an auror on the off chance he won.
- She is a magical construct created from dead flesh of muggleborn children Grangers experimented on in order to create Heliophats.
- She feeds Dumbledore tartaric acid through Lemondrops in order to make him senile so he will be at most a figure head.
- She developed a crush on Harry and feared she will loose his friendship if he ever learned she killed the Lovegood spawn, directly going against her masters orders for the first time. She was disposed that summer because of her defiance and a New Hermione, almost identical but more Loyal to the cause of Rotfang conspiracy took her place in the sixth year.

******** Heliopaths are said to be fire spirits in the wiki...

Maybe we have already saw the Heliopaths. Maybe Crabble only used a simple incendio on the Room of requirements, creating a perfect habitat for Heliopaths. New Hermione saw this as a chance for field test of the creatures and discreetly released the batch she was carying on her beaded bag. Heliopaths grew fast and were able to destroy the diadem.

She lied when she said it was fiendfire, there is no such thing as fiendfire she made it up as a cover story. Heliopaths were later discarded as a failure since their ability to consume souls were unknown. A fake incantation for fiendfire was fabricated and a few phrases about it was sprinkled on rare books in order to authenticise it.

** "Harry, get up, hurry up, we don't have time to waste"

In front of his bed, there was a little red owl, which slowly took the form of a tired Hermione Granger.

"Hermione? What are you doing here?" Harry stood up almost instantly, only feeling a slight headache. "Besides, what are you talking about?"

Hermione took him by the shoulders, and a crackle echoed in Harry's ears as well as a powerful explosion coming from the house. It took him a moment to get his bearings, until he could see the Dursleys' home engulfed in a ball of crisp, black flames.

"Oh fuck, I was just in time." The tired girl fell to her knees for a moment, earning a confused and concerned look from Harry. "Harry ... There are things I haven't told you about myself, and you have to know, right now."

"Are you talking about 'Rotfang'?" The girl opened her eyes, and she looked at Harry in surprise. "There's a lot I haven't told you about myself either, Hermione, but for now, we must go to one of the hidden safe houses in London. How well you said, there is no time yo waste"

** This is AMAZING!!!

Mildly reminds me of the ending of linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/156561][Harry Potter and the Trademark Dispute]]), an insane omniverse crossover where, after Voldemort screws with a... happy... dream, Harry unleashes Hermione, resulting in Voldemort getting sued by what amounts to the union of supervillains over calling himself a Dark Lord without their permission. Ending involves Lex Luthor, who is natch one of the bigwigs, handing over the paperwork acknowledging that they will stay out of the British Isles for the next 100 years because Hermione won what amounts to a bet and so now has their blessing to conquer all of Britain without their interference or further involvement.
