Hey there! First tile poster, long time lurker here. But first thing first, you guys are amazing, had to get that off my chest.

So for the fics I'm looking for: The students with muggle ties have a life during the summer. You know: having a drink, going to parties, watching movies, ... The 'pure blood' raised can discover that side of their friends life or not appear at all, doesn't really matter. I remember some fics that touched that trope (one with Harry tattooing runes on himself and smoking pots with Dobby, might be runic animagi? Can't remember it was so long ago, there's the classic Behind Blue Eyes which I quite liked but never managed to finish, and the last I remember had Harry and Hermione finding each other during a party in London on a parking lot)

I don't think I've seen this request before but I could be wrong ^{^} Cheers

** Muggle culture plays a minor role in my story "Patron", mainly by showing movies at Hogwarts and the purebloods going out in Muggle London during the war, because that's much safer for them.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
