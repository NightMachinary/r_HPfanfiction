So far the FB part of the fandom seems rather disconnected from the main fandom; I see very few FB recs on this sub. For my part, one reason of this is because I don't really have any idea where to start looking for these fanfics, and I don't really care to start navigating ao3's search index of 5k+ fanfics.

One story I /have/ read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12248275/1/The-Mystery-of-the-Frozen-Heart][The Mystery of the Frozen Heart]] by Necroposter. It is centred around Celestia Prewett, who is looking for an artefact to heal her dying husband. There's two timelines - one set during the time Newt's in Hogwarts, featuring Leta Lestrange, Celestia and a bunch of Slytherins. The second timeline is in the future in America, also featuring Tina, Graves and Picquery. One thing I like about this story is that it humanises Grindelwald's followers and shows why his ideology is attractive to perfectly normal people. It's a WiP that updates in spurts.

I want similar plotty recs, though I'd also like good character studies or slice of life fics featuring Newt and his friends. No Credence romance, please. I don't care for it.


** Harry and Newt travel the world and study magical creatures. Quite an interesting look on creatures and different magical cultures. But maybe not for everyone. Slash, obviously. Linkffn(against my nature by Araceil)

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

** Oh, and Relationship Counselling - linkao3(9235586) - is a crack oneshot that is about Grindelwald demanding a desperate captive Graves to figure out a way to seduce Dumbledore back. It's hilarious.
