I've been trying to find it for a week now and still haven't found it, so maybe you guys might have an idea and better luck than me if you have a clue. It basically takes place after Harry's name comes out of the cup and it reveals that there was a soul bond between Harry and Hermione and Harry is the heir to the Gryffindor line

Thanks in advance


** Sorry you might need to be more specific

*** Harry basically becomes emancipated along with Hermione because of a soul bond between them and apparently they're married because of it and the Lord and Lady Gryffindor?
