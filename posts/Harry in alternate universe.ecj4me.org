:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
All i remember is that there were two Harrys, and the one from canon was standing in front Order with Dumbledore and telling them about his dimension and how to defend Voldemort. Chapters showed thoughts of Remus, Sirius, Lily and maybe others about “new Harry” (how skinny and ill he looked compared to their Harry) Also remember that it included Pensieve, and order watched Harry's memories ( certain that he showed how he, Ron and Hermione became “Golden Trio” (Troll in the toilet))

Please tell me if you know this fic and thank you!!!


** Not sure if this is the one as it'd been awhile since I've read it, but I remember that Elsewhere but not Elsewhen had a scene where people were comparing the Canon!Harry's less than healthy appearance compared to the AU!Harry.

**** In that case good luck, you're gonna need it. There are SO many "dimensional travel" fics out there. Needle in a haystack springs to mind.

#+begin_quote
  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?
