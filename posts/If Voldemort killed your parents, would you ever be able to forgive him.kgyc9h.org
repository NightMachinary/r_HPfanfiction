** So Harry/your Harry never knew his parents. Think of the life he was robbed because of it. In DH canon he thinks about how he could have had siblings, friends over... I mean he wouldn't have been left with the Dursleys. He wouldn't feel so alone in the world particularly after Sirius and Dumbledore die. He wouldn't have needed Molly/Arthur to be substitute parents. Yes Harry wound up with all these amazing friends and people who care about him but it's not the same.

** To be fair, I could see it. If it's in her character not to care, it's only logical. But especially if she's more focused on survival ; if he's sane and not going after her or her friends, why would she creates her own demise ? Even insane, Voldemort is up there with Dumbledore, in term of danger. Harry would have no chance against a sane one before her/his maturity, wouldn't s/he? Even if she wants revenge, as long as no one is in danger, she'd probably wait. And in the meantime, well, she could forgive or forget. (And i mean, look at Neville in canon : he's in quite the same situation and he does nothing until the very end. If Harry isn't pushed into the early adventures, he could too lead a normal life until he has to take a stand)

Also, I would like to say that I wouldn't find such a character unlikable just based on that. Especially if the character is actually apathetic etc. New outlook are always interesting!

** I probably wouldn't. However a forgiving Harry is a very in-character Harry. He forgives the Dursleys and all it takes is for him is for Dudley to say a few kind words and for Vernon to make an awkward attempt at farewell. He forgives Draco and all it takes for him is to take some pity in the latter in the RoR. He forgives Snape and all it takes is for him to find out that Snape was in love with his mother. Hell he even offers Voldemort a chance at redemption before the final duel. So a forgiving Harry is very in-character.

*** I disagree he forgives duddly because deep down he understands Duddly was only acting like that because of his parents.

he forgives snape because snape helped him out a ton.

I think Harry was mocking voldemort

** If they were killed when I was a baby, before I had a chance to get to know them at all, I probably wouldn't give a shit. My ability to feel emotional connections to real people has been mostly worn away over the years thanks to a variety of mental health problems and childhood trauma. Most people are just distractions from my coping mechanisms now.

A Harry with no hero complex, who's too detached to care, sounds interesting. I'd read the shit out of it as long as the pairings aren't too creepy (i.e. Harry/Death Eater, Harry/Voldemort, Harry/someone from his parents' generation).

** I would find such a character to be unlikeable. Unrealistic, too, since orphaned children tend to fixate on parents, but you can argue that perhaps your genderbent Harry reacts differently, okay. But unlikeable, yes. And other people should also find that unlikeable because someone who doesn't CARE that someone flat out MURDERED her family is....not endearing.

**** Pretty much. So I can see why a harry who grew up with being told his (or in your case her) parents where drunks and all the other negative stuff the Dursleys said wouldnt be attached to their parents or mad at the dark Lord. I could see them being mad at them being made an orphan and making them live with the Dursleys but that's not all Voldy's fault. Harry should have been raised by Sirius but the ministry didnt give him a trial so it could be quite easy for harry to put the blame for him being with the Dursleys on the ministry and not Voldemort.

Honestly I dont mind harry forgiving the dark Lord as long as it makes sense for that character to forgive Voldy.

#+begin_quote
  When Harry fails to keep his anger at bay and Voldemort possesses his mind, the events that follow lead him down a long road to realizing the world isn't as black and white as it seems. Chaos, hilarity, and tragedy ensue with a Dark Lord being honest all the time, a rival becoming something else, and a world demanding to be saved. Featuring frightened Death Eaters, deep conversations with a monster, Prueblood traditions being ridiculous, and the fight to do the right thing with no true options. Harry's life just gets more and more bizarre with each passing moment. ~~~Or, the one where Harry's life gets split in half, and he has to figure out how to bring it back together.

** As an apathetic person, no. And the proof of his sanity would just make her angry because if Voldy is capable of being sane and not wanting to murder her, then why did he kill her family all those years ago. If she were somewhat sociopathic or unemotional ig she still wouldn't *forgive* him, and would probably also be a very angry person in general and he Is the root of all of her problems. Abused children often fixate on their families, see Tom finding and killing his only relatives and starting a eugenics movement, Sirius' obsession with his family and how much he talks about them, so your character would have no reason to Dislike her parents and no way to justify Voldemort's actions unless she acted very OOC and is so different than them that she'd have reason to murder her own parents
