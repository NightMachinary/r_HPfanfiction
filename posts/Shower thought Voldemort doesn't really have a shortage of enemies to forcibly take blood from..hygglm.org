Peter: Hey you! Random guy walking down the street!

Random guy: What? Who are you???

Peter: Do you hate V-

Random guy: Eeeek! Of course, I hate You-Know-Who! He's a mass murderer!

Peter: /slices guy's hand open/ Great! I'll just forcibly take some of your blood for our dark ritual. Thanks for helping resurrect Voldemort!


** This isn't a shower thought, Voldemort actually explicitly says Wormtail pointed this out back when he was planning this before the world cup

*** Voldemort's flair for theatrics likely had something to do with that as well.

After all, Harry was the one who had deprived him of his body: there was no way to restore it more poetic than using Harry's blood to that purpose.

I bet that any practical benefits occurred to Voldemort only /after/ he had already decided on using Harry in the ritual.

** u/vlaaivlaai:
#+begin_quote
  “B-blood of the enemy ... forcibly taken ... you will ... resurrect your foe.”
#+end_quote

It says "Blood of *the* enemy," not "blood of *an* enemy."

Giving sacrifices that are "too easy" and cheat generally fires back in myths, so if I was Voldemort, I wouldn't fuck with it.

And only an equal can be a true enemy, so together with the prophecy... I wouldn't risk it, if I was Tommy boy.

*** The Riddle House:

#+begin_quote
  “It could be done without Harry Potter, My Lord.”

  “I could use another wizard,” said the cold voice softly, “that is true. . . .”
#+end_quote

The Death Eaters:

#+begin_quote
  Wormtail would have had me use any wizard, would you not, Wormtail? Any wizard who had hated me . . . as so many of them still do. But I knew the one I must use, if I was to rise again, more powerful than I had been when I had fallen. I wanted Harry Potter's blood.I wanted the blood of the one who had stripped me of power thirteen years ago . . . for the lingering protection his mother once gave him would then reside in my veins too. . . .

**** Well, with the second quote it shows it's a mix of "need" and "must"

I think the facthat he /wants/ to use Harry, kind of makes it a /need/, because magic - but at that point I admit that this is my own personal interpretation, and can't be surmised directly and irrefutably from canon.

*** It also says "flesh of /the/ servant"... yet Voldemort hadn't had any issue with using /Wormtail/'s hand, despite Pettigrew being one of his least loyal and least useful Death Eaters.

The ritual doesn't appear to be all that picky. If it had been, Voldemort would probably order Crouch Jr to immediately join them after Harry's been portkeyed to the graveyard, then used /his/ sacrifice.

**** Well, the ritual doesn't seem to actually work all that well, considering he didn't even get a nose. And with the frequent references to his high voice, what else is he missing? Maybe he shouldn't have skimped on the servant part and tried to get away with using Peter. Bellatrix would have been better.

***** Eh, I consider the pale skin, red eyes, and noseless face a consequence of all sorts of dark rituals and the horcruxes. Some people joking say it's a consequence of the Weasley Twins' snowballs to Quirrel's turbin.

During Dumbledore's "lessons" with Harry, it shows Voldemort when he came to Dumbledore for a job and his appearance has changed considerably.

***** Sure, but it was /unintentional/ rule lawyering, which was why the cannon ending was so unsatisfying. The golden trio essentially just stumbled into a situation which worked out in their favor and didn't find out until after the fact.
