Fred and George get sorted into Slytherin House, not because of any hidden evil or anything but because of how cunning and ambitious they are. Of course the other Slytherins hate them at first, until they prank the daylights out of them until they respect them, and of course they simply HAVE to prank the Gryffindors, especially since their brothers are in that house!

** There's a great idea. I'm now interested in fics where sorting is based on true character rather than what the Hat thinks is best for them, or what they want:

Harry: Gryffindor if there ever was one. I never understood why he would be put in slytherin. He's not ambitious. Sure, he's cunning, but that's not what would first come to mind about him. " daring, nerve, and chivalry " indeed!

Neville is a Gryffindor by the end, but may be more suitable as Hufflepuff in the begenning?

Hermione-Ravenclaw

Ron-Hufflepuff

Draco- No redeeming qualities as per canon, but he's ambitious at least, so I guess Slytherin would be better than anything else.

Twins: Slytherin, as suggested.

Percy: Slytherin/Ravenclaw, based on ambition as well as book-smarts. Either one would be okay.

Crabbe and Goyle: Hufflepuff, only because Helga promised to take /all the rest/ and they're loyal to Draco.

Am I missing other changes?

*** Why is Ron Hufflepuff? The dude might have been pretty loyal for most of the series (although fourth year and horcrux hunt says differently so not even really) and he's as far away from hard-working as they come. He is, however, very brave. Gryffindor honestly seems to fit him the most.

**** Well, mostly because Helga promised to take /all the rest,/ according to the sorting hat. Not just those who were loyal and hard working.

" /I'll Take the lot/ /and Teach Them All I Know/" -*Helga Hufflepuff.

And you're right, he is very brave and he sacrificed himself in the first year. During Horcrux hunt, he was clearly influenced by the Horcrux. Remember, it influenced Ginny to release a Basilisk on the school, so its no different from an imperius. You can't blame him for that. Fourth year -yes, he was jealous.

***** What's even the point of having house traits if one house has ‚Äùloyal, hard-working and everything else‚Äù. Seems a bit unnecessary to even have any traits at all in that case.

****** My guess is that it's because the house traits are allegedly based on the views of the founders.

Three founders took students they thought fitted their house/could be developed to do so. One of them, Helga, says looks at the children and says all children ought to have the opportunity to learn, that hard work and loyalty means more than standing around picking only the children who you think are worth your while.

It makes sense to me as a sentiment. As though four founders are picking children off for a sports team - but one of them doesn't want some of the children to be last picked so she makes sure they feel valued too.

****** Well, that's what the hat said. I can't comment on that... Maybe they're traits that Helga wanted to develop in them /after/ they join her house?

**** I think that Ravenclaw would also be a good choice. Ron isn't as booksmart as Hermione, but he has plenty of wit and a great strategic mind. It's just that he doesn't put too much effort into the subjects that don't interest him or that he doesn't see as important.

***** A great strategic mind for sure, though I wouldn't say he defines the Ravenclaw traits very well otherwise. I mean, being smart isn't a Ravenclaw trait. A hunger for knowledge and a love of learning is, but not just being smart. I always liked something I heard about the traits not being what you are but how you act. As in if you're very smart but don't put any effort into learning new things then you're not a Ravenclaw.

If you're inherently brave but never act upon it then you're not a Gryffindor.

Incase you have high ambitions but no intention of trying to achieve them then you have no place in Slytherin.

Everyone has potential to define the traits of all the houses, but the differences lies in how you choose to act.

****** I always thought that the Hat sorted based on values and potential, as after all, no 11 year old really acts the way they will as they continue to mature. So Ron got Gryffindor because that house has traits that he both embodies and finds important. Same reason that Hermione was sorted Gryffindor, because while she is smart, hardworking, and ambitious, she values bravery over all of those things. Even Malfoy got sorted based mainly on values. While clever, he wasn't particularly cunning or sly, was happy to coast by on his father's name in terms of reputation, and in the end was driven mostly by loyalty towards his family. Slytherin's a decent place for him to be based on what he wants out of life, but Hufflepuff would have also worked.

However, if the Hat sorted without taking values into the equation, basing it on "true character" alone, then I maintain that Ravenclaw wouldn't be a bad fit for Ron. (Actually, neither would Slytherin; think of what Ron sees in the Mirror of Erised! That boy had ambition dripping out of him, he was just continually overshadowed by the people he surrounded himself with, both textually and in fan interpretation.)

*** Wasn't Neville almost a hatstall in canon because he was desperately arguing for Hufflepuff, thinking he wasn't good/brave enough for anywhere else? And the sheer guts it took for a terrified 11-year old with no self-confidence to argue with the Sorting Hat was the reason it solidified the decision to put him into Gryffindor.

*** I still think that Harry would be a Hufflepuff with the values that Petunia made him learn. Of course, he's still extremely brave, but that's not what would come to his mind.

**** That's supposing that Harry actually chose to embody those values though. In canon he's justifiably resentful of the Dursleys and their treatment, and seems to intentionally distance himself from them as much as possible.

** I read a great oneshot with that premise by the same author who does the /Boy with a Scar/ AU series. It's from the perspectives of Arthur and Molly and as always with that author the voices come through beautifully. I don't think it was ever archived to AO3, but here's the tumblr link.

** I feel like most characters could have ended up in multiple of the houses since no one is actually so 1 dimensional that they only have the trait that correlates with their house. I think the key is the values that they hold important compared to the ones they display the most themselves; which is why we have Hermione or Neville, for instance, end up where they do.
