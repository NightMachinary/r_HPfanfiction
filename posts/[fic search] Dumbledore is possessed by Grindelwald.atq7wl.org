From what I remember it's harry/daphne, harry has a phoenix, and the elder wand is Grindelwald's horcrux which possessed Dumbledore sometime after their duel. I remember the horcrux was set up pretty early by someone mentioning that Grindelwald's shade was kept in a special cell. Any help would be appreciated!
