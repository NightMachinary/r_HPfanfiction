I remember It was said that Voldemort and his followers strong armed the unspeakables in the deathly hollows once they took control of the minsitry to release a statement on how there study's concluded that magic can only be passed down from other magicals, and that muggleborne most likely stole magic. If he was able to do this why didn't he use the department for other means?


** Like what? We don't really know shit about the DoM. They could plausibly be considered to be nothing more than a government-funded research institution, that can't really be used in any other way than to push out the occasional fake science propaganda paper.

I mean yeah, you can force the FDA to put this or that on the banned substances list or not, but you can't force real output on demand out of research institutions.

*** idk it was just something that I was wondering. You would think a department that has studied dangerous branches of magic would have something of interest to Voldemort besides the prophecy in ootp of course.

**** Dangerous doesn't necessarily equate with easily weaponizable tho. To make a RL comparison, think nuclear physics: there's an abyss between knowing how an atomic bomb works in theory, and being able to build and */especially/* deploy one.

Besides, Voldemort would be the first person trying to suppress the spread of really dangerous stuff, lest it's used against him.
