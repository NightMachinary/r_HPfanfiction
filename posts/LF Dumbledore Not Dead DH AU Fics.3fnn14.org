I know after HBP came out a lot of people were upset by Dumbledore's death. Several websites were created with theories about Dumbledore actually being alive some way or another. I was wondering if there are any novel length fanfics out there where this is the case: someone wrote their own version of DH where we find out Dumbledore is not dead. If so I would really like to read it. I haven't come across any myself. Oh and I would prefer a Harry/Ginny pairing if possible but am open to others. If you can no Harry/Hermione but if that is the only one you know of than feel free to post it as well I would just rather other pairings. Thanks!


** [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] by Jeconais has Dumbledore survive into his seventh year. The pairing is Harry/Daphne (the first popular story of that pairing).
