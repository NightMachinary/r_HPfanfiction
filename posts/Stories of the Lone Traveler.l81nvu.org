In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

Harry Potter, T, English, Adventure & Fantasy, chapters: 78, words: 273k+, favs: 2k+, follows: 2k+, updated: Jul 14, 2016 published: Feb 16, 2010, Harry P.
