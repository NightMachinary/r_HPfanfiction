** Dumbledore, having learned his lesson, kills him off in an "accident" before Draco gets past year 2?

**** This make 0 sense. No matter the intelligence of a 12 year old it would never surpass the wisdom of a 150 year old.

** What if Dumbledore grew some balls and made sure all Death Eaters got the comeuppance they deserved?

/or/

What if Voldemort and the Death Eaters were actually intelligent human beings, and won things the first time?

******* I have bad taste for not wanting to bash Dumbledore, but you guys were the one who said to me that enough is enough? Huh. And I also got -5 points for saying something that J_K_R wrote? Envy much? Why are you guys stealing my points? I'm not coming back to this reddit and I will suggest everyone I encounter to do the same.

******** I'm curious to know where you are getting the assumption that we like Dumbledore bashing. It's you who wants a Dumbledore stupid enough to not be able to see through the charade of a schoolboy.

[[/r/HPfanfiction]] /hates/ Dumbledore bashing.
