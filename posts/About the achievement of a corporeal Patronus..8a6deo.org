We know in canon that the Patronus charm is incredibly difficult to cast. Lupin says that it is beyond OWL level and many adult wizards never manage it. My question is;

Does the fact that Harry is able to effectively teach several members of of the DA how to cast corporeal patronae undervalue his own abilities and achievement or does it stand as a testament to Harry as a teacher?

1. It shows Harry's chops when it comes to teaching the understanding of how to face the Dark Arts, dark wizardry and dark creatures.

2. A bunch of 4th years up trying to learn it in a nice, comforting setting with all their friends is no where near as impressive as a 13 year old learning it by going face to goddamn face with dementors for months (all evidence shows that the boggart as dementor is indistinguishable from a dementor (EDIT: actually, the boggart!dementor would be weaker, forgot about that) as long as someone hasn't cast Riddiculous or whatever the charm is both spelled and actually called) on end, culminating with the successful casting during time travel shenanigans while driving off a veritable miasma of dementors.

3. We don't actually know how many people achieved a full-on corporeal Patronus. I just checked my copy of that chapter, and it says "The few Patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist, leaving the room looking much darker than before." So, the only number we have for how many people were successful is "few." Now, as far as I'm aware, few is not an actual number, so we're going to need to ballpark it. We know it would be more than one, as few implies plural. It would therefore put two as the minimum. Which coincidentally is the number of people specifically stated to have a corporeal Patronus (Cho, Hermione) though Seamus had one very momentarily but could not hold it. So what would be the upper limit? The definition of few includes a component denoting that it refers to a small amount. So I would say the upper bound would probably be 5. So ~2-5 people actually successfully cast one. And I would argue that it is Hermione, Cho and one to three NEWT students based on how difficult we know the Patronus to be and how damn good Harry is at Defense Against the Dark Arts.

I blame the movie for people thinking that the Patronus isn't actually a difficult thing to do.

EDIT: Corrected some wording to properly state my points.

** There is also this to consider:

The Patronus is only designed to protect from Dementors.

The Ministry controls the Dementors.

The Ministry doesn't want anyone not on their payroll (like Aurors) to be able to fight the Dementors, because in their mindset, only they have control over the Dementors. But they can't make it illegal or they would be seen as deliberately setting up people to have their souls sucked out, so instead, they keep it off the curriculum. It's already a difficult spell, so it doesn't take much logic to figure that you would need a DADA NEWT in order to learn to cast it.

If this is the case I bet a patronus would have warded off ghost voldemort when he left Quirrell's body. It may have also worked against diary voldemort while he was draining ginny.

** I think a lot of that has to do with the setting as well. Patronus charm is very mental.

Here's a bunch of kids in a secret club fighting against the man and being taught by harry potter himself. Their situation likely psychs them up and gives them a mental drive that a regular classroom with a normal teacher does not.

** I always thought it had to do with the fact they were learning it in the Room of Requirement.

So the Room not only enhanced harry abilty to teach but also the student abilty to learn.

If when harry called the room he specifically had in mind that he was going to teach the Patronus charm that day then that is what he Required, so that is what the room gave him.

I wonder what the Room of requirement would have given harry if he had thought to ask for a room were he could learn occlumency?

So, I know this is a common fanon interpretation of the RoR, but as far as I know, there isn't good evidence that the room is super capable of handling esoteric requests, and it certainly doesn't give the /best/ option for whatever is requested. Asking for a "place to hide things" gives the same giant junk room every time, despite there being way better ways to hide things. Dumbledore gets a room filled with chamber pots when he needs the restroom, despite the castle actually containing modern plumbing.

Plus, it's better to assume that characters are reasonably competent and that there's a reason the world works as it is, and a learning enhancing room located in a /school/ going completely ignored and unused for a thousand years is a step too far IMO. I think it's much more likely that the RoR is just a kind of quirky room that can change its furnishings and there isn't a lot of value in a shapeshifting room when you have a castle filled with specialized rooms so it was forgotten over time.

** I can't speak to Harry's pedagogical talents, but here are some thoughts about the Patronus:

1. Patronus is not a spell that requires a lot Patronus-specific of skill or practice: it took a 3rd-year Harry months to learn, whereas DA students, about 2-3 years older, learned the basic form in two weeks. That suggests that the general magic skills acquired in those years help.
2. Environment matters: casting in a comfortable setting among friends (e.g., DA), or even in a neutral setting (e.g., outside the Diner, or at the end of PoA^{1} ), is much easier than casting in the face of a Dementor, because Dementors suppress the very emotions needed to cast the Patronus (e.g., Harry's training, Hermione in the Ministry, battle of Hogwarts).
3. When casting in a difficult environment (i.e., in the face of a Dementor), the caster's emotional disposition and ability to persevere in the face of adversity are the decisive factors. Harry is brave and stubborn to the point of recklessness and wears his proverbial emotions on his sleeve, so he can push aside Dementor's depression and /just feel/. A more cerebral character (e.g., Hermione) falters, because how can one be happy in a world where money and blood matter more than truth, where slavery is commonplace, and where everybody leaves their homework to the last minute unless you nag them?
4. While [[/u/Jahoan]] brings up an interesting point about Ministry's incentives, I think that the main reason Patronus has a reputation as a rare spell is much more pedestrian than that: the Patronus Charm is utterly useless to the vast majority of the wizarding population. It's a very narrowly tailored spell only useful to those who either 1) interact with Dementors and Lethifolds in some capacity or 2) know Dumbledore's Patronus messenger trick. So, yes, it's not on the OWLs; that doesn't mean it's beyond OWLs, only that OWLs cover more useful spells.

^{1} When Harry repelled a hundred Dementors at the end of PoA, he was casting from across a lake, at Dementors who were going after his time-clone, so he was casting on the "easy mode".

Don't forget the other explanation, that he gave at the end of PoA...he knew he could do it because he had already done it. Turns out this matters a lot in a spell that's based entirely on the mindset of the caster.

** I think a lot of it is a sign of how good a teacher Harry is. But it's also a sign of how bad Wizards are. It really can't be that hard of a spell, most of them are either too lazy to bother or too stupid to learn or teach properly.

I don't think it diminishes Harry's achievement. It's still hard and he's really young when he does it.

The dementors are all on Azkaban and the patronus has no other use but to protect you from dementors and lenifolds (that live in the tropics).

(The ordinary citizen is not part of the 'Order of the Phoenix', so Dumbledore probably won't tell the public that patroni can deliver messages. That way there is a way for messages to be sent to people without suspicion.)
