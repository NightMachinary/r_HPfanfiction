** I can't remember the name of the fic but there was one where Harry got stronger somehow either the scarcrux was gone or absorbed or dumbledore trained him and dracos parallel was that he went through rituals as well being trained by death eaters and Tom until there wasn't much of his original self left and he was called dragon when in death eater garb all of this takes place before 6th year

** I agree with this.

I get sick and tired of people dumbing down Snape, Malfoy, and Dumbledore. What makes a good story is plot.

*** You don't have to actually dumb down Draco. Except for the 6th year, he is for the most part actually pretty dumb. Snape and Dumbledore are on the other hand very cunning and intelligent. Even if Snape is blind when it comes to Harry.

**** Academically?

I disagree. His father was disappointed when Hermione surpassed him on tests, but he was implied to be a decent student.

Emotionally, yeah, he was a bit of an idiot. But making him only pass because Snape favored him is a bit stupid.

***** I agree, he did fix the vanishing cabinet by himself after all. But, this also the kid that dressed up as a dementor to a quidditch match, came up with 'Potter stinks' and thought it was a good idea to provoke a hippogriff. You see what I mean.

****** The hippogriff situation was taken advantage of by him and his father.

The dementor incident was really stupid.

I do think the potter stinks badge, while not witty, was probably the best way to get under Harry's skin.

******* Yes, Lucius took advantage of the situation. But, it does not change the fact that it was stupid to provoke a hippogriff. He is lucky that the injuries were not worse.

****** You could argue the Potter Stinks badges was decent bit of enchanting. Still a dick.

****** I say a bit because he was popular, at least in his own house.

The only thing he really got in trouble for was wandering when Harry and Ron were smuggling Norbert and the dementors.
