To be honest, I don't like this couple. Well, Severus as a character I like, I loved his redemption arc and how they made him very human, by making mistakes and regretting them. On the other hand Lily, she is a character that I have never liked, perhaps because we were not allowed to get to know her well, and only as a teenage witch who resented her best friend for a horrible word she said in a moment of humiliation and pain. So somehow I feel like if she had given him that second chance, Severua wouldn't have gone into decline. I don't know, that's why I would like to read some fanfiction where Lily realizes her mistake and tries to fix things with Severus, where Severus doesn't fall at her feet right away. Above all that, I would like to read some fanfiction where Lily really has the desire to fight for Severus (Because let's be honest, it's usually the other way around)

Please make sure they are long fanfictions, that they are finished or, failing that, they are updated regularly.

Thank you.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/716010][Obscura Nox Animae]] (very long, finished, slow-burnish, and the best HP-fanfiction there is in my humble opinion with great character development for Lily)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7670834/1/Come-Once-Again-and-Love-Me][Come Once Again and Love Me]] (a great time-travel-fic, also finished, slightly shorter than the other one)
