All I can remember is a scene set at the Yule Ball, where Moody's comment of "nice socks, Potter" ends up getting him in trouble because people realize it means he's using the eye to look through clothing


** Kinda similar one shot: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11169334/4/Invasion-of-Privacy]]

Found it or one similar: reboot ch 22

** I remember one like this. I think all the girls learn a spell that blocks his eye from seeing through their clothes. Moody then I think goes to one of the staff to complain to try to get them to ban that spell but it backfires on him. Unfortunately I can't remember the fic, though I think it may have been a time travel one?

edit: as mentioned above, it was reboot linkffn(9552519)

*** Was it the one with loki in it? say a prayer? I know the one you're talking about too, it was so great to see it because honestly fake moody is such a creep and the thought of him around teenagers with an all-seeing eye is chilling

***** Oh in the series I'm thinking of Harry prays to Loki and gets a sort of mix between mcu loki and mythological one. Then he decides he's going to build spaceships lol

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.
