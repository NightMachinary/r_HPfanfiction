Look it's another twin fic, this time with Dudley having a sister. Idea came to me with the image of a little girl getting mad at Harry's out of control hair and promptly trying to fix it.

Any comments welcome.ðŸ˜€


** It depends on what you want to do with the sister. Generally speaking, it would probably be easier to replace Dudley with a girl born around 1981, so she would be younger than Harry and, in her childish innocence, might develop a sisterly attachment to Harry, even against the wishes of the Dursleys.

The Dursleys would probably be the biggest obstacle as they were horribly abusive. Which honestly I would keep that way. Because that gives you a lot of possibilities for cute scenes where Harry and his little cousin work together to defy Vernon and Petunia. Harry helping her to learn stuff, her sneaking him food, maybe Harry later returning the favour with magical candy.

Dudley existing would be a roadblock because he could easily prevent all of that from happening. Which is why I would write him out and replace him with the little girl.

An interesting arc would be the girl turning out to be a witch.

And keep in mind that a Harry who took the protector role for his cousin would most likely end up in Hufflepuff.

*** My interpretation of Dudley is he's a Mamas Boy. And I am thinking about the relationship of magical and non-magical siblings.

Thank you for your input Hellstrike.

** I wonder what effect that could have of the Dursleys. Just imagining the Tantrum Dudley would pull if his sister tried to make him play with dolls or barbies, but she could always have Harry to play with, would Petunia and Vernon really say no to him playing with her if she tells them that she wants him to? I think Dudley as is in canon would hate to do anything that would be seen as girly, with both Vernon and Marge telling him how he's supposed to grow up and be a good strong man like his dad, and not a sissy or a 'nancy boy'.\\
Of course that opens up other cans of worms, if she does have Harry as a playmate and they like each other, would she realise that hey, maybe cousins shouldn't live in cupboards under the stairs? It's interesting since Dudley's been raised to be just like his dad, and encouraged to look down on Harry, while I think they'd want a daughter to be a little lady, proper, and normal, and not to get into fights, and to wear dresses and be pretty.

It's an interesting thought experiment, keep us posted on how your story writing goes?
