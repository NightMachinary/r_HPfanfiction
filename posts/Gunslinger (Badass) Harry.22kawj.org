** jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] has a badass Harry and he uses a shotgun a few times, but it's not a big part of the story.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2784825/1/Old-Soldiers-Never-Die][/Old Soldiers Never Die/]] starts with Harry getting a gun. He maintains ties with one or two people from his earlier life. However, this isn't about Harry using a gun to be a total badass; no gun katas, no personally mowing down hundreds of Death Eaters. Instead, as the title suggests, it is more military in nature.

Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9290216/1/Khaveyrim][Khaveyrim]] by Ghostforce1911 (the username gives away the gun fetishism of the author); 90k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Spin-off AU of Per Ardua Ad Astra. Harry lost his magic and became an elite soldier. Ziva lost her sister and became a spy. Theirs is an unlikely bond, a friendship forged in fire, blood and loss that endures despite divergent commitments to duty, country or agency. First friends, who became comrades, then something more - something deeper. They are, and always will be 'khaveyrim'.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3953548/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-BoyWhoLived][Harry Potter and the Boy-Who-Lived]] is a wrong BWL story where Harry uses a very iconic gun and pretty spiffy magical armor.
