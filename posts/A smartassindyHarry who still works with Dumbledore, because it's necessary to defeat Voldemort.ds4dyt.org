I'm looking for a story where smartass Harry and Dumbledore are grudgingly forced to do away with their own plans and work together against a serious threat!Voldemort, and over the course of the story develop respect for each other.

Progressing from the typical indy!Harry vs manipulative!Dumbledore shouting matches at the beginning towards cooperative planning sessions to come up with the final plan to defeat Voldemort at the end.


** ^{This^} But both also have major dirt on the other and know that as soon as Voldemort is dealt with they are going to have to deal with one another... Both also having to suppress the desire to look past their need for revenge/control as they grow to understand, respect and love one another again.

The tragic tale of the estranged student and headmaster.

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.
