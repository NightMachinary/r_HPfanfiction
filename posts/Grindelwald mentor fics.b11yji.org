Or just Grindelwald somehow being involved in Harry's life.

Recently read The Mind Arts and re-read Hail Odysseus and now I'm really into the previous Dark Lord helping Harry.

^{pls} ^{gib} ^{fics} ^{I've} ^{got} ^{nothing} ^{to} ^{read}

bonus points for: Slytherin, fem, no golden trio, and some stuff other stuff probably that I forgot rn, but none are a requirement

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left to continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. If only everyone else would realise this...

** Hermione has a redeemed Grindelwald for a friend and mentor in Fourth and Fifth Year of my story linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor). That being said, I'm not sure you'd necessarily like it, as there's little that's particularly Dark about the proceedings.

*** Also the fact that I don't particularly like Hermione and I've heard she's quite annoying in this fic to read so I think I'll pass. Thanks for the rec tho!

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
