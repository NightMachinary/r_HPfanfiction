Hi guys,

I just finished reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9444529/1/Vitam-Paramus][Vitam Paramus]] which was posted here a while ago, and while the dialogue was often a little clunky and the characterizations could be a little stilted, I really loved the feel of the fic, as well as grew really attached to the Falmouth Falcons and their hangers on, so I was wondering if anyone could recommend something similar? Quidditch fics would be really cool, but I'm down for any well written alternate post-hogwarts take on any of the trio. I'm not really into slash, but if it's really well written I'm down to try it. Also totally open to non-canon pairings, and preferably 40k+ words.

#+begin_quote
  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.

  The war is over and Harry just wants to have some fun. Turns out Quidditch is a lot harder than he thought, and the Ministry reeeeally wants him to be an Auror. Post-DH AU.
