The fic was similar to Hogwarts Battle School in that students teamed up to battle each other - except this time the 'battleground' was all of Hogwarts with the Great Hall having the most points. I remember Harry and Draco being in the same team, and tricking the other team(s) by using disillusionment charms. Also, Voldemort and Co. invaded Hogwarts during a detention session in the Great Hall, with all the students ending up taking refuge in The Room of Requirement. If anyone knows the name of the fic, I'd really appreciate them telling me - thank you in advance! :)

It's by the same author as HBS. The students are all essentially training to fight in a war, and part of DADA classes is simulated warfare in Hogwarts.

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.
