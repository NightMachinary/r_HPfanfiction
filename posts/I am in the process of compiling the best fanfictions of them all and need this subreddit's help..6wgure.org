I have spent too much time sifting through posts, and filters, and other things to find good stories for Harry Potter. There is the wiki, which i use, but that is only part of all the great HP and other fanfics there are out there. SO i need this subreddit's help finding great Fanfictions.

First, I will be sifting through the wiki, and reading all of the Fanfiction in there to find great fanfiction, but i want your suggestions as well.

So post your favorite fanfiction, and explain why you think its a good fanfiction. Dont forget to link it, so i can find it.

Those that want some ideas about what to write, look [[https://www.reddit.com/r/BestFanficsofAll/wiki/criteria][Here]].

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/BestFanficsofAll/wiki/index][Here is the wiki Index]]. I just started the Subreddit, so not everything is laid out in the right formats, and just about nothing is in the system, so I really want your help filling it up with great stories.

Anyone that wants to help me, please message me. It would be a great help to get all the stories information.


** I don't see what the point of this exercise is. This list you compile is going to be so subjective as to be utterly useless given the varied tastes on the sub.

As an example, I personally find /Stages of Hope/ and /Delenda Est/ to be tedious and amateur, yet the sub believes they're among the singular greatest accomplishments of 21st century literature for reasons I can't understand. My own list of "greats" would include a few fics by some prominent DLP authors, yet mentioning them here would be downvote magnetism (largely because Starfox and his/her posse hate hate hate DLP and downvote on that alone irrespective of post content). And, of course, someone's bound to mention MOR and stir up that shitstorm yet again...

Why not just find your own good fics and set aside any aspirations of "best fanfictions of them all"? It's a fool's errand at best.

Same reason anyone compiles a 'best of' list of subjective things. It's helpful to people in the future. And can be a fun personal project. Not sure why you would specifically shit on somebody trying to do something that's pretty harmless.

#+end_quote

I read this sub pretty thoroughly and I don't think I've seen anything pointing to that. Sure, they're recommended, but that's mostly because the whole "Time Travel Bellatrix" plot is /rare/ and Delenda Est is at least /competent/. Honestly, the most praise I've seen it get is "pretty good until they screw it up and go to the future."

You shouldn't project your own issues on others. I don't downvote stories based on their authors. Nor do I have a posse. But I do point out that [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/marriage-law-fics-with-the-law-causing-a-revolution.28242/#post-801545][using homophobic slurs in personal attacks]] is neither mature nor a sign of quality debating or criticism of a story, and a community who tolerates such things - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/6vkdl9/why_do_people_down_vote_fic_requests_that_are/dm2v4q0/][and even defends it]] - [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/board-rules-and-posting-guidelines.4/][despite those breaking their own rules]] shouldn't claim that they have high standards.

**** Okay, they are of reprehensible moral character. How does that affect their ability to criticise writing? To be honest, I haven't found a single bad fanfic on the DLP forums, and everything by their homegrown authors is incredibly fun to read. Your argument is basically, "They aren't nice so they're obviously wrong about everything," which isn't a great position.

***** Because if you don't enforce your rules consequently, then you cannot be trusted to be objective when it concerns criticism. At least I expect the honesty to say so, not have rules you don't or only selectively enforce.

Further, not knowing (or not making) the difference between an attack on an author, and an attack on a story is pretty much disqualifying your criticism as a whole - it's just a flame, nothing constructive much less professional.

And finally, mistaking being rude for being honest is pretty much the sort of stupidity I expect immature teenagers to make, not mature people whose opinion one should respect.

**** DLP: Dark Lord Potter forums. Known as quite picky, some call them elitist. In general they're a community committed to Harry Potter fanfiction and giving feedback and criticism to writers posting on there as well as fanfictions posted elsewhere. They're also known for being not exactly friendly in how they criticize / telling it straight up how it is and not sugarcoating anything.

MOR: Method of Rationality. A famous / infamous fanfiction that is loved / hated by many, written by an controversial author. Its often a "beginner fanfiction", so most of the community have at some point read it (or at least began to read it).

** The Resonance, Revolution, and Resolution Trilogy is by far and all the best series I've ever read.

Also, one of the few I'll consider better than canon, as the writing style is more suited to my interests as well as the character development and conclusion.

Clocking in at an astounding total of 1,713,423 words, this trilogy, starting at Year six, is a whopping 629,253 words longer than the entire original series.

There is drama, romance, a ton of action and I've yet to find any plot holes or spelling errors.

Without ruining the premise or story, it's a very developed take on the Severitus challenge, where Harry grows physically, mentally, and emotionally throughout the entire series.

linkffn(1795399)

linkffn(2569561)

linkffn(3470741)

Also one of the few fanfic series I've read more than 5 times through.

If you haven't read it, it's definitely worth the time.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord.

Keep in mind for my recommendations that I hate reading cannon pairings. (Those are boring to me, lol, because we already know how a canon pairing came to be from the original source material. I'm far more interested in the volatility of non-canon pairings.)

Linkffn(9238861) Linkffn(5782108) Linkffn(10402749) Linkffn(8618289) Linkffn(4172243)

I like all of these because they're thoroughly well written and thought out. Each scene has a purpose, there is no filler. Each and every character has motivations of their own. The authors took their time to truly make something great, smart, and clever.

I'm sad I only have five to share. I need to get more reading done, apparently.

** Like others in this thread, I feel that a sub dedicated to the best fanfics alone has many issues.

Personally, I assume it'll fail as it's just a wiki, and it shouldn't even be one, it should be a google doc as the only purpose is to get the links off the wiki. After a while, if the wiki isn't of exceptional quality, people will forget about it and the sub will fall into obscurity making all the work pointless. Basically, you need to keep the sub useful so users come back.

An example of something to actually keep the sub useful beyond a one time visit would be to make it for posting lists of fanfiction for various fandoms. I know there are a bunch of google docs filled with curated fanfiction for various fandoms floating around, probably a lot more than I personally know.

*** That's the whole point, right now the only thing I'm doing is finding and collecting the various docs for the curated fanfiction, and creating a wiki off it, but the point of sub, is for people to discuss the fandoms they like and share what they think is an important fan fiction. Sure I could create a list and share it, but that will eventually get buried, by finding the lists, and the people who want to discuss good fanfiction, or even just look for it is the whole point of the sub.

*********** the result of searching Google for the empty string on fanfiction.net is that result for the bot, so that's what it links - essentially, if you don't provide a story ID, it searches fanfiction.net for whatever is inside the brackets via Google

anyways to make a legitimate bot call always put something in between the parentheses - see the sidebar for some ideas

I haven't read it in full for a very long time, but I recall it being really good...or maybe it's just the nostalgia talking. Most everyone has some reason for their actions instead of just being 'bad guys', and I don't think it gratuitously bashes anybody.

** Do you want fanfictions only in English? I know some pretty good ones but they are written in Spanish, so let me know if you want some of those too.
