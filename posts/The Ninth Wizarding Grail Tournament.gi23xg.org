In 1531, in the city of Lisboa, seven Noble wizarding families created a power item that stores magical energy over 51 years, once fully charged this Cup grants one almost absolute wish to it's owner, a war break loose and the winner was consumed by the raw power of the Grail in an incident that destroyed the whole city. It was discovered later that the Grail can only be safely used by teenagers as their bodies can support better the raw force of it. Ever since then a tournament has been enacted every 51 years to control the magic stored in the Holy Grial. This Is the ninth tournament (1994). The Holy Grail will grant one wish to the winner. There are seven Competitors all of 17 years old, each choosen by the Goblet of Fire to represent his/her school. Each Wizard can summon a servant from the historical records, each servant has a class, and there are seven classes. This year's tournament will be hosted in Scandinavia (communication with their schools are allowed). The Seventh participant was supposed to be from Mahoutokoro but for unkown reasons, Harry Potter of only 14 years old, was selected by the Goblet of Fire... These are the participants and their Servants, let the Tournament begins:

*Harry Potter (Hogwarts): Saber (Godric Gryffindor)

*Cedric Diggory (Hogwarts): Lancer (Leónidas I)

*Fleur Delacour (Beauxbatons): Archer (Paris)

*Viktor Krum (Durmstrang): Berserker (Beowulf)

*Olivia Terrence (Ilvermorny): Assassin (Cleopatra)

*Joaquina Sousa (Castelobruxo): Rider (Quetzalcóatl)

*Bwanbale Mbabazi (Uagadou): Caster (Queen of Sheeba)


** Damn Joaquina's going to dominate with a god on her side. Not to mention a god of wisdom...

*** Indeed, but Paris has Apollo on his side as well as the "Hero-slayer" legend, so those two girls can put a helluva fight

** Hmmmmmm Harry Potter plot armour vs a literal God.

Actually, a suprisingly balenced show...

*** Thanks! I decided to give Harry a weak Servant (Godric Is a Caster as Main class) for that reason. Plus Beowulf has Terrain advantage and París is a Hero-killer accompanied by another literal god (Apollo).

** Damn, a Harry Potter Grail War would definitely be Interesting! Definitely more so if Crouch Jr. Somehow Cunfonded it. Perhaps Voldemort, whether because of Homunculus body or simply due to the fact that his soul is bound to the living until his horcruxes are destroyed, ends up being able to Summon a servant. (Maybe Avenger?)

Also, cool Servant Choices!

*** Thanks! I tried to balance plot armor issues and servants, It's true that Rider is a bit OP but since Berserker (Territory) and Archer (Also comes with a Divine Spirit) are also there that should counterbalance the game. This is Voldie's attempt to get a perfect body, but he could totally get a Servant, most likely an Angra Maynu Assassin.
