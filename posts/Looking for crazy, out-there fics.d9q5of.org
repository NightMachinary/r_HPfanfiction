Weird, maybe out of this world or just whatever different thing that comes to mind that isn't one of the damn books that someone used a thesaurus on and called it a fanfic. Finding something I haven't read and being a picky bastard doesn't help me so I'm just going to go with whatever you fine people throw at me. I just favorited a Wardmaster!Harry fic I've never seen that gave me this idea.

Completed or nearly completed please. I don't start docs that aren't almost done because man do I hate cliffhangers. Don't care if it's M or not, either is fine. Unless it's just fucking amazing, please leave out the Snarry, Drarry, and whatever Voldermort/Harry is called - just not into those, not judging.


** I have exactly what you need. The complete version of this is out there somewhere, but I'll link you the rewrite first.

#+begin_quote
  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

** linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus; Horry Patter and the Philogoger's Stone) and though it's long abandoned and so much shorter than you'd want it to be, I'll still say you should try out linkffn(Ectomancer) which is great.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.
