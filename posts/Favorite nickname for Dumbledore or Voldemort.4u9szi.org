*** Do you think it's okay for certain characters to call him Albus and if so which ones?

I think Minerva might, but I'm not sure who else would be on a first name basis with him.

** This actually raises a question I've had for some time.

Of all the cringe-worthy, groan-inducing monikers I've come across for Voldemort, "Tommy-boy" is the most perplexing of the lot. When it comes from Harry's mouth, it evokes an image of a deathly pale ChildSoldier!Harry with a buzz cut... cigarette in mouth and sidearm/bottle of Muggle whisky in hand, depending on the tone of the story.

Anyways, I digress. What is so attractive about that nickname in particular? Can't wrap my head around it...

EDIT: Misspelled "Muggle" of all things...

** Giving your enemy insulting nicknames is very, very common. I don't see why Harry shouldn't do the same to Voldemort.

The British had a mocking song for Hitler, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler_Has_Only_Got_One_Ball]["Hitler has only got one ball"]]

Seriously, what is with this "Harry has to respect Voldemort" stuff? Harry is snarky in canon, and gives lip to almost everyone. Why shouldn't he insult Voldemort?

**** "Hitler has only got one ball" is not exactly refined either. And that was an actual example of real life. Not to mention that Harry is a kid for most of the books.
