Maybe the lemon drops spiked with WIZARD recreational drugs. Harry may start ranting about how HE has been manipulating Dumbledore after taking one.

Maybe Veritaserum.


** I love this twist on the stereotypical “Dumbledore spikes his lemon drops with Veritaserum” take.

** This brought to mind the idea of, rather than Dumbledore saying he manipulated everything, instead saying that that he was to blame for the things that happened to Harry. The thing is though, is that Dumbledore doesn't state specifically "what" he is to blame for. So based on this miscommunication, Harry starts believing that Dumbledore was admitting to things in Harry's life, while Dumbledore was meaning something else. For example, Dumbledore recalls Hagrid saying that he didn't tell Harry how to get onto Platform 9 3/4's and Dumbledore recalls that he neglected to tell Hagrid to make sure Harry was aware, so Dumbledore says to Harry, "Remember that incident when you were trying to access platform 9 3/4's", which Harry in turn thinks about Molly Weasley yelling out asking where the platform was, and thus helping Harry find it, and then Dumbledore continues to say, "that was my fault". So now Harry is thinking that his first meeting with the Weasley's was all a set up staged by Dumbledore.

** No, not veritaserum or recreational drugs... it's like a variant of love potion in that it makes the imbiber confess to massive conspiracies that aren't real (kinda like how love potions make you confess love you that isn't real).

*** "My dear boy," Dumbledore started, looking at Harry with a shamed look in his not so twinkly eyes. "It is I who killed JFK. I don't recall why I did so, but I definitely did. It was the 60's. Sex drugs and rock and roll, and also revolution. Lemon drop?"
