** "I must say, you've surprised me, Mr. Malfoy. Would I be correct to assume that your willingness to aide our cause comes with certain caveats?"

"You would be, Headmaster." Lucius paused. Dumbledore's eyes narrowed.

"Shave."

Dumbledore's eyes widened to a blank stare.

"Or at least trim your beard. And you must start wearing robes of respectable fashion. And you have a phoenix, for Herpo's sake, take it around with you. You'll need a tan, of course. Perhaps stark white robes, your skin tone golden to complement your familiar. Nothing less will do, and if you can manage it, I will help you defeat the Drab Lord."

** Lucius ripped the box open hurriedly. His hands shaking as he clamoured for the files he had been waiting for days now. The files he discretely ordered someone to hunt down and give to him.

When the box finally opened, stacks of pictures flew out and scattered at the surface of his desk. Lucius wasted no time in arranging them as his hand immediately grabbed the nearest picture.

And at that, it was as if time has stopped. There in the photo was the most aesthetically pleasing sight he has witnessed. Brown and aged interior of the classroom bathed in the warm sunlight of dawn, with a man in the middle, dressed in the most exquisite, perfectly fitted outfit, lounging lazily against the edge of the teacher's desk. It was immaculate, no---

It was perfection.

Suddenly, a drop of water hit it. Lucius immediately fanned the photo, in fear of damaging it. He could not let it get destroyed, such beauty was undeserving of destruction. Once the photo was dry again, his head swivelled around to see where the water came from before realising it was from his own eyes.

At that, he made his decision, he finally had his confirmation.

‚ÄúFather‚Äù

Lucius whirled around to see his young son looked at him wide frightful eyes.

‚ÄúFather, are you-?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot now son, what is it?‚Äù Almost immediately Draco forgot the horrid state his father was in from sheer excitement of his news.

‚ÄúFather, I have finally succeeded in bullying Potter to wear the hunter green turtleneck sweater that matched his eyes, and black oxfords to make the sweater pop out more; I also stunned Harry to mess up his hair and curl some its edges, to make him more aesthetically pleasing‚Äù

‚ÄúSon, I couldn't have wished for a better son, but please I have something to do, we can discuss this later in more detail‚Äù

‚Ä¢¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Ä¢¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Ä¢

Narcissa sighed, her eyes fixated on his son's retreating back. She could already guess what he would be doing right now, ordering outfits for the Potter child and scheming for ways to make him wear it.

Maybe she could send Potter a tiny care package as forgiveness for the abuse he is going through from his son. Oh, why couldn't he just act more like her rather than his father?

Making up her mind, Narcissa walked away to make a care package for Harry, her hand twiddling the edges of his favourite dress that his husband bullied her into wearing when they were still in the courting stage of their relationship.

‚Ä¢¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Ä¢¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Ä¢

Dumbledore smiled, his eyes looking wistfully at the snow falling slowly from the night sky.

‚ÄúIt's beautiful, don't you think so Fawkes?‚Äù He asked, smiling at the tiny chirp the baby phoenix responded. The old wizard chuckled as he sat down in his chair, swivelled away from the desk to face the window. His eyes shone as he remembered the good old days where he used to play in the snow without a care in the world.

‚ÄúYou know Fawkes, I used to---‚Äú

*/BANG!/*

Dumbledore jumped from shock, his glasses disarrayed to the side. He turned around to see a seething Lucius Malfoy, carrying a bundle of what could presumably be photos as based from the movement and the colours he briefly glimpsed at, walking aggressively towards him. The moment he was near his desk, he slammed a familiar photo in front of him.

‚ÄúAh, this photo, this was-‚Äú

‚ÄúI can't believe it! How could you!? /HOW COULD YOU!?/‚Äù He yelled, his hands dramatically waving at his face.

‚ÄúMr Malfoy are you alrigh-‚Äú

‚ÄúYou're supposed to be the Chief Mugwump and Headmaster of Hogwarts! Not the fashion mannequin of Snape and Sinistra‚Äù

‚ÄúI think my outfits are well fine Mr Malfo-‚Äú

‚ÄúIs this why you have no mirrors?!‚Äù

‚ÄúMr Malfoy-‚Äú

‚ÄúPlease spare me your words, you discount Merlin wannabe!‚Äù

‚ÄúMr Malfoy-‚Äú

At last, it was as if a dam broke, Lucius Malfoy yanked the chair in front of him, and sat down in the most dramatic way possible. He swiftly moved his head to his side, letting his blonde hair flow gracefully in the opposite side.

Dumbledore looked at the aggrieved man in front of him, who looked as if he was a wronged victim who strangely also, despite having no strong wind in the room, has their hair waving gently as if there was one.

‚ÄúNow! Explain! /Explain!‚Äú/

‚Ä¢¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Ä¢¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Ä¢

‚ÄúHarry! Oh, my dear boy, I have news for you, the Malfoys are now in our side‚Äù

‚Äúwhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey have completely denounced the dark side and has completely cut ties with Voldemort, claiming that he was ‚Äòtoo ugly' and that they could no longer take the psychological torture‚Äù

‚Äú.../what?!/‚Äù

‚ÄúAlso, aside from your private lessons with Snape, I also arranged you some new lessons in fashion and style with Lucius Malfoy‚Äù

** Harry half-limped, half-ran toward Cedric's body. With a panicked glance over his shoulder, he could see that Voldemort was dispatching the specters of his victims.

If the Death Eaters got involved, Harry was done for, but they were on the far side of the golden dome, they must not have seen him start running. Could he make it back to the Goblet of Fire--back to salvation?

Huffing and puffing, his shoes scraped through the gravel and dirt of the graveyard. He was so close, if he only his magic wasn't tied up by whatever was happening with the phantoms, he could just /Accio/ Cedric and the cup. Just a little farther.

He felt his magic snap into him, but even as he raised his wand to cast, he could hear Voldemort was faster, "/Avada Kedavra!"/

There was just one chance. Without his mother's sacrifice to protect him. Without Dumbledore or McGonnagal. Without even Ron or Hermione. With a badly injured and enflamed leg. It was his worst move, but it was his only shot.

He sucked in a breath, puckering his lips, just so, and spun...

...On his left foot. He turned to face the killer green curse, and his magic flared.

A gasp rose from the assembled Death Eaters. Some had been waiting their whole life to see magic like this. "Blue Steel," one murmured as he fell to his knees.

Harry stood gallantly in the path of Voldemort's most practiced weapon, one eyebrow cocked in a smolder that would leave Fleur gibbering if it were turned on her.

The curse struck Harry's famous scar and fizzled. He summoned Cedric's body and the Goblet of Fire, and with a /thwip/, Harry was gone from the scene.

Voldemort raged and screamed and /Crucio/d his Death Eaters, but one of them never moved their gaze. One of them just kept staring at one spot, burning into his memory the Boy-Who-Leered.
