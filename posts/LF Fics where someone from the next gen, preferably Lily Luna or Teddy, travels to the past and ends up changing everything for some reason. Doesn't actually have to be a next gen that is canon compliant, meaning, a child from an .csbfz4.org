I've read Heterochromia and that one where James S. comes back after being trained for years. There was one also that I read that it was Harry and Daphne's daughter, but as an adult, and she eventually ended up fighting Dumbledore in the RoR. Don't recall its name though.


** linkffn(Teddy's Excellent Adventure by ReluctantSidekick) is a favorite of mine.

And if anyone knows the one with Daphne's daughter, It sounds right up my ally.

***** Sorry, the only thing I remember from that fic is that exact fact that his daughter came back as an adult, for some reason, and was trying to help them with a war, Dumbledore was an antagonist, but so was Voldemort. His daughter (don't remember the name, but she didn't reveal herself right from the start) also didn't like Harry or was really pissed off at him for, I think, abandoning Daphne or not taking care of her or dying. Something like that.

  Astoria Greengrass wants to set up Harry Potter with her sister, Daphne. But her plans don't really go the way she wants them to. Not your usual Harry/Daphne/Astoria fic. Rated for some language and some adult content.

(Not trying to be condescending I looked it up for the both of us.)

So yeah, some Susan(or Amelia Bones)/Harry shipper went "Well Lunar Harmony gets its own name so I get to make one too." But then realized the only two things they can think of is medical terms or Fossilised Harmony and that has all sorts of unfortunate implications.
