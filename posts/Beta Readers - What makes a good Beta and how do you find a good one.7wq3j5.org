** Not being afraid to tell me your actual opinion of something.

I just posted a request in an A/N of my latest chapter, got a bunch of messages about it.

** My favorite method of finding one is posting a public advertisement. The ad tells readers that if they're interested, they should take one of my already published chapters and send feedback as if it was still going through the revision process.

A good beta will, in some manner, make the end result better than if they had no input. The above process allows the writer to look and see what input the beta has to offer and make the decision on whether it's helpful.

Alternatively (or in addition), look for people who review a lot of chapters with insight that you like and send them a message to see if they're interested.

*** Do you think posting part of Chapter 1, and asking for volunteers would work?

** I stumbled upon mine online. I think a similar sense of humour helps for starters. It's also helpful that he's a Brit, whilst I'm Australian, but most of all, I think our relationship works because we're not afraid to say when we don't particularly like something, but we also respect each other's creative views and, at the end of the day, if we're working on my work, it's my work and my decision, and the same goes for when we work on his stuff. We suggest, rather than tell. Most of the time, the other will go with the suggestions, but we (generally) don't get upset when a suggestion is rejected. And we understand that a suggestion means â€˜This bit could be better. Here's what I suggest, but I just want you to think about improving this bit.' Even changing another section of the story can improve that bit, so yeah.. I should also confirm; we both write our own works and edit each other's.

** Definitely someone who's not afraid to say something is absolutely rubbish and should be scrapped. There was a fairly big plot point I was working on, and one of my betas pointed out that it would be incredibly out of character. After thinking about it, I realized they were right and had to change the entire thing.

**** Yeah, I have one that focuses mainly on grammar and flow, and another that focuses on plot. There's some overlap between the two, and I find that having multiple opinions helps strength my writing more.

** I hooked up with my beta back in the Checkmated days. For that site, you submitted your story and it went into a queue for a beta to pick up. I worked with a few different ones there before I found my current one who happened to be local and became a friend IRL. She's really great on grammar (I have a problem with lie/lay/laid), HP canon research and bouncing ideas off on. I also make liberal use of my husband. He's really useful for commenting on story flow and helping me out when I'm stuck. I'm not a mom, so my BFF is my resident teenager resource and I have a teacher friend I reach out to for some teacher Harry stuff.

Fan fiction---it takes a village!

** No. 1. Dont ghost the authors after offering to help. This is the most annoying thing many aspiring beta readers do. I had 4 beta readers ghost me so far. The only one who consistently has helped me currently has a relative who's sick so he's an exception.
