1) Starts after Sirius death. Dursleys are physically(beating/starving) abusing him. Harry starts drinking and smoking. Snape comes to teach him Occlumency, he finds out about Harry drinking but not abuse. They end up fighting. Snape doesn't return (I'm not sure about this). By the the Harry returns he has lost alot of weight. He doesn't eat & ignoring his friends. Dumbledore tries to talk to him but it doesn't work. He finds Draco smoking cigarettes.

2) I'm not sure but I think it's post goblet of fire or it could be post order of the phoenix. Harry has a creature not sure about it but Tom is his mate. Tom knows about it but Harry doesn't. Both of them came to a truce and Tom comes to his place to teach him. He gets jealous knowing Harry is sleeping with other people (OCs) but can't do anything about it. Harry later finds out about their bond and gets upset that Tom hid it. So, to get back at him by seducing Draco & Snape.

Please help ðŸ¥º
