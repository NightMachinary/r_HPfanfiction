** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4101650/1/][Backward with Purpose]], linkffn(4101650): Due to some twists, the Prophecy was already published by the time Harry showed up on Hogwarts Express, and it had some very unflattering words about him. As a consequence, the Weasleys did not trust him, and his further actions did not help either.

** linkffn(Realignment by PuzzleSB) does a good job of it. (Well, it's kind of inevitable that he'd be seen that way, given that the first thing Harry does is blow a hole through Hogwarts' wall and try to kill a student (Tom Riddle), but it's there.)

**** In my opinion, Harry's personality in that fics was meant to be like his characterization in a typical OP!Harry fic, i.e. a snarky action hero. If the story was told from Harry's perspective then we would get to see deeper motives and emotion, but since the story is from Tom's perspective it makes sense that we only get surface impressions.

****** The story tries to address this by dumbledore saying basically exactly what you said and that it must have been a passion crime. I think you're supposed to think that the war just ended in Harry's timeline and he's trying to go back and kill Tom, so the moment he arrives he just immediately goes to Hogwarts to kill him.

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** You HAVE to read "A Black Comedy". It's the most hilarious work I've ever read, while being an AU fic. Harry and Sirius compare their new universe to the old, some of the changes being absolutely hilarious (earliest revealed example: While in their original universe, Tonks and Remus are married and have a child, Remus is Tonks' adoptive father in this one.. Harry tells them of this when he first meets them, after assuming it in the first place. This leads to a horrified Tonks and Remus, and a whole lot of laughter. A few comedic details: Voldemort's arch-nemesis is called "that fucker", as his identity is hidden from Voldemort. Bellatrix wants to have a child, and Sirius tricks him into helping her, thinking she's someone else. Both Harry and Sirius are the head of the Black house, making them "Lord Black and Lord Black", and they are often addressed as so. Seriously, check it out. Story features 30 or so chapters and 126k words. Note that there is smut, but most of it is not too detailed, and you shouldn't let it scare you away from reading this story. It's fucking amazing, and I love it to bits.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13165325/1/Echoes-in-the-Fog]])

features Canon!Trio and Grey!Harry, plus a few of their friends, getting pulled into an AU where Voldemort won. Evil!Harry is his right hand man and is really unhappy that there are two look-a-likes running around. Fantastic read.

The Grey!Harry is from For Lack of a Bezoar (link below), a short fic that explores what happens if Harry wasn't able to save Ron when he gets poisoned his 6th year. Reading this would help in understanding some of stuff that goes on in the background as well as the motivations and friends. Also a fantastic read.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13108396/1/For-Lack-of-a-Bezoar]])

Evil!Harry comes from the author's Downward Spiral saga, but I didn't read that as it was too long. Not necessary to understanding the main story.
