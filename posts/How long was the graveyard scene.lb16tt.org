I am currently writing a scene from the POV of a spectator during the third task. How long did it take Harry from being portkeyed to the graveyard to portkeying back to Hogwarts?


** The only explicit reference I can find to time passing around then is this quote from Snape.

#+begin_quote
  "There. The Dark Mark. It is not as clear as it was an hour or so ago, when it burned black, but you can still see it."
#+end_quote

The marks started burning black when Voldemort called the Death Eaters to him. Then he monologued, fought Harry, Harry escaped, was interrogated by Barty, was rescued by Dumbledore, Barty was interrogated, Harry was taken to the hospital wing, Harry explained what happened in the graveyard, Harry went to sleep, and was then awoken by voices. It's not clear when in that time period the marks stopped burning black, but since the purpose was to call the Death Eaters, it probably would have stopped fairly soon after they arrived, or at least once they presumably left the graveyard after Harry escaped. Either way, that's still a lot of stuff to happen in an hour or so.

My point is that measuring time is a type of math, which Rowling is awful at, so the books won't really help.

Fortunately, the graveyard scene is almost entirely filled with dialogue. So you could probably get a good estimate by just reading out everything that's said and timing how long it takes. Then just add a few minutes for Wormtail subduing Harry, dragging him around, and tying him up, a few minutes for Wormtail bringing the cauldron over, a few minutes for the potion making (the text says the cauldron started boiling very quickly), a few minutes for the parts of the duel where the ghosts aren't talking to Harry, and that's about it.

Maybe 45-60 minutes, by my rough estimation.

*** Would also have been my estimate. There are too many uncertainties to go into too much detail on the time. I'll probably go with 1h. I would have hoped that JK might have posted something at some point about a more exact value.

** My guess is about 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes.

***** I'm assuming that is how long it lasts in the movie.
