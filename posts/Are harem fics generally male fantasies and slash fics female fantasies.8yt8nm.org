So most harem fics = written by males

and most slash fics = written by females

Just wondering


** I've rarely come across a harem fic that doesn't have a ton of smut, and while some slash is smut, there's a decent amount that isn't.

Harem fics are usually focused on the dude getting attention from all the female characters the author desires, so yeah, it's a male fantasy. Harem fics also go hand in hand with the male character being overpowered.

Slash (M/M) fics can be female fantasies in the same way romance novels are female fantasies; they're focused on the emotional development of the main characters.

***** True. Might have to do with fanfiction demographics though - if the majority of fanfiction authors are females (particularly those who write in the romance genre), then it would stand to reason that there would be more slash fics than femslash fics. I don't have any actual statistics though, so this is just conjecture.

I also think that m/m slash is a way for women to avoid all the power dynamics and politics that are inherent to being a woman in the real world. You don't have to worry about how the female character is treated by the narrative if there isn't one involved in the pairing.

Men don't generally have that problem, so we get harem fics and m/f porn instead.

I think ultimately it isn't about the slash, which is purely incidental.

The situation is this: the straight female reader is projecting onto Harry, the main character, as readers tend to do. This reader is attracted to men, and so they like to read Harry who is attracted to men also, because readers who project onto the main character (rather than merely empathise with them) prefer to read that character paired with someone who they themselves find attractive.

So a lot of female readers like slash for the same reason why a lot of male readers like Harry/Fleur or Harry/Tonks - they want to read Harry, as the reader's proxy, getting together with the target of the reader's own affections.

You can also see this identification between the female reader and Harry in that the vast majority of slash fics will have Harry behave and be described in a more "feminine" manner, even outside of the romantic relationship. For example: they commonly use adjectives which are generally associated with women to describe Harry: graceful, svelte, slim, etc; they commonly make Harry physically much smaller than his partner; they will have Harry interact with his (male) friends in a more physical, touchy-feely manner. And, quite depressingly, they will generally make Harry emotionally weak, which is an unfortunate thing for people to associate with femininity.

**** Actually, you've got a lot of that wrong, as far as my acquaintance with other slashers is concerned. I ship Snape with a dozen other characters; I ship Harry with Snape for the intensity and dysfunctional relationship and don't really care about him otherwise. He's not my favorite. I don't project onto Snape /or/ Harry. And I'm a woman who's more attracted to women than to men in real life. Fanfiction, even smut fic, doesn't necessarily correlate to real-life orientations or desires.

Also, even though I don't read much Harry fic outside of Snape/Harry, I'm well aware of Harry/Draco, and in that instance Harry is hardly ever coded as the more "feminine" (and for the record, I hate using these terms to describe behaviors in men because they imply that graceful, flamboyant, pretty men aren't 'real' men, which is bullshit). In Drarry, Draco is usually the one who gets the slim, fashionable, graceful treatment, and Harry is stolid, strong, and clueless. Neither of which is in-character, to say the least.

In fact, I hang out with a lot of slashers who don't really care about Harry at all. This sub tends to focus almost to excess on Harry, and there's a lot of confessed identification with him, but most of the slash readers and writers I know are a lot more various and versatile. There are plenty of Harry fans, of course, but there are even more fans of - well, you name it. In HP, slash writers ship everyone.

So I don't know what this 'vast majority' is that you describe here. Teenagers on Wattpad? I don't go there, so I wouldn't know. And frankly, the graceful, svelte, slim, etc. stuff gets applied to women in fanfic as well, even though it has nothing to do with their canon selves. Throw in busty, curvaceous, whatever, for the harem fic writers appealing to the male libido. But I think you're better off not trying to speak for the majority of slash fics, especially since you don't write slash and probably don't read much, either.

***** Seems like each of us is talking from our own experience without any kind of statistically significant data to back up our opinions.

However, I /would/ note that per the recent survey, people who prefer non-Harry centric fics are just 8.1% of the fandom (whereas slash readers constitute 40.8%), so on that basis you might want to reconsider the idea that you can speak with authority for the "slash community" not caring much about Harry.

****** What survey is that? I appear to have missed it.

And I don't speak with authority for the slash community, which is far, far larger than the HP portion of it, although many HP fans have since wandered off to slash other canons and characters. I openly referenced my own experience and my own circles from the last 12 years of participating primarily through journal platforms and fic archives, which at least constitute an active experience of slash fandom, as against your theorizing, which seems to be mostly informed by hearsay and casual polling. Neither of us can claim (why would we?) that we're defining slash fandom, but I'm not sure I see where you find the confidence to draw sweeping conclusions on the basis of this subreddit, which is distinctly anti-slash and very Harry-centric.

For the record, I assume that if you lumped het and slash fandom together and took a vote, Harry would still emerge as the most popular character. The thing is, while I love Harry, I have limited and very specific interests when it comes to reading or writing fic about him. There are other characters I'd rather explore more. And as I said, I know a lot of slashers who feel similarly. They don't come here - I only stumbled upon this subreddit a couple of years ago, when I was web-surfing from boredom - and it's a late, minor addition to my fannish pursuits. So my friends and favorite writers are probably, for the most part, off this sub's radar. But I assure you they exist and have created a fairly large body of fanwork that follows different patterns than you see reproduced here. And simply by existing, they contradict your verdict that 'this is why female readers like slash.' (Personally, I don't give a flying fuck why women read and write slash, and in my experience the question is usually accompanied by the attitude that we need to justify our tastes to the questioner. Been there, done that, have zero patience for the assumptions of people who can't stop interrogating women's erotic and creative self-expression.)

As for the rest - again, this is all just you speaking from experience. There's no real information for either of us to go on.

But as I said above, 40% of this sub read slash fic, so I wouldn't really call it "distinctly anti-slash". I suspect this is the classic response to a diverse community by someone who is used to a homogeneous one: diversity of opinion is interpreted as bias against that person's favoured position. People who are into indy!Harry fics probably also think this sub is anti-indy!Harry, because there are frequently posts deriding that genre. But there are an equal number of posts by people looking for indy!Harry fics.

If you read my original post, you'll see that I continually qualified my statements to make it clear I wasn't speaking about all women, just a significant trend that I have noticed. Pointing out outliers doesn't really say anything about the trend. I understand that there are fics that buck the trend, but no one was ever claiming a universal truth.

I think this is telling. This sub, though a late addition to the fandom, is now by far the largest and most active HP fanfiction community in the fandom.

Taure, this statement could equally be applied to you. And since we are specifically talking about slash fandom, your experience is less relevant. 40% of this sub may read slash, but I guarantee you that most of them don't use /this/ sub to find slash recs, since on the whole it /is/ pretty unfriendly to slash.

This is disingenuous. You are claiming a generalization, and discounting counter-evidence on the basis that it's obviously just "outliers".  You can use that strategy to justify anything.

I have been involved with slash fandoms (a lot more than just HP) for years now, and I have to say my experience mirrors beta_reader's a lot more than it supports your theory.

The truth is this is a very complex and sensitive issue. There's no reason to assume there's just /one/ major reason why people read slash, other than the fact that it exists.

*** 99% of the time, it's related to some degree to internalized misogyny. Female characters that everyone like and who are frighteningly capable are treated like fake Mary Sues. The amount of shame both external and internalized is intense, especially on teen girls and young women.

Writing slash for these female folks is like comfort food. The guys can both be amazing without anyone contesting it and there are already thousands of cool, interesting male characters to choose from. They are seen as people in dynamic and interesting ways because they tend to have both positive and negative characteristics.

So it's easier. And when you're female and spend a lot of time hating your own weird body and feeling awkward about being sexually objectified irl by gross people even when you're still like 12-13 and onward, there is literally no worry of feeling like you have to sidetrack your enjoyment of the characters having romance or sex because you are reminded of your own insecurities.

There are, of course, a lot of people who use M/M slash because they themselves have unresolved gender dysphoria and are just starting to become aware of it.

Men, on the other hand are encouraged to participate in all of their fantasies. Hence the harem story.

Despite being female, I, personally, am not a huge fan of slash. And a lot of the slash that's out there is quite a lot closer to “softly lit romance scenes without explicit sex” than the hardcore stuff most people imagine when the word slash is used. But then again, that's because I just kinda ignore the people who say that my female characters can't be cool and awesome and write what I want anyway.

There was not a moment in time I ever liked threesomes or group sex or harems. It's kind of annoying to me, I do not care too much about smut in general and if there are mire than two people smut quickly loses the obe aspect of it that I like - intimacy.

** Does slash just mean m/m? Cuz my understanding of the term is that it was just same-sex pairings. In which case, it's significantly less of a female-dominated fantasy. I'm pretty sure it's a generally male thing that girl on girl is hot.

I, being a guy, don't really like harem stuff either, so maybe I'm weird one. Dunno. Even in smut I find it annoying. I can understand the appeal on a basic level(More women good. Caveman like.), but I would prefer fewer characters with more depth over 36 women that are basically just physical descriptions.
