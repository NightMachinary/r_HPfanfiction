He employs the weasleys etc and I think it operates in both muggle and magical worlds?


** Is this the one where the company makes the magical equivalent of TVs, and the goal is to broadcast Voldemort's resurrection to the world? Old Harry also hides his identity but ends up making contact with the younger Harry.

  Harry and his friends ingested love potions; great - he could deal with that. But knowing that he found this out before and the people he trusted sent him back in time without his memory, to relive his past, again and again? Not this time if he had anything to say!

So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic.
