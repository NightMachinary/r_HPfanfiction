** I think most Severus-centric fic. portray him as an anti-hero, including canon.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/507132][A Dream Carved in Stone]] is Severus/Lily and he's a DE/Order spy. It's more clich√©, which I think is what you're asking for?

** - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] The unofficial 8th Harry Potter book, and white-washes rather nicely. It's like porridge- there are raisins, which not everyone likes, and some cinnamon, which is nice, but the story is boringly bland overall.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7250343/1/I-ll-Shoot-the-Shot-Bang][I'll Shoot the Shot, Bang]] Time travel.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2276169/1/My-Doomed-Children][My Doomed Children]] They were Slytherins, they were supposed to be the rotten apples, they were expected to be as they were. No one gave them a second thought. After the final battle, Snape ponders the fate of his Slytherin students.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1024910/12/Hinge-of-Fate][Hinge of Fate]] Has pretty much romanticized everything about him, student-teacher relationships, and teenage pregnancy.

*** What's /your/ opinion of Sneep, Powerupzz77? You seem to have read a lot of longfic. featuring him, not all satisfying.

Yeah. His personality is doused in this. It's like writing about a Severus somebody is smothering with a pillow.

**** Hahaha, the one time anybody asks me about /Snape/, they're from the internet. Yay! So I'll forgive you for misspelling his name.

Actually, I've already gone way past the squealing fangirl stage, onto the doodling shirtless gay pictures stage and am currently hurtling into blissful, canon-ignorant oblivion.

My headcanon is a collection of all the random, interesting, or plain crazy things from the many, many fanfics I'd read, and yes, they're not all satisfying. But some are very, very well written. Most of the following attributes are from A Difference in the Family, the first one I read.

*1.* He can cook, because, */dammit/*, Potions is like Cordon Bleu, but in a dungeon. I hate it when, in a poorly-executed [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Wimpification][wimpification fic]], writers make him burn toast and ruin dinners.

*2.* The archetype of tall, dark and handsome is hotly debated between the yaoi writers and those who do the evil Death Eater routine, but I lean towards the former. It also helps that I have a thing for long-haired men in an aesthetic sense.

*3.* Severus has a kind of personality that is quite difficult to achieve, partly because of the assumed fact that he is socially and emotionally crippled- natural Occlumency/bad childhood/autism (admittedly my own pet theory)- and also from the whole unrequited love thing I don't really care about. So there. But I do enjoy the references to a certain flower that leaves him rather flustered. Or the inevitable patronus make-out scene with Harry's.

The snarky intelligence thing is usually expressed with witty banter, though I prefer the classic academic prowess. It's just like the frenzied studying in the memoirs of refugee children or performing arts academies I used to read. They filled me with this sense of accomplishment, never mind the fact that my own homework was undone.

He's also a really bitter old man, and dies a virgin. I am simply uncomfortable reading explicit scenes between him and a student less than half his age, or God forbid, wanking. Don't even ask about the infamous Lupin pairing.

However, there is a multitude of fluffy stories out there which some may be partial to.

Sorry for this long-winded, veritable essay, but it was asked for. No apologies.

** I was hoping other people would chime in. Most of the ones I know are Hermione/Snape, because arguably, for them to get together at all he has to be a Byronic anti-hero.

One, The Golden Age by Arsinoe de Blassenville is Snape + the descendant of Jane Eyre and Rochester.

There's "The Birthday Present" by excessivelyperky in which Snape is very tortured.

And my all time favorite: Spellcaster by SGCbearcub.
