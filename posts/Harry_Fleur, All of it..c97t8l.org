Harry/Fleur (otherwise known as "Flowerpot") is my OTP, and I have a veritable library of fics in that pairing (40 in all) and I felt like sharing them.

Before any other Fic is recommended, here is one of my favorites. It was taken down from Fanfiction.net and now only exists in this archive. It is a miracle, lightning in a bottle, a blend of the absurd humor of a crack fic with the literary skill of Shakespeare. It is without doubt worth a full read.

[[https://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/harry_fleur/aon/a/1/An+Old+And+New+World/Lens%20of%20Sanity/37][An Old and New World by Lens of Sanity]]

Before I begin, please know this. Not all these fics are complete. Not all these fics are long, not all these fics are short, not all these fics are recent or even good. What they are, is a record. A history written in other people's words, a history of the love and passion of a single person for Harry Potter manifesting itself in a way familiar to all of Us here. This is my OTP. Starting with my all time favorite fic in the HP fandom.

On that note, for those who might be interested, I am working on a Fleur/Harry story myself (Self promoting, I know, I'm sorry). The writing probably needs work but I figured I should share it with the community!

I had the idea running through my head for quite some time but decided to write it down and see what people thought about it. I felt like both universes could compliment each other rather well. However, I had to change a few rules in both universes to make it work, but everything will be explained in due time. I am planning to take this way beyond Harry's fourth year!

*** Regrettably, I must agree with you on all points. When it is done well, such as in A Cadmean Victory, the pairing works fantastically. However, if done poorly, the result could be fairly actuarrately summarized as a sort of crossbreed between the Hindenburg and the Titanic. That is to say, God awful. Fortunately, in the 40 fics listed there are quite a few that are still quite good. In addition to A Cadmean Victory I am quite Partial to [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters][Letters by TheEndless7]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13132670/1/][The Stag and The Flower by ReluctantSidekick]].

  Fifteen months in Azkaban Prison following the Chamber of Secrets fiasco leaves Harry Potter less than interested in being anybody's hero, and thanks to his psychotic friends, unreliable allies, persistent enemies, prophecies, tournaments, war, politics, magic insanity, and the perils of true love, it'd be a wonder if any of us remained sane. Still, it's the only game in town...

*** There are a variety of reasons why people ship them. One of them is of course the fact that she's drop dead gorgeous and many people like to write wish fulfillment or otherwise use her character for that aspect. /ahem, lemons, ahem/.

However, there are more genuine reasons as well. Firstly, they have a somewhat common experience that Harry does not share with anyone else in Canon. That being an object of an extreme volume of public attention whether it is desired or not. Fleur may not be famous, but she certainly has near constant attention on Her everywhere she goes. In this way they have something in common.

Secondly is their somewhat natural canon chemistry. It is not romantic in nature, but by the time book 7 rolls around it fairly evident that the two are friendly with each other, and at least somewhat enjoy each other's company. This makes it far easier to ship them than if they hated each other.

Thirdly is the literary shakeup that occurs by shipping them. Of the people for Harry to enter into a relationship with, very few change the story merely by there presence as much as Fleur. Because She's French, because She goes to a different School, because She is a legal adult by the time they meet, any story in which she and Harry get together will under undergo a massive shift feom canon almost by default.

Fourthly is of course, the Triwizard tournament. Not only is this a shared experience that does actually act as a catalyst for their canon relationship, but it provides a myriad of writing opportunities for them to get together and in a wide range of ways.

Lastly has to do with the "Daphne Greengrass effect". In canon, Daphne is a single name, mentioned a single time, in a single book. This means that for fanfiction authors, she is essentially a "canon OC" for them to play with. Fleur is in similar circumstances. We know enough about Her to establish Her presence in the story, but there isn't nearly enough to fully define Her character. Something that leaves a lot of room for author freedom and therefore making Her an excellent subject for Fanfiction.

Ultimately it comes down to this. People find the pairing to be both quite reasonable, and also somewhat incredible (as in rare to happen). They enjoy reading it and think it fits perfectly within fanfiction where the impossible is possible and the absurd seems well reasoned. It is fun, and has the potential for a wide range of incredible stories.
