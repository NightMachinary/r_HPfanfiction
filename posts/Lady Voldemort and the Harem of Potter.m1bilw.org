So, there's fics with a female Riddle as Voldemort. Some of which pair her romantically with Harry Potter. And there's plenty of fics where Harry Potter has a harem.

Has anybody actually written a story that does both, where Harry has a harem that includes a female Voldemort?


** Actually a big fan of the female Voldemort pairing

*** I'm reading Departure From the Diary as it updates, read The Adantages of Being Sane, and am to Chapter 27 of Limpieza de Sangre (which I think may go that way? Though recent chapters hint Harmony?). So... I guess I'm well-read at it now?
