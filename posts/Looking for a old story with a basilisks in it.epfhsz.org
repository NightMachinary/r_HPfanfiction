Hey everyone, I am looking for a story that I read ages ago and I can't really remember much about it. The two things that I can remember, one Harry is in Slytherin and Harry was “adopted” by a basilisks. I think the young basilisks was a pet originally brought by Draco. Any help with finding this story or a very similar one would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance


** I think you're looking for this; 'A Brother to Basilisks'
