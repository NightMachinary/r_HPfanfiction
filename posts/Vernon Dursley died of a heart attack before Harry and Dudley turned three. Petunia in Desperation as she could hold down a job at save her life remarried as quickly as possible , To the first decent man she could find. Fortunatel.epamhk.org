Their stepfather's name was Mycroft Holmes, Harry and Dudley grow up under the watchful eye of the British Government. The only man that could make Dumbledore cry.

Edit: She couldn't hold down a job to save her life.

And yes, ‚Äú Uncle Sherlock‚Äù Did occasionally babysit under the supervision of the actual babysitter ‚Äú VisUncle John‚Äù . However this was discontinued after ‚ÄúThe Greece Incident ‚Äú . Mycroft firmly told his brother he was not allowed to Take the boys to crime scenes anymore, Especially not after Dudley got so scared He begged Harry to get them out of there .

And harry Like the good brother obligingly Teleported them both to the Acropolis in Greece. This Of course Prompted a family meeting After Mycroft's network found the boys . Petunia had a lot of explaining to do, Harry was now required To ask first before teleporting internationally, If he did He had activate his GPS tracker, The same went for Dudley on the off chance Magic ran in the family.

A number of conversations in the following months were often ended with ‚Äú No Sherlock, You're not allowed to experiment on your nephews, I don't care if the chemicals are non-toxic. ‚Äú

Mycroft of course had at least 900 plans for Harry's future in espionage, Until that blasted letter arrived with that umbrella wielding giant that kicked down a 16th century oak door .Sherlock still brags That John only had to shoot him twice to bring him down.

**** I'm not too familiar with the show Sherlock, never watched it but I intend to one day. I mean I know the rough story and characters of Sherlock Holmes so it wasn't too hard to follow.

It seems like a light-hearted, comedy style fic. I love the Petunia is a gold-digger tag lol. Although the first chapter confused me because I didn't realize it was an outline-ish chapter.

I don't think I'm in the intended audience group and that's okay, partly because I've never seen Sherlock. It looks like you already have a bunch of kudos on it for just posting it today!

If you'd like however, I don't mind helping you edit chapters because the story itself looks so awesome! The premise is really cool tbh and I'd love to see it grow. I've been writing/reading/RPing for quite a few years now so I'd be glad to help, if you want it :)

*** Food, maybe? Mycroft struggles with his diet and so does Vernon. Cue Petunia, a woman who feeds the men in her life prodigious amounts of food, to encourage Mycroft into eating more and reassuring him that he /doesn't really/ need to go to the gym. Petunia is nosy and constantly spying on the neighbors, maybe she overhears information that Mycroft needs and that's how they originally get in contact.

Of course, Sherlock would see their shallow relationship for what it is immediately, so Mycroft would have to double down and marry Petunia so that he didn't have to admit that his brother was right.

***** I would actually love it through if they end up bettering each other and Mycroft gets fit. I feel like Petunia not doing the same thing she did with her past husband would be a good way for her to finally be rid of him, and it would be a good way for Mycroft to also start changing himself and realizing he needs to be a better father to these young boys with involves being active with them.

** Mycroft would very likely be aware of the Magical World to begin with. Though he may not know specifics or who exactly Harry is. Also why would John need to shoot Hagrid? I very much doubt situation would ever deteriorate to the point where they are hiding in the shack in the middle of the ocean.

Also unless you aim for evil/manipulative/idiot Dumbledore - I think the two might get on famously. Mycroft might actually find an intellectual equal in our dear Headmaster.
