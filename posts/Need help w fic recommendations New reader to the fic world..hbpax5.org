hi guys! I have only ever read 1 harry potter fanfic and it was pretty good! I was wondering if anyone has any other recommendations?

my only preferences: rated PG or PG-13 as long as it isn't super sexual or has a bunch of curse words, canon ships (if any ships at all) (harry/ginny, ron/hermione), post DH (so nothing that messes with the books plots or ships or whatever.

I hope there are some good fica along those lines bc I just finished the series and it would be cool to read some fanworks!


** Here are my preferred canon compliant post DH fics:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3688609/1/][A Little More Time]], linkffn(3688609): Unspeakable Teddy Lupin tries to save his parents with Time Turner.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6989327/1/][Children's Crusade]], linkffn(6989327): 4 years after the Battle, a Hermione from another dimension asks for help. The Trio and Ginny once more enter the breach.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13072492/1/][Democracy]], linkffn(13072492): Mostly canon compliant, only that Neville disagrees with his friends's aggressive reform agenda.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): Draco Malfoy finds redemption in the Muggle world. One of the most popular Draco centric fics on this sub.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5486257/1/][Grave Days]], linkffn(5486257): Fully canon compliant fic depicting the days immediately following the Battle.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12925628/1/][Interview with Director Potter]], linkffn(12925628): My own one shot for the Battle's 20 year anniversary. Harry talks about the past, present, and the future.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11994595/1/][Perfectly Normal Thank You Very Much]], linkffn(11994595): Dudley has a witch daughter and asks Harry for help.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6331126/1/][Strangers at Drakeshaugh]], linkffn(6331126): My favorite canon compliant postwar fic, and together with “Grave Days”, are part of a massive 85+ story series. This one depicts Harry and Ginny's work/life in 2009, narrated from their Muggle neighbor's POV.

--------------

Author [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]] has written a large postwar series of 85+ fics. His [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7071175/1/MLT-Muggle-Liaison-Team][MLT-Muggle Liaison Team]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9992917/1/Friends-and-Foes][Friends and Foes]], linkffn(7071175;9992917), are the start of a mini series that focus on adventures of the Muggle Liaison Team (MIT), centered around Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, and a Muggle OC team member.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** There's a "Post-Hogwarts" filter on fanfiction.net which should give you a wide variety of stories. Of course stories which were written before this tag was introduced aren't covered, but you can get a decent selection by sorting by comments, likes or follows.

I personally love [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-with-Me][Grow Young with Me]]; it's Harry/OC but very well written.

** So... I don't know many, but I can recommend "Stay Standing" by Windschild8178

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/Stay-Standing]]

It has both Romione and Hinny, it is post-DH, doesn't mess with the original plot but adds a couple of things that work well. It starts as a pretty "calm" fanfiction, but soon will come both action and plot-twists.
