The Queen of HP/TR yaoi is BACK everyone!!!! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2328854/Athey][Athey]] has finally returned from her 1.5-year hiatus! Rejoice!

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/39/Again-and-Again]]

Edit: Holy crap she just posted like four chapters at once

Edit 2: Make that five

Edit 3: Six :0


** The fact that the author never had an idea how to end the story until now makes a lot of sense. The first dozen or so chapters or so were fantastic, but it dropped off very quickly from there. I'll still read it, I just wish the quality of the first third could have been maintained.

*** Very prevalent in her works. All of her stories have amazing set-up, but never gets to a conclusion. Same goes for Araceil, but she's always starting new fics. Still love them tho, and I keep reading everything they put out.

**** Yeah there are a fair few authors like that, assuming it is why they write fanfiction. If is free so can't complain though, I just enjoy what is there. I think the gold standard author for good ideas that will never be finished is cywscross though, some of her stories are just so good it is heartbreaking they will never be completed, her bleach stories in particular are just head and shoulders above all others.

** I read Athey's linkffn(Harry Potter and the Descent into Darkness) and it rather put me off reading any more. The writing is good but the way the characters developed felt very contrived. But what really put me off is that there's a scene where Harry uses Rita Skeeter as target practice for dark magic, torturing her horribly for some time before finally killing her... and later he and Tom chat amiably about how Riddle's goals are actually designed to /help/ muggles, not harm them. These two things don't fit, to my mind. Maybe the author's other stories don't have such massive dissonance but I'm disinclined to find out.

*** Yeah, some of her early work is kinda rough around the edges, but I recommend linkffn(6486690) for her best work. It's not contrived at all, and has some excellent character work.

*** The overall concept of Harry/Voldemort is basically Anne Frank/Adolf Hitler, but with magic. It is always going to be contrived, unless the author turns his parents into Death Eaters, but that will feel contrived as well.

*** Out of curiosity, is this your first time on a fanfiction community? I'm not trying to be mean I promise, it's just that yaoi (and to a lesser extent its feminine counterpart yuri) are /huge/ parts of any fandom.

Personally I don't read yaoi much either, I grew out of my yaoi phase after middle school. I started reading Athey back then tho, so I keep up with her because she's one of the best fanfic authors I've ever read.

**** To be fair I've mainly seen slash/femslash used for western media, as opposed to yaoi/yuri, which is more often used for japanese media.

***** Honest question but do people still use the term yaoi, even in the context of Japanese media still? In recent years whenever I see the term it feels dated. Mostly because it reminds me of when I first started reading fanfiction in middle school and they still used a citrus rating scale (lemon, lime etc.)
