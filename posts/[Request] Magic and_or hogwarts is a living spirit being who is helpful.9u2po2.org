  Harry grows up watching anime and fantasizing about having superpowers. When his Hogwarts letter arrives, he jumps at the chance to live the life of a harem protagonist. Not a harem fic. Timeline moved forward to modern day.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. But this is nothing to what awaits him in the future. A future that he will do anything to protect.

*** It just got updated too, thank god. IIRC it's the end, which is both good and bad. Good because now one of my favorite fics isn't abandoned but bad cause its over now :(

** Six Pomegranate Seeds, by Seselt, includes a sentient Hogwarts that forces Hermione back in time to prevent some sort of explosion that ends up killing everyone after the Battle. It's incredibly well-written, and all throughout the story you get Hermione speaking to Hogwarts quite often.
