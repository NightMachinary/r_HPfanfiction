Hey,

I need a Beta reader for an OC fanfiction exploring the life of an up an coming Quidditch player named Cameron Roland, exploring his time at Hogwarts, and his professional career after that. If this sounds like something you might be interested in reading about then feel free to reply :)


** If I were you, I'd post a couple of chapters somewhere so people can see if your story will suit them. I've been asked to beta stories before, only to discover I don't like the characters, think the story is directionless drivel, and that I wouldn't trust the author to write stuff for the back of breakfast cereal packets.

On the other hand, if there's a story I like, I've come close to begging to be allowed to beta it (ask Starfox5!) if I think I can help make it even slightly better.

Your story doesn't sound like one for me; I think Harry Potter stories should be about Harry Potter - at least to a large extent. But posting a couple of chapters may get you someone who thinks differently.
