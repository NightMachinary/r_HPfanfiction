:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember I read this when I first got into reading Harry Potter fanfiction, and I honestly don't remember anything else about it (length, author, site, etc) other than the fact that, whether or not it was a very important part of the fic or not, there definitely was a teacher in it that was very biased against Remus for his lycanthropy.

Thanks so much!


** Are you talking about the one that turns people against one another with talk about Light and Dark Magic core-types? Pettigrew turns against Remus for having a Dark Core as a Dark Creature.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
