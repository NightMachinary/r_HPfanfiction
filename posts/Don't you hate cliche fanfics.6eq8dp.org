I hate it when there are fanfics where Harry learns from the goblins that Dumbledore was hiding that he was Lord Potter, was stealing his money, and hid him illegally (although that is probably true). Harry then learns the whole Weasley family hates him and/or is bribed to befriend him. Then it turns into a super powered Harry story where it turns out Dumbledore has a horcrux and taught Voldemort to create them or something like that. I like manipulative!Dumbledore fics but I think that these fics take the cliche too far. What are cliches you hate?


** I do hate them, especially because they always turn out pretty much exactly the same way. I usually say that I hate manipulative!Dumbledore, just because saying that excludes the majority of awful fics that use that trope, but I'd be pretty open to a fic where he was manipulative or outright evil if it was done well. So far I haven't found one example of this.

A cliche I'm not fond of is the Ice Queen!Daphne characterization, because the character is virtually an OC save for the fact that she is Slytherin and (if I recall correctly) a pureblood. You could write her virtually any way you wanted, yet the fanon seems to have conjured up a characterization for her, and it's an awful one. Again, I'd be open to this if the fics that featured it actually did it properly. The biggest issue is that even though she's supposed to be a cold and aloof character, she warms up to Harry in the span of about three chapters, so what's the point?

*** I liked Jeconias' Blue Steel portrayal of Daphne. She was still an "ice queen" but that was because she's rather dim. It was something different at least.

** I hate a lot of independent harry ones. They feature a lot of the common cliches and they way they make Dumbledore look like an idiot boggles me. Like give the man some credit he has multiple high government positions defeated Grindlewald in a duel and know more about magic than all of Britannia pretty much. If he is as manipulative as they make him out to be in the stories then he should be able to trick a 15 year old. Make him evil sure but don't make him dumb evil. Also the nickname they give him in all of those fanfics is annoying. Don't have Harry call him Dumbles which is what a fourth grader would call him have Harry call him Albus that at least shows he doesn't respect him anymore but wont stoop down to 1st year name calling

*** I absolutely hate abusive Ron who obviously keeps Hermione captive against her will. Another cliche I hate is Death Eater Ron.

If you don't like Ron, just have their friendship drift apart in the background. Maybe Harry takes different electives in yr 3 or they never kiss and make up in year 4. But you can grow apart from someone and not hate them or join a terrorist cult for revenge or whatever.

**** Yea I mean why would Ron who absolutely hates syltherins join a group that is full of slytherin a and kill his two uncles. Also about keep hermione captive they showed us in 5th hear that she easily over powered Ron and blew him back like 15 feet back.

** I don't hate them. They're not my favorite fics, but essentially they're just as good as any other fic with cliché's that have gone stale. If it's a nice read, I would not throw it away.

I don't care about cliché's much. All of literature has evolved from cliché's. The Lord of the Rings-style of writing has been done to death after the original trilogy. For example: Game of Thrones is inspired by Tolkien's work. And it's still good. Also, how many fantasy fics use Orcs, Dwarves and Elves? I won't say Tolkien was the /first/, but he definitely set a trend. Is that bad? Of course not. Sure, there will be books, fics or whatever that use the races of Tolkien, of plotpoints from fanfics, but if its written well, does it really matter?

** the problem is usually to many 'fix-it rants' that explain everything away and the plot quickly becomes more of a wiki discussion than a story, and stale. if harry is a lord and political then write the story differently. the most obvious thing is that a 12 year old can't reorganise the ministry, just bump the whole thing forward a decade, or whatever.

**** The difference is that canon Hermione /thinks/ she knows everything and you're wrong if she's wrong if she doesn't understand something it just isn't possible thus she rejects it and that's absolutely ridiculous. I'm not surprised she didn't have any friends outside of Ron and Harry. Cliche Fanfic Hermione just legit knows everything like she's a walking encyclopedia.

***** But even if she /thinks/ she's right, she end up being right in the end. I'm not saying it's not a character flaw, when it's brought up (ex: the whole scabbers being eaten by crookshanks ordeal and the Firebolt) Hermione went about it in a stubborn way and all wrong but ends up being right.

That's why I'm saying the way canon Hermione was written doesn't help the omniscient Hermione fanon argument. If she always ends up being right in the end what's the damn point of not listening to her.

Which makes book 6 Hermione very weirdly written. It's like Rowling forgot 5 years of shenanigans and plot so Ron and Hermione can act the way they did.

****** There is a difference in thinking you're right and actually knowing you're right. Canon Hermione's arguments half the time are "That's wrong because it just is" while happening to be right (And sometimes be wrong) but she doesn't actually have reasons

Fanon Hermione's are "This is right because x,y, & z" with solid reasoning and research in a short time-frame all the while being 12 years old

Canon Hermione is book smart, Fanon Hermione is Albert Einstein's reincarnation. This is what I was talking about

***** That what I like about canon hermione because that a real human reaction she's used to being that smart kid who knew everything now she's in a world were there are so many more possibilities that you couldn't possibly know all of it. She knows magic is real but since she grew up in the muggle world she probably still uses the muggle world as a reference as what is possible or not.

*** Another cliche fanfic that is usually stale is the fact that it turns out Hermione is evil along with the Weasleys and the Order and, etc. I mean, she is a muggleborn witch. Even if she looks up to authority, she's not going to plan to kill Harry or whatever.

** I have a cliche threshold, I can manage maybe one or two, depending on how overused it is and how interesting is the story, but OOC Friendly Goblins almost invariably make me close the fanfic.

Another cliche - Snape as Draco's godfather. I'm starting to think people take it as canon. But not only was it never mentioned, it doesn't even make any sense, especially not post-HBP book! Older generation pureblood Slytherins should have known about the scandal of Eillen Prince marrying a muggle, or, at the very least, that Snape is not a pureblood name. Not to mention, he went by Half-Blood Prince in school! Why would Lucius choose a halfblood for a godfather of his son? At the start of HPB, if Snape was Draco's godfather, Narcissa would have used that to convince him to help, instead she only says that he's Draco's favorite teacher.

The next one - lets get rid of Harry's horcrux by removing the scar! This one is probably mostly a misconception, but its in every fanfic that changes the way horcuxes are dealt with ever, so it's very annoying and would have been easily avoided if people just stopped to think how illogical it is. Horcrux is in Harry, not just in Harry's scar! You can't get rid of it by just removing the scar! It's a curse scar caused by especially dark magic (Avada Kedavra), it even looks like AK wand movement, so that's probably why, in combination with the piece of Voldermort's soul inside Harry (not just inside the scar), it causes pain to Harry when Voldemort is near. The scar is not separate in any way from the rest of the body, how do you even make it a separate container for the soul. That container is Harry himself.
