This is my response to @PixelKind's prompt post:

[[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8a5qt0/prompt_harry_potter_and_the_why_did_i_want_these/]]

I really would appreciate some feedback from you guys, this is my first time writing since taking a break 3 years ago whilst writing my science fiction novel.

This prompt really got my juices going and I'd love a bit of feedback on it. I may start writing Fanfiction if you think I have the style for it.

For reference, this was 3,700 words and took about an hour to write, and 10 minutes to proofread. Is this a good rate of writing to keep an audience going with updates? I feel as though one to two chapters a week is doable.

I have a couple prompts in mind that I could turn into 100,000-300,000 word fics easily, but I lack the motivation currently.

If you have any prompts you'd like to throw my way, I'd love to take a look :)

It may even be the one I go novel-length for!


** I would read more of this, I've not encountered a spelling mistake and the plot makes sense.
