** Interesting premise, terrible execution. I take issue with so many things in this story I don't even know where to begin.

As others in this thread I only made it through 10 chapters or so before I had to give it up. The first one got my hopes up with the decent grammar and what seemed to be a novel and interesting idea. It only went downhill from there.

Dudely finds out his daughter is a witch, which prompts him to contact Harry. He had no contact with Harry in a long, long while, a fact supported by the fact that he had no way of directly reaching him, but as soon as he tries it only takes seconds for Harry to appear at his door. Then there's a dementor attack, out of nowhere, and Harry's patronus is incapable of dealing with the dementors, so Dudely has to help by... making them chase him.

The author made Harry the adult auror weaker than Harry the 13 year old who only knew two spells in total. Dudley the muggle who works in marketing did better at fighting the dementors than Harry did. I don't even know what was the point of this.

It goes on like this with more ridiculous little plot points that get resolved in the same paragraph, until the discerning reader has no choice but to abandon ship.

The last thing I want to mention is the way the author deals with female characters. Ten chapters in and we've only met Dudley's wife. She literally spends her life in the kitchen, only occasionally poking her head out to go into hysterics on poor Dudley whenever bad things happen. Typical woman behavior. Now, you might remember Sarah, the magical daughter, but for all intents and purposes she disappears once her role in the story is done. Her brother reveals to the world he's magical too, so all the screen time moves to him. Sarah, at 4, becomes the muggleborn equivalent of Lucius Malfoy: "Magic, how lame! Look at those plebeians getting excited over magic!"

** I got about 40% of the way through it and [[/spoiler][nothing much had happened]]. It hadn't hooked me by then, so I gave up.

** I just skimmed the first ten chapters. It's simplistic and lighthearted. Not much substance to it, so it'd be a good zone out, feel good fic. Not sure if I'll finish it

** I read the fic, and if I am being brutally honest... I dont think Ill ever remember reading it. There is nothing to make it standout from any of the other Dudley's Magical Children fics, and if we are being serious, I don't really care for the characters. :/

That being said, for a simple, one day read (Assuming you need something to kill two to ten hours) it wasnt bad. I would not recommend it however.

** I'm going to be honest, a lot of the chapters I merely skimmed. I was going to give up but I wanted to participate in this thread with the whole material read. So I committed even though it was kind of boring for most of it. I guess it's hard to depict normal muggle life within HP fanfiction? I would love to see it done well, but it was kind of a week by week catch up on what the Dursleys (bar their child at Hogwarts) did and some catering business. There's a twist and a dark climax but it happens so suddenly after all these chapters where I virtually skimmed that I didn't feel as attached to read this ending.

Also using Mom instead of Mum because I'm nitpicky like that, even when it's fanfiction.

Edited: because I'm shit at tagging spoilers so I got rid of them because I don't know how to use reddit well yet.

** I, like many others, only got up to chapter 10. The lack of suspense and mundane chapters failed to get me hooked. The Americanisms really started to bug me (ie. Grade school instead of Primary School, Diner instead of Cafe). I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters and didn't feel that the characters had been thought out well before hand.

** SPOILER FREE REVIEW

Dudley's Dilemma

Slightly boring, entirely too forgettable, but not too bad at all. I don't think I quite agree with most of the readers here when they say that this is that bad. This sort of light fics can be quite fun when read not too seriously.

That being said, execution of the female characters is just bad. Plot holes are quite abundant and there are a lot of points in which you'll just be so bored, you'll want to give up. The length of chapters becomes a bit annoying after a while as well.

All in all, a light not too memorable read, which despite an interesting premise and good grammar, fails to capture the reader's attention for too long.

My rating- A - Acceptable

Passing Grades - O - Outstanding, E - Exceeds Expectations, A - Acceptable Failing Grades - P - Poor, D - Dreadful, T - Troll

Liked it just fine, but would never read again.
