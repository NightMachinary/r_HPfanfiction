specifically them reacting to whats happening to harry and co, but i would be down to read anything of a similar premise!


** Ooooh, there's one where there is some kind of competition where you can compete to win a day on earth to watch your loved ones, and Lily wins every year. It was really good. I have no idea what it's called, I read it years ago, but I'm sure someone knows.

  Unlike everything else in this place, she feels mercifully, wonderfully real; her hair gets caught in his smile, her elbow knocks his shoulder as she throws her arms around his neck, and the arm of his glasses digs hard into his temple as her hot, heavy breath tickles his ear.

      James and Lily Potter, after.

  What if Sirius had the other two-way mirror on him when he died and Harry found that he was able to talk to his godfather and parents though it? Not to mention, meet all those others who went before? "Sirius Black? Sirius Black!" "Pads, is that your pocket talking to you?" "I dunno, but it sounds like...no way, it couldn't have been there the whole time...Harry!"
