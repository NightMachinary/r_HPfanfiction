IIOPMoD Harry decides he's bored, so he time travels, aiming for his sixth year. He ends up in his parent's sixth year, right in the great hall during dinner. He just (t)rolls with it. Basically I want to see a Harry like linkffn(On a Pale Horse) end up trolling the Marauder Era. Thanks.

  AU. When Dumbledore tried to summon a hero from another world to deal with their Dark Lord problem, this probably wasn't what he had in mind. MoD!Harry, Godlike!Harry, Unhinged!Harry. Dumbledore bashing.

*** This one cracks me up. If it took itself even a little bit more seriously it would be awful, but it doesn't. It's a joke, it knows it's a joke, and I laughed my ass off at the interactions.

**** Seems like so many of these great fics end up abandoned which is always a great shame. But still it is indeed a great read.
