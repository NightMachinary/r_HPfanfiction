Any fics in which Harry becomes so engrossed with magic that he unknowingly becomes powerful. He studies magic just for the sake of learning actual MAGIC compare to Hermione who just wants to have good grades. He explores other types of magics, magical deities, or magic itself.

Everyone thinks of him as the next Dumbledore or Merlin but he thinks everyone already knows this stuff. After all, most grew in the Magical World so they must know this right?

No slash please but any other pairing, older women, harem are fine as long it is not unrealistic or smut centered.


** Victoria Potter linkao3(13795605) has fem!Harry engrossed in magical theory and it helps snap the practical aspect of magic into place. Hermione's excellent rote memorization isn't nearly as effective in comparison.

Fair warning: at this point in the fic Victoria and Hermione are academic rivals as well as House rivals. They are by no means friends and while I think this makes sense from Victoria's perspective, it may still come across as quite harsh towards Hermione's character.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First year complete as of Chapter 12.

I mean, unless the fic is a bit cracky or Harry is somehow never interacting with anybody, I don't know how this misunderstanding would continue for any significant length of time. Other people would comment on his ability/knowledge and he would notice their lack of it.

If we ignore that part, this fic is quite a bit like it imo: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived by The Santi) - Harry has been fascinated with magic and learning more about it basically his entire life. He pursues it for its own sake. But it's blatantly obvious to himself and everyone around him that he's ridiculous good at magic for his age.

Because there's one of those that always intrigues me with the concept and first few chapters but loses me when the unchosen one disappears from the canon setting and ends up surrounded by OC's.

  Since he was punished everytime strange things were happening Harry drew the conclusion that he was causing them. Looking for answers, the librarian sent him to the fantasy section. Harry realized he was a wizard and dedicated all his free time to find the grain of truth in every fantasy book he read. When a magical letter appeared and Harry was invited to Hogwarts he was bursting with joy. He might lack knowledge of "real" magic and the "real" magical world but life lessons from fictional characters, a few handy magical tricks and an open mind would make up for it.
