I'm trying to write a more involved Harry, and I thought a good way of doing that would be to have him join a club or two. The thing is, according to HP Lexicon, the only clubs are Quidditch, the short-lived Duelling Club, the Slug Club (for which Slughorn is obviously necessary), and the unsanctioned, unsupervised student organization, Dumbledore's Army (awesome though it was, not really a school club). The movies added in the choir, for...reasons?

Are there other clubs that I have failed in remembering/finding on the Lexicon? Is there any canon evidence for the idea that other clubs /might/ have existed? And barring that, are there any clubs that could realistically exist without canon Harry knowing about them?


** There's the Charms Club, of which Victoria Frobishier is a member. There's also a Gobstone Club mentioned in OoTP.

....

Alas, we never got that Harry Potter Fan Club Ron was talking about.

*** I forgot all about the Charms and Gobstones clubs. Hahaha, I think Harry might have actually died of embarrassment if such a club had started up!

*** I thought Colin Creevy founded such a club? Or is it only Ron hinting towards something like that?

** There's a mention of a Charms club and Gobstones club in OotP.

Similarly, the games have introduced a Potions Club, Divination Homework meeting, House duelling clubs, etc. Also, there was a Wizard Card Collector's club in the early games. (While I don't consider the games canon, it does give you a few ideas.)

There are also advocacy groups (Such as the SPEW and probably for other magical creatures as well) that could be considered as clubs.

Movies introduced the frog choir and Hogwarts orchestra.

I would guess from these things that there are, or once were, clubs for core classes and interest groups. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a club of Quidditch fans (of certain teams) and some sort of arts club.

*** I forgot about the Charms and Gobstones clubs! Thank you!

I don't consider the games canon, either, but you're right, those are good ideas. All of these have got me thinking, in fact. Thank you, you were extremely helpful! :)

**** There's also a bunch on [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_subjects#Extra-curricular_subjects][Extra-curricular Subjects]] taken from various sources.

** I'm somewhat sure that every subject has a club. Especially subjects in which very involving, long-term projects could be done, such as Herbology, Care and Potions. I think I've read about "The Gardeners", a multi-house group of Herbologists, in three or four fics now.

Then you could have various fanclubs (Quidditch, wizard culture, maybe even muggle culture), political clubs (such as SPEW), sports clubs, game clubs and interest groups of all kinds.

*** Hmm.... I hadn't thought of having other political clubs. I guess I always thought of SPEW as a one-off, but if Hermione had the idea, then it's a fair bet a past student has had the idea before, too. That all sounds great, and I think I have a few ideas now. Thanks for your help! :)

** I want to see a "take over the world" club. That would be awesome. Hmm, maybe I should write a fanfiction where Harry joins that club...

** Maybe this is just me, but I don't see why there couldn't be clubs that Harry didn't mention. I bet there was a wizard chess club, but why would he talk about it if he wasn't a part of it?

...I shouldn't try and make a point on 3 hours of sleep.

** Although not in cannon, you can draw on the sorts of clubs that are around in most schools. For instance there is usually a chess club, year book committee, a school newspaper, environmental club. There were also some school wide competitions, talent competition, math competition, school jeopardy. Various fundraisers...you know how we used to have to sell wrapping paper for field-trips? what sorts of useless but purely wizarding things could children try to sell?

** Also...classes like Home-ec, wood shop, animal husbandry, could translate well into an extra curricular activity. Wood shop could be something like how to charm basic household items into doing something more useful.
