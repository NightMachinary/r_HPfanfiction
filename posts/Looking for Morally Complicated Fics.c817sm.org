I'm looking for fics where characters have complex motivations. I don't mind pairings, although I'm not a huge fan of Ginny. Anything with dark magic, I also enjoy, but only if it's morally complicated and it's not just Harry being out of character "I hate mud bloods now for no reason". Thanks!


** I just got done reading linkffn(The Art of Self-Fashioning by Lomonaaeren)

Morally heavy decisions and conflict by a professor (who is not Dumbledore) who is always heavily light-side, for a good chunk of the story.

I enjoyed it a lot. I had recently inquired about the gore warning but after reading it, I don't feel it even deserves the warning. There are some scenes that could use it but it leaves out the detail that would usually make someone squeamish.

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence. COMPLETE.

** I enjoyed the Sarcasm and Slytherin series, the last part has been getting slow updates.

The series does get more depth as it goes on and while it relays somewhat heavily in tropes (Wrong boy-who-lived) I usually don't really like It has kept me waiting with bated breath to the resolution of several of the conflicts that it has been building up. Overall I think it's a good story that put the choices several of the characters take into morally dubious grounds (if not total moral bankruptcy)

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux), if you haven't read it already. In it, Harry desperately wants to be a good person, but he's also /very/ loyal to Voldemort (or at least the bit of him in his head), and he knows exactly how hard it is to balance those two things. Its portrayal of Voldemort (it uses the "I don't care about blood purism but the idiots who do are easy to manipulate and make good pawns" thing) usually bothers me, but it doesn't whitewash him (he's very upfront about the whole "terrorist/mass murderer" thing), so it's bearable here, and it has one of my favourite iterations of Dumbledore in the fandom.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Just in case you haven't come across it, I'll put in a mention of linkffn(The Snape Chronicles), because he is of course the most morally complex character in canon.

Methods of Rationality is probably not what you're really after, but if you were thinking of reading it, it does have some interesting discussions about good vs evil, escalating conflict vs compromising or even accepting a tactical defeat, the appropriateness of punishment, and how much an individual life is worth when many lives are at stake. It also has a superb antagonist.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.

** So there's this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10808355/1/Children-of-the-Revolution]] - which is really really good and quite morally complicated. Harry is raised to believe in pureblood supremacy, but he's also quite a lot like his canon self and comes to question a lot of things?? It's Harry/Voldemort slash, but currently we're at 125k in and there's yet to be any actual slash.

And then there's this one [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12917045/1/Manacled]] which is quite simply the best fanfic I've ever read - the moral complexity of situations they're put in. I can't even. The only fanfic ever (in like a decade of reading) that has ever made me actually cry.

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
