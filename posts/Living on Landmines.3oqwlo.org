Does anyone have any updates about the sequel to Living on Landmines and Living on Wildfires, by Gyzym? She doesn't seem to have updated her LiveJournal account in a while, but I was wondering if anyone knew about a different place she posted her work. Thanks.

*** Completely unrelated, but while scrolling through that FAQ (in regards to a fic I'd never read, nor have any great inclination to read; yay boredom), I came across [[http://gyzym.livejournal.com/97790.html][this little /gem/]].

Funny as fuck.

EDIT: Her parents, I mean.

*** A different place, yeah, but the trilogy OP is asking about is still unfinished.
