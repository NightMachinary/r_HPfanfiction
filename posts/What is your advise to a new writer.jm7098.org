I'm starting to plan and draft out a fan fiction- it's my first one and I want it to be good. I know that people get better the more they do something but I would like it to be something I can be proud of. What are you pet peeves, tips and advice for me and other writers? Xx


** - Read a lot -- not just fanfiction, but top authors in genres you're interested in writing in.
- Come up with an outline for your story. It doesn't have to be super fleshed out if that's not your style, but you should have something
- Proofread spelling, grammar, and character's names. For me, misspellled words is one of the biggest turnoffs for a story
- Be passionate about your story idea! Make sure you're having fun :)

** Others have made points I would have made, other than this - make sure you can edit well or get a beta. Many a promising fic has died on the shore of poor grammar and spelling mistakes.

Also voice is really important - I should be able to tell who is speaking/thinking by the way they talk most of the time. For example, Harry says “Er,” a lot when he's surprised (do not use “uh”), Ron says “bloody” a lot, Dumbledore has a very educated air, etc.

** The only thing I can add to the previous fantastic points is remember to think about the Why and How of things when you're writing/planning. Why things happen, why things are the way they are, and how things happen or develop. A generic idea can become incredibly interesting if it has interesting backstory rationale and happens in an interesting way.

I definitely second the 'make sure you're having fun' thing though. Do what you love and it'll never feel like work and all that. :)

** I find that whether it's writing or making art, there will always be dips on motivation and morale, where I honestly think I'm the worst writer in the world etc etc, so I make sure that I have the reasons why I a) like to write and b) why I like the way I write, and c) what others say they like about my work to help me remember why I continue to put my amateur fiction out into the world

My other advice is a about posting and that is that I've found that there's a pretty even split between people who prefer ffnet and ao3, so I go to the effort to cross post

Ao3 is also good for someone like me who posts gen and rare pairs because tags can help you find your readers easier. for instance something like # reguluslives can be infinitely useful, so it's a good idea to look at fics that are in the same sort of category of what you want to write and use the same tags (I'm sure people know this but I took a awhile to work it out, so sorry if it doesn't need to be said)

The other thing is that you can politely dictate how people interact with you as a writer. I suffer from extreme anxiety and have other disabilities, so flame comments are actually physically bad for my health (not that they're good for others) but because of this I have asked for no concrit on my work and for the most part people are happy to oblige. I ask people to tell me what they did like. It means that I gat slightly less comments, but it's still better than the alternative

other writers will ask questions for their readers to comment to invite interaction, and that seems to work out well. I find that a lot of readers don't always know what to say, so if you invite conversation you'll get some interaction from those peeps as well as the ones who would comment anyway

** Figure out a schedule and stick to it.. I don't care if you update every 4 days, 4 weeks or 4 months.. but figure out what schedule you can manage, add 20 to 50% to that and stick to that.. Knowing that an update is going to land in the inbox at a set time give or take a few hours is a wonderful thing, and if you write faster than your schedule you have a backlog in case life gets in the way..

** You didn't give much details about your idea, but here is some general advice:

1. Don't start writing from chapter 1. First write a list of things you want to have in your story. If it's plot focused, write as detailed synopsis as you can. If it's character focused, write as detailed character descriptions as you can. Then start writing scene by scene from whatever point in the story you find yourself interested in. You may lose interest at this point. If you don't, you can actually start writing chapter 1. Having some amount of text ready for later chapters can be motivating.

2. Even if the story is plot focused, you need relatable characters, otherwise even the best plot feels hollow. Your characters should be the force that drives the plot onwards instead of them just reacting to whatever fate throws at them. You must be able to truly know your characters. If you can't explain to yourself why they do something, you've got work to do. All their actions should reflect their personalities.

3. Conflict and drama are essential. No one likes to read about superheroes who always triumph unless it's a parody. Your main character should find him/herself in their lowest point before they eventually overcome their obstacles.

4. Keep in mind that every single scene in a story needs to have a purpose. It can be advancing the plot, character development, world building, or (in rare cases) red herring. Don't write for the sake of writing. I've read stories with pointless filler parts because the writer wanted to give text for their brainless fans who were satisfied with anything. Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

5. Don't be predictable. When you write fan fiction, your story is based on the work of someone else. If you want your story to be a good one, you must add something that wasn't in the original. The plot of Harry Potter is quite straightforward. Add some twists of your own to it or you will have trouble keeping your readers interested. My personal favourite is that Voldemort is not what he seems, but his entire genocidal crusade was just deception to hide his true goal. (For example that he was bullied at school for having a low background, and he decided to cause a war in order to kill off all the arrogant aristocrats and establish a better society on the ruins of the old one.)

6. Your story needs to have something that justifies its existence. If you just like Harry dating Hermione and feel that there is room for one more such story in the Internet, continue thinking. You don't need a deep philosophical message, but something that sets it apart from the million other Harry Potter fan fictions stories out there.

If you have some ideas of what your story might be about, do tell about them. I can check them tomorrow and maybe give some further suggestions.
