** Basilisk Born by Ebenbild

This expanded so MUCH on the history of the wizarding world, as it takes place many many years ago, as harry is transported to the past. Its plot is kind of complicated to explain properly without writing around an essay, so I'll just link it so you can read the story.

Edit : I screwed up the link, here it is: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10709411/1/Basilisk-born]]

** It's not for everyone -- and some of it is just gruesome and disturbing -- but for world-building I don't think most can beat Lightning on the Wave ([[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/895946/Lightning-on-the-Wave]]).

**** Yeah I dropped it after 4th year. The worldbuilding elements were interesting (though not to my taste) but the real killer was the sheer level of angst... and worse, repetitive angst. Harry doesn't so much have a character arc as a character loop. You could strip 500,000 words of filler armchair psychology out of the series and lose no meaningful plot, characterisation or worldbuilding elements.

** Darkly Loyal, Flight, and The Legacy, all three by Keira Marcos. Her worldbuilding is just incredible, and I have enjoyed every fic she's written in the HP universe, though those are my top three.

​

Swung by Serafim linkao3(9821300) and the Of a Linear Circle series linkao3(11284494) starting with the first installment, all by flamethrower. The worldbuilding here is so amazing and well thought out that I just spent the last two months straight reading these fics in every spare moment available. And if you like 'em long, plotty, with exquisite worldbuilding, /and/ magnificent pacing, this is it right here.

Setting aside the excellently-written characterization, plot, and so on, there's an amazing level of care given to make everything and everyone sound like they were living 80 years ago, from the slang, word choices, and the slightest little details like ration stamps and book titles.

For that reason alone it's one of my favorite fics to read, just to feel the immersion.

**** May I recommend linkao3(15430560), In the Bleak Midwinter which is about Hermione going back in time to raise Tom Riddle with the Riddle family.

I'm also reading: linkffn(13275002), The Imposter Complex about Diary-Tom, and linkffn(10942056), crawlersout, which doesn't feature Tom much (small primary character) but is set in his time period. Crawlersout starts off a little...slow and in a sort of disconnected tone but the story is grounded when Tom leaves the orphanage.

There's also the Evil Overlord List which is often recommended on this sub but it doesn't follow the same tone as the other stories (including Birds of a feather) since it's a crackfic (?).

Edit: Also linkao3(16480832), Carpe Noctem. Voldemort goes back in time, redo story. Redo his taking over of the world that is.

** Since we're doing long fics anyway... All the Young Dudes is, imo, the best marauders era fic ever written (though I would love to be proven wrong). The world building and attention to detail for era-specific pop culture references are amazing. It is a remus/sirius slash fic, but even if that's not your thing, it's the best characterization of Remus I've ever read. Warning: it's cannon compliant and goes all the way through 1997. linkao3(All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89)

​

The absolute best AU I've ever read is linkao3(Harry Potter and the Problem of Potions by Wyste). It's a complete rewrite of the original series, but the author does an excellent job of skipping over 80% of the story that would just be repetition from the books, only jumping in when events turn out significantly different. Snape is still just as awful, Dumbledore is just as morally complicated, and Harry is just as confused, if a bit more studious when it comes to potions. It's the ultimate fix-it fic.

A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all.

  Magically talented, Slytherin fem!Harry. Years 1-3 of Victoria Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, with a strong focus on magic, friendship, and boarding school life. Mostly canonical world but avoids rehash of canon plotlines. No bashing, no kid politicians, no 11-year-old romances. First Year complete as of chapter 12.

** Not HP, but my favorite worldbuilding fics have probably been To The Stars linkffn(7406866) and Mother of Learning linkfp(2961893).

Within HP... You named a lot of the good ones, but I'd add the recently completed Black Princess series linkffn(8233291). There's some major triggers in that one, though. MC starts out in a child brothel as a former worker who 'aged out' and keeps it running after her departure. She's also perfectly happy with killing out of convenience.

  “Just... tell me. Tell me what is going on, Snape.”What was going on was that Severus Snape had no trouble tracking down one Petunia Evans, now Dursley, to a little town in Surrey where he saw how exactly she was treating her nephew. Which somehow led to last night and Severus knocking on Lupin's door with a toddler half-asleep in his arms.

** This is slash again (I read everything!) but I just remembered Two Households, Both Alike in Dignity ([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/205899]]) by mad_martha. She builds a lot of details around magic, religion, and culture that feel rather appropriate to the Harry Potter universe. It's also an AU with a Slytherin Harry, but not a creepishly ambitious one. Written prior to HBP, which is a fave time period of mine.
