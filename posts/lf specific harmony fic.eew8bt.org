I read it a while ago but dont remember the name

it was a time travel fic from hermiones perspective but harry is the who travels back to before first year and it follows them through their hogwarts years where harry starts killing of the majority of those who supported tom in the future with the help of Sirius and deals with tom alone without involving anybody

ends with them getting married


** Sounds like "Returning to the Start".

** Pretttty sure that is the one whose description goes "A H/HR time travel fic where they don't get together till they are both adults". Clearly the 'I like the idea but really didn't like how some of the other fics I read went so i'm writing my own' type of fic :P

**** It is linked in the other comment, returning to the start. It's description:

"Harry killed them once. Now that he is eleven he'll kill them again. Hermione knows her wonderful best friend has a huge secret, but that just means he needs her more. A H/Hr time travel romance where they don't become a couple until Hermione is twenty one, and Harry kills death eaters without the help of children."

** That's not a request. The correct flare would be "what's this fic?".
