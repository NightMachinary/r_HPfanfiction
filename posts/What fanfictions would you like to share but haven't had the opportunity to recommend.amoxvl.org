  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Linkffn(The Longest Nights by GreyMurphy)

Sad little Sirius/Lily sort of shoved into the cracks in OotP. I like it probably the most out of all their fics, but it's such a niche pairing that it doesn't get much recognition. All their stuff is good though.

Linkffn(Fundamental Compatibility by HarmoniousConvergence)

This is a true masterpiece, but it's hard to read because of the way the author changes the universe around the characters. It all comes together by the end, but you have to push through.

  Harry and Hermione react as canon shifts about them. An homage of sorts to H/Hr tropes, beginning after Ron leaves them in DH. Traces H/Hr through the years to the DH epilogue as they struggle to understand the nature of forces that keep them apart and will ultimately bring them together. No bashing, though incorporating angst, mystery, drama, humor, and occasional absurdity.
