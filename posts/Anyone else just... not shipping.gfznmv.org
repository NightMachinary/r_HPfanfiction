Everywhere I seem to see people with OTPs, searching for fics with a certain pairing, etc. But I want to make a post to highlight the people, like me, who do not ship. I think some ships are cute when I see fan-arts about them, but that's pretty much it.

** I don't ship either.

But searching for ships sometimes give you a hint of what kind of fic you'll be reading. Like, Daphne/Harry tends to political, grey area. Ginny/Harry tends to fluff or adventure, Harry/Hermione may be fluff, Weasley bashing or adventure, depending of when it was written, Luna/Harry offers an oniric atmosphere sometimes, etc. So I sometimes search fic using ships if I want to read certain types of fics.

I think of pairings more as a tool for searching than an actual preference, if I can say so. But then, it doesn't work all the time, thankfully (if we can't get surprise by a way things are written, what the point?).

This is just my observation as a fanfiction (binge-) reader, nothing that can really tell "what type of person you are"... there are most likely a bunch of fics which doesn't follow the patterns I've said but it does help me when I search for a certain "flavour" of fics when I'm questing for new ones without recs.

** I read Harry Potter for the story, the characters and the fact that they went to a freakin wizards school.

No I'm sorry I don't give a crap about your OTP this guy goes to A WIZARD SCHOOL.

Like normal go to normal schools, Harry Potter goes to a wizard school. There's magic and Dragons and Quidditch. Give me more of that please and thank you.

** I don't have specific pairings I like to read. I'll happily read both Harry/Ginny and Harry/Hermione, for example, so long as I like the way the author treats the characters. And I'll happily read fics with no romance at all.

I *do* have specific pairings that I don't like to read, however. Harry is my avatar in the HP world, so I don't like reading him paired with anyone I would not want to be paired with in real life. So no Harry/male, no Harry/Bellatrix, no Harry/Madam Maxime, etc.

Harry's the only one I have super strong feelings about, but I do have some secondary pairings I avoid as well: Sirius/Remus, Snape/Hermione, Draco/Hermione, etc. But these are all more that I dislike the kind of fics they appear in rather than disliking the pairing per se.

** Most romance in HP fanfics is terribly unrealistic. As is most other stuff, but since the premise is magic school I can excuse unrealistic physics, but not unrealistic relationships (unless there's a love potion involved).

Gimme something with a decent plot, some suspenseful action scenes, high speed broom chases, curses flying and spies spying, and I'm happy.

** I don't ship but I have ships that I enjoy, because I like how they draw out the best and worst of the other character (or they do in good fics)

E.g: my favourite ships are HarryxLuna and HarryxCho. The former in fics I've read makes Harry a lot more grounded and usually showcases how sharp but caring Luna is. And although the latter can come across as super angsty at times, HarryxCho usually ends up as "mental healing" fics, where the two sort of address their shared trauma and become better people because of it.

I don't have an OTP and I don't actively sit around in fandoms and pair up the characters, but there is a lot to love about shipping when you're just sat in the sidelines enjoying what people make out of it.

** Yeah, I'm a diehard Harmony shipper, who wishes I could be like you. I'd have so much more to read if I didn't ship, but I just can't get myself past it. I've tried. I do better with Harry being with other people than Hermione for whatever reason, but it always comes back to my OTP.

** I do like some good Harry/Draco, but mostly because that's such an absurd concept that most of the fun is in reading how and why they get together. I don't mind most other pairings if they happen, but I prefer fics where the main focus is somewhere else. I find it incredibly jarring if I'm reading a good adventure story and suddenly have skip over several pages of repeatedly inserting body part A into body part B.

** I don't have any preferences either, nor much care about who ends up with who. But it kinda irks me that despite what a huge fandom we have, and despite having a source material quite up for it, HP fanfiction only really has five or six pairings that repeat themselves obsessively in every single fanfic.

Hermione, Ginny, Daphne, and, at a great difference, Fleur, Tonks and Luna. Anything else is a rare accident, and some pairings dont even have any fic about them, at least one that isnt smut.

** Same. I read fics in several fandoms, and while I prefer gen, I'll read most pairings as long as it's done well (though there are some pairings I refuse to read, such as Harry/Voldemort because no thank you). I just don't get the obsession with shipping that pervades most fandoms.

** How dare some heathens not have an OTP /s

Seriously though, I think the reason shipping is such a big matter in fanfiction (not just HP, but everywhere more or less) is that romance is the kind of thing people get really invested in. People read a lot of different subtexts in a plot romance-wise and thus a fic with the "wrong" ship from their point of view can be rather jarring. Certain ships can make or break a fic for me sometimes, whatever I think of the plot otherwise. But at the same time, when I'm not looking for a fic with my favorite ship in particular, I actually prefer fics to not have a romantic focus at all (This is how I like my SS&HP fics for example; gen).
