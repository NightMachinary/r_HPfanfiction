Well written fics please, preferably long.

Also want to recommend [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12560378][To the next by queenfirst]] Great story with a really likable SI, shes reincarnated as Alexandra Fortescue, daughter of Florean Fortescue. Just read it and it really was one of the best SI's I've read!


** I've been enjoying this fic, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21500365/chapters/51243229][The Ghost of Privet Drive]], which I think is the author, 50 year old English guy, dies, and then becomes a ghost. It's WIP, but not abandoned, was updated just the other day.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter.

it's a /'raises Harry'/ fic which hasn't gotten to Hogwarts yet (if it even will, as I could see that being an Epilogue however unlikely it actually is).

  “What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around. Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
