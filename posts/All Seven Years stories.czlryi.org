What do you love to see in full-saga fics? Things you hate?

What is done too often, or not often enough? Discuss!


** I've only read a handful myself, being relatively new to the fandom, but I personally love it when they go all the way off the rails and blaze their own trail. I like alternate sorting, when it's given the weight that kind of life-defining choice deserves. I don't like it when changes are introduced, but don't seem to affect anything. I like seeing things from other perspectives, even OC inserts.

I haven't found nearly enough Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw-centric stories, though I'm sure they're out there. I'm tired of Gryffindor-centric stories, and am working my way through the Slytherin ones. (I really liked Changeling.)

I think following canon too closely is my biggest problem with the longer stories. If you only want to diverge at year 4, you don't need to rewrite the first three to do it. Just start at the divergence point. Maybe write a brief summary for the first three years that your OC was tagging along with Harry or whatever, but at a certain point I just don't care to read someone's rewrite of Philosopher's Stone unless it's going to be different.

** The one thing that peeves me the most in full-saga fics is the excessive reliance on stations of the canon. Seriously, don't be afraid to change things up. Let someone else get the diary and then make that be the major mystery in second year. If some canon events still happen, then they don't /need/ to happen to Harry and friends. Maybe someone else gets detention in Harry's first year and meets Quirrell in the forest.

Something I really like is fics that put Harry in different friend groups. You mentioned alternate sorting fics, and I like those mostly because they put the characters in situations where they are more likely to become friends with different people than the ones that formed in canon.

*** The most important thing is not merely making changes from canon, but from making sure those changes have lasting consequences in the rest of the series.

**** Stations of the canon should be a loose structure around which to build a story, not a hard and definite structure. Seriously, it's fine if you take the general premise of each year (year one is the third floor corridor, year 2 is the diary opening the chamber, year three is an Azkaban break-out, and so on), but making every event happen the same way each time even when there's no reason to? Is Colin /always/ going to get petrified? At least change it up a bit! Not everything needs to play out the same way each time!

** I like ones that deal with the trauma/ptsd of kids going back to school after either being at war or getting traumatized at the Death Eater's Hogwarts. It's great when it's acknowledged that the kids aren't going to be as trusting of adults or even their peers when you know some of your classmates have done some pretty horrible stuff to stay alive.

I hate when 7th year fics do Draco in leather pants. Like, Draco isn't a monster, but he isn't cool or charismatic and his minor redemption should not be an excuse to make Hermione/Harry/other love interest forgive his racism and bullying and date him.

** I dislike when 3/4 of the saga is full of artificial angst and forced drama.
