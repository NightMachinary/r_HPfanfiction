*** u/stefvh:
#+begin_quote
  he also VERY LIKELY created this fake Taure1 fanfiction-account
#+end_quote

If this is true it seems like there is a clear pattern of "reactivating" old accounts. [[/u/varunf]] was created in October 2015, [[/u/gzgGahavaavaava]] and [[/u/Seenu1]] were created in July 2016, [[/u/worydfandomer]] was created in March 2017, and the likely fake FF.net profile created in April 2013. Whoever this is seems to have a particular vendetta against DLP.net, as evidenced by this latest post as well as the [[/u/worydfandomer]] account.

** Thats not Taure, that is Taure*1*.

[[/u/taure]] You should probably see this.

Is your account actually inaccessible or is this account just fake af?

*** Nothing wrong with my account. This is a serial plagiariser/impersonator/troll who has dozens of sleeper accounts. When one account is banned he changes the name of one of the sleepers and uses it to reupload his stock of plagiarised fics.

He's been at it for years now, it's kinda sad as it must take so much time whereas a report takes 10 seconds to file. All he really wants is attention - this thread was probably made by the same guy, to draw attention to himself. He's been posting a lot to this sub recently under about 6-10 accounts.
