** Canon or headcanon, Accio is really handy.

*** In a story, I had a variation where the wizard could Accio a fixed point and the spell would drag them toward it like a fishing reel, so long as they held tight to their wand.

**** That sounds more like a banishing charm used on the caster.

***** It's the difference between push and pull. Banishing would push caster and target away from each other, whereas Summoning would draw them together.

**** I recall one like that, though the name escapes me. Harry used Accio on the docks to pull himself and his two hostages back to shore during the second task like an improvised fishing reel or a diving assisting propeller, though I can't recall anything more specific like if he had someone else instead of Ron, or what the rest of the story had different.

** Canon:

- The vanishing charm seems to have a fair amount of usability, even if its not really used well in canon (for a variety of reasons I imagine). Harry could have just vanished those brains, maybe.
- The blasting curse (Confringo) would likely have a fair amount of versatility (distraction, direct attack, indirect attack, remove obstacles).
- The banishing charm also appears to be useful, though how much control one possesses varies from fic to fic.

Non-canon:

- The stunning curse (Soporo) Harry invents in HP and the Unlocked Knowledge. Only he can revive the stunned.
- Several spells used by Harry in Realignment, including one that creates a black sphere that sucks in material, a spell that pulls chunks of the ground around the caster to create a floating shield (cirucmvorsio petrum), and a conjuration of living liquid metal that can change shape into different forms to accomplish tasks.

*** The last one sounds like it was inspired by T-1000, Volumen Hydrargyrum and Iron Man Endo-Sym Armor, depending on how versatile, adaptive and independent it is.

Though I doubt Harry would have it walking around looking like a maid or a policeman!

**** The fact that I get everyone of those references means I am officially a nerd. I think you might have misspelled the name of Kayneth's alchemy by the way.

***** I googled it to copy paste, so my source (wikia) was wrong as well. No way could I remember that correctly.

** The Mas Turbare Charm. Cure that 4 hour problem and control men at the same time! Note: I am a ^{^{^{^{very}}}} hormonal ^{^(read:} horny) 17 year old, and thus I am only half joking.

Comes from the Firebird series.
