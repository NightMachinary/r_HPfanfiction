I'm looking for a decent crossover fic where Harry gets the death notebook. Preferably within the HP universe and a hetero pairing or non pairing.


** I saw a oneshot like this. I don't think it had a pairing though. I'm leaving this comment to remind me to look for it after I finish the 40ish pages of writing I have to do.

** I found it. It was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7240213/1/Absolute][Absolute.]] It took me a bit because it wasn't listed under crossovers.
