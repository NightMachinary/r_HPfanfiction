***** Wow! This was actually really good! I was a bit hesitant at first when I read that Harry had wings because I thought it would be a trope filled super Harry fic, but I was actually really pleasantly surprised. In fact, this has got to be one of my favourite fics. Thanks so much for sharing.

Now it's too bad the author abandoned the sequel.
