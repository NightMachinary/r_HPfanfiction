Okay so this is kind of stupid but I was just reading a fic (Needs Must by Aurette incase you're interested) and one scene reminded me so much of a scene in another fic that I am now desperately searching for said other fic. Here is what I remember about it:

It's probably long, like 100k+, because I'm pretty sure it was an epic slow build.

I think it takes place during the war, because I think Hermione is about 18 or so.

The scene I remember goes like this:

After or close to their first time, Snape is raising all kinds of objections to the idea of a relationship. Hermione says that they don't have to do a relationship - they can keep it a secret and she can just come to him when he needs/wants her.

Snape proceeds to basically flip his lid and say something along the lines of the following: do you know what I would do to someone who did that to you? Who used your body when he wanted etc etc. I can't remember the whole of his speech but I do remember that it was quite lovely, and he mentioned losing her dignity and her pride etc.

I'm fairly sure that it is a very well known fic in the pairing, and that it has a HEA.

If anyone could help me find it I'd be most grateful.
