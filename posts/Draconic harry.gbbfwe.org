:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fanfic in where Harry basically becomes like a were dragon? He has a humanoid form with dragon traits basically a new race and I think it was a harem.


** Sounds like "Cold Blood", though that story does not have a harem.

  This Story is based on Whitetigerwolves story, but continued by me with his consent.This is a Harry/Multi story. More specifically, Harry Potter/Minerva McGonagall/Poppy Pomfrey/Andromeda Tonks/Amelia Bones. How they came together is inspired by The Curses Cure and Draco's Gift respectively, but I've put my own little twist into it.As I stated this was inspired by two other stories. Basically, Harry is cursed to uncontrollable lust. In those stories, it was Hermione that helped Harry, and, for the most part, involved younger witches. And I got to thinking, what if Draco had been caught by a teacher and the situation brought to the attention of Hogwarts staff? Then I threw in my little twist. That is what Whitetigerwolve did with it i added Harry/Narcissa Malfoy and continued the story from the first chapter onwardsI hope you all enjoy.Nothing but the storyline from chapter 2 onwards belongs to me.
