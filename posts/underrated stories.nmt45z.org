recently i've gotten into reading relatively unknown and underrated stories, mainly because i've read most of the good ones, and i wanna hear some. they don't even have to be super underrated, just obscure. thanks!


** these two fics are by the same author. the first one is hermione traveling back to Tom riddles time and the second is hermione traveling to the marauders era. they're both wip but so, so good.

Summary:

#+begin_quote
  Lavender takes one step forward and -- just like the snap of a finger, the blink of an eye, the drop of a pebble -- Hogwarts is left behind. There's no jump, no flashes of light, no whirlwinds of disconnected images. Just one little step; behind stood her war and in front stands 1947. "Huh," she says to herself, "didn't see this in the tea leaves."
#+end_quote

(I swear I'm constantly plugging this fic, and it's not even mine lol! But all of you must read this because it is wonderful)

** An obscure fic I really love is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25272307][There's a List for That]] by GatherYourStrength. Hermione travels to a few months after Voldemort's first defeat to fix everything before the war starts all over. It has a really good grasp of Hermione and Snape especially. I loved the world-building and its soft and quiet moments.

Another one is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27530344][Dance with Darkness]]. Again, the premise is similar to the one above. This time Hermione travels to half a year before Voldemort's Downfall. It has a very interesting Regulus Black. The story is still quite new, but it looks very promising and interesting.

I hope you try them out!

#+begin_quote
  Redirected and rebranded, the Death Eaters have dismantled and destroyed everything the Light holds dear. With their society on the verge of extinction, Hermione is the only one who can fix the future. At least, that's what she keeps telling herself. Armed with plans, lists, books, and a house elf, she won't stop until things have been set right. But what will happen when she doesn't arrive at her intended destination? Will her plans to work alone still hold water? Or will she sink among the endless waves of memory and regret?
