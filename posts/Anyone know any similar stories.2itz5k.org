I'm looking for stories that follow a particular concept. That harry has some sort of mentor, but the mentor is in his head. Examples being:

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/][The denarian renegade]]

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8079676/1/][Fateprophecy break]]

The one thing I'd like to see different if you have it is a less authoritative mentor, so harry can make mistakes and grow. In denarian renegade meciel keeps harry from developing into a good guy and the author ends up making him do antagonistic things just so he stays a bad guy. In fateprophecy it's the opposite, Archer doesn't let harry make mistakes really at all and he comes across as just an avatar for archers morals and will.

That being said I really like the concept, so much so it lets me ignore flaws in a story I would otherwise a quick out of.

Thanks for any recs!

Edit: they don't have to be crossovers even though my examples are.

Edit: please keep out the Mary sues.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3531310/1/Dark-Respite][Dark Respite:]]A Noir story of HP ass kickery cooked to perfection and served over a savory blend of snarky humor. Before sending Harry to the afterlife, Voldemort told him he'd write the book on worse things than death with him. Harry's back to write the epilogue.

You might like this awesome fic then. It has Salazaar Slytherin living in Harry's mind and acting as a sort of mentor and as you wanted, Harry is much more reluctant to listen to Slytherin compared to Emiya or Meciel.
