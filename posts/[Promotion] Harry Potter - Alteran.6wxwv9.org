:END:
This fic is now placed as one of my favorite fanfics i have ever read

This is a crossover with Stargate - SG 1 but you dont need to have read/watched this series in order to understand this fanfic

Harry Potter discovers a ancient piece of technology that is millions of years ahead of what earth is capable and with this, he will travel the galaxy.

*** Yeah, I gave it a try even with my inherent hate for Hermione but I just simply couldn't get over it. And the obvious Lunar Harmony trope where Luna is some kind of super seer killed it further. The idea was great, HP and SG1 are usually either amazing or horrible and this one I can honestly recommend if you're into the pairing, it gets kinda weird when Harry starts getting sort of a god complex but eh. Was not my cup of tea at the end but it might be for many others.

**** After the point that you seem to stop at, they realise they are being all high and mighty and mellow down. Still works at the God complex though but at a softer pace

***** Meh it still has Hermione and I can't just skip trough her parts in the story like I usually do if I really want to read the story.

  The rebirth of an entire race and society is a tall order when this and other galaxies are not safe. What is Harry to do? What he does best, jump in feet first. Rating T for some language and mentions of nudity later on. Pairings HP/HG/LL/other
