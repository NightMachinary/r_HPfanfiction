** My solution to this somewhat major problem when reading fics is to subconsciously age-adjust them to their actual physical age -- the mindset being that mental time travel genuinely turn you into the age you were back then, but with future knowledge, just like how you can dream of future yourself, except more exhaustive and complete. This almost always works, because our main character usually assimilate into their physical age group just fine. They may know things of the future, but their more mundane problems are that of a 11-year old (or whatever age they traveled to). Consider an actual adult going around posing as a 11 year old, while physically an adult. It'd look ridiculous. You simply can't identify as an 11 year old as an adult.

Grooming would mean manipulating a target to bare their soul to you, basically replacing everything positive in their life with yourself. This is clearly not what is going on in those fics.

The fact that most writers can't write children still hold true of course, but that is the case whether you involve time travel or not.

** There are quite a few fics that go with 'sending memories back' or 'merging past and present'. Usually to get the pairing they want but avoid dealing with the squick which is the notion of deaging. (People have issues both with a mental!adult/child body with both another child or with another adult.)

These tend to be just a way to avoid that issue, not a deeper explored issue...

** I really like reading short range time travel where someone travels back a few hours, fixes something, and has to keep his past self from noticing the fixes to avoid a paradox, like what happened in PoA. Unfortunately there aren't many. Cedric's eight is interesting, there's a ton of different versions of the same person running around trying to defeat the bad guy.
