Preferably centered on him. Not too keen on Sirius/Remus, but it's okay.


** The best match to your desiderata seems to be Teufel1987's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7254667/1/Black-Vengeance][Black Vengeance]]. Dark Sirius adopts Harry.

#+begin_quote
  AU Third Year: He spent twelve years in hell for a crime he did not commit. Sent there without the courtesy of a trial. Betrayed by his friends and allies. Now he has broken out. He will find and catch that rat and then, they will pay!

Not Sirius-centric, but he's a major character in BajaB's excellent novelette [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]].

#+begin_quote
  The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.
#+end_quote

In the first book of Darth Marrs's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][Firebird Trilogy]], Sirius is a wizard in the service of a dark cabal. He's only a bit player, however.

#+begin_quote
  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
#+end_quote

It's been awhile since I read it, but I recall Nuhuh's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4347702/1/Catharsis][Catharsis]] had Sirius as a dark wizard.

#+begin_quote
  Post DH. Harry could never have known Albus-Severus was the herald of the new dark age. He watched as his youngest child came to be known as the Dark Son. Now Harry goes back in time to save his family and his son from the dark path.

*** Thanks so much. I think I'll skip over the Firebird Trilogy, but everything else looks great.

**** The Firebird Trilogy is really interesting for originality and it has some great new characters in it when they go to America.

The re imagining of some characters (namely Ollivander) is quite refreshing to read about.

*** Is Black Vengeance a good story? Did you like it? I second Dark Marauder, was a nice oneshot.

**** It's Teufel1987, so it's not going to have universal appeal, but it is one of his better stories and is definitely worth reading if you seek a dark Sirius tale.
