I don't want anything long, but I'd love to read a fic where Snape has to tell the wizengamot what he did as a death eater and that he later switched sides.

** The odds of this actually coming to pass would be a story of the ages. He would have to be crucio'ing pureblood orphans on the WWW to be actually brought to trial.

Between the "I was imperiused!" victims, Lucy's gold, and Dumbledore, it would be swept under the rug faster than you can say "The use of the unforgivable curses give you a lifetime vacation in Azkaban."

*** Karkaroff (I'm sure I spelled it wrong) mentioned him during his own trial and Dumbledore said he already testified that Snape switched sides, so there was some sort of discussion about that. Dumbledore says clearly 'Sverus Snape was indeed a death eater' so it's not a secret. I'm curious if they knew what he did as a death eater. Of course the policy 'I've got a dark mark, prison is waiting for you' is the best, but they apparently didn't know this existed, and yet Dumbledore had to testify so there was a reason for that.

**** Dumbledore also "gave evidence" that Sirius was the Potters' Secret Keeper but Sirius never had a trial. It's very likely that Snape never had a trial either and Dumbledore politicked his crimes away.

Though I /would/ like to know how such a trial would go if it did occur. What evidence would Snape (and Dumbledore) provide that he'd turned against Voldemort to a /just/ court?

  “There is not a shred of proof to support Black's story, except your word --- and the word of two thirteen-year-old wizards will not convince anybody. A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Ministry that Sirius had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper.”

  “Oh I know Crouch all right,” he said quietly. “He was the one who gave the order for me to be sent to Azkaban --- without a trial.”

***** hmm maybe. But Crouch sr also said Snape had been cleared by this council so I believe he at least had to show up. It's interesting that Lestranges and Bagman had a trial and Sirius did not.

Edit: Yes, but wouldn't the other Death Eaters want to silence him without knowing that because he could potentially oust them?
