It wasn't crowded enough. The plan had been to hide in plain sight. But as she and Ted stood in robes and cloaks among Italian Muggles who were not at all in fancy dress as she'd expected and who had crowded beside the road to let parade floats rumble by, it was clear that the two of them were not remotely what would be considered "in hiding." They were just in plain sight.

They really should've gone to Venice instead.

"This can't be all there is," she muttered quietly to him. "The Muggles have got to be off cavorting somewhere, at some bigger party."

It was strange to see apprehension in the eyes of Ted Tonks, who, as recently as a few hours ago, had nothing but confidence in their plan to flee to Verona.

He swallowed and adjusted his grip on her freezing hand. "I think this is it."

The two of them ought to have done their research. Yes, there were plenty of people here in elaborate outfits, but the vast majority of them were in the parade, not the crowd. A horse-drawn carriage ambled by, carrying a group of people, and a young boy wearing a felt hat tossed a handful of confetti into the air. For a moment all Andromeda could see was a blur of white paper squares.

"But, luckily," he said, "this isn't what we came here for." He grinned and brushed some of the confetti out of her hair, and there he was again --- optimistic to a fault. "But let's hurry. And we should wear our masks."

"They're looking at us like we're mad," she muttered, pulling the intricately painted mask over her face as Ted did the same.

"Well, we bought the masks from /their/ Muggle shops. So I don't think we look mad, I think we just look like a couple of foreign wankers."

Andromeda's lip twitched. It was true that the Muggles who were giving them curious looks simply seemed entertained, rather than bewildered. Perhaps it hadn't been completely insane to assume that two young, giddy newlyweds could blend in wearing robes during Carnevale.

"If anything, /this/," he said, tapping the goblet in her hand, "is drawing more attention than anything else."

"Just let me have the things that make me feel better, Tonks."

Andromeda could hear muffled laughter behind his mask as he began pulling her through the crowd.

** This sounds like it's really well written. Not normally what I would read topicwise but sounds really good. Might give it a shot
