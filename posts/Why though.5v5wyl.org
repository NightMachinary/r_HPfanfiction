** At least they review? That's more than can be said for most.

It's the nonsensical ones that bother me. I have three guest reviews from what is obviously the same person talking about what Harry and Bella should be doing.

Bellatrix Lestrange is not in, or referenced, in my fic. There is no character in it named Bella. The female antagonist is named Emily.

*** I'm in the same boat of "hey, at least they said something," as reviews begat reviews. People are more likely to review if they see OTHER people doing it, even if it's very low effort ones.

Like you, it's the reviews by people that obviously aren't paying attention to the story, and/or want the story tailored exactly TO THEM that drive me insane. I recently got a reviewer that asks questions that are literally answered in the text, and in a very...demanding way. I like to imagine him going up to the ghost of Hemingway and screaming, "WHY IS JAKE IMPOTENT?!" after reading /The Sun Also Rises./

**** It reminded me a bit about how most of the reviews to Vitam Paramus referred to Gabrielle Delacour as 'Gabby'. Not once in the story is she referred to as that. Her name is instead shortened to 'Elle' or 'Ellie' depending on who's speaking.

But I figured that, shrug, I'm sure that she's called Gabby in other fics and I'll just grit my teeth and deal with that.

But for my current fic I'm pretty sure I'm the only person writing a story about Emily Riddle.

** Could be that they wanted to repay you for the enjoyment they got from your fic by bumping its review count. More reviews = the more popular your fics seems, and popularity is oftentimes mistakenly equated with quality. I imagine they just wanted to do you a solid.

** For some reason I can't see what you're linking to (I'm on mobile), but while we're on the opinion of reviews, yet again I have two recent guest reviews on a completed fic asking me questions. Just... just fucking sign in.

Edit: can see now. At least they leave something even if it's not particularly helpful!

******* I think that sometimes people don't realise they aren't signed in. Seems to happen a lot when people review off their phones. And it is frustrating because it looks as if you are ignoring the reviewer when actually there's nothing you can do about it.

***** I know I've been threatened to be reported because of one guy who just reviewed the same copy pasted sentence over and over in the span of 5 hours. I have 30 something chapters in my story.

It's not a stretch that someone will look at this and be like "this guy might be boosting his review count".

Just wanted to ask this to you so that you have the chance to make this clear. I've seen a couple of people with alternate accounts get violently called out for it here, and your post history seems a bit suspicious. You might want to make it clear to avoid any misunderstanding.

Edit: I'll take that as a yes.

That could help but those are barely even comments. Maybe a thumbs up/down rating system per chapter might be good.
