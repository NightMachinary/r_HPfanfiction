i remember starting an amazing draco/harry slash fic and before i could finish it my computer broke! it was set right after the great war, the same day. harry was tired, and draco was there and they forgave each other and i think they went up on a hill and fell asleep and thats all i read before my computer fucked everything up. if you could help me to find this fic i would be so appreciative!
