:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Basically, the title. Harry is seven or eight when he meets her and she shows him all the stuff Muggles have done, and he begins reading and learning more. Later on, I think in the summer after his first or second year, James and Lily send him to some sort of wizard boot camp/correctional facility. That's all I can remember. Any ideas?

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter may be the brother of the Boy-Who-Lived and his parents may still be alive, but that doesn't mean everything is perfect. While he may not want anything to do with the upcoming war between Light and Dark, he'll end up walking between them. An AU fanfic involving Harry Potter as a Ravenclaw and based off Neither Light nor Dark: Steelclaws & Gray Coats.
