For those of you who haven't heard of my story before, it's basically Harry Potter living life where Voldemort does not exist.

And for both those who have and haven't heard of it before, I'll now be notifying people of my new chapters at my Tumblr page.

P.S. If you actually do like my story and want to continue reading it, I'll need you to review it. The quality of the story is completely based on what your feedback. And the lack of writer's block will be dependent on your ideas for the plot.
