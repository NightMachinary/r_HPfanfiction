** [[https://youtu.be/1zkD-R24nc4][Benny Hill Chase]] should work (sorry for the quality, but it's an old video). [[https://youtu.be/0cFucXYlw94][This one]] has much better quality.

Now, [[https://youtu.be/LxpBUsfu-Ww][Victory by Two Steps From Hell]] is really good. I also like their [[https://youtu.be/gssUh_QE6BY][Star Sky]].
