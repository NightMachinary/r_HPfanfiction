:END:
I only remember it was a 'Harry back in time' kind of fiction and that Harry always reminded Cedric Diggory of 'graveyards' and 'run like hell'.... Sorry if it isn't much but that's all I remember

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.
