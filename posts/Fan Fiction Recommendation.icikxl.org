I recently finished reading Grow young with me and wanted to know if there were similar fiction like that where Harry is an adult and falls for a muggle or something familiar to Grow young with me?


** To me, Abby being a muggle is only half of what makes the story. The other half is how Harry is (not entirely) coping with losing Ginny and raising his children alone. The main significance of her being a muggle, I think, is that she's a complete stranger to his life, and remains so for a while because he has to keep secrets from her.

Sorry, though, I don't have any similar recs.

** I've been reading Grow Young with Me because it's been mentioned in quite a few threads recently, it's making me bawl. So thanks /s

linkffn(3461008) is a fantastic read. It's a Harmony from Ron's POV, it doesn't have Harry fall in love with a Muggle after, however it does have the same theme of dealing with (or no being able to) the loss of his love.

  Waiting. He was always waiting. He'd already buried one best friend and now the other will follow. There was nothing he could do or say. There was no Harry without Hermione. Ron witnessed the beginning and now he must accept the end. HHr. 4parts Complete!
