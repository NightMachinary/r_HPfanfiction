How do you all do Chapters titles? Just with numbers, titles or dates? I've been doing titles but I'm thinking dates would be interesting as well.


** Personally, I think chapter titles are a very underutilized tool in fanfiction. They have the ability to create interest for the reader in a way that chapter numbers really struggle.

Of course it depends on the fic. Light-hearted ones don't really need it, but it can be useful for comedic purposes (0800-Rent-A-Hero comes to mind). For an intensely plot-driven fic, I think chapter titles are an indication of how well your story is structured. If you can't think of an appropriate title for a chapter then it's a good indication that your story isn't well structured and the chapter probably isn't achieving much.

Canon does a good job of this. When you read and you get to the chapter called /The Chamber of Secrets/ Or /The Heir of Slytherin/ you've been teased about what this chapter means for the while story, so you, as a reader, are immediately interested in the chapter. Again, there's the fact that a proper title could increase the tension so much as well. I'll just say /The Only One He Ever Feared/ to drive that point home.

So yeah, I think chapter titles are very useful

** I used to use them, but I realised the amount of time I spent agonising over them was a complete waste so I just keep it simple with chapter numbers now.

** I use titles - usually one or two words long. I often use dates and locations in the "scene headers", though.

** Never thought of using dates --- but of course, my story is pretty damn linear, timeline-wise. I just use numebered titles.

** I use numbers and titles, like so: Chapter Two ~ Swan Chick

They're usually relevant to the chapter or nerdy jokes/puns.

** It depends on the fic. Different stories have different feels, and the style of chapter title can help define that vibe somewhat.

** My chapters are sometimes named after things which are apt for the chapter or for the quotes I put in them.

Mostly they are the names of applicable tarot cards.
