I'm feeling it today! I read so many fanfics in that damn quarantine, (literally it's been many months since I only read fanfic, I even stopped watching series and anime) I get a little discouraged, because I fear that at some point I really will have read all the good ones and then I will be without nothing to read. Do you feel that too? Let me know!


** The fandom is definitely slowing down, it seems. There's less great stuff coming out / getting completed. At some point I suppose we'll all have to go back to "real" fiction.

*** This is the cycle unfortunately, stretched only by the popularity of the base series.

I originally got into fanfiction in 2001, with Final Fantasy 7 and 8 fanfiction being my main jam, there are to this day some of the best fics ive ever read in that fandom, but the fandom died off for obvious reasons. Then i slowly segued into Naruto and HP fanfiction and a few weeks ago fell into the dark abyss of Worm fanfiction which is now keeping me sustained!

But yeah, Fandoms come and go, but theres always another fandom to get sucked into if you keep an open mind! I only discovered worm 3 weeks ago and ive already read a ridiculous amount of fanfiction!

***** Yeah, I think I went through pretty much every notable wormfic (DNFing many of them) in 2-3 months. That fandom notoriously has a high percentage of incomplete fics as well, and many of the long ones are incredibly slow-paced and don't really go anywhere.

****** For anyone who hasn't read it and likes both, I recommend [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/felix-fortuna-worm-hp.56551/threadmarks][Felix Fortuna]], updated every now and again. For those who are only on the HP side, it's an insert with Contessa, a 'background' character from Worm (In that she's largely responsible for the entire setting being the shitfight it is, because her superpower is a precog who asks questions like "How do I do X" and gets a step by step answer) as a mind wiped child version of herself, starting in the year of Prisoner of Azkaban.

It's pretty great and manages to avoid the pitfalls that sort of power could lay in the story.

******* I think I started it and DNFed, can't remember why. I'll give it another try.

Edit: I definitely read all of it, pretty solid fic. The worm and HP fanfic traditions, so to speak, are so different though that every cross I've read feels incredibly awkward to an extent. FF is very much a worm fic and the worm stuff I really like (Absolution, Atonement/Intrepid, Shamus) is not very representative of the Worm fandom anyway, so YMMV.

** I've been reading HP fanfic on and off since before OOTP came out. Its my main fare when it comes to any sort of lit and I really read a lot.

I know for a fact that I will never ever run out of good HP fics to read as long as I am flexible in regards to the main characters of the story and story length.

There are so many good snack-sized ficlets under 10k you could spent years doing nothing but going through them.

I personally have a "to read" list that will probably get me through another quarantine just from checking this sub every second day or so and bookmarking fics others have recommended.

I am so desperate that I started writing fanfic, so that someday in the future when I want to read something, hopefully I will forget the story I wrote, and read it as if it were something new. Judge me, I'm going crazy. HAHHAHAHA

** The more you read the more you get idea of things you really like and things you don't like at all. Also, you get idea of what is a really good fic, what's only a good idea but poorly realised and what's just plain sh**..

Ten years ago I started with fanfiction that was in my first language and slowly transitioned into English ones. Now it seems I can't even see the Czech fics, I just automatically skip them and focus on any in English.

To not get mind numbingly bored of the HP fanfiction I started with crossowers and then into totally different fictions and it served me well. I always come back to Harry Potter in the end but I'm not always desperate for brilliant stories anymore..

But what's the worst is starting a fic, finding it utterly fascinating and fabulous and realising that it cuts of in half of the story and last update was in year 2011.. That's the kill me now sort of a feeling.

** Yeah not going to lie, been reading on a major Fanfic binge for two years now? My sister thinks I've lost it. Mad woman. Love her though.

But yeah, there really isn't anything left to read. I've gone from Harmony to every other pairing that won't make me sick, to hating Hermione. Read everything I could. Now I just wait for updates, which get slower and less frequent with time. Read really boring fics sometimes just cause they update regularly.

So yeah I get where you're coming from but don't stress about it too much. At certain points you'll find booms in the Fanfic community, with new fics being written and completed fast, certain pairings gaining more steam and then dying down for some time, only to restart again. Like the flowerpot ship booming last month. Harmony usually comes to the forefront in November in my experience.

Also, idk about other fandoms. Well other than maybe PJO, which has nearly completely died, but HP due to its popularity and agelessness, might lose hype and steam, but it'll never fully die like PJO, ASOIAF, GOT etc.

** I'm lucky in that regard since compared to most of you I'm relatively new to HP fanfics, having started early 2020.

I do fully understand where you are coming from though, since I went through that with ASOIAF fanfics. Due to no new book having come out in over 9 years and the show having a shit ending, ASOIAF fanfics seem to have come to a blinding halt. Two of my favourites have been abandoned, and three more haven't updated in over a year, and are therefore most likely also abandoned.

A balanced diet of Litrpg, quests, historical SIs and fanfics keep me occupied, there's always more things to find and new stories being written if you cast your net wide enough.

Locking yourself into just the HP Fandom, or just fanfiction in general will mean you MAY end up consuming faster than it can be produced and you'll miss out on the best of the rest.

  Eu entendo perfeitamente de onde você está vindo, já que passei por isso com fanfics da ASOIAF. Devido ao fato de nenhum novo livro ter saído em mais de 9 anos e o show ter um final de merda, as fanfics da ASOIAF parecem ter parado de forma cega. Dois dos meus favoritos foram abandonados e outros três não são atualizados há mais de um ano e, portanto, provavelmente também foram abandonados.
