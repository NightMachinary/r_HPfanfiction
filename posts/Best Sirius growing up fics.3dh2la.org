Just read through [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1155970/chapters/2345019][The Other Side]] by ChapterEight, and I'm hankering for more stories that focus on Sirius growing up, and breaking away from his blood-purist family. Long novel-length and canon-compliant preferred, but I'll check out anything if it's good.


** My favorite genre!

I highly recommend lupinslittlesis's series about Sirius. The first one is called Deny Thy Father. Link: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/lupinslittlesister/DTF.html]]

Also amazing (but dark) is NyxFix's A Feast in Azkaban, one of my all time favorite fics. linkffn([[https://fanfiction.net/s/2454211/1/A-Feast-in-Azkaban]])

I'll try to think of more!

And sorry my linking is strange. I'm new to this subreddit, and on mobile. :/

  How did Sirius Black Spend twelve years in Azkaban and come out relatively sane, when others in his situation went mad or died of despair in a matter of weeks? Complete, now in chapters, mature material, SBRL slash, but mostly gen

*** LOVED A Feast In Azkaban- just read the whole thing yesterday. I didn't even realize it was pre-HBP until they mentioned Snape as a pureblood, so I went back and checked the publishing date. Fantastic fic, really well written and interesting narrative style.

Got anything else? :D

** you'll want shoebox project and the life and times, though both are slightly more centered on james. you still get some really excellent characterizations of sirius

**** sorry this is totally another where sirius is kinda peripheral but I figure if you don't get a good answer you may be desperate -- I think the author is cgner? really AU stuff, total classics, only slightly about sirius unfortunately

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)

*** Is this the one where Harry is reincarnated as Sirius's older brother? I think something turned me off it, or maybe I just fell asleep, but I'll give it another shot! Thanks!
