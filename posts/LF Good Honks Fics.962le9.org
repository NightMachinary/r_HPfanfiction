** The best ones I've read are the ones by Chelseyb; Harry Potter and the Halfblood Auror and The Rebel and The Chosen. You might have to search for it though because I think the author already deleted them. I got my copy from somewhere around this sub. There's also Harry Potter And The Summer Of Change by lorddwar. Most of the other Honks fic I've read are just poorly written smut fics.

**** They're super generic. Rebel and the Chosen is essentially just canon with Tonk's name attached and everything happens the exact same way, essentially make her presence redundant. The other fic is slightly better, but is bogged down with a bunch of side characters that fight for screen time and get in the way of anything interesting.

-edit- to clarify, if the only thing you care about is Tonk's name appearing in the same paragraph as Harry's sometime, then they're the prefect fics for you, since there's just no substance to any of them.

** linkffn(12188150) is my favorite.

Honestly, I find this pairing hard too read. The most common approach seems to be "Harry is a Metamorph" , which tend to be poorly executed power fantasies. The character benefits little from such power, and when he does it usually works better as "studies hard and learns advanced magic" over "born with super magic"

The other approach seems to be handwaving Tonks age away. Also generally not a sign of a good story. Usually because they want to do the romance during the school year.

As for what does work, Time Travel works pretty well to put different generations together. Sands is the best of them, and ironically it doesn't use time travel to close the age Gap (Tonks uses her powers to de-age herself).

I also recall a decent-but-not-great story where War!Harry gets thrown back to first year, has to avoid his 12 year old self while he averts the war, adopts an alias and joins the Aurors with Cadet Tonks. As I said, decent but not noteworthy.

There was also one that had Harry+Teddy+Andromeda pop in from another dimension into the past, and Tonks falls for him. I recall decent writing but a bit of a anti-climantic ending.

Things I haven't seen (done well anyway) so far:

- Tonks survives Hogwarts Battle, Honks later where the age difference matters less (25 v 32 less creepy than 16x23)
- TonksxHermione (or for that matter, TonksxRon. How would that even work)

It's hard to write as well. You have to balance the imbalance such a relationship would have (age, experience, responsibilities) and the only thing you can ignore is financial dependency since you can either make the Potters loaded or have Sirius drop Harry a neat sum.

I'm writing one right now and it challenges me to come up with some creative solutions for these issues. Harry's difficult past makes him more mature, but even that has its limits. I'm trying to circumvent that by having the story begin during late 1996, which makes Harry 16 1/2 and then build the relationship from a friendship and lust (and a little alcohol to kickstart things), but it's still more difficult than writing a relationship between Harry and a classmate.

** How about this one? Linkffn(2079353)

I really enjoyed it, and although it's not a top tier fic by any means, it's still well written. It also hits on a couple of my favorite fanfic topics: time travel, and unspeakables.

** Renegade Cause by Silens Cursor isn't terrible. It's pretty long and detailed, and towards the end the author explains Harry's OOC behavior and how Tonks' attraction to Harry grew despite the age gap and lack of common ground between them.
