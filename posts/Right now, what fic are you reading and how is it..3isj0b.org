I'm currently in the middle of re-reading Linkffn(Keep This Wolf by Lomonaaeren) and was wondering what the last fic the rest of you last looked at was?

How is the fic so far and do you think your gonna finish it?


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10914042/1/Sympathetic-Properties][Sympathetic Properties]]).

To be honest, I almost quit immediately after reading the A/N in the first chapter (the author must have been channeling some unholy combination of Percy and Lockhart while writing that), but it's proven to be an interesting fic with original ideas. My major complaint is that every single character seems to be a tad... neurotic.

** I'm currently reading linkffn(Another Dream by dragoon811) SS/HG

How is it: Well, so far it's a cute romance fic but the plot has been a bit bland, honestly. Snape's character is only okay but granted, voiceless Snape is probably a bit hard for an author to pull off (Snape lost his voice due to Nagini's attack). I might read another chapter or two to see if the plot picks up but if not, I'm going to change to a different fic.

*** This is one of my absolute favorite Ss/ Hg! It is not an 'exciting' fic, but it's one of my favorite romances. IMO both Hermione and Snape are very well-written, and their relationship progresses like a normal relationship. I've read my fair share of Marriage Law fics and forbidden teacher/ student fics, but it's nice to read one where the war is over and everyone has a relatively normal life. Plus, no bashing (that I can recall at least).

**** I agree it appears to be a very good romance fic. But personally, I like a bit of drama with my romance so it's not exactly the type of fic that I prefer. I don't know, I used to like character driven fics more in the past (like Loten's Post Tenebras, Lux) but not sure what happened LOL. Anyway, high-five to another SS/HG reader! :)

** Reading linkffn(Burnt by lastcrazyhorn) which was suggested recently somewhere around here.

Bad points: It is clear that the author likes slash, but as long as he does not let it bleed too much in his writing it's no problem. Secondly, Severitus. If that is a negative or not depends on how heavily the writer will come onto that element and from which angle. Don't know yet.

Postive elements: good writing. Nice premise with a disabled Harry coming to Hogwarts. I guess it is enjoyable seeing him overcome those hurdles.

  AU. Harry is blinded in an accident at a young age and then disappears from the watchful eye of the Order. What happens when he reappears in the wizarding world? What dangers will he face? No horcruxes and Voldemort is dead. Warnings for some descriptions of child abuse and the aftereffects, nothing too violent. Rating may be a little higher than necessary.

** I just finished "The Changeling," about a Slytherin Ginny. The beginning was written quite a while ago, but it's still updating. It's all right in the first few chapters, but quickly the quality starts to improve, and now where it's left off it's excellent. Great characterization and OCs that contribute to the plot and aren't annoying.

** Well, I'm reading Taking Control for like the 4th time. I knew the sequel, Free Life, was abandoned but had no idea that another author had picked up where fake-a-smile had left off and finished it with Prevailing Counterpoint. It's gotten good reviews so I'm pretty stoked to finally see a conclusion.

**** That's a good question. It seems like a decent size though I doubt it's as big as Taking Control.

** linkffn(The Sword and the Sorcerer by 50caliberchaos).

So, fridging a character is when you kill off one character, typically in a gruesome manner, to give another character a bit of growth. The dead character's almost always a woman, and the character who grows is almost always a man. The death doesn't give any character growth or anything like that to the character who died.

This book has instead, early on, a woman who dies in a gruesome manner. It feels like it's a fridging. Except nobody has any character growth as a result. The specific incident is at least alluded to in canon, but the inclusion of it seems kind of pointless.
