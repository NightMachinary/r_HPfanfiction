What, when you see it, keeps you coming back to a story? Enraptures you and keeps you reading? What turns you on in a fic?

You're welcome, [[/u/Taure]]

It needs to have some level of intelligence to it. Interesting ideas, interesting writing. Flow. Memorable moments. Suspense. Tension. Sharp angles and soft curves. Characters acting for their own interests. Treachery and loyalty. Honesty and lies.

None of that stuff above is important though. I just need it to be more entertaining than irritating.

Nothing, I'm an actual person, not words to be assembled in some word processor and posted on the internet.

*** It turns me on when the fanfiction is written like the original books and respects canon . It must be clear from every sentence that the writer is a FAN, not someone arrogant who thinks "I can write those crap books that happen to have some good characters better in 2 like 2 seconds"

***** Well, that was the question wasn't it! Not literally, unless it's smut, but I almost never read that.

**** It's not that I think it is neccessary to have the same writing style as the books, but for me the story needs to recreate that magical feeling, so with more magical than muggle elements at least. Of course there are always exceptions but that's what I prefer. Even when it's about muggles, then it needs to be made clear how theyre different from magical characters... Unless it's a Muggle AU, but I only like those if the characters are still very recognizable, otherwise you could as well have written an all original story about muggles

This was clever, but 'interesting writing' is just a stock phrase. What do you mean by that specifically?

**** It is just a stock phrase, but I lacked a concise way to put it. Authorial Voice may be a better way to put it, but something interesting and not boring. For example: Even with all of its faults, I greatly enjoy Bungle in the Jungle because I find the writing/authorial voice in it interesting. I doubt I would find it anywhere near as enjoyable in Third or First Person. Barefoot, while it has a super!Harry/human!Hedwig/Harry-Tonks-relationshipthingy-when-Harry's-12 has both an interesting idea (what if Harry was psychometric?) and interesting writing (present tense).

*** I usually have better grammar, but I had class all day with little sleep. I chuckled though.

** A plot that basically works as an Imperius curse, such as /The Son of Lord Voldemort/. I've read that story at least a dozen times.

** A promising blurb and first chapter gets me started. Harry actually being the son of death eaters, a time travel story where Harry doesn't instantly befriends his old friends (90's) or his parents (70's) or whatever, or an interesting pairing (as in, not Hermione or Ginny) that isn't slash, etc.

If it lives up to the promising start, and the grammar, spelling and punctuation are decent, and the language isn't too American (unless there's a good reason for it to be, like in Harry McGonagall) or non-native, I'll keep reading it. OOC behaviour ruins it though, like Ginny trying to slip Harry love potions, Ron holding grudges for more than a few weeks, etc.

** Pairing (so no Hermione/Draco or Snape or worse: Slash!), world-view matches my own (I admit I can't handle it if some sort of agenda is pushed...feminism for example...hate it when say Harry is completely dominated (no, not in the BDSM-Sense - not that I like BDSM, in fact I dislike it strongly because I myself could never submit to someone (I hate being in a position of weakness! No you can't convince me that being submissive is not being weak - you may disagree with my, but that's one of the things I will not give ground on!) and I don't feel the urge to be completely dominant either...a partner is supposed to be an equal, not either a plaything or a boss! If I want either I'll buy as plastic doll and start another job) by his girlfriend (often Hermione) or men are constantly being made fun off etc.), good writing, nice topic, unique (or at least memorable) story-telling and an idea that sets it appart (or if it's a re-telling of something I've more or less read already: Then it's even more up to the quality of the writing!)
