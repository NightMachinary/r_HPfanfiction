Because Blood Magic is the kind of scary-dark stuff that makes all other scary-dark stuff look like a First Year Charms lesson; and Albus Dumbledore is sick with fear over what the more nefarious elements of the Ministry could potentially do with access to Harry's blood.


** I feel like fanon blood magic is magic using blood as a catalyst. Yes this magic didnt harm anyone, but it was still blood magic. You cant just say its magic using blood that hurts someone, because im pretty sure most of fanon uses these quills to sign contracts and thats it. So they wouldnt be considered blood magic either at that point.

*** Fanon and bad fanon at that.

Yes, there were powerful protections on Harry due to Lily's sacrifice, and yes, the protections extended to where he lived and those he lived with (maternal family), but wards? Dumbledore casting protections based on "blood magic"? Bad, bad fanon that's a staple of bad, bad Indie-Harry fics.

**** To be fair, part of Harry's protection did come from Dumbledore's actions:

#+begin_quote
  ‘But she took you,' Dumbledore cut across him. ‘She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.'
#+end_quote

--HPOotP, ch 37.

Basically, Lily's sacrifice gave Harry his innate protection against Voldemort, including the whole touch-burn-thing and the reason why Harry eventually survived the second Killing Curse (Voldemort took in Harry's blood in the graveyard, hence inadvertently making himself a vessel to sustain Lily's protection from there on out).

But Dumbledore's actions largely led to Harry being protected at number four, as Dumbledore delivered Harry, did some unknown spell (commonly called the Bond of Blood Charm), and made the pact with Petunia.

***** A charm involving blood does not equate to fanon blood magics and blood wards, though. It's one instance of a charm involving blood, manipulating magics that even Dumbledore didn't fully understand.

****** It doesn't have to be blood magic at all. Using Occam's razor, the SIMPLEST explanation is sympathetic magic involving those linked by blood.

Because blood wards? Would need blood. Unless they're saying Dumbledore was callous enough to drain Lily's lifeless body to have the necessary ingredient---which I /have/ seen. (And Dumbledore described it as a charm, if I recall correctly, which doesn't take ingredients. Adding blood would make it a ritual, surely?)

******* Good point -- using blood would make it a ritual. We see it in canon when Wormtail takes Harry's blood at the graveyard.

This makes more sense, yeah.

***** I mean, it's repeated throughout the books that the important part of the charm is the acknowledgment of a relationship and house freely given, so blood here is much more of a metaphor than the usual fanon blood magic and whatnot
