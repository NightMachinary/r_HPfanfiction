By this I mean that the muggles attack wizards and all wizards fight back. Not dark wizards trying to kill all the muggles and light wizards fighting back with muggles.


** Oh i'm looking for the same fic like you. I'm hoping for the answer too. I read a fic a couple of years ago that has this "war with muggle" thing happing with Harry being turn into a magical creature but saddly the name does not stick with my brain.(sorry for the false alarm mate)
