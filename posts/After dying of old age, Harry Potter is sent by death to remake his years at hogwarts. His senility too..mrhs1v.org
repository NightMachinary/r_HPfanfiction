Or Harry has already partially lost the Sense of reality and it has not changed in his new young body.

He constantly mistaken draco for his half-Weasley half-Malfoy grandson, and keeps forgetting which Dark Lord it is alive right now.

"Wait, Longbottom? He's not in Azkaban yet?"

"What? Why?"

"I uh ... thought I read an article about a Longbottom that was in Azkaban for a few dozen gmurders, must be misremembering."


** Ron Weasley wasn't sure what he should make out of Harry Potter. He met the other boy at the train and it was very nice to spend time with him. For the first time in Rons short live somebody actually listened to him when he told storys about his favorite quidditch team or his favorite chocolate frog cards. During the whole train ride Harry sat there, smiled and listened. What was a little bit irritating was that Harry called him Arti the whole time. But being the sixth son Ron started to react to every name that's called in his direction so he doesn't complain. (Not much, at least. Sometimes it's disappointing when your mother needs two or three tries to get your name right).

Anyway, Harry was a nice bloke. He even bought sweets on the train. He did sound a little bit like Grandpa Septimus when he said: "Don't eat them all at once." But they had fun eating them. That was until Malfoy turned up. Malfoy was a git... but Harrys reaction to the other boy was weird too. After Malfoy made fun of Ron and his family Potter said: "I am really disappointed in you two. You are great-cousins - family really - you shouldn't fight."

And while Harry was right - Rons Grandmother was a Black as much as was Malfoys Mother - they didn't talk about that. Nobody did - not their fathers or their grandparents. There was a mutual agreement about that (after all: you can't choose your family). At least Malfoy fled the compartment after that.

It only got weirder after that. There was this boy - Neville Longbottom - Harry called him Frankie - who searched for his toad. When he opened the door, Harry fired a spell, called him a f*cking Dark Lord who doesn't learn and said that this time they would take him to Nurmengard when Askaban couldn't hold him. It was scary - really - Neville even start crying when Harry pressed his wand against his throat. Luckily a prefect came and stunned Harry in the back. After they arrived Hogsmeade a teacher already waited for them. He woke up Harry and had the most peculiar reaction yet.

"Oh, I must be dead", Harry said to the teacher. "I am sorry Riddle killed you. I named my son after you. Ginny said I am crazy because you were a total git - but I think you deserve a Potter named after you. When I said that Ginny suddenly was okay with it. At least I think so. She stopped laughing after half an hour. But she really has no room to judge. She called an owl Pig."

Ron was sure he never saw a grown up man more horrified than that teacher after this words. The teacher then stunned Harry again and levitated him to the castle. While Ron was on the boat with Neville - who assured them he wasn't a Dark Lord, really - Ron thought that maybe taking a killing curse at age one makes you a little bit crazy.

*** Part 2:

Hermione Granger was furious. It just wasn't fair. Harry Potter was a nuisance, really. First there was the incident on the train with Neville. The poor boy still didn't dare sleeping in his dormitory because Potter attacked him half the time when he saw him. Then there was the fact that Potter would miss half of their lessons if Ron Weasley didn't keep dragging him with him.

An even worse habit, however, was that he addressed some teachers by their first names. How many points they had already lost because of his lack of punctuality and his disrespect! Hermione couldn't win as many points as Harry lost them. It was like he didn't care about school at all.

The worst of all, however, was that despite his ignorance he managed every spell first and got every potion straight away as if he'd been doing it all his life. He didn't even bother!

But this time she would show him. Professor Flitwick had said that that day they would finally make objects fly. She'd spent every free minute in the library - even skipped lunch and broke the school rules that you weren't allowed to do magic outside of class so she could do the spell perfectly. This time she would be better than him.

So Hermione was sitting in the classroom with a wide grin when Flitwick started handing them the feathers. They were divided into groups of two and Hermione sat right next to Potter. Everyone should see that hard work beats lazy talent.

While they waited for Flitwick to let them begin, she heard Potter mutter, "I forgot something ... but what? There was something, I am sure...“

Hermione ignored him. When Flitwick said they should start, she cleared her throat and said, "I'll start."

Potter didn't even seem to notice her. He looked as if she had pulled him out of a deep thought. „What are we doing?" He asked. Hermione felt like she was bursting with anger.

She hissed: “The levitation spell! We are currently learning the spell for levitation!"

"Oh, that“, said Potter. And without actually swishing and flicking or saying the spell at all, he tapped the quill ... and the damn thing flew. Flitwick turned to them and said: „Oh well done. See here everyone. Mister Potter has done it. Splendid. Well done, my boy! Talented like your mother! Five Point to Gryffindor.“

Hermione felt tears well up in her eyes. Furious she pointed her wand at the feather and shouted: "WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA!" Suddenly there was a loud bang and the feather in front of her exploded. All the students turned to her and started laughing. Hermione couldn't take it any longer and ran away. She hated Potter, she hated him with all her heart.

She didn't know how long she had been crying in the girls' bathroom when she suddenly got a terrible stench in her nose. She looked outside to see where the stench was coming from and screamed. In front of her stood a huge mountain troll with legs as thick as tree trunks and a club bigger than her body. She wanted to run away, but her legs didn't obey. Suddenly the girl's bathroom door flew open and Potter rushed in.

"I remembered!" He shouted, then pointed his wand at the troll and screamed: "Sectum Sempra!"

The spell hit the troll right on the neck. For a moment it was as if time stood still ... then the head slipped off his shoulders and hit the floor next to her with a loud splash. Hermione looked from the troll's lifeless eyes to the broadly grinning Potter ... and passed out.

**** Part 3:

“Come here, Potter!” Professor Quirrell did not stutter at all. If anything, his voice sounded stronger and more sinister than Snape.

“No,” Harry said.

Quirrell muttered. “Master...”

“Let me face him.” Trembling, Quirrell turned around and removed his turban until it was the disembodied face of Voldemort facing the boy. “Harry Potter! You will come here!”

“No,” Harry said. “And since when did you have a nose?”

“What? Come here, or I shall curse you.”

“No.”

“But...why not?”

“I don't wanna.”

“But I have a wand.”

“I don't care.”

Voldemort began muttered to Quirrell. “More of my curse must of hit him than I remembered. Imperio the boy!”

Quirrell spun about and cursed Harry with the most insidious of the Unforgivables. “Come here!”

Harry blinked and obediently walked to the mirror. “Tell us, boy! What do you see?”

Harry had a goofy grin. “The day Ginny told me I was going to be a daddy.”

“What?” “What!?”

As the two stared dumbfounded at the mirror, Harry snapped up his hand into Professor Quirrell's crotch and shouted, “Explodies Testes!”

The resulting screams woke the entire castle.

Two hours later:

“Harry, my boy, I'm so proud of you,” Dumbledore said they spoke in his office. “But where did you learn that...effective spell?”

“My daughter brought home a lot of boys. It was a good way to deal with the ones that weren't right,” Harry said. “So, why didn't I ever know you were putting Flomax in your lemon drops?”

DUmbledore twinkled his eyes. “You'll understand when you get older.”

“IN other words, Pomfrey doesn't have a spell for bad prostates.”

DUmbledore sighed. “Alas, no.”

AN---Not sure it's funny. It's been years since I've written any HP. But it was a fun prompt.
