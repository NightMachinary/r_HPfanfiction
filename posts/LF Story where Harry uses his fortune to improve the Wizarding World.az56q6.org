I want to see a fanfiction where after the War Harry uses his fortune to fix the Wizarding World by building orphanages, changing laws, renovating Diagon Alley and Knocturn Alley into cleaner and safer places to shop, maybe developing new ways of magical lighting and so on. Anyone know of anything like that?


** linkffn(13022013) is a pretty good fic but seems to drag on at times a little bit.

** *self-promotion*

In the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12191520/1/The-Last-Mage-Of-Krypton][Last Mage of Krypton]] series, Harry (with help from his Kryptonian AI assistant) starts up a company called Evans Enterprises and among other things re-opens the Tegg's Nose Cavern as a Wizarding shopping area. Sirius Black later joins in the fun with Blackwolf Industries (buying up several companies including a few publishers) while seeing his family's position at the top of the financial heap threatened, Draco Malfoy scrambles to set up his own umbrella corporation, White Wing Artificers.

All three end up co-operating to set up a massive magical theme park named after Sirius' brother.

Note- In the third story, Voldie and Grindlewald go on a road trip around America. Oddly, this is /not/ played for laughs...
