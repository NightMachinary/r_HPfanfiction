#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin is reborn as Hermione Granger. With her new identity as a muggleborn girl and her old reputation in tatters, Hermione sets out to start a new life for herself, a resurrection for House Slytherin, and a renaissance for the whole of the magical society.

It's on a hiatus right now while the author works on the next story arc, the equivalent of /Order of the Phoenix/, but it's great.

** Not necessarily dark, Hermione is morally grey in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24935455][tired of fighting the good fight]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/orphan_account/pseuds/orphan_account][orphan_account]].

She is actually dark in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29583573][If Only One Remembers to Turn On a Light]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/EscapingArtist/pseuds/EscapingArtist][EscapingArtist]]

And she's morally grey in [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15234645][Coven]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Naidhe/pseuds/Naidhe][Naidhe]] which has one of the best-written Hermione I've ever read but is sadly abandoned.

  Hermione liked to talk, but she knew that sometimes her fists were more effective than her words.

  “The problem here, professor Dumbledore, is that you keep wondering what my position on the board is. I started off as your pawn, then at some point I became a useful bishop; but suddenly you see yourself wondering if I might not just be the black queen.” Hermione looked at him then, and smiled softly, “And what you don't realize is that we're not playing chess anymore.”
