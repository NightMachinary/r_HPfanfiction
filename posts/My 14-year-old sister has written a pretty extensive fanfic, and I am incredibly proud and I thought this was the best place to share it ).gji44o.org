** So the picture preview only shows half the girls face. When i saw it, i thought is was kristen Stewart. From that perspective my first thought was "Is this a twilight crossover, where Harry and Draco try to find out why Cedric got turned into a vampire?"

** Aah her writing is so good for her age! I'm so proud of her and I hope she continues to nurture this talent of hers. However, I've noticed areas that could use some proofreading. If she needs a beta let me know and I would be glad to check for spelling and grammar.

** For a 14 year old, it's good, I like the premise, just that her writing style needs to be developed a bit more and it would be perfect. Good job to your sister for putting her work out there!

** Well damn... I'll be honest, I was incredibly skeptical. Now that I've read through a good portion, I can say that while I'm not that personally interested in the fic's premise, I really look forward to any of her future works. Keep up the good work OP's sister, you will go far.
