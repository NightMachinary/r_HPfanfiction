On a more serious note, I doubt that Hermione would stand for what's basically glorified animal fights. You could certainly have a lot of new psycho and fairy type Pokemon from the HP universe (Cornish Pixies would be the new Rattata). And Hagrid would be the final trainer at Hogwarts.

*** So there are a couple ways to view this.

There's the realism/gritty/grimdark view where yeah forcing sentient creatures to fight each other is pretty horrifying, but these super powerful creatures when wild are also super dangerous for humans so having some humans become trainers is basically the only way humans don't get wiped out completely, so it's just the way it is. Especially if you view the disturbing facts from the Pokedex entries on many Pokemon as actual facts and not myths.

While interesting, and makes for some good fics, that is not in line with the general atmosphere in the actual games/cartoon, where everyone seems much more lighthearted and happy. A more canon compliant explanation imo is as follows, which I think Nintendo has basically made comments similar to this when asked about it. Most Pokemon really enjoy battling and getting stronger, and thus intentionally seek out trainers hoping to get captured so they can get more fighting opportunities and better training. The capture battle is intended for the trainer to prove to the Pokemon that they are would make a good trainer, and only then do the Pokemon let themselves be captured. Pokemon that don't want to be captured simply don't approach humans. Of course this somewhat contradicts some of the game mechanics, for example why would more expensive Pokeballs work better if Pokemon are only captured if they let themselves be.

**** I mean, I agree with you, but that argument sounds eerily similar to the "house elves like to work for humans because they need their magic" argument. Also, Hermione might not necessarily follow that logic.

***** I can totally see Hermione from canon going off on Pokemon battles if she was sent to a world with pokemon, But would a Hermione raised in a pokemon world see anything wrong with it?

****** It depends if Pokemon are a Muggle thing or not. If yes, then she should be fine. If Pokemon are a thing from the magical world, well, see canon House Elves.

*** I was personally planning on including the Scottish Trainer Meme in my fanfic, I was thinking maybe a relative? or Granddaughter? of McGonagall. Main downside of making it a relative is it makes the world feel smaller.

Good point on Hermione, I don't know what i'm going to do with that, I already have some skeleton of a plan, but that upsets things a bit.

**** The Scottish opinion out of the canon students is Morag McDougal. There was also an Isobel McDougal in early extended canon, but she disappeared at some point.

  They told Harry that magic was real, but had limits. He saw no reason why that had to be so. Why should you only be able to break some laws of nature and physics? He wanted a pet Pikachu -- but that was just the beginning. Powerful!Harry, Super!Harry, magical theory, Harry/Luna. Serious fic with a large serving of silliness & fun. Complete.
