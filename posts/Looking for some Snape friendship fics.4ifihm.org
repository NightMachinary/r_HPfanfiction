** You could try linkffn(Snape Chronicles). It's OOC and non-canon in the way that /everything/ Snape does is whitewashed. For example, he's bullied by his dormmates (though in canon he was friends with them), he's tricked into becoming a death eater (in canon he'd planned to join years before he actually did), etc. It does make Snape into a poor misunderstood guy, so there's some level of cordiality/truce with James Potter, Remus Lupin, and even Sirius Black (hence the OOCness). He's also good friends with the other professors and some Death Eaters.

It's a really well written and researched fic, over 600k words, and the whitewashing can be somewhat explained away since it's from Snape's (liminted third person) POV so the narrator's biased in that way.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
