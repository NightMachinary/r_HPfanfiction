So basically the Reptila 28's dont fear the reaper challenge but it is Hermione instead of Harry that goes back to fix things. Is there any stories like this?


** Well, not only Hermione, but also Harry and Snape, move to the past in “Reboot by Kallanit” linkffn(9552519).

  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** One thing I should have mentioned is that the three stories I mentioned (A Little Child Shall Lead Them, The Needs Of the One, and Many Thanks) all are Hermione Time Travel stories but do not have her meeting the grim reaper like Reptilia28.

I don't recall offhand any stories I have read just having Hermione meeting her grim reaper and returning to the past. In fact, is anyone aware of a Challenge like Reptilia28's but that has the twist of Hermione being the mc (e.g. has died multiple times, her grim reaper mad at her and her soul mate is some Potter guy)?

Now I did do a deeper search for Reptilia28 and did find a handful of stories where Hermione did meet the grim reaper and came back with Harry, (and sometimes a third girl/person). Reboot by Kassien was mentioned by someone else.

The other two I have read are:

Harry Potter - Three to Backstep by Sinyk has Harry, Hermione and Daphne come back. Now both girls did meet with their reapers but that was "off camera". However, they are both aware that they have come back prior to Harry kissing them.

Linkffn(10766595)

The Eighth Time is the Charm by madie080802 has both Harry and Hermione meeting with their respective grim reaper and getting tasks to complete when they are sent back.
