Hi

Read this one couple years ago, where the Weasley twins had a WW factory on Hogwarts grounds.

Ron & Hermione has a romantic dinner where he proposes to her, and they end up physically hurting each other. A very humourous scene. The cork from the wine bottle hitting Ron between the legs etc

Harry and the rest are watching on a magical wall in Hogwarts.

Thanks!


** Possibly these two:
