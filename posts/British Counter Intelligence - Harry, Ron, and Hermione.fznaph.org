:END:
I saw a story recommended long ago about Harry, Ron, and Hermione attending a school (or institute) that was similar to (or the same as) British counter intelligence, MI5 or MI6. However, I forgot the name of the story itself. Does anyone know which story this is, or does anyone have any other recommendations where Harry, Ron, and Hermione are part of some sort of British Intelligence Agency? It can be magical or non-magical, though I prefer to the former.


** There's DianeCastle's Hermione Granger and The Boy-Who-Lived, the classic non-magical AU of Hogwarts. [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm]]

*** Thanks for the reply! Is DianeCastle's story part of a series? Also, I never heard of The Secret World of Alex Mack. Does one need to have knowledge of that series to understand the story itself?

**** Nope! The story is set in that universe but you don't need to know anything about the series.

** linkao3(Operation Wandless by EllianaDunla) is slightly similar, but other way around. It is a cross-over (probably the only cross-over of HP, which I like, because it doesn't destroy JKR's universe) with the TV show “Spooks” about MI5. Two wizards and a witch work for MI5 and help them to resolve case which interests both sides. It is post-war and canonical, so Harry is somewhere in the background as the Head Auror and he is personally not much involved in the case. I am not sure whether Hermione and Ron make even appearance.

  Harry Potter has no idea what to do. His new Auror recruits are nothing short of hopeless. Then an idea hits him..."So, let me get this straight: we're supposed to show some wand-waving weirdos how to do our job?""Yes, that is the general idea."Or: failing Auror recruits get dumped with MI-5 to get a lesson in how spying is really done, and with cooperating magical and Muggle terrorists on the loose, working together might just be a necessity anyway.Set in Spooks season 5 and after the Deathly Hallows, but before the epilogue of Harry Potter
