Like, he finds some old book hidden in the back of Greenhouse 6 full of powerful plant manipulation magics; literal blades of grass, strangler figs, grabbing rose bushes, etcetera.

Or runic magic as it's seen in the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard. Where you take carved runestones, toss them up, and the combination of the runes meaning and the users intent you get a result, no complicated runic sentences and equations or anything like that.

Or cooking magic, potions more powerful but less traditional, and so was cast aside due to the lack of dingy dungeons and the cauldron lobbyists.


** Closest thing I can think of is linkffn(the poker game by Enterprise1701-d) harry picks up a few ancient magics and while the story is technically a harem it's not a smut filled one. More innuendo than anything else. Bit crack but it's a fun game

  Draco organizes a no-holds-barred poker game. Harry decides to compete... just a little fun fic co-written by Joshua. I might or might not write more on this.

  Curiosity killed the cat, satisfaction brought it back. Harry's curiosity leads him to exploring the Chamber a bit more thoroughly before he leaves for the Summer. What he finds there gives him a new responsibility beyond just himself and a lifelong satisfaction in the choices he makes from there on.

  The voices Harry heard, those no one else could, were the only ones that spoke kindly to him growing up. They had spread their whispers across the world to rescue him and at last, found a way- by creating a queen of serpents. The birth of the amber-eyed empress triggers a permanent change in Harry's life, as he enters a world of magic that seeks to either protect or destroy him.
