  It's a simple arrangement. Between her grueling quidditch schedule and his mysterious auror duties, Ginny and Harry find time to have spectacular sex with no strings attached. It's incredibly uncomplicated. Except when it isn't.

** Anyone have any good smut fic recommendations for where sex is enhanced by magic?

By this, I don't mean love potions, or charm spells, or using magic to get someone into bed.

I mean two consenting partners, using magic to make sex more fun - like the way quidditch is more magical than rugby. So much of the HP series was about using magic to make everything more interesting - whether it was snacks, photos, travel, etc.

This could be magical bondage, or transformations, or cloning, or something totally unexpected. Not looking for any one specific kink, just magic used in a sexy and consenting way.

It helps that they are a gay guy so the way they write slash is actually well accurate. Plus they write story and smut so its nice. I admit I mostly read him because I like that perspective the way he makes harry or othere go through discovering their sexuality is something I appreciate.

Oh and he doesnt Ron bash. He really likes Ron.

Warning he likes his cliches.

#+begin_quote
