If anyone base watched captain marvel, Carol and Maria is what I consider a strong female friendship. They're fully supportive, encouraging and confident in each other. It was so refreshing but there isn't such a friendship between female characters often so I was wondering if there were any that had them. Preferably no romance and any character, as well as OCs work.


** Might not be exactly what you're looking for but linkffn(Alexandra quick and the thorn circle) might be something. The second and third books have more in it I think.

** Is it tacky to rec your own work? One of the central themes of /bring on/ is female friendship and the main focus is a quartet between (female) Harry, Hermione, Sally-Anne, and Millicent that develops after they have to fight a troll together. It's basically 70k ode to the relationships that girls and women develop with each other and how important it is to nurture those and let them grow.

  Harriet Tonks wasn't completely ignorant of her past. She knew that she used to be a Potter, that her Lily-mum and her James-dad loved her very much, that her mums had been good friends, and that her ‘Dromeda-mum and Ted-dad had taken her after her parents had died.She knew how they had died, and why, and what people were calling her, even though she didn't like to think about it very much.And she also knew that she was supposed to be living with her aunt and uncle, but they hadn't wanted her. And that technically (“The technical sense being the most important, when you're trying to get out of trouble, pet,” Ted-dad always told her) her mum had stolen her.

*** People recommend their own stuff all the time, I don't think anyone really minds unless you do it constantly.

The story seems great, by the way, although I'm just a little bit in at this point. I'm honestly surprised I haven't found it before, it fits a few of my more common searches.

** I know exactly what you need:

/Faith and Understanding/ is my favorite fanfic of all time. Ginny and Luna's friendship, with Ginny's musings therein.

It's archived, so the format takes a minute to get used to, but this story is the among the greatest platonic love stories this fandom has to offer.

** I try to write that in my story Lily Bud, by giving Lily two female best friends, aside of Snape.

I follow Lily and them with her over the years. It is not completely without drama and there are moments of tension between them, they still respect and care for each other all the time.

But it is not always easy to find stories that really flesh out female friendships. That is one of the reasons why I write this story. Because girls and women can have these incredibly strong friendships and bonds, but it is often ignored or misrepresented in all kinds of media

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
