would prefer no angst but ill take what i can get


** Fem!Harry femslash is basically a niche inside a niche, so I'm gonna toss my own fic in here. There's not really any real romance yet --- and when it does happen, it'll be light. But my fem!Harry /is/ a lesbian.

  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Life never stops trying to tear her apart, but as everyone soon learns, Iris Potter bites back. Five unique tasks. Animagus and eventual reasonably powerful fem!Harry. Fourth year.

*** Certainly right about it being a niche! Last I read anything under this category were fics of Philosophize. Somehow I never came across your fic so I am looking forward to reading it!

** linkffn(Harriet Eilhart: The Sorceress) this is the most recent I think, this one might be femslash, because of the other fics the author wrote, but it is no guarantee linkffn(Her Mother's Love), there´s also linkffn(A Witch and an Amazon Walk into a Bar) it recently was completed.

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

  At the end of 5th year, Remus whisks Rose Potter away to America to rest and decompress, far from the demands of wizarding Britain. In Las Vegas, she meets someone else dealing with serious personal problems: Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman. The two get drunk together, and the next morning they find that they made bad decisions while inebriated. Or maybe not so bad after all?

  Albus still didn't fully understand what magic young Lily had wrought that night. At the time, he'd only been grateful her noble sacrifice had earned them peace, however temporary. He should have looked into it deeper. He should have done something. Unknowingly, long dead, that arrogant girl might just have ruined everything. (independent!GWL, black/white magic)
