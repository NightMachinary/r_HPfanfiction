NO INCEST!!! I've come across the DracoxNarciassa thing before and absolutely hate the pairing. Its disgusting. Would also prefer it to not be Draco in leather pants but if the story is good enough then its fine. I'm also not a fan of Dramione but yet again if the story is good I'll give it a try.

Are there any crossovers where he ends up in another universe? Its usually Harry as master of death going to different places so it would be interesting if Draco ends up somewhere different and if its during his Hogwarts years he could practically return appreciating muggles.


** One is Drarry, a pair that I don't ship, but the set up is extremely believable with solid writing so I love it. Another is a friendship story with Draco/Harry when they get caught by one of Voldemorts spells and get sent back in time 20 years and have to figure out how to survive till they can catch up to present day.

I enjoy Dramione and would be happy to send you a few more links if these are to your liking. On mobile at present and finding it difficult to sort through too many fics at a time.

** Does Drarry count? (Check ratings & tags before reading any of my suggestions, some are NSFW)

Bitter Transmutation: Cruel Transformation by DorothyAnn (Drarry Creature Fic) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19969309/chapters/47273539]]

All Life is Yours To Miss by Saras_Girl (one of my faves)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/825875/chapters/1568057]]

Actually, several of Saras_Girl's fics.

Whoo Knew by oceaxe is good, Draco & Harry are auror partners:

** Not a huge fan of universe hopping and crossovers, but here's a few Draco-centric stories:

  When eighteen-year-old Draco Malfoy finds himself back at Hogwarts on the eve of Voldemort's infamous return, he is confronted with the most difficult decision he's ever had to make: Fight for a cause he no longer believes in, or do the unthinkable and ally himself with Potter's lot... [Warning, Slowest burn EVER]

  This is losing themselves, but finding each other in the heart of a war. The story follows the lives of Astoria Greengrass and Draco Malfoy during the return of the Dark Lord, how they came to be and how they conquered their own demons. Before, during and after the Second Wizarding War. (A Drastoria Fanfic)
