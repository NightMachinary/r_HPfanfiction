I've been looking for a good next gen fic for a while but they are very hard to find so if you know any I would greatly appreciate it. I am okay with any pairings. I would love it if in the story you could see the next gen kids interaction with the adults.


** [[https://floreatcastellumposts.tumblr.com/NextGen][FloreatCastellum]] has a bunch of next gen ficlets that fit your request.

These are actually series of one shots though, and not really a single fic, like you requested.

(The link I've given is her tumblr page, as that's where the fics are)

  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
