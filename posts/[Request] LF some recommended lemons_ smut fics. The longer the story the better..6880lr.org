*** I'll happily second Debt of Time, it's a long ass story but well written and it might have a couple of well written raunchy spots in it.

** Fics by keira marcos always feature some smut along the way. They are generally well written, but somewhat cliche heavy.

There's also "Forever Knight" which AFAIR is pretty smutty in parts, but that was on portkey.

#+begin_quote
  Harry's world is flipped upside down when he is visited by a naked fairy on his fourteenth birthday. Finding out that he is a rare type of incubus known as a Choiceling is the least of his problems when he finds out just how drastically his life is about to change. How will young Harry manage an entire year at Hogwarts when he has to have sex at least once a day just to survive!
