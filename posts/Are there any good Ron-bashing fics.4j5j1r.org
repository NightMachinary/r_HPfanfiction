** 'Bashing' usually means taking the worst parts of a character, magnifying them, and then adding several other bad qualities without any of the (canon) good ones. It's a trait you generally don't find in good stories, not just because bashing makes stories worse, but because usually only bad stories add bashing. So, in short, there probably aren't any good /anyone/-bashing stories.

** I guess it depends on whether you like Ron bashing. As far as I'm concerned though, there is no good bashing fic at all.

*** My feelings on bashing are if you have a story with it in it, you should have just written the character out of the story by killing them off or moving them away.

** "Harry Potter and the Champion's Champion" is very funny and cracky, and has the worst portrayal of Ron in it I can remember off-hand.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** I loathe your request, but I'll honour it all the same. Here's two that might take your fancy. They happen to show both Harry and Hermione at their worst at certain points as well, so I'll just call that my silent protest, lol.

*** Fifth Element has bashing in it? I remember an awful subplot with D/G and love-potions!Ginny, but nothing about Ron bashing. Thanks for giving me another reason to not reread this story.

** I generally dislike bash fics, but there are always exceptions.

For example *The Accidental Bond*, linkffn(5604382), is heavy on Dumbledore/Molly/Ron bashing, but it's one of my top ten.

I also like *Hail Odysseus*, linkffn(10645463), a fic that bashes almost everyone [[/spoiler][only Sirius, Snape, and Grindelwald were portrayed positively beside the protagonists]]
