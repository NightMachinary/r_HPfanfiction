Example:

- Hermione/Lilers is the descendent of an ancient family renowned for their prowess.

- Pureebloods are literally better, like bloodlines, unique magics that only certain families can do, that sort of thing.

- Harry, as a half blood, isn't that competant, so obviously he needs to know that his mother was not just a pureeblood but an incredibly super powerful descendent of Merlain and King Arthur and is the heir to fucking everyone becuase fuck you that's why.

I enjoy these because the characters are contradicting themselves with nearly every action they take and the authors literally write them to be wrong but for some reason their idiocy never actually comes up and the authors at best brush over it. It's fascinating to me for whatever reason.


** "A Necessary Gift" has magic affinities being inherited through bloodlines, which muggleborns lack. So, when a pureblood marries a muggleborn, they end such lines.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

*** I think there's two reasons that wizards are a rarity:

One has to do with how the wizarding world is and has been very similar to modern societies that have low birth rates today for a very long time. and that leads into number two the mandatory integration of all muggleborns into the magical world to uphold The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy which leads the muggleborns to adopt simallr low birth rates to the rest of the wizarding world.

The Harry potter world would be a lot more wizard and witches being born if the wizarding world had left muggleborn wizards in the muggle world ignorant to magic.

If in 1692 along with the Statute of Wizarding Secrecy the wizarding world decided to start leaving muggleborn wizard in the muggle world. By the time that we got 1992 300 years later there would be millions of wizards.

Let's say you start off with just one muggleborn wizard in the year 1692 they go on to have 5 children with the majority of them being magical, and then his children go on to have 5 children each. Continue on threw the generation over the next 300 years with. Each child having an average of five children that is a lot of wizards.

It's like the wheat and the chessboard

If a chessboard were to have wheat placed upon each square such that one grain were placed on the first square, two on the second, four on the third, and so on (doubling the number of grains on each subsequent square), how many grains of wheat would be on the chessboard at the finish?

Edit: even if you only go foward ten generations that's still around 48828125 magical children from just one muggleborn and his descendants being left in the muggle world.

**** You're /way/ overestimating the fertility rate there. In countries and times where children almost never made it to adulthood, a super-high fertility rate was common, but so was a super high death rate. By the time the world really started advancing and the quality of life shot up, the birth rate also fell.

This also assumes that no magicals die before they can have children of their own, that every child is also magical, and that no magicals interbreed (a couple's children would have been counted twice by your calculations).

The tl;dr of it is that while it's possible that wizards would have had large numbers, they'd be nowhere near as big as you suggested. It's also possible that they get out-bred by muggles, who hog resources and force down the wizarding fertility rate.

I was also going off the assumption that magic is a evolutionary advantage that would help the children reach adulthood and therefore be more likely to reproduce.

Any way I was answering the question of why magic is not more widespread if it is such a good evolutionary advantage. The short answer is that when ever a child with magic pops up there immediately taken into the magical world and effectively romoved from the muggle worlds gene pool.

If the muggleborns were left in the muggle world and threw that there gene pool in under 20 generations magic would become the dominant type of human on the planet.

I would agree this is a relatively straight-forward definition of eugenics. Vague as shit (this isn't your fault, either, no one has ever been able to decide on a precise definition, so far as I know), and notwithstanding of implementation attempts throughout history, but not /inaccurate/.

But then you go on to somehow imply that society frowning on you sleeping with your sister is somehow controlled breeding.

There is a MASSIVE difference between selecting your partner based off of the chance of success of passing on desirable genes and aborting a child because the short life that they'll be able to live will be in agony. Or avoiding sleeping with people who're closely related to you, because it's known to cause birth defects.

You can argue all you want that it's a "weak form" or whatever, but it's just /not/.

***** The point is that the thing that makes animals not people is the difference in intelligence. By saying animals are not people you're basically reiterating the point that we set huge importance by intelligence. Animals have an internal mental life, they can feel pain, they can feel happiness, they form social groups. What they don't have is intelligence to the same level as us, and for that reason we say they are not people and therefore have fewer rights.

*** Well, let's pose this the other way.

Do you agree that sufficiently low IQ people maybe need less rights and responsibilities, are they less responsible for their actions if their IQ is super low?

Do they need to be give maybe a firm hand to be guided through life.

After all, while we need to take the mentally handicapped's wishes into account, at the end of the day, those with 'average' IQ really do know what's best, their 65 IQ really does rule out MIT, maybe we could get them into a good trade school, or they could bag groceries.

** A number of HP/Stargate crossovers depict magicals as descended from Ancients who crossbred with humans after returning from the Pegasus Galaxy. Too often Harry gets involved in things because he meets some "percentage" of Alteran genes that apparently no one else on Earth meets. This often bothers me since Ancients are depicted as "better" than other races ("evolutionarily"?), implying that magicals are too, to some extent.

I prefer the fics where magicals are actually just one of Hathor's experiments she abandoned when she left Earth with Ra.

*** honestly, for all we know regular house elves could die if they are freed. But not for a magical reason, but rather them not being able to cope with the shame of being freed and being unable to take care of themselves. Like Winky becoming an alcoholic and needing Dobbys support.

But this still wouldn't be a argument for slavery, but rather make it necessary to gradually change their mentality before freeing them.

*** I like the "paid/fed with magic" variant of this. Where house elves are basically magical symbiotes, working in exchange for magic (which they eat like food). Thus, they aren't /slaves,/ just employees who tend to get really shitty jobs with even shittier employers. It's usually never explicitly said to be as such, but I've seen a few stories with something like this being implied.

In these stories, it would be funny if there was someone who said something like, "Oh, just don't have more than two elves per wizard/witch in a home or they'll suck you dry." Or there's some old dude who's practically a muggle because he's got a dozen house elves working for him and they're taking all his magic.
