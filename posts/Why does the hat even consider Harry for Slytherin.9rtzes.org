I was thinking back on Harry's general behaviour and his sorting and then wondering why the Hat would even consider Harry fit for Slytherin? I'm not sure if it's the case but I don't think it's the partial Horcrux which would influence the Hat's proposition as it's not really active and not influencing Harry.

Harry isn't ambitious at all. With his fame he could begin to build something for later but he just want to be a unnoticed potted plant in the corner of the room. He doesn't specifically apply himself in his studies and when asked what path he wants to take after Hogwarts, it's shown that he hasn't even really thought about it. And let's not talk about elective choice.

Cunning? Meh as much as anyone I would think? He doesn't plan ahead, doesn't have escape or secondary plan if his first idea doesn't work. He could use his fame or cunning to get out of tricky situation (see his overall 5th year) or trap his opponents and as much as some say Malfoy shouldn't be in Slytherin with as much a braggart he is, at least Malfoy makes little ridiculous plan against Harry.

Self-preservation? Well when he's near death, yes he tries not to die but except that? No plans and contingency for when he goes on his "adventures". He runs half-cocked only surviving with his luck and Hermione's planning. He didn't even prepare or train before going after the Horcruxes. That was again all Hermione. He doesn't seem to understand the scale of the problems he's to confront and really deserves all his misadventures. The rare bit of working cunning feat I've seen from him was under luck potion.

In the end, even Ron would be more ambitious, Hermione more ambitious and cunning (even Romilda and her spiked chocolate is more devious) and Hermione and has more self-preservation.

So yeah, why would Harry even be fit for Slytherin?


** The "Pottercast" interviews with JKR contain a lot of answers to these sorts of questions.

#+begin_quote
  For convenience, I had Dumbledore say to Harry, "You were the Horcrux he never meant to make." But I think, by definition, a Horcrux has to be made intentionally. So, because Voldemort never went through the grotesque process that I imagined creates a Horcrux, with Harry, it was just that he had destabilized his soul so much that it split when he was hit by the back-firing curse. And so this part of it flies off and attaches to the only living thing in the room. A part of it flees in the very close-to-death limbo state that Voldemort then goes on and exists in. I suppose it's very close to being a Horcrux. But Harry was not-- did not become an evil object. He wasn't-- he didn't have curses upon him that the other Horcruxes had. He himself was not contaminated by carrying this bit of parasitic soul. The only time he ever felt it stirring and moving was in "Order of the Phoenix", when he himself goes through a very dark time. And there's a moment where he's looking at Dumbledore and he feels something rear like a snake inside him. And of course at those times, it's because the piece of soul inside him is feeding off his emotions. He's going through a dark time and that piece of soul is enjoying it and making its presence felt. But he doesn't know what he's feeling, of course. *Also I always imagined the Sorting Hat detected the presence of that piece of soul when Harry first tried it on. Because it was strongly tempted to put him in Slytherin.* So that's how I see it. Now, I know that won't end the debate, but I do think that the strict definition of Horcrux, once I write The Scottish Book, will have to be given and that the definition will be: the receptacle is prepared by dark magic to become the receptacle of a fragmented piece of soul and that that piece of soul deliberately detached from the Master Soul to act as a future safeguard or anchor to life and to safeguard against death. So that doesn't clear anything up but it elucidates what I believe. But I don't think it's necessarily going to convince people who have a strong feeling, one way or the other, on the matter. You know what, that's been the case with most of "Harry Potter". I gave my explanation and it just fuels more debate.

Are you immediately mistrusted at your new job when people know you were a Slytherin? Does it screw up job interviews? No one is born evil and certainly can't be judged as evil at eleven.

​

On the other hand you can certainly make someone dark and jaded by judging and discriminating against him/her as an untrustworthy evil "snake" from the age of eleven just because of their House.

******* Then we get to personal choice. The hat offered Slytherin and Harry rejected. Not because he was aware of the soul leech or he had anything against ambition, but because of the negative connotations he had heard. What about other ambitious people? Can they reject the sorting hat and go where they want as well? If you are cunning and ambitious and don't want your dream getting destroyed thanks to the apparent shit reputation of the House the hat suggests, I could see someone asking for a different house just like Harry did.

​

Does that mean that all the 'negative' attention he would have gotten from being in Slytherin would have activated the soul piece permanently? Since he would 'have been in a dark place'.

​

So all the people with actual cunning go elsewhere, and Slytherin is just left as a cesspool of Blood Purists.

TLDR: Having a house notorious for dark wizards and witches being run by an ex-Death Eater was a dumb ass move by Dumbledore. He should have put a squeaky clean Slytherin in charge and started cracking down on the house rivalry, and JK should have written a Slytherin character that called Draco out on his shit.

I always felt like Slytherin was kind of poorly constructed.

Keep Snape as a teacher, but put a new teacher in charge of the house, and have some characters call Draco out on his shit, all minor changes, and I feel like it could have drastically changed Slytherin from the 'evil' house.

***** That was the problem I always had with Slytherin. In my opinion, if she wanted to make it the "evil house" she should have kept it that way until the end and maybe disband the house or at least disband all the houses. Instead it seems like we're in a confusing state where Slytherin is the evil house but also not really, so people don't really know how to feel about it.

In the original books , they're shown to be nothing but pure evil (even the good Slytherins seemed to do good things /in spite of/ their house rather than because of it, that's why Dumbledore even implies that Snape should have been in another house, "we sort too soon") however we're also bombarded with messages that no they're not evil, when /nothing/ is done to show us that they're not. It's confusing. I think in Cursed Child they tried to redeem Slytherin, but CC in general is awful and doesn't feel like canon.

The hat didn't spend forever waffling on it- it said he had a thirst to prove himself (which dare I say qualifies as ambition?). Whether that came from him or from the fragment, I think that's certainly a valid reason to consider sorting him there.

*** This explanation is ridiculous. The soul-piece never affects HP at all in his entire life. He forgives the Dursleys after they abuse him for his entire life, FFS. If the soul of Voldemort had any say in that, the Dursleys would have been dead (along with a good portion of Surrey) before HP left for the express in his first year.

And if the piece doesn't influence him, then it is more or less intangible, seeing as how it is a piece of a soul, and not a piece of a mind. The Sorting Hat looks into his mind, not his soul.

If the soul piece was also a piece of his mind, then Snape would have detected that in their Occlumency lessons.

********** I guess the point of it is that sometimes I'll try to have a conversation about a work, and somebody will chime in with a quote from the creator, as if that renders the conversation moot, because we have a definitive answer. And when I indicate that I don't actually give a crap what so-and-so has to say, because that doesn't change the textual evidence, it would be nice if they responded with something other than bewildered indignation.

For example, JKR has stated several times that Harry Potter wasn't abused by the Dursleys. In an ideal world this would not at all impact a discussion I would have about the effects of the Dursleys' abuse on Harry's development as a character.

So, yeah, people can decide what parts of works they like, and even reject the parts they don't, but there's still a persistent belief that the creator has the final say, and interpretations counter to that are somehow less valid.

I will grant you that this attitude is much less prevalent in fanfiction circles than other corners of the internet, since fanfic is by nature transformative, but people still often bring up the author's stated intent as if that somehow magically trumps any argument.

And I have to continually justify myself, and continually have the same argument over and over, just because someone wants to argue that my experience of a work and my analysis of that experience is invalid and not worth discussing just because it doesn't align perfectly with what the creator says they intended.

Some people have this conflict internally, where they just second guess themselves and their interpretations.

In conclusion, I agree with you that everyone should be able to choose whatever they want to consider canon, but not everyone thinks that, which is why it's useful to have a formal concept for the idea that I don't give a crap about what JKR posts on Twitter.

So i'd guess the hat saw the potential of growth there. Just like he saw in Harry for slytherin. And tbf i see it too. Harry in Gryffindor didnt like being the bwl and wanted to be normal. I can see a Slytherin Harry still not liking the bwl and wanting to become more, be known as more than just a celebrity for something he didn't even do, and that cost him his parents.

Its not about predicting the future to know if they end dead or not. Its kinda like searching a person's soul to see what they really will or could potentially become.

***** No yeah, I understand that, I'm just being cynical. I guess you could argue that the hat ignores all the realities of sorting someone in a House and goes only after a very idealistic character evaluation.

I find that kind of definition of potential completely divorced from reality to be particularly useless though. "Well, you do have the potential to be a millionaire, if you weren't currently being eaten alive by maggots and living on the streets". I think there are better words here, like raw talent, power, tenacity, whatever.

I don't think the hat is malicious, he probably can't see the future and see that Harry ends up dead in Slytherin, its an enchanted object after all, he probably has the info from all the students in school to conclude Harry may be in risk at Slytherin but can't reach that conclusion because he was made to sort students, not to predict the future.

Wait wait wait. This argument arose from the Hat claiming that Harry could be great in Slytherin. That requires some kind of attempt at predicting the future, no? The whole point of this debate is predicated on the idea that the Hat predicts that Harry could be successful in Slytherin.

​

I don't think the hat can "see" the future. My theory is that he only see "potential of the person", a soul-searching magic or whatever you want to explain it as. It doesn't mean that person will always be destined to be Brave or Smart or Cunning or Hard-working. It also doesn't mean a person can only be one of those, After all Hermione was Gryffindor but none would argue she could've been Ravenclaw with no problems either. And i think Dumbledore was Gryffindor but honestly he was more cunning than all Slytherins we saw in the books.

​

Like imagine if Neville never went to DA, suddenly all his growth is stumped and he never reaches his full Grynffindor Potential. And i don't believe the Hat saw that Harry would create the DA in the future, he just saw that Neville had it in himself to be Brave, but it was up to Neville to reach that himself.

​

Kinda like Harry in Cannon has none of the traits of Slytherin, The hat saw that potential in Harry but Harry himself never became cunning or ambitious.

Gryffindors are the ones who don't care one whit about rules - they barge headfirst into any situation without looking back. Ravenclaws would toe the line and bend the rules to their own purpose. Except for Hufflepuff, /every/ House has rule-breakers. It's not singular to Slytherin.

Out of that list of traits, "resourcefulness" is the only one which can be attributed directly to Slytherin.

** I think it would make sense for the Hat to consider all of the houses for most students. It runs through a quick checklist-- has this child been brave? Loyal? Smart? Cunning? The Hat also mentions to Harry that he has a good mind, which implies that the Hat considered the possibility of Ravenclaw, too, but Slytherin is discussed explicitly because Harry himself brings it up.

​

Personalities and situations vary. Some people absolutely need to be in one particular house to get the most out of Hogwarts; the most extreme example would be someone from a Slytherin family that would pull a student from school if s/he was sorted into the "wrong" house. But other people are more adaptable and will do just fine in any of the houses. Harry, I think, falls into the second category. Before he ever made it to Hogwarts, he survived being thrown under the stairs in a loveless home while his cousin played Harry Hunting. To come out of that at all, let alone to come out of that a funny, kind person with the ability to make friends, means that Harry showed a predisposition toward bravery AND cunning AND wisdom AND effort.

​

Maybe that Hat didn't just think Harry would be fine in Slytherin... it thought he would be fine wherever he landed. But because NotSlytherin is where Harry's fixation lay, Slytherin is what got discussed in detail.

The people that one surrounds oneself with plays a huge part in how such things develop in children. If he had been sorted into another house, I think he would have taken on the characteristics of that house more. He would have valued education more in Ravenclaw, for example, or friendship and loyalty if he were in Hufflepuff. His personality was not set in stone at 11. How many people do you know that remained unchanged personality wise from 11-17? I know I didn't. I know that when I was a teenager I was quiet and reclusive.

** The House probably influences quite a lot of his later actions. The Hat says, "Daring, Nerve and Chivalry set Gryffindors apart." Daring is a very kind word for being stupid, and chivalry can lose you your head, as the chivalrous Lord Stark found out.

Dudley and gang play a game called Harry Hunting in their muggle school, and HP runs away from them. One week in Gryffindor and he's standing up to Draco and co. People who get ragged generally don't wake up one fine morning and decide to stand up for themselves (or for random people they really don't know, like NL was to HP at that point).

I'm guessing that had he been sorted to Slytherin, he'd have become more ambitious and would have valued himself more, as those are traits that his housemates would have valued themselves.

JKR's explanation of the Hat finding the soul piece in his head is BS, IMO. The soul-piece never affects HP at all in his entire life. He forgives the Dursleys after they abuse him for his entire life, FFS. If the soul of Voldemort had any say in that, the Dursleys would have been dead before HP left for the express in his first year.

And if the piece doesn't influence him, then it is more or less intangible, seeing as how it is a piece of a soul, and not a piece of a mind. The Sorting Hat looks into his mind, not his soul.

Look, the whole mother's protection thing is wonky. It protects him about two times and conveniently decides to do nothing several other times. It protects him as a toddler against Voldemort's curse, but pays no mind to a bit of his soul from latching on for a joy-ride.

I always took that to mean her using it as a real diary, that is, telling it all her secrets, made her vulnerable to it. Especially since it was an ongoing thing, and /especially/ since she trusted it like a friend. (There's a phrase, "pour your heart out", which means to tell someone all your secrets.

Harry only used it once and only out of curiosity. If he'd kept writing in it, it might have done the same thing to him, though it'd likely take longer since he's not as sentimental as an insecure girl with a hero-crush.

I suggest you have another read through Philosopher's Stone. In particular through the pre-Hogwarts part with close attention paid to when his first letter arrives. Harry has no problem talking back to his relatives, telling them "Make Dudley do it." He's not such a ragged and downtrodden little victim fanfiction likes to portray him as.

Also I think beyond an academic lens, Harry is quite ambitious and hard working. He throws himself into learning how to fight dementors and trudging around after horcruxes even though they are really unpleasant and hard endeavours. He shows a lot of resilience in dealing with PTSD and extremely stressful situations. These activities also have an element of survival, which is also a very Slytherin theme.

** This isn't 100% related, but your question made me think of it. So I'm reading through the books with my son for his first time and it's been a great excuse to refresh things, because it has honestly been a while since I read through them all.

In Chamber of Secrets, when Harry first finds Riddle's diary in that toilet he has this thought at one point that the name is familiar, ‘like some long forgotten childhood friend', or something to that affect. I totally didn't remember a line like that, and it really struck me as interesting.

Makes me wonder if Jo had some idea in mind about the bit of foreign soul in him was able to reach him more when he was younger.

She said Harry felt the soul most in fifth year since he was going through a dark time and the soul bit fed off those negative emotions, so maybe some especially dark point when he was younger he could feel it more as well.

Definitely could provide fuel for fic ideas.

Edit - more related to your actual topic, at one point in (maybe book 4?) Trelaeney says some things like that she sees Harry was born in the middle of winter - basically she's reading the bit of Voldemort's soul, not Harry. So if her janky Vision could pick up on Voldy details and mistake it for reading Harry, it totally seems reasonable that the hat would too.

Harry is actually quite cunning when you think about it. You've got to have some kind of tact to run around school at late hours and in places you're not supposed to go wearing an invisibility cloak, and my fav example: when he has to feed Dumbledore the horcrux juice left by Remus. That shows his self-preservation imo, because a Hufflepuff would be too sensitive to go through with something like that and I think the moral quandry of it all would confuse a Ravenclaw into just not making a decision.

The Horcrux does not influence him like the locket influences the trio during their hunt. But it connects him to Voldemort. We see in PS, GoF, OotP, and DH the effect that Riddle has on Harry and his scar and their ability to “communicate.” Voldemort is able to possess Harry through the scar in OotP and influence his decisions. Harry can feel what he's feeling in DH. When Harry is near Quirrel in PS his scar /hurts/.

The hat is able to see all of Harry and Voldemort was part of Harry. I wouldn't be surprised if he could've been resorted after Voldy died the Sorting Hat only recognized Harry as a Gryffindor.

All his friends were gryffindor and he disliked Slytherin so of course he would avoid being like them and more like a gryffindor. But who's to say if Harry had made friends with Slytherins he wouldn't have picked up their traits. I guess its something like Nature vs Nuture.

I don't mean being a deatheater, he is still Harry, he loves his parents, he doesnt like bullying, etc. I mean being ambitious and cunning (which tbf i dont see anyone in the books being really cunning except Dumbledore).

*** Well first he isn't a completed Horcrux as the other as he's accidental and I read the books multiple time but him being a walking horcrux... no? Like the only visible feature that he's an Horcrux is parseltongue but the soul shard doesn't try to possess him or any people around. He doesn't twist people around him to be impulsive and aggressive and clearly doesn't seem indestructible to anything except Basilisk venom, Fiendfyre and Killing Curse (and it's not even proven that Killing Curse could destroy an Horcrux).

Hell Ginny was almost more a walking Horcrux than him between transporting the Diary and being possessed.

**** I think you are actually understanding. Had the sorting hat sorted Ginny while possessed, it may have suggested Slytherin. Don't you think?

****** You know precisely how it works, do you? Then it must have been Harry's innate qualities that made it think Slytherin might be a good fit.
