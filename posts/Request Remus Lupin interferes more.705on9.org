I love Remus Lupin, he's my favorite Marauder with Sirius being a close second. But I was wondering if there was any stories where Remus interfered more with the bullying between the Marauders and Severus and tried to stop it more often then was shown in canon?

Maybe even Remus and Severus become friends or at least allies?

Any ratings is fine. Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters would be fine.
