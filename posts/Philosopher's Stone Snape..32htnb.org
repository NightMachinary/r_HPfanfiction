I don't think my thoughts on this are completely coherent, so forgive me for rambling.

If we look at how Snape's characters is portrayed in Philosopher's Stone, there's a lot of potential there; he's bitter and spiteful towards the Griffindors, but plays incredible favoritism towards his own house. He's the obvious choice for the bad guy, but in the end, we find that he was on the right side all along, and has saved Harry's life along the way.

No slight to Rowling, but I feel that, in canon, Snape's character kinda stagnated. He kept playing the same role pretty much every book; 'Oh look, Snape's being a nob, but secretly he's on your side'

What I want to see is a fic that takes Snape's character from the end of Philosophers stone and works with it. Explores the reasons for his bitterness (preferably without the whole crush on Harry's death mother thing) and his favoritism towards Slitherins (the fact that Slitherins are universally hated by the other houses goes a long way towards justifying this) but also explores the secret hero aspect, his reasons (but no dead mother fetish, please), actions, etc. From there you can begin to change Snape in to something more likable, maybe having Harry come thank him/ apologize at the end of the school year would be a good starting point.

*** I'll give the same warning about this fic I gave a while ago: if it was written by any other author it'd be ten times shorter. This particular writer is really, really wordy.

**** To be honest I've seen some fics a lot worse.

To elaborate a bit, there wasn't any point during the whole work in which the pacing feels very slow.
