I recently started reading a fanfiction on ao3 where Harry befriends Hermione and Neville instead of Ron. At first I really liked it, the main premise appeals to me but...it got weird really fast because Harry got sorted into slytherin amd Snape was nice/OOC and Harry befriended Draco also and grew his hair out long into a pony tail and went by his â€˜real' name which was Hadrian. I didn't like that at all so I'm hoping there's something like that story but also not. I've always wanted Neville to be part of the main trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione, going on all their adventures with them. So is there a fanfic like that? But where Harry isn't in slytherin or Snape (and Draco) being portrayed in a good light (I hate his character and do not forgive his canon actions). I don't care if Ron is still in the group or not (making it a foursome instead if he is). I just want a golden trio + Neville story to read that doesn't have all the weird things mentioned above. No slash pairings or M ratings please.
