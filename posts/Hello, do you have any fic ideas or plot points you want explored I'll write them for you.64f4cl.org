Edit 1: Good stuff!

Edit 2: it's been a month since I last visited here but rest assured I haven't forgotten these fics - had to focus a bit on life for a few weeks.

--------------

--------------

I've been writing creatively on and off for a few years. Nothing especially exciting but I've written a few reasonably well received fics sub-20k words. Started a few "big" fics but can never finish them.

I'm trying to get back into the swing of things and develop my writing some more. For this I would like you to throw any fic/idea requests at my and I'll see what I can create for you.

The word length won't be anything impressive, probably never more than 10,000 words but enough to sink your teeth into for a good half hour or so.

--------------

--------------

*How it will work:*

1) post your request in a reply below

2) I go away into my man cave and grok it out, revise, revise some more, finish it

3) I upload the fic (to an account I haven't yet created) and maybe make a new text post here linking to this post, notifying the OG requestor, and the place I've uploaded the fic.

4) you guys can then read and (if you're feeling kindly) critique.

--------------

--------------

*Requests from me to you:*

1) make your request as detailed as you want, the more detail you share the easier it is for me to tailor it to your tastes.

#+begin_quote
  For instance if your request is /"Harry loses his magic, write about him getting it back..."/ then I might go about it by incorporating the supernatural but you might have wanted /Dark Magic/ to be the appropriate method of doing this. Remember: this is /your/ story.

  Don't worry about your idea being an "epic" or a drawn-out story. There are ways to shorten such ideas.
#+end_quote

2) upvote the best ideas and they'll be the first I work on, of course you could put a prank request up and I'd still write it if you enjoy the concept enough.

--------------

--------------

*Misc:*

/NSFW stories?/ Sure, why not. Never done before but it'd be interesting to explore

/Slash?/ As above

/Characters?/ No preference - though original, non-canon characters might need a bit of detail providing so I can better write them.

/Turnaround time?/ Depends on length, some weeks, others months. This will be done mainly in my spare time so only a few hours per week sadly.


** I kinda have this plot point in my head but I don´t write fics in years (and I don´t trust my english enough to write a complete fic) so here it goes:

A next gen fanfic where Auror Harry has to deal with a serial killer who kills people in a way of representing all the event´s that marked Harry´s life (like killing a couple with the death curse and leaving their 1 year old baby alive with a lighting bolt mark on his forehead), besides reproducing the scene he leaves tauting messages for Harry, puzzles so he can try and guess his identity. Harry is having a hard time because he doesn´t know how to deal with someone with no identity, no ideology and no goal besides tauting him.

** I'll try my luck because these fics just /do not exist/ anywhere. Maybe you can blaze this trail with a short 10k bit.

The headline: Bellatrix / Sirius

I really don't know where to place this, so I'll just outline a few possibilities.

1. Bellatrix and Sirius are ordered by their family to marry. Both of them are difficult children in the eyes of their parents. They're rebellious - if in completely different ways. They're talented and powerful in their magic, yet use it only for mayhem and chaos. Somehow they're really two sides of the same coin. When they are told of their marriage, Sirius doesn't get away to the Potters. He will marry Bellatrix at the age of seventeen. When he tells this to hid friends in his seventh year, they try to get him away from it, but fail. The only way into a bearable life is to make the most dysfunctional marriage on the planet work.

2. Sirius duels Bellatrix in the Ministry of Magic. During their duel one of them brings up that they should have been married. Sirius ends up convincing her to come with him (maybe with the promise of a family? I'm not sure of the angle here). He gets an Unbreakable Vow of loyalty and Bellatrix ends up switching sides.

3. Neither Sirius nor Bellatrix died. They faked their deaths and are now living under new name on a fideliused island, smoking cigars and drinking mojitos. The story is about them reminiscing of their reasons to do it.

4. The exact opposite of 1. Sirius and Bellatrix are both promised to other families. Bellatrix is facing a loveless marriage with Rodolphus Lestrange, and Walburga has negotiated the terms of marriage with Jasmine Parkinson. During the dinner where the second agreement is announced, Sirius and Bellatrix plot out a plan to get out of their shackles. They marry behind their parents backs, but then face a problem. Voldemort? Dumbledore? The Blacks? Where exactly does their new family stand and how will they ever know that, when they can't even agree on whether or not to keep the motorbike?

** It's Harry's second year at Hogwarts, the Statute of Secrecy is now just a piece of paper, and the British wizarding community is forced to deal with the aftermath of a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States. Unfortunately, Voldemort has noticed the destructive potential of the nuke. Things are about to heat up.

Bomb shelter smut would be great.

--------------

Gilderoy Lockhart, reputation in tatters after the revelations of his fraudulent nature, makes a new start in lucrative Memory-Charm-related contracts with Muggle multinational corporations. That's when the aliens signal their presence and Lockhart is finally put to the test of unifying world leaders against them through memory modifications. Likeable and compassionate but misunderstood Lockhart with a human heart who regularly brings us to tears is a bonus.

--------------

Story is a bureaucratic thriller set in Grindelwald-era Britain during the 1920s, and follows Reginald Rookwood, fresh out of Hogwarts, fresh into the Department of Records, noted for his ability to wandlessly cast spells through his nose, who by coincidence (or fate) becomes Head Junior Unspeakable at the Department of Mysteries. The central plot is a newly-made prophecy that seems unimportant at first, but gradually grows to concern the entirety of the wizarding world. The points of tension and conflict is Rookwood's frustration with getting anything done, the hierarchy of the workplace, the mystery of his Department, getting away with things he normally wouldn't be able to as an Unspeakable, and the enormous amount of paperwork involved. His work involves "creative prophecy fulfilment", that is, finding word loopholes in order to exploit prophecies to their best. A conspiracy is uncovered that the Ministry of Magic is a creation of the aristocratic class to occupy non-aristocrat wizards with pointless work, and nobody apart from the Unspeakables really does anything. Oh yes, and there's a romance in there too. Look for inspiration in Max Barry's /The Company/, Catch-22, and The Trial. Should be extremely fast-paced and generally in the comedy genre.

--------------

just thought of this one

Muggleborns and those living outside of the wizarding world (including Harry) are prevented from entering Hogwarts or knowing about magic at all until the age of 15, severely crippling their magical education (this was started by the purebloods to widen the disparity between them and the Muggleborns), but this has the interesting effect of making these children more susceptible to powerful outbursts of accidental magic. And they can control it too. Hermione should probably feature pretty prominently, and a political subplot wouldn't go amiss. Characters from below Harry's year can be at Hogwarts

** I think this one will work best as a sub-10k word fic.

A post OOTP independent Harry fic which takes the fact that Harry is an inexperienced 15 or 16 year old to its natural conclusion --- Harry miserably fails.

You know the tropes common in Indy!Harry tropes --- diagonal alley shopping trip, Lord of a million houses, new trunk, Dumbles/Moldyshorts, order of the chicken, big ass speech comparing Dumbledore to Hitler, that sort of thing.

In this fic, Harry tries to do what Harries in those fics do, but ends up antagonising everyone and ruining everything. After all, it stands to reason experienced war veterans would know more about strategy than a 15 year old.

It would be even better if the tropes were explicitly subverted. Like Harry inherits half the noble titles in the land but all that those houses have is a load of debt (that's why nobody had claimed them until now). Or maybe he tries to form an alliance with Amelia Bones and she humours him but then informs Dumbledore, because who's she gonna trust, the Chief Warlock or some skinny 15 yo?

Dumbledore's actions through the books should be cast in a sympathetic light. Can be crack!fic where Harry doesn't even realise he's screwing things up or a serious fic where he realises his mistakes.

** A Harry/Cho fic.

Start 4th year to cut off all the Cedric stuff. She is a Ravenclaw a year ahead of him, she can help him prepare for the tournament? Harry could ask her out(before the ball thing) or ask her for help or just bump into her. (He feels he is going to die and wants to ask out someone he has a crush on?) Bonus points if you pair up Cedric and Hermione to make some interesting fireworks.

You can focus on the effect Cho has on Harry's thinking. Make him consider the tasks better, think things through, have multiple strategies. Draw focus to the fact that Cho is a Ravenclaw(and thereby quite intelligent) and the effect that someone like that (who doesn't poke, prod, nag, manipulate and who he actually likes and wants to impress) would have on him.

Cho as a Ravenclaw would be smart and competitive. She has a crush on Harry too.(it can start off as hero worship or just wanting to know the truth behind all the rumors about the last three years and his life)

You can do the main bits. Their meeting, the help/strategy sessions, the tasks, the ball, their relationship developing(14/15 yos are old enough to experiment in a place with virtually no adult supervision), how their friends react, maybe add some Luna too(because Harry is connected to Ravenclaw events via Cho).

** i have this story on my mind but as i'm writing two other i don't think i have the time to write it.

The story starts after the epilogue Hermione became an unspeakable and is working on a project about time travel Ron and Ginny go to visit her to work Ron is an auror and ginny works for daily prophet Harry is head auror and currently on a misison. they go into the time chamber because ginny is writing a piece for the newspaper. they talk a bit and when they go out they find themselves in a dystopian London where evil!dumbledore is ruling most of europe with an iron fist. voldemort defeated dumbledore earlier on and posed as him to take control of the magical world. after they find about this they have to infiltrate the ministry back into the chamber of time. they send their minds back in time to harry's first year (when dumbledore was defeated) to set things right unfortunally, because a miscalculation, they are sent back to harry's seveth. (harry age 17)

Harry never went to hogwarts instead he went to stonewall high, at age 12 he meet a girl that later became his only friend and latter her girlfriend. now harry works two partime jobs while studyng so once he becomes of age he can marry his girlfriend and move away from the dursleys. one day two girls and a boy aproach him telling him they are his bestfriend and wife from the future and that he has magic. harry doesn't want anything to do with them unfortunally he and his girlfriend are dragged into the world when death eaters try to kidnap harry.

The weasleys and the other good wizards formed an underground resistence agains't voldy!dumbledore and ginny ron and hermione think that the key to defeat voldy!dumbledore is harry.

focus a bit on the drama about harry having a girlfriend he wants to marry and his wife from the future. while they try to find a way to hunt the horcrux and destroy voldy!dumbledore.

** How about where Harry was actually born a true Genius, but having a Horcrux stuck in his head severely crippled and limited him and now that his mind is finally free of the parasite his true potential is unleashed.

And I mean extremely intelligent. /Frighteningly/ intelligent. Like Sherlock Holmes/Sheldon Cooper style. Able to remember everything, see connections between disparate tidbits of information, able to plan and predict every action, reaction and outcome several steps ahead of everyone else. Able to process complex problems (be they logical, mathematical, behavioural, whatever) with ease, be able to visualise information, perfect recall of anything he has ever read or seen, ...

I think there is an interesting story here with how he would cope, how others would react, suddenly realising how limited he used to be and what to do with his future. Where on one hand is simple, cosy and predictable life with Ginny or on the other hand pursue his true potential and rise above all others, put his newfound genius to use for greater good?

Also could him having 'unlocked' his jumping ability either when he is in hogwarts removes the magic tracker on him while also optional give him the ability to do wandless magic. If young he can do magic without a wand.

I don't see why drinking the blood of a unicorn would mean you were morally bankrupt. If there was an animal that if I killed, or had someone else kill, and it's blood would let me live with some side-affects then I would likely take it. Don't see how that removes your morals.

** The main heads of house having a meeting. In that meeting they all d code to have Harry apprentice to them to help him survive Voldemort.

In my head it's set after year two. Dumbledore has explained to them Harry's role in the up coming struggle. Flitwick teaches him dueling, Snape does mind arts and spying. McG teaches transfiguration and animagus. Sprout is mother figure and teaches politics

** A story were harry finds out that people have been using polyjuice potion to turn in him

i can see two ways the story could go:

1) the girls of Hogwarts using polyjuice potion to take turns transforming into harry with harry accidentally finding out about the group when he is using his map and cloak as he walks the school at night. from under his cloak he would observe the girls having an orgy.

2) A daily prophet article about a group getting busted for selling illegal polyjuice potion with Harrys hair in it. The story would be about harry being in the great hall as the Daily Prophet arrives with the morning post. and it would cover the reaction from harry and the other Hogwarts student and staff reactions.

*** Romance Fics I'd enjoy seeing, or just smut fics with these characters.\\
- Marauders era Lily Potter and time travelling Harry Potter. Harry would feel conflicted about this since it's his mother while Lily would like him, and wonder why he was avoiding it.\\
- Rowena Ravenclaw and Harry Potter. Without it being Harry is actually someone reincarnated. (I've seen one of this before I think but it was Salazar reincarnated, don't remember the title though.)\\
- Myrtle and Harry Potter.\\
- Helena Ravenclaw and Harry Potter\\
- Death of the Endless (Sandman comic series) and Harry Potter. I've read like one fic with this.\\
- Delirium (Or Delight since they are kinda the same person/entity) of the Endless (Sandman comic series) and Harry Potter.\\
- Luna Lovegood and Harry Potter. There is just not enough fics involving this.\\
- Nymphadora Tonks and Harry Potter same as above.\\
- Female Vampire and Harry Potter, I've only read one fic with a female vampire and Harry that I liked.

---------------------\\
Non-Romance fics(Well just not specifically romance fics)\\
----------------------\\
Hagrid actually opened the chamber of secrets. Tom Riddle & Hagrid were both parselmouths, but Hagrid was the one who was actually opening the chamber and petrifying people. Tom knew it was Hagrid, but also didn't want to reveal the chambers location nor kill the basilisk he pinned the blame on the acromantula. Tom made the horcrux diary so he could be immortal, and so he could stop Hagrid if he ever tried again since he got off free. Perhaps have so the diary was placed with someone (perhaps not lucius) and they had a spell that would automatically place it with someone so it could stop Hagrid.\\
------------------\\
Showcase Hagrids and Madame Maximes time with the giants.\\
------------------------------------\\
Harry Potter cannot feel hate. Someone placed a charm on him, that is mostly permanent, it cannot be removed by anyone, but it could be possible that it could be removed. The person who placed the charm did not want another dark lord like Tom Riddle, the person was no Albus Dumbledore.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
Harry, Ron, Hermione and Lockhart go down into the chamber. The instant they arrive they are petrified by a waiting basilisk. Make up some reason why Hermione is there with them when they go down into the chamber. The four wake up in the future where Lord Voldemort rules magical Britain sometime into the future. The four team up to attempt to fight him. Lockhart uses his memory charms to acquire info, and supplies from people, etc.\\
----------------------------------------------------\\
Harry Potter time travels back in time. Except everybody that went to Hogwarts, and was in the order while he was there also traveled back in time from the moment of their deaths. So we have Cedric from when he died in the fourth task, Sirius from when he went into the veil (or have so he didn't actually die when he went into the veil, but still came back. Could have the death eaters except Voldemort come back, so we have Death Eaters that saw that they lost, and their lord is thinking there is disloyalty because everyone is acting weird.\\
----------------------------------------------\\
Harry from an earlier year, like 3rd or 2nd year time travels forward in time to his sixth, fifth, or fourth year. Everything happened like normal up to that point. Could have past-harry time travel into future-harry's body or separate.\\
----------------------------------------------\\
Rita Skeeter realizes she wouldn't be allowed to write basically what she wants if Voldemort wins. Showcase how Rita helps in the war against Voldemort.\\
-------------------------------------------------\\
Voldemort is the defense professor in sixth year. Most people didn't believe Harry at first, and why would they believe him when he says that the handsome Tom Riddle is Voldemort? Ginny would probably have problems because he would look like an older Tom from the diary. Some would believe him, like Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Twins, Albus would already know, Severus. Perhaps they can't prove he's Voldemort, and Albus can't fire him. This Voldemort would be sane, or at the very least saner.\\
---------------------------------------------------------\\
An Idea I wanted to write but I'm terrible at writing.\\
The Horcrux decided to attach to the thing closest, and had spent a good amount of time near Lord Voldemort. Lord Voldemort's wand. Hagrid picks up the wand because either wanting a free wand and it's Voldemort's. Also perhaps some compulsion magic to keep it. Everything plays out normally. Hagrid slowly become Hagridmort. Perhaps because Hagrid is a half-giant lord Voldemort is in his body and they merge. So we have a Hagrimort who likes deadly creatures, is sadistic, and fears death. Add what you want to that. Perhaps have it slower than other Horcruxes so we can see the results when Harry gets to school.\\
---------------------------------------------------------------\\
Harry didn't kill the basilisk, or there was another one in the chamber that didn't come out. Everything happens normally until the final battle when Harry goes down with Ron and Hermione to the chamber to get a fang. They find a basilisk there and Harry convinces it to fight for their side in protection of the castle.\\
---------------------------------------------------\\
The Twins accidently lock the entire Weasley family, including themselves, into an Egyptian tomb. They can't go out the way they came so they adventure further in. Bill uses his knowledge of curse-breaking and the tombs to tell whats happening, The twins use their experiments they've made. Charlie (if he's there I don't remember if he is) uses his knowledge of magical creatures. The adults are general magic users perhaps, but Arthur is a bit knowledgeable in enchanting. (He did enchant a car to fly, be invisible, and eventually become sentient even if he didnt mean to). Ron brought his rat and eventually Pettigrew transforms to human just to save the Weasleys because he didn't want to be alone down there. They realize they have to work together to get out even if they don't like each other. If you want to make Ginny know parseltongue because she was possessed by Tom, and that helps because of snakes that are around.\\
If you have them escape (Your choice) Pettigrew would probably escape, and the picture was never taken perhaps so Sirius doesn't escape prison, but the Weasleys know he is innocent.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
Fawkes doesn't/can't bring Harry and Ginny out of the chamber easily. They move the rocks so Ron can get through and get Lockhart to follow them. They adventure deeper into the chamber with the sorting hat and perhaps Fawkes follows them or leaves. They adventure basically.\\
-----------------------------------------------\\
Harry casts Accio on Sirius when he was falling through the veil, and it doesn't turn into Dumbledore bashing.\\
------------------------------------------------ Harry is a metamorphagus, he befriends Tonks who would be in a later year. (Like sixth, or seventh year). She teaches him how to control his abilities.\\
-----------------------------------------------

I don't have any more currently.

** I had a few ideas, First, the burrow gets attacked by death eaters during Neville's and Harry's birthday party. Attendees are weasly family, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, Remus, Sirius, Fleur and Maybe Dumbledore. Harry saves Several of them from killing curses but gets killed taking a killing curse for tonks. They're all hurt alittle but alive. But after while they all sit around the table exchanging harry stories along with regrets, maybe funny and embarssing confessions of love, He wakes up as if from a nap. Walks into the dining room with everyone. Begins to eat like it's no big deal..its just the start of a longer fic Harry/Tonks with no Bashing please. I might just try to write this myself but I've never written one before
