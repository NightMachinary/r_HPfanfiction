I'm in the mood for some alien lovin' at the moment.

I suppose it doesn't /have/ to be space specifically, but I would prefer it.

There was a fairly decent Warcraft crossover I enjoyed linkffn(8933408)

I also have linkffn(9443327) on my list as well.

There was a Star Wars crossover or two that promised to be a multi as well, but if I recall they weren't finished yet.

** I was gonna suggest Darth Marrs's work but ChaoQueen got there first. You could also check out NonJon's linkffn(Green Eyes, Browncoat).

I'm also doing an AU story where space exploration and combat will take place and will have poly relationships but not Harem.
