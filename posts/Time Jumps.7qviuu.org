This probably belongs on the fanfiction subreddit.

How much time is too much to skip between scenes in a chapter?


** There's never too much. If the theme is the same and the chapter would feel incomplete if you put the scene into the next chapter, simply don't. Whatever the natural breaking point is can be okay.

** It depends. If a plot arc is complete, skip 50 years if it works. But if you're in the middle of an arc and you skip 5 years, that's probably gonna suck. Imagine if JK Rowling had a 5 year time skip in the middle of Half-Blood Prince

*** The first part of the chapter is set in mid-September 1984. I was thinking of skipping to maybe a couple days before they leave Hogwarts for Christmas

**** It could work or it could feel odd. It's up to you to make the execution work, and the execution /can/ work.

***** Timeskips are an underappreciated tool in the arsenal of ff writers. Case in point, Prince of Slytherin.
