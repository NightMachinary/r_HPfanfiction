sooo, pretty recently i found a "Draco Black" fanfiction needless to say i was obsessed, of course after finishing this fic i searched for others, however i only found around 8. sadly, after reading all of these i still don't feel "fulfilled", now i've come to my last resource: reddit.

all i really want is a fic where Draco is either Sirius's son, but is still raised by the Malfoys (or any other family) or a Draco /Malfoy/ raised by Sirius or anything in between really. i really would enjoy a Draco in PoA dealing with an escaped father, if anyone finds something like that. honestly, i'll read "self-made" fics (on the off chance you got inspired by this post).

oh, and i don't mind a "Draco disowned and takes the Black name, Sirius takes him under his wing" fic or something of that sort, although its not my first choice. i'm not too picky, just anything like the above.

(any ships, slash included, just no teacher/student)

thanks!!


** I'm interested in a Draco raised by Sirius too. What were some of the fics that you found?

*** this one is a "Draco Black raised as a Malfoy" i definitely enjoyed it although the Dramione pairing ruined it a little for me

​

this one's a little more Sirius-centric, here Sirius adopts Harry and Draco. i loved the Narcissa backstory. sadly, it's incomplete. (slash)

​

this one's a cute little WolfStar raising Draco one-shot, honestly i keep going back to it.

  They would underestimate him. The strongest person he'd ever known had been underestimated, and she was his mother in all but blood. He molded himself, played the part he'd been cast to play, while he waited for his chance. Then Sirius Black had escaped. Twisted canon. AU picking up at the start of DH.

  Narcissa is dying and decides her son would be better raised by the Lord of her house: Sirius Black. With this one action, the wizarding world as we knew it has been turned on its head. Alliances, enemies, relationships... everything is forever changed. (Het & Slash pairings) Part 1: COMPLETE, Part 2: On Hiatus
