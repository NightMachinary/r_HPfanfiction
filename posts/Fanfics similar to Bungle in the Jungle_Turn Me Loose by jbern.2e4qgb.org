** I don't know how well they fit your requirements but here you go:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7287278/1][Harry Potter and the Forests of ValbonÃ«]] is an awesome fic which explores magical creatures and enchanting in more detail.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7309863/1/The-Prisoner-s-Cipher][Prisoner's Cipher]] aside from being very well written has a very original take on Runes.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5460511/1/Ambient][Ambient]] takes place in a sort of post-apocalyptic setting where wizards are slowly loosing their magic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][Skitterleap]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5755130/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Lords-of-Magic-I][Lords of Magic]] are massively AU fics which might interest you.

*** Not a big fan of Skitterleap, but I thought [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6738586/1/The-Sun-Dog][The Sun Dog]] by the same author was pretty damn amazing.

**** You should also try other fics by the author too. All of them are well written and refreshingly original.

**** Forests of Valbone and Prisoners Cipher are complete. Ambient is almost at the end but hasn't been updated in a long time. Skitterleap is completed but as said above, its a part of a series. Lords of Magic is abandoned, unfortunately.

Edit: Looks like Prisoner's Cipher isn't complete. My bad.

  Prisoners Cipher
#+end_quote

You got my hopes up that I had simply missed the story update email from fanfiction. Unfortunately, Prisoner's Cipher is not finished. There is (supposedly) one last chapter. But it is a good story.

Forests of Valbone is "finished". The author's note at the end says "So, that's the end, or at least the end of Harry's story. Like I said, there's still one more chapter to come", but its been a year since he posted that. There is also supposedly a sequel coming

And any preference regarding WIP or completed and whats the shipping or Yaoi ( just to let you know, I do not have any in this category )?

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Summer][This]] has Harry going off on a cursebreaking adventure with Bill. Never could deal with the second person in Bungle in the Jungle so coudn't say how similar the plot is.

*** HP and the Cursed Summer is descent. It doesn't have as much Supper!Harry as Bungle in the Jungle. Oh the other hand, Bungle in the Jungle is much more of a "full" story (much more is going on). Both are worth reading, IMO. But yeah, the second person narrative can be a bit off-putting.

** Hmm, tough call, as he's pretty much in a class by himself. I don't think anyone is as consistently original as jbern.

It's not fanfiction, but perhaps you may want to give Jim's original fiction a try.

joe6991 (Wastelands of Time, e.g.) has some similarly vast span to his stories, though he tends toward the more comically epic, whereas jbern keeps his characters more grounded, more human.

Many of the other AFC writers (nonjon, BajaB, Perspicacity, Master Slytherin, Heather Sinclair, Voice of the Nephilim, cheddartrek, etc.) explore similar themes or strive for similar levels of originality. Maybe some of their stuff?

** I honestly want to read that story, but I can't make it past the first "you". Second person is very off-putting to me, and rewriting it in first or third would just destroy it I'm sure.

*** Seriously, try it. I was freaked by it at first but then I stuck with it and pretty quickly you read it as easily as third person. You don't even notice that it is being written that way after a while.

Plus this is one of the best fanfictions out there.

*** Jbern is probably my favorite writer on ff.net. I came backwards to Harry Potter, I was reading the Dresden Files so I'm used to the writing style, which I consider to be first person narrative anyway.
