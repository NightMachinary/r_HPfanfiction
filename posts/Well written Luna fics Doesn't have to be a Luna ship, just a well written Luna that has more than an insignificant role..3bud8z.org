** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=308510][Christmas in Prison]] is one of my favorite one-shots, about Luna's time in Malfoy Manor. The author also recently wrote me another Draco/Luna story (non-romantic, as is the other one), [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=334334][Your Heart on Your Sleeve]] which extends that headcanon.
