I recently started reading the fanfiction /Rise of the Golden Trio/. I have been enjoying it a lot but its updates are awfully slow. Anyone know any fanfictions where the trio train themselves and make alliances for the war starting years 3-5 at Hogwarts? No Ron bashing please I am sick of it.


** If you're ok with an abandoned fic, Forging the Sword is the best in this genre.

  The Golden Trio are done with being helpless and relying on luck to save them. Together they start training to be better fighters and wizards. Together they will face dangers, uncover Hogwarts secrets, and survive the Goblet of Fire.

** If you can find it, Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past is really good. Time traveling Harry goes back in time to to inhabit his younger body to train his friends and get the world ready for Voldemort.

**** It's mostly gen. Harry still has feelings for Ginny but is conflicted about it. He is 20 years older than her. You can tell romance will happen eventually but mostly it's cute fluffy moments between kids. Cannon couples plus Luna having a crush on Nevile. It's not complete but the author is working on it slowly. He has health issues.

Did a little looking. This is the [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/forum/viewforum.php?f=4][forum]] dedicated to the author. This is the author's [[http://www.viridiandreams.net/][website]]. This is the up to date [[https://github.com/IntermittentlyRupert/hpnofp-ebook/releases/tag/2.2.1][ebook]] download.
