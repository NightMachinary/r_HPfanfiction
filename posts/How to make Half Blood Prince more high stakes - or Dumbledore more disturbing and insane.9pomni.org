It is simple: make Draco's attempts succeed at killing the wrong people, or make him try even more times and kill still more students. Make Katie actually put on the necklace and die. Make Slughorn or Ron die from the poison, because Draco chose a very potent and dark poison that a mere bezoar wouldn't be able to counteract!

No plot armors like the basilisk dodging every time. Make it like real life, where they would've all died from it and nobody's conveniently always there to stop it.

I mean this would have made the story more mature and serious! It would show that the war is actually HAPPENING NOW, and people Harry knew for SIX YEARS are dying around him and he can't do anything about it.

Then Harry has to go on without his best friend, Katie's dead as a simple casualty, and the whole tower confrontation can have way worse of an affect on Harry's mind because his great hero Dumbledore willingly allowed Malfoy, a Death Eater he'd brought suspicions of to him himself, to murder his best friend and a Quidditch teammate just so he could keep Malfoy alive.

Maybe take that forward into Deathly Hallows and make a two parter, where Harry has indescribable loathing and lack of trust for Dumbledore now, and is in such a horrible depressing state of mind that he maybe refuses to even go on his Horcrux Hunt.


** At that point, Harry knew it was Malfoy and Ron/Hermione didn't believe him. If Ron had died, Harry would have actually laughed as Malfoy bled out from Sectumsempra, and maybe stunned Snape in the back to make sure it happens. This is how you get basically Frank Castle Harry.

**** Harry had only just lost Sirius, and it was enough to make him try an Unforgivable. Losing Ron to Malfoy would make him flip his shit to the point that "Wait outside Slytherin Dorm under Cloak. Reducto Malfoy to the face when he exits. Burn the body" wouldn't be a stretch. Losing Dumbledore, who he had been on the outs with, made him try and Crucio Snape as well. Punisher Harry isn't a big stretch if Malfoy's poison killed Ron and Katie.

**** Didn't stop him trying. He didn't actively know how to cast it properly, and was knocked on his ass wordlessly every time he tried to hex Snape, even one of his spells was "Cruci" unless he's going to turn Snape into a Crossword by casting Cruciverbalist, then it's likely he was going to cast Crucio. Him being that much closer to Ron and Hermione... He'd have let Malfoy die, and actively attacked Snape to make sure Malfoy died, at the least.

** I agree with a lot of this; Dumbledore was playing with fire by letting Malfoy run around unimpeded for so long. It was sheer luck in-universe and plot-armor out of it that no one was killed. People should have died; Malfoy should have had that on his soul.

***** No, both times somebody (Harry) was conveniently there and it had nothing to do with Dumbledore.

When Katie was affected by the necklace she was supposed to give Dumbledore, Harry ran to find help, found Hagrid on his way back from visiting Grawp, and Hagrid was able to get her to the castle and up to Pomfrey. Yes, Hagrid was present, but not placed there by Dumbledore, it was luck that Harry was able to find him. If Harry hadn't run to get help, or if it had happened earlier or later and Hagrid wasn't coincidentally there, there would be a body.

When Ron drank the poisoned mead, Harry and Ron visited Slughorn to get a love potion cure, something that could neither be foreseen nor controlled by Dumbledore. If Slughorn had chosen to drink that mead himself rather than share it with Harry and Ron, or if Harry had left, there would be a body.

And Hagrid wasn't there, Harry ran to find help and found him. And if you're suggesting that Hagrid lied about the reason he was out, I suggest that you remember which character we're talking about here.

And yes, they were very sloppy attempts that could never have killed Dumbledore. That's kinda the whole problem we're discussing here. Sloppy assassination attempts that nearly led to collateral damage.

And of course Harry knew the common poison remedy (not a cureall, just a remedy for most common poisons), but that was, again, Harry preventing somebody from dying, not Dumbledore. I know it's easy to mix them up sometimes.

And it's a hell of a thing to say there was no collateral damage. Even regarding the lack of deaths which, again, prevented by Harry, not by Dumbledore, Katie Bell was hospitalized for an extended period of time, and would have died, regardless of who was present, if she hadn't been wearing gloves.

****** Nonworries, it happens. See, the problem with Albus is that when it comes down to it, even though he is a powerful genius, he is also deeply flawed. It's what makes him a great character. It seems as though the readers who feel the most betrayed by him are those who looked up to him the most.

He does say multiple times to Harry that he is an imperfect man not worthy of such trust as is placed upon him, not through false humility, but because he actually believes it. His failure to protect his sister, and then Myrtle weigh heavily on him, and yiu can see it in his actions. One of his biggest flaws is to always see his former students as students still. Even as adults.

******* Oooh yes up until HBP I thought Dumbledore was epic, but I felt so betrayed after finishing it that I went completely off him, and then I started thinking and... Well, yeah.

I mean it was basically part of the thing that I loved Snape so much that I refused to believe that he was actually working for Voldemort, and my mind immediately went to 'Dumbledore made him do it' and...when you think about it that was really a bad, bad plan. Not even on a moral level, because I can understand the idea the good of the many, thank you Mr Spock, but the way the plan hinged on everything happening exactly right is... Well, that's not how you plan a war.

Plus you can make a definite argument that the original plan was to set Snape up as the owner of the Elder Wand, in order to give the ownership of the wand to Harry when he killed him. And setting up a kid who should still be in school to kill someone who he would later find out is innocent (and how would he find that out? How was Harry supposed to find out about the Horcrux in his scar when Snape was the only person who knew?) is triple plus ungood fucking squared.

I think Dumbledore wanted to be a better person than he was, which gets him points, but I'm pretty sure that Ron could have planned the war better if he'd had access to all the information Dumbledore had.

** If Dumbledore's attempts to save a racist scumbag like Draco resulted in the death of Ron or Katie, he'd have lost Harry's trust completely, I think - and the trust of McGonagall, Flitwick, Sprout and probably Snape as well. Most of the Order - the Weasleys - for sure.

Protecting Draco was such a braindead decision, the risks so much greater than the meagre reward, that it alone would be enough to ruin the entire characterisation of Dumbledore.

Not to go all McGonagall bashing, but the woman has shown an astonishing lack of indivdiual thought when it comes to Dumbledore. Not that a student death couldn't possibly shake her out of her stupor, but the huge number of near-deaths in preceding years didn't do it either.

And I figure your outlook on Flitwick is probably mostly fueled by the typical fanon characterization of him (some kind of guardian/revenge spirit protecting the students...)

  The loss of someone closest to Harry shows why the Hogwarts motto is apropos. He now has two missions in life, missions which would make any dragon proud; fierce care of what means the most to him and revenge against those who would do him or his harm. See how he handles the burdens of the end of 6th Year and The Hunt with these new mantras. HP/HG, NL/LL
