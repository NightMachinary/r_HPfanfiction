How long would the transfiguration last for? Would the person stay unconscious for the whole time they're transfigured, or would they wake up and become aware of their new form at some point? If they do wake up, could they potentially undo the transfiguration with enough willpower?


** Considering that if you get transformed into an /animal/ without proper care, the fact that you now have an animal brain is enough to cancel out your sapience, and therefore your ability to Untransfigure yourself... I'd say there's zero chance of a person who has been transformed into an object being able to Untransfigure themselves. Zero. Nada.

As for the rest, unless we presume that the transformed wizard's magic would "fight back" eventually, there is no reason the Transfiguration wouldn't last forever unless cancelled by an external agent. The better question is what would happen if you only reversed the Transfiguration hundreds of years later --- would the poor victim crumble into dust as age catches up with them, or would they look as though they had been frozen in time for the duration? There I don't think canon gives us a definitive answer.

*** Agreed. Personally I think it makes a lot of sense if wizards have a kind of "magical immune system" in which their magic works over time to restore the wizard to their "correct" state.

This would neatly explain why transfiguration cannot be used to give people eternal youth or make everyone beautiful, but /is/ considered useful for healing: in the first two, you are using transfiguration to move the body away from its correct state, whereas in healing you are using transfiguration to move the body towards its correct state.

The biggest problem with this idea is that it means that a wizard could use transfiguration to give a Muggle eternal youth/beauty. Without a magical immune system, there would be nothing to work against the transfiguration.

However, ignoring the above speculation and sticking purely to known canon...

One thing I would add to your post is that timed/triggered transfigurations are a thing: see Fred and George's fake wands, for example. So one way to escape the "you don't have a consciousness to untransfigure yourself" dilemma is to first cast a timed/triggered untransfiguration.

I think "crumbles into dust" is the likely option. Canon has a running theme of age catching up with you if you've somehow managed to cheat it: not only what happened to the Flamels, but also the lady who travelled forward in time.

Hm, a variation of this may be what Slughorn used, then.

** I'm caught between on this. I like transfiguration being permanent, but then we know wizards have souls, and even if the mind doesn't persist the soul would. If nothing else, I would think skilled witches and wizards would be able to tell (think Dumbledore's peering, brushing with fingers, detecting magic in cave, though less difficult).

But I suppose for my own sanity, I would have to say there is some reversal (though how that works with Dudley's tail remaining I'm not sure). I think like the frog prince it is possible to be cursed into a form (animate or inanimate) that can't be escaped(on their own), but that a standard transifguration would untransfigure itself in time. Otherwise it would just break my head.

Lastly, good crackfic idea is that all the old artifacts are actually beings (have souls) transfigured into locket or goblet and that this is how the enchantments last centuries/are so powerful.

** I think it's in linkffn(The Power of the Press by Bobmin356) that Harry transfigures an injured death eater into an ottoman to stop him from bleeding out. I don't think it was stated explicitly, but was sort of presumed that the ottoman was neither conscious nor sentient.

** Now, transfiguration and conjuration, they aren't explicitly mentioned to be permanent.

And also we see that when Ron tries to transfigure his rat into goblet for the first time, its tail was still left hanging. Even though it's an incomplete transfiguration we can still reasonably assume that the object will stay alive, but inanimate when transfigured successfully.

So just based on those points, I made a theory for my fic, trying to avoid the inconsistencies.

Whatever changes that transfiguration or charms bring on an object cast by wizard are temporary.

But the duration upto which they last depends on several factors like the type of spell, complexity of spell and how close the changed object is to its natural state, etc.

It makes most sense in my opinion because even human life is temporary, it tends to reach to its natural state, i.e., when the soul is free from the containments of the body, aka death.

Jinxes, enchantments last for longest durations, some even few decades or centuries, because they continuously take energy from the ambient magic, even after the spell is cast. However, the rate of energy transfer is usually limited. Only when the jinx is cast, energy is channeled through wizard amd wand (more efficient way). But to maintain the jinx, it takes energy from ambient magic. Here fanon concept of runes may also be utilised as an alternate to wizard and wands.

But when spells like protego are cast, they only last as long as wizard is able to channel the magic through his wand.

My argument is, the similar reasoning applies to transfiguration.

When a wizard transfigures matchstick to a needle, it may last longer like several hours to few days because needle is closer to matchstick.

But when a wizard transfigures a living person to an inanimate object, say a chair, evidently it is an extremely complex transfiguration and chair is not that close to human. So it may last less, maybe like several minutes to few hours, depending on skill of the wizard.

And whether the wizard can break through the transfiguration or not is completely uncertain.

Besides, transfiguring a human into an inanimate object takes really huge amount of skill, like McGonagoll/Dumbledore/Barty Jr. level of skill. So it's not commonly used. Even if he does, it may take huge chunk of energy out of him, or its execution time may be considerably slower when compared to spells like expelliarmus or protego. So I don't think it can be used in battles advantageously.
