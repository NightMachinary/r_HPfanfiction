(OR: Fic to watch in 2016.)

I've realized for a while now that a huge part of my fanfic diet comes from stories that have either been around forever and are still updating or stories that began in the huge boom between 2005 and the end of the series.

Now that we're two months into a new year, I thought it might be interesting to ask: What stories /launched in 2016/ are you enjoying? (If you only have 2015 stories I guess I can't complain about that, either, given how old the bulk of my reading is.) What do you like about the stories, and what are you nervous about as they continue?

So much of what we talk about on here is fic that's already earned its sterling reputation. It'd be fun to have some new blood to watch out for and follow over the next ten months, even if not all of them turn out as promising as they began.


** Besides *Abraxas* and *The Dark Lord Never Died*, I'm highly interested in how *Petrification Proliferation*, linkffn(11265467), turns out. This story is about what could have been if the CoS incident wasn't merely pampered over, but received a more realistic response.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  Lily Potter made a mistake nine months before Harry Potter was born: Severus Snape, not her husband, was Harry's father. The ripple effect of this reaches far: Snape dies young, Harry calls vampires family, and Lucius Malfoy seeks to destroy Voldemort. But one thing remains the same -- the inevitability of death.
