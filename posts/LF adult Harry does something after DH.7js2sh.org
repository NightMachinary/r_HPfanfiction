I am looking for a adult Harry (with a dead voldemort) who does interesting magical things(so not politican or policemen harry). Maybe he decides to build a magic tower and researches the arkane or goes tomb diving in South America. Or he plans his necromantic army of dread because he is a Au evil Harry.

In the end I am just sick of 3 children bumbling through the same happenings with minimal changes of Harry's abilities and an immature romantic subplot that is anounced in the description.

  Do you have a problem that needs fixing? Who better to call than Harry Potter, savior of the wizarding world?

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
