In every dark Harry or evil Dumbledore fic. Dumbles sticks around for ages while they play unnecessary strategic mind games or make up a list of irrelevant reasons why Dumbledore is still needed.

Are there any fics where he just gets portkeyed into a volcano or wakes up with a basilisk in his bed so we can just continue the story without him whining in the background about Harry turning dark or his own evil overlord ambitions?


** Does getting replaced by a "good" version of Dumbledore via an alternate universe count? If so: linkffn(Dumbledore's Next Great Adventure)

  In a Universe where Albus Dumbledore responded differently, he dies as a respected figure on June 24, 1991. He then is asked to go to a new universe and fix the mistakes of his alternate. What a mess. No Pairings yet (Not Canon). Year One Complete. Sequel will come - eventually.

** It's been linked here a lot, but linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fates Fool). Dumbledore and Voldemort don't survive past chapter 2~3, with the rest of the story being about Jamie moving on past these 2 asshats.

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** I don't have anything I can think of where Dumbledore just isn't there or gets specifically killed off, unless we are talking about stuff that doesn't follow the normal timeline. I know that linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) doesn't have any Dumbledore and it's an /amazing/ 7 book series.

Seriously try it out if you just don't want Dumbledore or anyone like him around. It feels similar enough to the original 7 books while being unique and original.

My only issues with it is that the first book introduces too many unnecessary characters by name in the sorting ceremony. I mostly skimmed that section because I knew I couldn't retain that many names and I didn't have much trouble because of it.

The first book is a lot of setting things up and introducing the characters and world building but the payoff over the entire series is worth it in my opinion.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
