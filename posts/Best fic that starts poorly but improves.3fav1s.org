I usually give up in the first 3 or so chapters if a story doesn't interest me and, as a result, I miss out on fics that improve with length. Any such stories you would be able to recommend?


** linkaO3(A Year Like None Other)

For the first bit it looks like a kind of uninspired "Snape meets the Dursleys". The writing is always just fine but the plot bored me a bit, however I knew it had been recc'ed to me as the best "Snape adopts Harry" out there so I kept going and it turns out awesome, if you like that sort of thing.

**** haha, I love long stuff so to me that's a bonus. It starts to get really good around chapter 23, which according to my kindle is 15% of the way in. Just before that was when I almost gave up. As for why, I hate to give away plot points but before that it looked like it might just be random Snape and Harry start to get along, but suddenly there's some plot movement and reasons for everything.

I'm thinking being creepy is kind of the point, innit? Cliched... yea, probably. But what fanfiction isn't, really? Some are less than most, but I have yet to find a fic with no cliche in it.

#+begin_quote
  ...inaccurately representing a lot of things
#+end_quote

What exactly? Its AU, so I, personally, give a lot of leeway.

If you're talking about Voodoo, then I have to at least put a good word in for it. While is surely isn't accurate (I'd be really impressed by anyone who could accuratly describe Voodoo and not be from, for example, Haiti or Benin), it certainly interprets a lot of the available facts quite nicely.

I found it highly entertaining and am still following the sequel.

****** I see where you're coming from, and its probably the exact opposite direction from where I'm coming from. I never treat fanfiction as actual novels. That also means that "Stupid Shit" doesn't put me off, most of the time.

Yes, the thing with every Black being a different sort of pervert is pretty over-the-top-stupid. But it made me chuckle.

And the thing about Jen being a (anti-)heroine in this despite her past as a victim of pedophilia is, of course, unrealistic.

But this is fanfiction. This is the unfiltered bullshit people come up with when daydreaming about their favourite fandom. I'd be really upset if I would've paid money to read it. But as it is, I'm going to FFN and expect, to a certain extend, that I find the unfiltered fantasies of people on there. That mindset is also why I often take the opinions and criticism of DLP with a grain of salt.

In the end, its all about tastes, expectations and what mindset you're in when you read fanfiction.

It crops up once or twice later on, but never in any of the capacity it was mentioned during the meet the Blacks scenes.

****** DLP really need to get their heads out of their asses, they treat Fanfiction like they're reviewing classical poetry or literature, it's not.

They're the quintessential pretentious douchebags of Fanfiction.

Have they not heard of a strong will? If your will is strong enough you could endure anything, just look at the survivors of North Korean concentration camps, they're lives before they escaped were *hell*! And they still manage to live productive lives and even some of them have the courage to go on television and speak, do they have problems? Of course they do, but most of them aren't broken people, far from it.

It's incredibly condescending to assume that anyone a victim of a tragedy would always be a depressed and broken person.

******* The irony is that the canon HP DLP worships is so full of incredibly unlikely, unrealistic or plain impossible coincidences, that complaining about a major character not conforming to their ideas of how a victim of abuse should act comes over as highly hypocritical.

Doubly so since in canon, Harry is a victim of child abuse as well, with no visible consequence on him.
