** Linkffn(The Granger Principle)

Dangerous missions in about half a dozen of different countries (is Kosovo actually one?) involving break-ins, kidnappings, espionage, assassinations, memory modification missions and action packed chase scenes, often not mutually exclusive. Lots of guns, magic, and enchanted guns. There are AU fics and then there's this which takes the entire concept to an entirely different level.

** Slide's Stygian Trilogy has a lot of globetrotting and mystery/discovery. And it's hard to do better than Valbone for pure action-adventure!

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

*** The Stygian Trilogy is really great. Warning though: there is a huge focus on romance (and I personally found Rose and Scorpius to be awfully boring, the real star here is Selena Rourke, as well as Nathalie Lockett). I finished Starfall recently, now I just have Oblivion to go through. The OC's are well crafted and complex, the mercenaries are actually threatening and the history is great, as is the global magical community. I'm surprised this isn't more popular among the community.

**** It's one of my favorite series. I agree it really should be more popular - it's long, complete, and the writing is really good. I know there are several people on this sub who enjoy it, but it definitely suffers from the Alexandra Quick syndrome of diverging from most definitions of fanfiction, which turns off readers.

I found most of the romantic arcs quite good, and I think they're given a little more gravitas in Oblivion (the most serious of the three books). I agree with you on Scorpius and Rose in Starfall, they do get better as characters in Oblivion. Selena and Matt are absolutely delightful characters, as are Lockett and Saida.

***** What I found most insufferable is how obnoxious Scorpius was everytime Draco attempted to speak to him, and Rose in Starfall was an echo of Hermione, although she wasn't as such in Ignite. I'll read Oblivion once I have the time, since it seems quite big. Matt was a great character, but Selena Rourke is an example of an OC which is better than some canon characters, in my humble opinion. I was so much more invested in her than any other, she's truly complex and well-balanced. Saida was...meh, although I can understand the appeal of her. The worldbuilding was top notch, as was the plot and dialogue. Those scenes at the casino were wonderfully exciting.
