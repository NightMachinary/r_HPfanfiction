So, I had just poured myself a hot cup of coffee and heard my daughter running up the stairs. I knew she'd be startled to find me standing right there when she came around the corner. In that split second, I had the thought that if I tried apparating to spot where she'd expect me to be, that I'd spill my coffee in a spiral marking not only where I had been, but where I landed. What a mess.

Anyway, it was a funny thought and I just had to share. And yes, she jumped when she saw me!

Do you do that, too? Think about HP magic so much that you consider what would happen if you were able to do it?


** Reparo would have been a useful spell to me a few days ago. That was my first thought when I heard the cracking noise. I had to settle for glue.

*** Oh! That would be so handy! And such a great way to make sure there are no shards of glass on the floor.

** My first thought whenever I have to do the housework is that it would be so easy with those household spells. I might just start expecting to find a wand lying somewhere. Maybe pointing fingers would work lol.

*** I have seriously tried to lift things with my mind before. Like if I concentrate hard enough, I might be able to do it.

**** I remember considering trying it, but thinking I won't be able to concentrate enough. Hagrid wasn't wrong when he said we'd want magic to fix everything. And I could go anywhere if we had portkeys. No need for a plane (I have a fear of this mode of transport) or a bus.

** Often if I read a lot of FanFiction before bed I wake up thinking to myself “if only I had my wand!” Or something ridiculous like “I need to remember the spell to summon food huh”
