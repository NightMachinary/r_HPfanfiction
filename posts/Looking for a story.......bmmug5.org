:END:
Hi all! I'm looking for one of the first ever fanfictions I read (I didn't know how or that you could save stories to reread again) I don't remember much of it but what I do remember is this:

​

Hermione discovers a way to help Harry using old family magic.... she doesn't tell Harry anything of her plan.... they have sex on the Weasley family property on/near the ward stone... it married them and Molly slaps Hermione bc she feels she tricked Harry.....I remember after that they go to Grimauld because Harry wants Hermione to explain and doesn't want her disrespected by Molly.

​

I want to say the setting is possibly right before Fleur and Bill's wedding... but I'm not 100% on that
