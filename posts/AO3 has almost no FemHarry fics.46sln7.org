So I was trying to hunt down some good fem!Harry fics that I didn't read yet (and if anyone else loves that trope, then you know how hard that is), so I thought to try my luck on AO3. Imagine my surprise when I was lucky to find about 10-15 fics with any mention of fem-Harry-s and even those were of questionable quality. Am I using the wrong tags?

Btw, here is my list of tags used: -slash -homo* fem* (super* || god* || powerful*) (dark || evil || grey || gray) -"Original Female Character"


** Ok, the thing about Ao3 is they understand equivalencies and parallel tags. They have "tag wranglers" that mark tags as meaning the same thing, so you only have to specify one to get all. For instance, here's the list of tags contained by the [[http://archiveofourown.org/tags/Female%20Harry][Female Harry tag]]. Searching for the Female Harry tag and limiting to Harry Potter fandom gets you [[http://archiveofourown.org/works?utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Sort+and+Filter&work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&work_search%5Bfandom_ids%5D%5B%5D=136512&work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&work_search%5Bquery%5D=&work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=0&tag_id=Female+Harry][403 works]]

**** Also, the search/filter categories will let you narrow down to het or gen (or f/f, or multi). But not both in the same search, because all the checkboxes are AND searches, not OR.

***** So I tried using several meta-tags for my search but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly...

Is this right?:"Female Harry" ("Powerful Harry" || "Deity Harry" || "super!Harry" || "BAMF Harry")

This should return every female harry fic that has some kind of powerful harry in it if I'm right

****** Well, Deity Harry does not show up as a recognized tag, and super!Harry has only been used 8 times, so you can probably leave those out. Honestly, I'd probably just sort the Female Harry results by kudos or something and then go by summaries - powerful Harry is not something that would necessarily get tagged, it's just a given for a lot of people. I only got 21 results when I made that part of the search.

** There's a tag for it, you can then filter from there.
