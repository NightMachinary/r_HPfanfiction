So after I created my: Discussion Why did Rowling feel the need to dumb down the professors I now want to read stories; any stories where the professors aren't as dumbed down as they were in canon and don't make as many stupid mistakes as before.

For instance Dumbledore telling the students and basically Quirrell that the third floor corridor was forbidden, McGonagall did nothing after Harry, Hermione and Ron told her that they knew about the stone.

Dumbledore had Hagrid take the stone out of Gringotts right in front of Harry when it should have been Snape or McGonagall and not when Harry was around.

McGonagall let first year students go to the Forbidden Forest for a detention when there was something out there that could destroy unicorns and other really stupid things that shouldn't have happened throughout the series.

I get that the series is a children series written for children and not adults, but it always irked me, even when I was a kid that the adults were incredibly stupid compared to Harry, Hermione and Ron.

So yes, I'm looking for any and all stories where the Professors are actually better at their job. Being more active at school and protecting it.

(I have other things that I never liked the Professors doing, feel free to read my thoughts in the discussion I created if you'd like to of course).

Would rather the story be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine, any rating is fine, the more realistic the professors are at handling things the better imo.

Very little to no character bashing. Am fine with het/slash/femslash.

The professors don't have to be the main focus, the main focus can still be Harry and co. I just want to read stories where the professors act smarter then they did in canon.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Dumbledore was on top of his game, Fudge was reasonable, Lockhart was not a fraud, Hagrid was cool, Harry was working hard, Pansy was a good girl, Umbridge wasn't really that bad, but that still wouldn't be enough. Fortunately, Hermione and Aberforth picked up the slack.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.

** The teachers are competent in Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, the author also balances this out by making the villains competent too.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
