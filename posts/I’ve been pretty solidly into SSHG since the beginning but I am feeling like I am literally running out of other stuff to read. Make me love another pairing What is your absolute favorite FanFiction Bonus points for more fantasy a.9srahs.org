** Absolute favorite HP fanfic of all time is "The Secret Language Of Plants" series by Endrina. It's on AO3, it's a 3 part series. First part is "The Meaning Of Dandelion", Then "The Meaning Of Mistletoe" and the finale is "The Meaning Of Geranium". That last fic changed my life it was so good.

- VERY long. Hundreds of pages.
- main pairing is Severus Snape/Remus Lupin, and it works in a way you never would expect
- basically, Snape goes to spy on Harry when he's a toddler at the Dursleys, sees him being abused, and kidnaps him and takes him to the one person he would never be suspected of working with: Remus Lupin
- VERY plot heavy, lots of lore and magic adventures
- morally grey Dumbledore (he insists on Harry staying with the Dursleys so Lupin and Snape don't tell anyone where he is, they hide him away for ten years and raise him with love and support. Dumbledore says he has to be with family, Snape says 'I'm Slytherin - we can always find a third option'.)
- it's just an epic fucking story and I want to re-read it but I'm trying to pace myself so it doesn't get old.

** Tonks with Harry or Hermione. If done correctly, it has an interesting imbalance of power/experience without going into legally/morally grew area (which is irrelevant for you since you are into Snape).

For Tonks/Hermione, there's "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10798339][Dignity in fear]]", which can be seen as a complete OotP fic (there has not been a lot of progress in the last year). Some smut and a superb depiction of emotions. linkffn(10798339)

For Harry/Tonks the best one by far is "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12188150][Like Grains of Sand in the hourglass]]". An outstanding friendship between Harry, Hermione and Tonks and overall a nice plot with a time traveller who faces some difficult choices. It is not explicit (although sex is implied) and the sequel (still waiting) is supposed to turn it into a true triad fic. linkffn(12188150)

Honorary mention to "[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10751741/][Call me]]" for a delightful teenage relationship between Harry and Lisa Turpin, but that ship consists of the aforementioned "Call Me" and a story I am writing, which took some inspirations from it. linkffn(10751741)

** I'm really into Remus/Hermione time travel shenanigans as well as Sirius/Hermione. They both are pretty much the same concept but with completely different execution. With one, you have to deal with the werewolf angst and Hermione has to help Remus learn to love himself. With Sirius, it's more of a love/hate thing where they eventually open up to each other and build up each other from their vulnerabilities and potential survivors guilt. They also seem similar enough to Snape/Hermione if that's a paying you really like.

Examples:

Linkffn(Chemistry and Timing) I love how original this one is as it twists the concept of the Time Travel fic in ways I won't get into without spoiling the story. Linkffn(11655125) Linkffn(8581093) Linkffn(6370763) Linkffn(12731748)

Incidentally I never get a chance to mention this one, but there's this really fun Hermione/Percy fic that sounds like crack but it make sense for both their characters and gives Percy a bit more development. It's recently completed and while it kind of gets a bit dull during the Deathly Hallows it picks up towards the end linkffn(7670511)

Also as a bonus, here's a somewhat crack fic, somewhat realistic fic in which Severus and Petunia Evans of all people fall in love and because of this fic they've become one of my favorite altTPs. Linkffn(11182721)

****** I mean, I hang out in the Bellamoine Tumblr community, so I get the basic idea (even if I have yet to find a Bellamoine fic I actually like). But the difference is that a Bellatrix redemption CAN, under specific circumstances I have yet to encounter, be pulled off because there is a window where there is no bad blood between Bellatrix and Harry or Hermione (after Azkaban, before she kills Sirius). Snape (and Malfoy) get on the "no no" list within a week at Hogwarts. And it also helps that she does not bully eleven year old kids, she is cool evil like Vader and not well, a shitty teacher.

bellatrix and a handful of other adult DEs failed to secure a prophecy against a few children. snape isn't a threat to harry because he isn't trying to be. he's the reason harry's an orphan, and /lazily/ defeated harry in the 6th book. if he wanted to be a threat, he would be. i don't see any reason to believe bellatrix is more powerful than him in canon

snape being harry's father is a plot scenario to foster a certain dynamic between snape and harry

Therefore she wants revenge on the man who used her for his own rise to power. She's still quick to resort to violence and has little to no restrain, but now is pointed in the general direction of the Death Eaters instead of civilians.

Her redemption comes through killing scores of Death Eaters, she would be an antihero, not some goody two shoes. Also, in the plot I envision for this whole thing she would have people who try to contain her violent tendencies (Andromeda, Sirius, Harry and Hermione), not egg her on further.

Like, Snape pointing out over and over how Harry might be a child but he's been through so much and he's so mature and that makes it okay does not eliminate the scientific fact that his brain is still young and he actually does not have the same capacity to make decisions as an adult.

**** I understand people not being ok with the age difference but in most of the instances with this pairing it isn't typical student teacher situation. We are talking weird war time situations, time turners, and post war when they're grown anyways. Annoying that such a fuss is made when they are almost always all of age.

Harry/Luna is a cozy pairing, Harry/Snape can only be explained by Stockholm syndrome or non-con.

This is a Snevans fic that focuses on what may happen if Severus and Lily get together in Hogwarts, Snape doesn't join the Death Eaters and becomes a magical drug dealer, and Muggleborns have very limited rights, causing a lot of frustration for Lily.

#+begin_quote
  It should've been simple: Severus falls for Lily, Lily falls for Severus, and the pair live happily ever after. Instead, Voldemort is rising, and the Ministry is corrupt. With her options in the wizarding world curtailed, Lily quickly aligns herself with the Order of the Phoenix, whilst boyfriend Severus remains deliberately apolitical. After all, as a full citizen, he's got rather more to lose. With Lily forbidden from earning, he's keeping them both, with all of his spare time eaten up by his apprenticeship and his casual hours behind the bar at the Three Broomsticks. Not to mention his little side-hobby. Avoiding Azkaban. Touting illegal potions carries a rather harsh sentence, you see...

** I wholeheartedly recommend reading fics without any pairings at all.

If you like romance plots and absolutely NEED to have character A and B smash their respective genitals together to enjoy a story, then sure, whatever, you do you.

For me though, between the writings of yaoi-obsessed teenage girls and more than mildly pedophilic fantasies of 40 year old men (yes, I used to be friends with a 35 year old man who loved to write about the sexual escapades of 11 year old Harry and his harem(DalkonCledwin if you wanna check his stuff out for yourself)), I've become so turned off from any kind of pairings that I just outright ignore them. Especially when considering that due to oversaturation of tropes and the creative drought that fandoms inevitably hit, reading fics has become more of a "How many shitty tropes on this bingo card has the author hit? I don't want to read about 14 year old Hermione lusting after a man thrice her age, that's fucking disgusting, and as a straight man I really don't care for slash fics either.

Before I get torn to shreds by an onslaught of comments like "It's their story, they can write it however they want!!!" and "Don't like, don't read!!!", I have to say that this is of course my opinion, and you're free to disagree. However, I'll carry on reading what I like, and you won't change my mind.

Side note: I'm fine with reasonable romantic subplots, as long as they don't hijack half the fuckin story. Subplots should always stay secondary to the main plot.

** Depending on what type of HGSS you like, HG/Tom Riddle (jr) or HG/Voldemort may be for you. It's relatively rare, you'll find most fics posted both on on AO3 and FFnet, but I prefer AO3. My favorite author is Lady Miya, start with Shared Flame. There's also Nerys, Seprent in Red, and others, after a few searches on AO3 you'll start to see some usernames regularly, they're the one that have long finished fics. For a different kind of tomione I can't recommend enough « The Scientist » on ffnet, y uchiha.s. There's also Avada Kedavra Anonymous by Speechwriter (ffnet), if you want something short but hilarious.

** There's a great Ron/Hermione fic that I'm reading right now called "[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/718757/chapters/1331941#workskin][To Know You is to Love You]]".

The premise is that a post-Hogwarts canon Ron and Hermione are having communication issues and understanding one another, so they go to an unorthodox marriage counselor to try to fix things. The counselor's treatment ends up with Ron experiencing Hermione's memories, and Hermione experiencing Ron's memories, both experiencing all the emotions that the other person felt during that time.

The characterization is on point for both characters in my opinion, and is really good about acknowledging that both characters have flaws, both have issues, and both have very real love for one another.

Oh, and it's a completed fic, so it has that going for it too.

The first link is an ao3 link, but here's the Fanfiction.net link if you prefer that site. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9094981/1/To-Know-You-is-to-Love-You]])

** I'd say my favourite pairing would be Tomarry; not 70-odd Voldemort x 15 Harry, but either a Harry goes back in time so they're both the same age and on an even playing field or there's some sort of rebirth / Master of Death backing to it. I specifically differentiate Voldemort and Tom Riddle as regards pairings in FF. I really enjoy it when they are equals and partners in a relationship, makes for an interesting dynamic :) Have to say, major age differences dealbreakers usually for me in a fic.
