*** I really like this. In particular, I like:

- No Ron-bashing. (Though I don't see the point of the Dumbledore-bash.)
- Hermione is more ruthless and dangerous than Harry.
- Harry and Hermione are loyal friends but have their individual agency and are not 'shipped.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8376331][Safe Word is Devil's Snare]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/ShayaLonnie/pseuds/ShayaLonnie][ShayaLonnie]] on AO3 is my favorite of all time but it is an explicit smut fic, so it might not be your cup of tea. Hermione/Neville pairing with Harry/Hannah Abbot, Draco/Astoria, and Ron/OC in the background.

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  A rewrite of 'Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts' done to improve some of the story elements, cut down on the Weasley bashing, and generally make a bit more sense. The changes are minor, but I believe make for a better story.

*** Not really a 'marriage law' fic. It's a non-Ministry sanctioned Marriage Contract fic, with the contracts being offered by the women's families and the Ministry having nothing to do with it beyond allowing such contracts to be legal.

God, I wrote that a long time ago. A whole lot of choices I would make differently now.
