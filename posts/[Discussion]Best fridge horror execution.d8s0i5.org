** linkffn(Mandragora) always got me. It is rather ordinary horror, but the concept the writer used for it is every bit fridge horror.

  Consider the curiously humanoid mandrake root, or mandragora. It is hideously ugly, deadly dangerous, and a powerful restorative. Why would anything else matter? * * A tale of horror. Please review. * *

** Something that's been on my mind for a little while is that the Dementor's Kiss is far worse than creating a Horcrux.\\
Making a Horcrux requires extinguishing an innocent life, but leaves the victim's soul untouched, protects its owner's life as long as it's intact, and it's theoretically possible to heal the creator's soul if they feel remorse.\\
The Dementor's Kiss, on the other hand, destroys or perpetually imprisons someone's entire soul, provides no positive benefit to the Dementor or others (that we know of in canon, anyway), and has no known cure.

It's something that irks me a little in fanfiction, because you have characters going "Egads, this guy is a murderer who's cut slivers off his own soul to extend his life! Let's gruesomely murder all his followers we can find and /destroy/ the souls of the ones we take prisoner!"\\
Sometimes, anyway. Usually in those 'Super!Harry with political power' fics.

** I think obliviation is another form of fridge horror. Your memories are who you are, and yet there's a spell to erase them. Of course, the potential depends on how you interpret it to work exactly. For example, is Lockhart the result of a memory charm gone wrong or is it canon that they can't be reversed?

** Fridge horror? I didn't see this while reading the books, but Lockhart had the potential to be infinitely more terrifying that he was. A good memory deleter in a school full of teen girls?

I've seen it used in a couple of fics, but I can't remember which ones.

** Enter the Dragon (on Questionable Questing) has a lighthearted romp through Harry being ridiculously overpowered, set against a dark backdrop of "mind magic enables widespread human trafficking, breeding programs, etc". It's funny to see Harry eating the troll, the Basilisk, and even Quirrelmort but not so funny when a man's fiancee was kidnapped and sold to a "fantasy" brothel where she's magically programmed to act out whatever the client wants, and in order to keep tabs on her until such time as he can free her, he has to /hire her services and leave his own magically altered fluids in her as a tracker/, because no other tracker will stick.

Methods of Rationality addresses the horror of Azkaban, and the danger inherent in transfiguration; how long could a skilled wizard maintain a transfiguration of mere micrograms of botulinum toxin? What if someone transfigured a large strangelet?

*** Do you have a link for this? The only one I can find on that site is where Harry turns into a dragon.

#+begin_quote
  The crumbling island prison of Azkaban has been evacuated, its remaining prisoners left behind. Time growing short, Harry Potter will make one final bid for freedom, enlisting an unlikely crew of allies in a daring escape, where nothing is as it seems.
