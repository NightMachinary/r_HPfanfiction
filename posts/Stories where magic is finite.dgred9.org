** Magic isn't finite in Harry Potter and the Natural 20, Milo even complains about that.

*** I think this is splitting hairs. Milo's own magic is finite per day if you don't count cantrips, which is what I was referring to in the OP. I'm trying to find more stories where the main character has more limited resources, magically speaking.

**** I think I misunderstood also- perhaps "magic /use/ is finite" would've been a clearer way to phrase that.

I thought you meant more on a grand scale- "magic is running out, all the wizards are going to become muggles/die, what do we do?" sort of scenario.

I guess my rec doesn't fit, my b.

***** Thanks for the input, I'll re-evaluate the way I try to get things across.

**** If someone talks about the magic inside a Harry Potter fanfic, I obviously assume they're talking about the Harry Potter magic.

You could have simply said you want a magic system similar to D&D.

***** I'll agree to disagree. I feel that the intent of the post was clear, you don't - let's leave it at that.

  Harry defeated Voldemort with the power he knew not, a power far more valuable than his freedom. Sealed away until next he was needed, the Wizarding Saviour slept through the fall of his race, of magic and almost the world. Now he has been woken, the last avatar of a dead species and a being whose purpose is so old that only the bones of the Earth remember. Gen. Adult themes.
