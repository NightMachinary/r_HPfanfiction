Can anyone recommend any Harry Potter Fanfic where the characters are outrageously out of character , filled with fanfic tropes and just cringe to read but you'll burst out laughing. I just read the Immortal , the OG Harry Potter fanfic and I need more cringe crack fics. Please link them down below in case someone else would also like to read them. Thank you. Bear in mind complete crack without it going serious in the middle or having a plot. Cursed Child doesn't count. If anyone ever writes one in the future do link it below.

** And am I going to get our account's flagship story out here

linkffn(Put into Lifetime Detention by Death)

The story was written as a parody-by-imitation, so the more outrageous the better. There are even troll Author's Notes. Absolute emo (except for the change of writer note)

See folks, this is shameless self-promotion.

  Reptilia28 Challenge. Harry learns the fallacy of forgiveness at a Maternal!Reaper's knee. He realises that maximum control is the only way to destroy the Voldemort ideology. ALL Death Eaters(inc Snape) are bad. Max Revenge, Min romance, CRACK/heavy tropey/OTT elements, so distrusted but not bashed Weasleys and Dumbledore. (Add pinches of salt to taste!)

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/27799261/chapters/68056189]]) How Fate Intended by hoboheartache is absolutely shameless and a fun read but I think it might turn plotty later, I'm only a few chapters in. The plot I saw when I skipped to the current chapters looked pretty damn cracky though.

The writer seems to have trawled for every single fanon trope they could get and has shoved them right in to see what will happen.

  The tattered memory of Tom Riddle sat on the porch of number 4 Privet Drive, pressing desperately into the horcrux housed in Harry Potter's forehead. orIn which Harry Potter is unceremoniously thrust back in time and is forced to deal with Voldemort whining inside his head, at least Death had the decency to apologize.
