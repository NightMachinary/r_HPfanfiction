Either having magical creatures or animals as an important part of the story; or focusing on exploring magic and/or magical research. The Art of Self-Fashioning, The Arithmancer and its sequel Lady Archimedes are my favourite fics by far, and I'm looking for stories in a similar vein. Thanks!

Edit: I quite like munchkinry, such as in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11572455/1/If-Looks-Could-Kill][If Looks Could Kill]].

  Gen, AU. In a world where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry still grows up with the Dursleys, but he learns to be more private about what matters to him. When McGonagall comes to give him his letter, she also unwittingly gives Harry both a new quest and a new passion: Transfiguration. Mentor Minerva fic. Rated for violence.
