I've just read the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/968343][The Confectionary Chronicles]] on ao3, and I was wondering if there are fics with a similar premise? (badass Hermione)


** Hermione is a central character in most of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][my stories]], and often a badass.

** Hermione in the Arithmancer series is pretty badass, but it takes a while for her to get there.

** So, this story is a Sevmione story which freaks a lot of people out. That's fine. I'm not usually into it either. This is just so well written and kind of intense that I really enjoy it.

Hermione outs Snape to Voldemort and takes his place as the Order spy. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2162474/1/When-A-Lioness-Fights][When a Lioness Fights]]

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
