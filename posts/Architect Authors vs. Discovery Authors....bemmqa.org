Make the difference between a complete but stale story and an incomplete but well-developed story.\\
That's not to say that this is always true, but it makes a lot of sense. I watched a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTZEFGvMH0k&][Plotting a Story]] video by JPB (he's hilarious, check it out) and noticed a pattern. Architects have a tendency of making their stories too predictable, and Discovery writers (especially long-runners) never seem to get to the point, that is, if they don't abandon their story altogether (I'm guilty of this to some extent).

That being said, what kind of writer are you? Or rather, which kind of stories do you like reading? What would you recommend for people to the extremes of each side?


** I very much like intricate worlds.

The latter type risk writing themselves into corners, either by accidentally 'answering' the problem of the story without actually meaning too, or by losing themselves as you said.

I think that optimal path is a bit of both - like, what I'm doing is constructing the form of the world (how magic works, outlines of magical history and backstory). Figuring out how magic works (in particular, what it can and cannot do, and possibly why) can help avoid accidental OP. Reading through your notes and trying to munchkin things (pretend your SI'ing yourself with your current knowledge - what would you do to break the system?)

Once that skeleton is formed, you can switch to discovery and exploration - the skeleton will guide you in the iterated effects of the actions of your characters, and by gluing pieces to it that correspond to stations of plot you want to do, you can explore paths to them.
