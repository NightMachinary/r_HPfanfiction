** There's something like it in the Carrow stories (the ones where Harry gets blasted 40,000 years in to the future and by the time he makes it back he's an Inquisitor with full Space Marine body modifications and power armour). He paints a lot of pictures of his old Space Marine brothers of the Charnel Guard, and they get loose in Hogwarts. To the point where their Chaplain delivers sermons at mealtimes on the Glory of the Emperor and Hate For The Xenos.

#+begin_quote
  The Wizarding World is devastated when Harry Potter disappears from his relatives' house in mysterious circumstances during the summer after his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

***** I feel I must inform you that it is your fault that I have now discovered warhammer 40k, I decided to do a bit of background research into the setting and am now waist deep in a plethora of lore and speculation that would make a team of archaeologists run screaming. I am not entirely sure whether I should thank you or burn you at the stake, but I am certain it's your fault. Time to go back to another multi hour documentary on what the fuck is 40k.

** I could see this getting pretty dark if magical signatures or an 'imprint' of the mind of the person in the painting is required for its creation.

A muggleborn so enamored with Star Wars that he obliviates his pureblood bully and manipulates his memories so he thinks he actually is DV before painting/imprinting. His bully runs around for his amusement as a caricature of 'evil' in perpetuity.

*Edit:*

I'm getting into this idea. A muggleborn dark wizard rising in the background while the war with Voldemort rages on. A few years older than Harry. A natural or gifted Legilimens that picks up on Lockhart's skill and devises a plan to get rid of a few of his bullies.

He implants false memories as characters in muggle fiction, paints the portraits, then completely obliviates them, landing them in St.Mungos. Lockhart takes the fall, and all the muggleborn students are delighted and entertained by the influx of portraits they recognize. Snape being suspicious since Lockhart was an idiot, yes, but what could possibly cause him to target those low achieving students? It's barely a blip on Harry's radar outside of passing amusement (portraits) and righteous anger at Lockhart (obliviated students), which are treated as two unrelated occurrences.

Painter keeps his head down and conveniently misplaces the portraits (not knowing or caring where they end up). Darth Vader stages battles against the other portraits that's humiliating for him since he just breathes funny, rants, and doesn't actually have the Force. Everyone thinks it's silly and all in good fun. It's like Buzz Light-year in the very beginning of Toy story. It goes on for years until the Fiendfyre incident in the room of hidden things.

Painter graduates and lives his life quietly and is secretly a serial killer for muggleborn supremacy. He starts a portrait business that's supposedly revolutionary due to 'new techniques' that don't require imprints, which becomes a hit in muggleborn homes everywhere. George tries to hit him up for a partnership on those 'joke muggle villain portraits'.

Maybe this could be half-told in Harry's perspective as an auror investigating the string of mysterious disappearances of pureblood supremacists the last ten+ years. He could struggle with the quandaries of prosecuting the Painter's vigilante justice through morally abhorrent means while the public opinion is just 'good riddance'.
