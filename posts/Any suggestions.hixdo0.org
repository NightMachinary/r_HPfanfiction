Does anyone know any good fics where harry uses accidental magic to get to Potter Manor/Castle... and gets trained by the portraits, the elves or something he then arrives at Hogwarts OP and knowing a lot about magic. (OP Harry if possible) Harry Potter and the lightning lord, if anyone has read it, is a good example. Preferably over 200k, but I'm not picky.Thank you.


** Not exactly, but slightly it is used in linkffn(12155794).

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** I don't remember how OP Harry becomes in these, but, apart from the accidental magic, they seem to fit.

linkffn(Elfish Welfare by tyrranicpuppy) and linkffn(Harry Potter and the Magic Unleashed by Sooner90) both have Harry rescued from Godric's Hollow by a Potter elf and brought up by portraits in Potter Manor.
