Hi!

I love Time travel fics in the Harry Potter universe and would like to discover new ( or old and/or not really known ) ones. I know it is quite a popular request, but I think I have read most of the one that have been recced here.

I like every pairings, slash or het ( just maybe not Harry/Ginny ), and for the time where he travels, marauder era, TMR era or even before is okay! I just want to read good time travel fics.

I like when it is Harry-centric but if you have any good other character centric fic, I'll take it!

Because I can't seem to find any well-written fic by myself, so if you could rec any fic that you enjoyed, I would be happy!

thanks :)


** I just ran across linkffn(Timely Errors by Worfe) the other day, and thought it was very good. A number of students travel to random times, but the story concentrates on Harry.

My favorite time-travel one-shot is [[http://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Deja_Vu/Deja_Vu/][Deja Vu by Aaron St. Vines]], which asks the question, "What's the most efficient way to come up with a better outcome?"

Another one-shot that starts with more-or-less the same premise is Unsealed by esama, which is no longer on ffnet, but [[https://web.archive.org/web/20120307095121/http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6312958/1/Unsealed][can still be found on archive.org]].

Another good story is linkffn(Retrograde by Knife Hand). Harry's trial for underage magic goes differently because someone knows more than they should about Harry.

Most of the other time-travel stories that I consider good are the better-known ones, but I've got these that aren't "Harry travels" in my pending list:

linkffn(The Bureaucratic Error by Iniga). Remus gets sarcastic with the Powers That Be, and gets a redo.

linkffn(Ginny Returns by kb0). Ginny gets a redo.

linkffn(Like Grains of Sand in the Hourglass by Temporal Knight). Tonks goes back in time physically, resulting in two of her.

Oh Wow. I had forgotten about this. Very sorry to hear about that, I can imagine how frustrating it is to go through the stuff you have already gone out and done before. Good luck!

******** I had forgotten as well, but I'm still trying to find the time to keep up with stuff online and I'd finally gotten to the bottom of my messages list and refound your message and that reminded me. It is frustrating, especially since I have no idea what old me was thinking at some of these categories - I literally have folders named 'forgiveness fucks shit up, lets fix it' and 'specialist misanthropic (non BWL) Harry with a cause' and 'bad is good, good is bad'. Weirdly, the second one is the easiest of the three to sort to - I already have six fics there! :)

And hopefully - if reddit is still around when I finally finish this. (:D). On that note, might be worth posting a thread asking for curated fic lists, see if you can get some other folks posting their lists too. :)

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
