I've seen this in a few fics as elements, like Ginny being jealous of Harry's new beau (typically Daphne Greengrass, Cho, or even Hermione), but those stories oft come with terrible "bashing" and caricature/flat characterizations (and awful superwank-Harry stories).

Does anyone have any recs where a girl is jealous of Harry's new girlfriend? I don't mind the jealous party being Hermione or Ginny, if they're not caricatures, and the more unusual/unused the girl being jealous (like Pansy being jealous), the better.

...Actually, Cho becoming jealous of Harry and Katie hooking up could be a good read. But I digress.

I'd like to avoid the really bad tropes seen in superwank stories (you know the ones), too: after years of reading them, I kinda just click on the red x now when I see them.

  She had loved her best friend since she was fourteen years old and he never knew. But it never mattered because she was never his to begin with.
