** There's this one fic, I forgot what its called but basically Harry has a power called the order of the phoenix or something which gives huge magical reserves and the voices of the older bearers of the phoenix thing (I think that's what it was called but I'm not 100% sure) that matches this description. It's not written from his perspective for a good part of it and he's also fairly subtle with his superness without actively hiding it.

*** Here's the link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/826742/1/The-Order-of-the-Phoenix][Fanfiction.net]] [[http://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Order_of_the_Phoenix/index/][fanficauthors.net]]

The first one is longer but the second was updated more recently and was the one I had in my favourites. That probably means it was the better one to read but I can't be sure. I remember this being a good read but the sequel not so much; they're both worth reading though.

*** I just finished reading Harry's first year in this story, and I'm liking it so far. (I do like Loony!Harry). However, so far I'm disappointed in the so called Reading!Harry - he hasn't really been shown as reading very much, nor is he really more knowledgeable.

Not sure if I like the GeniusResearcher!Hermione. So far, it almost seems like too much of a power boost, but we'll see.
