** My favorite Harry/Charlie fic is [[http://esamastation.tumblr.com/post/128472799296/flying-again-1-250][Flying Again by esama]]. It's a great Temeraire fusion where Harry and Charlie are the reincarnations of Temeraire and Lawrence. Dragon Harry is fabulous!

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/127766][Forget-Me-Not by Sa_kun]] is a Harry/Charlie fic. linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/127766][127766]]) Harry struggles with his sexuality and dates Charlie. The author has another Harry/Charlie fic called Requiem for a Dream linkao3(205847) that's part of a series.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1325029][May Contain Nuts by Scoradh]] is an incredibly sweet Harry/George post-war recovery fic. linkao3(1325029)

Another great Harry/George fic is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2020146][Two out of Three by wynnebat]] linkao3(2020146). It's a nice variation on the usual Ginny love potions Harry trope.
