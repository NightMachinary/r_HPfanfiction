A couple of years ago, I wrote a quodpot story as part of a lengthier one that I never finished. I found it again, if you'd like to read it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13070109/1/Game-Seven][Game 7]]

But it got me wondering if there were any other takes on game more popular in America.

Thanks!
