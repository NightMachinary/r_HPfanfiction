I'm trying to write a tier list of the best/most common Animagus forms.

In canon, there's only Prongs, Padfoot, Wormtail, McGonagall and Skeeter. What are some other common or interesting Animagus forms from fanfiction?

Please mention the fic, which characters become which animals and examples of how their animal forms are useful.

Example:

Harry Potter and the Lady Thief

-Animagus: Hermione

-Form: Brown cat

-Used for: Spying, climbing, breaking into places

  After the Battle of Hogwarts, everyone expected Harry Potter to become an auror. Harry himself expected it, right up until the moment came to apply to the academy. He takes up a hobby instead, and it leads him to a whole new world.

** In a Black Comedy, Harry is a turkey Animagus if memory serves.\\
In OH God Not Again, he's a snake Animagus. Which is great for sneaking around, or catching Rats.\\
In Parting the Continents, Luna was a polar bear.\\
In Bungle in the Jungle, Harry's a Jaguar.\\
Those two are probably very good at killing. Jaguar is really fast and should also be a very fun shape to assume.\\
I also saw a bat animagus somewhere. And maybe a platipus, though this one might have just been hinted at.

All in all, had I to pick, I'd choose the jaguar. Just because I find it cool.

Hope it helps.

Other animagi in that series are Neville (Orang-utan), Hermione (Tiger), Ginny (Honey Bear) and Luna Lovegood (Red-headed Crane). Harry can turn into Krypto while Snape is secretly a black bird of some sort (probably a Crow or Raven, the story doesn't actually say).

On the villains side, Voldie is a Krait (snake), Gellert is a Vulture and Barty Jr is a Wolverine.

Most of these are attained in the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12564837/1/A-Distant-Storm][third story]] and prove to be plot points of one sort or another.

Is one of the best depictions of the process of becoming an animagus in my opinion, none of that "trasnform body part by body part" that honestly I always though was stupid

‚Äã

For Love of Magic

-Animagus: Harry

-Form: Raven

-Used for: spying

‚Äã

Harry learns to talk to the ravens and make them search for his enemies, while the process of becoming an animagus is not very interesting, at least is not silly
