The prompt is as such: A ‘grey' Harry who believes in killing anyone with a dark mark and thus defeating all evil gets sucked into an alternate dimension. So he goes out and kills every slytherin, the Malfoys, Blacks, Lesteanges, etc. He is hailed as the darkest wizard on par with Dark Lord Dumbledore and his order of the Phoenix terrorist organisation. Oops.


** "I heard that the Malfoys are hosting a ball for all their death eater friends! Everyone's going to be there! Let's blow it up!"

Breaking news: Radical terrorists attack the annual summer ball! Dozens of respectable members of high society dead!

Basically every second Starfox5 fic.

*** Kinda, though it's usually Hermione doing it, not Harry like OP asked. (And, let's face it, it's a much more Hermione thing to do in the first place.)

"You know, in my first year at Hogwarts, I solved a lethal potions puzzle so that my friend could secure the Philosopher's Stone, but do they call me Hermione, the Puzzle-Busting Treasure Hunter? No. Second year, I brewed a difficult potion in an improvised lab from stolen ingredients, but do they call me Hermione, Potioneer Extrarodinaire? No. Next year, I managed to master a completely foreign legal system while taking a physically impossible course load, but do they call me Hermione, Scholarly Defender of the Oppressed? No. But you blow up /one measly ball/..."

** If someone writes this I hope Harr's characterized exactly the way he is in canon, except he's a ruthless killer. Like he'd be totally clueless as tho why people fear him or something

*** “But I'm just Harry!” Harry says, puzzled, as he idly picked the pieces of viscera out of his hair.

** In [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167), Ministry declared him a terrorist after he began vigilante killings of Death Eaters who escaped justice again after the war. Not all his former followers support him, but enough do.

I personally enjoy this type of fics. I don't give a fuck about what the Ministry thinks. This piece of corrupt, incompetent, and malicious failed state totally deserves to be burnt down to the ground and rebuilt from the foundation.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.
