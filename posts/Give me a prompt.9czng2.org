Hey friends,

I want to write stories for all the following couples but I've been in a bit of a writer's block for this fandom. (I write in other fandoms so this will be my first time.)

Scorpius/Rose,Hugo/Lily,Katie/Oliver,Angelina/George,Astoria/Draco

​

Could you please send me some requests prompts? I really want to write a longer one-shot (>6000 words) so make it a little more complicated if you feel inclined. Thanks! :)

​

PS-Smut is totally cool but I need more than a pwp request.


** “Rose had to begrudgingly hand it to Flitwick --- his detentions were nothing if not inventive.”

And go from there! (What's the inventive detention, what landed her there, and how has it affected her friendships?)

*** This is awesome. I adore the concept of the Rose/Albus/Scorpius trio as the Golden Trio 2.0 so I can see a lot of fun and hijinks galore.

​

I usually spend several weeks to a few months writing simply because of school, work, and prepping my grad school app, but when its finished I'll message you so you can see it. :)

**** Yes!! Seriously, please message me when you've got something (even if you don't end up using my prompt after all). I'd love to see what comes of it.

** Fed up with their bickering, Albus uses special Weasley's Wizard Wheezes handcuffs to bind Rose and Scorpius's wrists together.

** George and Angelina, because I actually haven't read a story about them specifically before. I guess something doing something involving teamwork. Either something about being the better uncle and aunt or something competitive over the rest of their family.

*** Oh! This sounds like a fun humor fit in the meeting. I'm not sure if I might even like the idea of them competing with each other. Then again, two is better than one ;)

**** Don't worry and take your time! I sort of understand where you are coming from. I'm starting my freshman year of University this fall and it is definitely a new setting for me.

** Angelina hated George's black moods. She wanted her friend back. Mourning the dead forever was suicide. Fred wouldn't want George to act like this. As he comes back to life, she finds herself falling for the man he was becoming.
