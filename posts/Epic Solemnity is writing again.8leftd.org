A bit off topic, but I know Epic Solemnity has tons of fans on here. To refresh some memories, she's one of the best slash writers in the fandom, the author of fics like Death of Today, Deliver Us from Sorrow's Hold, and Dreams and Darkness Collide.

Anyway, we chat a bit, and I convinced her to upload an original story she's working on to Fictionpress (+patreon account, though I don't think she's made it yet) instead of going the amazon self-publishing route. As such, I'm somewhat obligated to shill her story ;P

[[https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3325086/1/Immunity-Part-I-Concordia]]

It's very much in the style of her other works. She's already written 150k-200k~ of this, so updates will likely come with quick regularity. Having read the first 20 chapters myself I can promise it's some /really/ fantastic stuff. Please leave reviews to support her and tell everyone you know she's churning out free entertainment for us again :)


** She might be a good writer, great even, but you lost me at slash.

*** Not trying to persuade anyone to read her fics. Cups of tea and all that. This is meant to be a friendly notice aimed at people who've already enjoyed her writing and would have wanted to know if she was putting out more material.

*** My ex was a huge fan of DoT, and convinced me to read it despite my similar aversion to slash. It's a pretty darn good read regardless.

*** Same here, the fix might be amazing, but as soon as slash is mentioned, I drop them like I dropped the chimichanga I just microwaved an hour ago. The cheese was like molten lava, but it was still good

*** Sure!

Here's her profile: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2093991/Epic-Solemnity]]

linkffn(Death of Today by Epic Solemnity)

linkffn(Deliver Us from Sorrow's Hold by Epic Solemnity)

linkffn(Dreams and Darkness Collide by Epic Solemnity)

You can find her old works archived under the pseudonym Dark Cyan Star on Ao3 ([[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Dark_Cyan_Star/profile]]) and even /older/ works through her ancient yahoo group -- though you might have to do some googling on that front.

Happy reading.

  COMPLETE LV/HP: Raised in a Muggle orphanage, Harry arrives at Hogwarts a bitter boy. Unusually intelligent, he's recruited by the Unspeakables and the Death Eaters at a young age. As he grows older, he constantly has to struggle to keep his footing around a manipulative and bored Dark Lord, who fancies mind games and intellectual entertainment.

  SM/HP: He'd tried everything to get rid of 'them', the Hallows. But they kept coming back to him, recognizing him as the one and only Master of Death. Jaded and desperate for eternal sleep, Harry immediately becomes wary of a possessive demon that could curse him further into the pits of hell.

  AUSLASH! Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned
