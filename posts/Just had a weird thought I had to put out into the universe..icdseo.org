So a standard fic with a smart Harry who wants to be in the triwizard tournament, and figures out that he can just throw crumpled up paper balls into the cup to get his name in but he keeps missing and while being lectured by hermione for trying to enter he randomly yells “KOBE” and sinks his paper in the cup, hermione stops mid sentence to ask why he shouted that, and Harry says” I don't know but I suddenly feel sad.


** haha! Although, was Kobe Bryant in the NBA in the 1990s?
