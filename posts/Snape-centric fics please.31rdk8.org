I've posted this before, but I'm out of Snape stories to read!

Anything with Snape as the main character.

I'll post some of the ones I have collected as well.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][/The Best Revenge/ by Arsinoe de Blassenville]]

*Summary:* AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

*My comments:* A good feel-good story.

*** Yeah, read it already. It was pretty good, but I like darker stories more.

*** Haha yayyyyy that's my comment that I always repost when people ask for Snape stories :)

If you haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3570937/1/The-Better-Man][The Better Man]] which was recommended in your last thread, it's really good! It's not complete but I'm pretty sure it's not abandoned. I haven't found any new Snape stories since then unfortunately!

**** I started The Better Man, but I couldn't go on after the first few chapters. It seemed weird that Snape would randomly adopt Harry with the Dursleys without knowing anything. I just didn't like the feel. It didn't have a build-up.

*** I've read all of them except the last, and they are really good. 8thweasleykid's other stories are good as well.

**** You're right, thanks! It's a reference to a poem by Robert Frost: Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, if you didn't know.
