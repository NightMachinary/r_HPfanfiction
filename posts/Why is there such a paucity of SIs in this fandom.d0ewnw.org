Self inserts and OCs can be one of my favorite things that a story does, largely because it's new and exciting when done well. Bonus points if they diverge from canon because their very existence changes things.

Unfortunately it just doesn't seem to be done very often in this fandom, despite how many more fics it has compared to others.

Is it because of the golden trio dynamic? Does the focus on Harry discourage it? I'm coming back from reading a bunch of Naruto fanfiction, pleasenojudgement, and enjoyed how often new characters would show up there.

Also any recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks loves!

** I've read several good ones, but most people wanting to write with OCs will just grab the closest match from among the undefined canon characters. I feel like the timing just didn't work out: the HP fandom was established long before the SI craze, and so the newer writers who are into SI are more likely to put themselves into Marvel or Naruto or BNHA or whatever's popular now.

I started one of my own, but I've been so busy lately with RL stuff it's been sitting unfinished for a year or more now.

*** I think it's more that the fandom is over SI, and it was still called OC when it got over it. Because a decade ago I remember reading more stories with original characters.

But go to ff.net and sort by OC as character and you get 45.3K hits. A whole page of which were updated today.

** Part of it is that you don't have a proof of concept. Or perhaps more accurately, a proof that SIs can be done well in the fandom. For Naruto fanfiction, Dreaming of Sunshine was a real trailblazer in showing you could have a well written story based around a Naruto universe SI which encouraged not only readers to give SIs a chance, but encouraged writers to make SI stories without fear of the sort of judgment reserved for SI stories. Within the Harry Potter fandom you had a similar sort of genre setter/trope maker for Peggy Sue fics in Harry Potter and Nightmares of Future's Past, but no equivalent for SIs.

 

Unfortunately by now I think it too late to have that sort of fic. For example, What's Her Name in Hufflepuff is great enough that I think could live up to that standard, if it were more popular. But even given that, we are years and years past the end of the canon series being published. It's simply too late for a renaissance of fanfic to have much of a realistic chance of happening. For comparison, Dreaming of Sunshine started before we knew anything about Tobi and Nightmares of Future's Past began before we knew Snape's true loyalties

** Propably because an SI that doesn't do a Canon rehash in HP setting would have nothing to do if he's inserted in original timeline. The plot and it's resolutions in HP hinge heavily on luck, mystery and special circumstsnces, SI character in such setting would break it an instant if someone was to write him realistically.

It's not Naruto where previous knowledge can't really help you if you're not OP beforehand, or ASOIAF where it does you no good because of the setting.

I've read like two SI stories in HP, one was ok but only because the MC is avoiding conflict resolution for contrived reasons, and the other ended up an inevitable Sue because you just can't not do that in the setting.

**** Well, it could work, but it would be a bitch to write compared to the main storyline - we have very few named characters from marauders era, and like 3 from Riddle era. You'd basically create a parade of OCs, which not everyone may enjoy.

Personally I've thought about making an SI into riddle or even Dumbledore era, but instead of writing as he goes I'd write from Harry's perspective and see the fallout, with an interlude here and there from said SI, but I'm not sure if it would work

An SI gets sent to the HP world, and they immediately go tell Dumbledore about the horcruxes and shit, and then they screw up somehow and stuff just starts to spiral way out of control. They broke the setting, now they have to live with a whole unknown future ahead of them. A Voldemort they can't predict, a war they can't predict.

** As others have said, SI characters suffer from the way much of the plot is set up in the HP series - solved by children, and with a lot of easily preventable mistakes. A SI character sliding in is all too easy to make it all ridiculously easy - eg, if you know that Ron's rat is actually Wormtail from the start, how hard can it be to find a way to expose him?

Little points of knowledge like that screw canon up a lot, and because the universe is set up in a way that Harry & co, despite being children, can actually solve the situations on their own. So you slide in a SI, and suddenly it's easy.

SI characters can also easily fall into the situation of being too overpowered and boring to read about - like all the worst parts of the OP Harry trope, but in a random new character. It's hard to write that well.

I find that OCs have a lot more potential - eg, one of my favorite fanfics follows an OC - linkffn(Harry Potter and the Natural 20) - but is not exactly a 'typical' setup. The issue is that with so many undefined characters, OCs have much less of a need in the HP story base - you can just grab an undefined character who has a name and make him/her what you want your OC to be, and it's much more reasonable for many. Eg, if you want a 'starcrossed lovers' story between Harry and a Slytherin girl, why make an OC when you can grab Daphne Greengrass and make that ill defined character from canon whoever you want her to be? Or if you're looking for a friend from Hufflepuff, pick one of those named characters and flesh them out. That's very easy to slide into canon and make it reasonable, whereas adding in OCs can be a lot more jarring.

TL:DR - Self Inserts have a bad reputation as wish fulfillment, and if they come in with actual knowledge of the series then it's too easy to make it ridiculously easy with a few plot points. OCs can be great, but are less necessary with how many characters exist as solely a name - grabbing one of those and using them usually works better within a relatively canon-like Hogwarts.

** In addition to Whatsername in Hufflepuff, which has already been linked, the other good SI I can think of is linkffn(A Curse Of Truth), which has the added bonus of being complete! The protagonist in that one ends up getting to be a little more powerful than the rest of the main cast, but in a fairly believable way, in that a 30 year-old who has just discovered that magic exists is going to be a much more dedicated & efficient learner than your average 14 year-old. In any case, I remember it being pretty funny, and it takes place entirely within 4th year, which I thought was a nice mix-up.

gl looking! I do think the relative dearth of SIs in the HP fandom is because there's a lot of scorn associated with them, and so many people just don't dare write one. They can be really fun, though, so I hope you enjoy what you find :)

** linkffn(11691332) SI can work, but really, if it's not crackfic it ain't gonna work well.

Someone linked to 'What's her name in Hufflepuff' - a decent work, but unfinished as of yet, so you can't judge in all of it's complexity. If the author was writing a bit faster then it could propably work as a proof of concept that you can make SI fics in HP-verse, as long as you shift the focus from main plot to other things.

It's well written and a fun read, but the MC ends up a Sue - but really, if you are capable of writing a readable fic, and your character is supposedly an insert of yours, and then proceeds to fail miserably at magic that's been shown to correlate with general academic apptitude, then it is bad and contrived writing.

** I think mainly it's because they suck. Stories with SI characters are hardly ever good. In turn they don't have much review so not a lot of writers get attracted to it.

SI and OC are good when done cleverly, but not when a 14 year old girl inserts herself into the story with some of those cringey things 14 year old girls think are nice. I mean seriously, I won't be ever interested about Harry's long lost sister. This is just one way those suck. There are other ways as well. A good writer can cleverly disguse SI characters (I mean look at how JKR wrote Hermione) but most fanfiction authors are frankly not that good. Usually these OC and SI characters don't have a flaw if they are a MC and sometimes they are overpowered.

But everyone enjoys what they enjoy, so I'm not judging. But I won't go out of my way to R&R them either. Not in just Harry Potter, but avoid reading stories with SI and OC main characters by habit. From my experience they are usually not that good.

And it's easier to get invested in established characters. If a writer is writing an OC they have to establish that character from the ground up. But the reasons you gave seems about right as well.

The thing is, if you would teleport an engineer into Game of Thrones, he could make a significant impact, especially with knowledge of the plot. Full industrialisation would require magic to pull off, but some basics would be within the realms of the possible.

But if you dumped someone into the HP world, all they have is the books. They do not know magic and are therefore mostly useless. Emotional support at best. Unless you make the SI super talented, which is just bad writing and the definition of wish-fulfilment

#+end_quote

Just slap a canon name on them and you are golden. After all, I got a Harry/Lisa Turpin fic to 2200 followers, and the books mention her once or twice at best. OCs are stigmatised because usually, they are badly written (attractive, perfect partner for the MC, surprising parallels to the author when it comes to pop-culture tastes). Also, their names are usually atrocious.

If you dump someone into HP world, having any of the book conflict transpire hinges either on SI being such a pussy they wouldn't do a thing or utter a word to anyone, or putting him in a setting with the rest of characters so OOC it's impossible to get help.

C'mon, put yourself in a canon setting as a first year in the same year as Harry. Wing it for a year, learn some stuff, go to Dumbledore at the start of year two and sweep out all of the Horcruxes clean, ward off Albanian forests and you've got 6 chill schoolyears left with no plausible conflict.

#+end_quote

Even if you told Dumbledore everything, that does not resolve the Horcrux Harry has in his forehead (disregarding fanon removal methods). Also, both Dumbledore and Hagrid have to know what the monster in the CoS is, yet neither does anything about it. Dumbledore in canon is not some miracle worker who fixes shit. I mean, just look at how he handled Malfoy. It is a small miracle neither Katie nor Ron and Slughorn died due to Dumbledore "taking care" of the fascist terrorist in his school. He even openly admitted his conspiracy to commit child abuse and torture.

As a 20-odd year old in a school designed for young teenagers, in magic that relies heavily on academic apptitude (as showcased by Hermione) in non-combat situations? I'd crush it. And most people that write good fanfics are rather good at reading, writing, thinking and all that stuff, so they'd propably crush it too.\\
And do remember that up to year 5 in original timeline you can solve all the conflict with no or little magic at all if you were let on the premises. Bonus points if you get yourself a philosopher's stone in the process.

As to the other part of your post - as for the Horcrux, we get rid of others, make Albanian Forests (TM) unplottable and some other schmuck that makes it hard to find and get rid of Peter and Crouch, effectively getting rid of Voldemort's possible comeback methods. Then just wait 'till Harry buys it from old age.

In CoS - sure they knew. But they didn't know the entrance to the chamber, so they might as well keep silent and play dumb instead of getting flack for letting a 5X beast roam around in school.

As far as Malfoy situation goes - he didn't really need to bother from his perspective - all he knew was that a kid wants to off him, but believed he won't do this, so he let it play out. Not ideal, but really not an issue if you go to him with location of 6 out of 6 horcruxes before any of the shit hits the fan. He is the dude to get rid of the previous wizard Hitler, he isn't completely useless.

There is a good case to be made that Dumbledore would just go off and die to the Ring. He knew that it was cursed, yet still put it on after all. And once that is done, he has a year to live.

The stone still works after getting basilksked, so it might as well be you or anyone else going in there wands blazing, stabbing the damn thing and giving it to Dumbles curse-free (presumably).

Or do nothing at first, as long as you have Voldie in a place noone can find him thanks to some magics that hide stuff you can just get a horcrux stash, then fiendyfire the hell out of it after Harry passes on from old age or other natural causes. If Voldie somehow comes back anyway he still can go and off himself

What's there to fail? Ask Kreacher, go into RoR, get the diary from Ginny. Only issues are Harry and Cup, but I think Sirius could lay claim to the vault once Bella bites it and we can wait for Harry to die of old age.

TBH that's why you need to work on making a fic interesting and it's difficult- at least as long as you don't want to drop the idiot ball.

I don't know...How do you find Kreacher? You'll need Sirious first. Once you've told Dumbledore about the Horcruxes and their location, seeing how close to the chest he handle things, he's not about to let you tag along in the hunt. Instead he thanks you profusely, goes straight to the Gaunt shack despite your warnings and puts on the ring. Dumbledore will be dead by the end of year 2 and you have a very different fic.\\
And who says Ginny still got the book? Maybe Lucius gave it to another person. Maybe the diary manages to drain his victim completely and you now have a very young, very sane, and very evil Tom Riddle on your hair aside from Voldemort.

Not true. In first year, you're 11 years old and just started magic. Quirrel is far stronger than you. Harry killed him thanks to very specific circumstances. Year two. I know it doesn't transpire much from the books, but only a fool would think a Basilisk isn't dangerous. If for aren't able, for whatever reason, to get a hold of the diary you're in for a lot of trouble, potentially. Let's not talk about the Dementors in year 3.

#+begin_quote
  I'll take my chances with fidelius forestry.
#+end_quote

Who's gonna cast it? You gonna need some crazy powerful wizard to hide the entire forrests of Albania under Fidelius.\\
Honestly if I was a SI in Potterverse, I'd focus on my education and would'nt pay to much heed to the plot.\\
Despite, what makes you think the book are a reliable account of the events they describe? For all you know, it could've been considerably watered down, since the target readers are kids.

I mean, there's nothing which prevents you from making your fic interresting instead of a boring fix fic.
