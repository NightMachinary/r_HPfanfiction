** I think it's a good start so far. It will be interesting to see how much of a FtM lifestyle Daphne has to lead as the story progresses. Even as capable as she has been so far, she may have trouble reviving Harry before puberty hits and makes it harder for her to pass as male.

*** Why thank you. Yeah, trust me, there will be a few... issues with Daphne playing male as time goes on. Particularly since pretty much everything I have seen portrays her as quite an... attractive girl as she grows up, which will be rather confusing for certain people. :D

**** I originally assumed she would at least talk to Dumbledore for assistance maintaining the charade. It doesn't seem like something an eleven year old could expect to actually pull off for very long at all.

***** It's quite possible that she will get some help at some point. ;)
