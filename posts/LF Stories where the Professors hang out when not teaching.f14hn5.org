I want to see more of what the teachers do when they're not teaching/grading peoples, and hang out with each other.

I can see Minerva, Severus and Filius hang out and complain with each other about the Weasley twins, about Umbridge, or about the Ministry or Dumbledore or whatever new Defence professor there is.

It can be a main part of the story or a minor part.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be from ANY Era. And it doesn't have to be just Minerva, Severus and Filius, it can be other Professors as well.

Can be on ANY Site

Would rather it be completed, but if not that's fine

Anyone can be the main character.

  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.

** Takes a while to get to the part where he's teaching, but you could skip ahead. Lots of fun teacher interactions, Snape and Flitwick play cribbage, Kettleburn runs a Quidditch betting ring, and McGonagall's pursed lips face means she's trying not to laugh, etc.

  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
