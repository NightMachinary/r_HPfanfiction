I'm looking for some new great reads. Anything goes but I have a soft spot for time travel, darker Harry, and interesting character usage like a smart pettigrew.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.

** If you want an actual dark Harry (and not just 'darker' as in this involves murder of like, a lot of people, most background character but a few 'main') i highly recommend lnkfnn(Nightmare Man)

I love the character development even just throughout the story itself (ntm, it has a prequel with even more), and the interactions throughout it. There's no smut, no relationship with Harry himself or any other character, actually. The entire story isn't dark, its got some good 'soft' points.

** Most of my favourite stories come from TheDivineComedian on Ao3. They have absolutely mastered that dark tone with interesting introspections. I was hooked on every single one of their fics.

linkao3(Styx) really stands out just for the drama and tense atmosphere all through the fic. It has smart Peter and it's just a big ol argument with Regulus and it's great ðŸ˜Š

  Regulus wishes -- sometimes, not too often -- that he were like Sirius, able to make things up on the spot. Sirius says he has never seen a single bloody thing in his tea leaves, or his cards, or his palms, in the milky depths of a crystal ball or the glistening entrails of a dead pigeon. He just enjoys telling stories. Regulus sees water. His tealeaves: Dregs of muddy water. His cards: The Queen of Cups, waiting by the waterfront. His crystal ball: Unmoving, opaque water. His sign: Cancer, one of the Water Trigon. His palms: Somehow, impossibly, water. So, yes. He really did deserve that P in Divination. - Or: Regulus thought he knew all the horrors of Grimmauld Place, but on this stifling hot summer night in 1976, the house seems hell-bent on terrorising him in new and interesting ways. It's all Sirius's fault, of course.

** Antithesis goes hard if you like wbwl (where the wb isnt bashed a ton and ends up being a decent person)

It's been a while since I read it, but I think it has smart pettigrew, it's a harry/luna but i dont remember there being smut (maybe one or two brief scenes, very much not the focus)

*** Currently reading Antithesis and can confirm it really is bloody brilliant ðŸ˜Š. Being in Adrian's head is so tragic and interesting. How he grows throughout the story and interacts with those around him, it's so easy to see why he ends up doing the things he does. I'm really loving it.

I don't know how it ends but I don't see any smut at all so far? Even between Harry/Luna, I just read them as friends. But I'm Aro so I totally could have just missed the flirting or implications... Either way, even without the smut the story still works fantastically and the characters and relationships are interesting to read.

** Current best no-smut fav!

Ace/Aro BAMF Narcissa having a father-daughter relationship with Voldemort. The fic has AU prem, standout characterizations, no bashing, a ton of angst which gets resolved slowly into a happy ending.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/29310402]])
