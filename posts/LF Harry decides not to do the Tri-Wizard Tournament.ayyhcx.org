I know in fanfictions there have been versions if Harry doesn't compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, he will lose his magic; or become weak or a Squib or whatever; but as far as I'm aware that's just fanfiction, I want a story where Harry is like no; no I'm not going to compete in a competition that I could die in and that I never even signed up for to begin with, that someone obviously set me up with.

It would just make sense for him just to say no; I'm not going to do it, and then he not do it at all. There'd still be conflict; the biggest being who put his name in the cauldron, but then the other would be that the fake Moody would be pretty much screwed, not seeing this as a possibility, and not knowing how to get Harry to the deformed and not yet fully himself Dark Lord.

That'd just be interesting to read, imo.

No super powerful Harry or super Smart Harry. Harry smarter or slightly more powerful then he was in canon is fine, but make it believable

No Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione

No Seer Luna

  "Haven't you wondered if there's more to the world then a backwards, prejudiced society?" When Harry asks Astoria Greengrass this question in a fit of temper after he's forced to compete in the tournament, he wasn't expecting her answer - or that he'd go along with her decision to run away with him and see the world. Can two different people find happiness? HarryxAstoria

  What if Harry's rebelliousness started a year earlier, because Dumbledore wouldn't let him go stay with Sirius in the summers? What would a rebellious teenager who was entered into the Triwizard Tournament do? H/G
