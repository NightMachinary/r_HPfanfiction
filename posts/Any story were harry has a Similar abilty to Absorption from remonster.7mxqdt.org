I don't think I have ever seen a story were harry can absorb different ability's from Magical artifacts, substances ,ect ?

Like maybe have him use accidental magic to copy the abilty from Gryffindors sword when he uses it to slay the basilisk by keeping the Sword in his hand instead of leaving it in the Basilisk mouth after he kills it and as he lays then Dieing from poison his magic while trying to save his life copy's the abilities of Gryffindors sword to keep him alive ?

like if he eats a magical watch he will always know the time, if he eats the marauders map he will understand how it was made and give him a mini/world map like abilty that maps out more of the world as he explores it, ect

Transforming a Marauders map into a new Familty abilty that could be passed down to any of harry's descendants would be pretty cool same with the Invisibility Cloak.

maybe have harry use polyjuice potion to absor abiltys from Fleur,tonks and Hagrid.(would someone that harry has Absored from polyjuice potion into harry gain his Absorption abilty?)


** This would instantly become an OP!Harry story, of course, but I don't mind as long as it's not some Dark!Kewl!Harry Manpiulative!Dumblesdoor nonsense.

But no, much as the concept intrigues me, I've never seen it used. The closest I can think of is linkffn(Barefoot) where Harry knows objects' history from touching them, but that's not quite right, is it?...

  Harry has the ability to learn the history of any object he touches, whether he wants to or not.

** Ages ago, I've read one where Harry absorbed the Philosopher's Stone, and then when he faced the basilisk's gaze his glasses glowed red (?) and he didn't die. That's all the details I remember unfortunately.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]], sort of. Harry can, later on, eat magic. At the same time, he's smart enough and can see magic well enough that he can memorize the effects of a potion and apply the effects to water, thus giving him the ability to replicate any potion he's analyzed with a non-toxic substance. He can do similar things with enchanted items and spells.

If anything, it's more like he has a magical sharingan than the absorption ability.

  Reincarnation is a tough thing to deal with, isn't it? Especially when the new body is at the bottom of the food chain. So, yes. This is Eff*ed up. So, very, thoroughly. But wait. There is a notification window? Is this- is this really a Eff*ing game?
