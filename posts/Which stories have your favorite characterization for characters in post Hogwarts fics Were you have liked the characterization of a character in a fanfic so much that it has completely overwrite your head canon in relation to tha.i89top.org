** There are many but two most obvious examples:

- Lavender Brown in [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian writings]] (obviously start with “Tales of Battle”, but her true storyline starts in “Hunters and Prey”)
- Percy and Audrey in linkffn(Escape by SingularOddities) and even more in linkffn(Mr and Mrs Percy Weasley by SingularOddities)

That's just how these characters now exist in my head, and there is nothing you can do to persuade me otherwise (so, I always complain in my head when reading other Audrey-related stories, where she is a witch, “this is just wrong, she is a Muggle!”; including otherwise perfect linkffn(Order of Mercy by MandyinKC)).
