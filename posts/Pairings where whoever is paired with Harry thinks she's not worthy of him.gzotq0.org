No Harmony and no bashing.


** The difficulty with this request is that it basically means Harry would have to take the initiative in his love life. Which implies pretty significant character divergence, in a rather odd way; he would have to be more emotionally confident and proactive, while also being willing to choose someone with serious self-esteem issues. Tricky.

Ginny has some residual shyness in linkffn(You Can go with Harry, and I'll just), but I wouldn't say she feels unworthy.

The closest match I can think of to the relationship dynamic you're looking for isn't Harry, it's Severus/Lily, eg in linkffn(The Peace Not Promised).

  What if Ginny hadn't already agreed to go to the Yule Ball with Neville?

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

  Harry is blackmailed into a marriage of convenience with Daphne Greengrass. Ten years later, Ginny forces her way back into his life when a murder occurs... AU, EWE, romance with a side dish of mystery.
