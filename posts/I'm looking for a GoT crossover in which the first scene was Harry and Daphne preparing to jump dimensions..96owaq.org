I'm not even sure if its good. I just have it in my head and can't find it in my bookmarks anymore.

As I said, the only thing I remember is that the first scene featured Harry and Daphne as they prepared some ritual (?) to jump dimensions (or something similar).

Any hint is appreciated.

  War is hell and the aftermath is even more so, Harry and allies have just come through a recent war and have to now deal with the consequences. In attempting to deal with the consequences Harry finds himself in a world of ice and fire, and now he has a whole new set of problems to face.

**** After reading it, I remember why I originally put it down after a few chapters.

Harry and consorts are all - 100% of them - absolute psychopaths. Quite frankly, it just gets boring to read about them killing.

Psychopaths are just not fun to read about, not to mention that they're so far removed from anything remotely reminding of their canon characters that it might as well be a different fandom.

**** A ton... A lot wizards, goblins, veela and centaurs.

Most of Harry's classmates + Hagrid.

It's... decent. Nothing to write home about. Though, considering that most HP/GOT/ASOIAF x-overs are shit, this one is I suppose a stand-out.

***** Definitely not my cup of tea then. Just Harry and Hermione would be enough to take over the world of GMMR, I don't even want to imagine how easy it would be to do so with that cast (and how many idiot balls are used to not make it a stomp).

****** They try to mitigate it by having the Priests of Rhlorr be super powerful and by making the wizards not use their powers (Imperio, Confundus etc.) that often for bullshit reasons.

******* You don't need offensive magic to stomp Westeros. All you need is Hermione, someone with a lot of magical power (like Harry) and the favour of a minor lord. Hermione, using her magic, could easily jumpstart an industrial revolution and someone like Harry could use his "muscle" for menial tasks. Multiplying steel plates, gun barrels or shells, applying vanishing charms to improve pumps, reinforcing machinery and so on.

You could probably field a 20th-century army within a month, armed with everything from rifles and grenades up to field artillery. Transfiguration is a bitch if you think about it and it does not randomly expire in canon.

******** ehhhh... I won't go into a discussion like that, since HP canon doesn't supply that much material on the things you're saying.

I was just explaining why the author of Road to Hell tries to not have the wizards take over Westeros in a few months.
