The owls were flying in daylight, I want to know where they were flying, who written them and to whom.\\
I am searching for fics that shows the morning of November 1, how the news spilled outhow the news was received by the Light, the Dark and the Neutrals, how a seemingly powerful organization like Death Eaters with deeply entrenched roots cut down like that, any reactions from foreign governments.


** linkffn(That Halloween) a loosely canon-compliant fic about exactly this.

I'm sure there are loads of fics with this title so: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8062547/1/That-Halloween]]
