I haven't looked through the sea of godlike harem filth in a while and have no desire to start. Anyone who has have recommendations? Or self-promotions? Anything is welcome except Snarry, Severmione or Drarry.


** I thought linkffn(Heroes Assemble by Stargon1) was in that time frame, but apparently it's just over a year old. Is it new enough for you to have not seen it? I am enjoying it so far!

Question: was "Godlike harem filth" an aspect you were looking for or avoiding?

*** Definitely more avoiding than looking for. Feels like half the stuff on the site is poorly written and plotted fixit-may-as-well-be-a-self-insert bullshit and it irritates the hell out of me. If it's well-written I'll read it but it almost never is.

#+begin_quote
  After five years travelling the world, Harry Potter has landed in New York. He figures that there's no better place than the city that never sleeps to settle in and forge a new life. If only the heroes, villains, aliens and spies had received the message. Begins just before the Avengers movie and continues through the MCU. Expect a long story with some extra faces along the way.

  There was no way Lily Potter would let her son anywhere near her sister, so she told Dumbledore about her cousin in America. After Halloween 1981, the Fentons gain another son. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter or Danny Phantom and related media.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.
