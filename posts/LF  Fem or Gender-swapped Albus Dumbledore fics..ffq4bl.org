I have seen hundreds of fem Harry fics, about five fem Voldemort fics, two fem Ron fics and twenty male Hermione fics. Is there any fic in which Albus Dumbledore is gender swapped?


** I have a fem!Albus in Keystone Council, though she is only one out of the five Dumbledores in that story (it's a multiverse fic). Headmistress Ariana Kendra Wulfric Brianna Dumbledore. Despite the name, she is very much a female Albus.

We haven't spent much time with her, but there have been a few moments that I enjoyed writing. To find the Chamber of Secrets, for example, she invited Myrtle to her office for a good cry, after which Myrtle referred to her as "Gran". Having a female Albus also lets me okay with family - like when her granddaughter replaces Lockhart halfway through Year Two.

It's just a small part of this fic - but I absolutely agree, I'd love to see more of Fem!Albus.
