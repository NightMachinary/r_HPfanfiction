** "Avada-"

*WHOOOOOOONK!!*

Voldemort's mouth slowly closed, and he slowly turned his head to the left; there, looking as pristine as the day it was made despite having been driving around feral in the Forbidden Forest for who knows how long.

Harry stared, the Death Eaters stared, even Hagrid stopped struggling and stared, as a chauffeur in a smart black uniform stepped out of the driver's seat of the sparkling car and marched up to the Dark Lord, giving a little salute as he spoke, "Sir, your 10 o'clock appointment at Snowshine Cosmetics is waiting."

Voldemort spluttered, "What?! That was today?!" The chauffeur simply nodded.

Voldemort sighed, "Dammit...raincheck, Potter."

As Voldemort hopped into the car, which revved up before speeding out of the clearing, Harry just looked at the Death Eaters, slack-jawed.

"...What the heck just happened? Why is Voldemort in...a cosmetics company? I mean, a /cosmetics/ company...his face..." he spluttered.

Bellatrix just rolled her eyes, "Get with the times, Potter. Lucius over here," she indicated the blonde man, "ran out of funds for the Dark Lord's campaign months ago. Since then to make ends meet we've been running sponsorships and protection rackets for various companies...before you ask, yes, cosmetics. Charms can do a lot for the before-and-after advertising."

There was an awkward pause, before one of the masked anonymous Death Eaters shrugged and pulled out a deck of cards, "Solitaire, anyone?"

  Mr. Weasley's car raced down the corridor, slamming into one Death Eater after another. Dolohov, who had been pointing his wand down at Dean Thomas, the tip of it a glowing green, suddenly had his legs shattered by the raging automobile.

  Harry stared. "And they say I have a saving people thing."

** "Avada-"

*CHOO-WHOOOOOOO!*

Voldemort fell silent. Harry fell silent. Hagrid fell silent. The Death Eaters all fell silent. The dementors were silent anyway. Even the wind stopped.

Voldemort turned in the direction of the unexpected noise, and in an instant realised two things.

One, there was a bright light between the trees, growing brighter and larger as though it were coming towards him very quickly.

Two, the ground the Dark Lord was standing on had inexplicably turned into some kind of train rails.

** WHAM!

The engine of the Hogwarts Express suddenly plowed into Voldemort, splattering him into a million pieces.

Letting out an outraged cry, all the Death Eaters in the clearing raised their wands as the dementors swooped forwards, but then the carriage behind the train's engine opened up. And there, in the carriage, were rows upon rows of massive cannons.
