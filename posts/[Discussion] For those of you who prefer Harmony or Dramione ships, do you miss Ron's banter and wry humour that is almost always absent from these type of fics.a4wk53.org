I recently finished reading the Stygian trilogy, three well-written next-gen fics, and obviously, it had a small dose of Ron and his witty but good-natured quips. I realized that, having not re-read the OG series in a long, long time and having over-indulged a bit on Dramione/Harmony fics (which, let's be honest, are never really fair to Ron's character) in the intervening years, I had totally forgotten what an endearingly hilarious guy Ron was to have around. I wasn't a fan of the Ron-Hermione ending that JKR gave us and consequently (and predictably), reading too much of one kind of fan-fiction warped my mind against the character. But, reading this trilogy reminded me that if anybody could be the life and soul of any gathering, it was Ron. Not Harry or Hermione, who weren't exactly funny enough to begin with. Canon Ginny was witty as hell but as far as fanfiction is concerned, she seemed to have suddenly lost that ability after ending up with Harry. Fred and George were definitely the masters of this art, but we never really get too much of them, do we?


** Nah. There are fics where Hermione ends up Harry or Draco that don't bash or hate on Ron. Most of the fics I've read Ron's still there, and he still makes funny jokes or makes witty remarks or something. And he doesn't just disappear, he usually ends up with Luna or something in these fics.

*** The absolute worst thing is that so incredibly often some character will eventually just tell Ron something along the lines of "You wouldn't be such a bad bloke if only you could just accept that everyone around you is much better than you and completely out of your league" and the story treats them as justified for saying this, even pretends as if this was some nice way to reach out to Ron and that he is the evil one for lashing out in return.

Just WTF, do you have any idea how Ron as a character works?

That line just makes me want to punch whoever said that in the face. I don't even care what Ron did in before to "deserve" that, it's just such an incredibly cruel thing to say to someone who has already has an inferiority complex in regards to his friends and should not be considered "okay" in any kind of situation.

I don't see the need to remove Ron - plenty of nice people don't get together. I usually simply have them not get together in the first place in my H/Hr stories. It's not as if they have to follow the steps of canon.

**** Fair warning in case you missed it: my fic is not yet complete! Wouldn't want you to dive in just to be disappointed when it ends.

My current fic is a post-war back-to-Hogwarts. It's fairly canon-compliant. Harry and Ron are doing Auror training instead of going back to school like Hermione did.

I wrote Ron as being consumed by grief for Fred, causing him to not be there for her when Hermione needed him (going to Australia to revive her parents' memories while in the midst of grieving was probably not easy). He is completely focused on his Auror training to distract himself, and by the time he is himself again, Hermione found comfort elsewhere. I could see that happening. It would be understandable.

I am rather easy-going and I am still friends with my ex-boyfriends since we broke up. Sometimes people grow apart or relationships don't work out, and that sucks but it happens. That would be a plausible reason for them to not be together anymore, too.

I've also seen fics where Ron and Lavender's relationship matures and they stay together, and Hermione then moves on.

There are plenty of reasons to not have a dramatic break-up that creates a villain. It's doable.

Bashing is the easy way out, and in my opinion it's just bad and lazy writing.

If you want to go with canon events, give them a short romance which quickly fizzles out because they have very little other than Harry and fighting magical fascism in common. And I mean "we fucked for a weekend and then had absolutely nothing to talk about" short, not several months.

You could kill Ron off (poisoned trident in the second task, DoM Battle, poisoned mead, Hogwarts raid, Battle of Hogwarts) if you can't fit him in, but I would personally advise against that because then you have to deal with the fallout of his death.

My personal favourite is to simply pair him off with a girlfriend who keeps him occupied for most of the time. I mean, most men (myself included) would prefer to spend time with a new girlfriend over friends, at least for the first few months of a relationship (Ron did that in canon as well). So all you really have to do is make Lavender a little more forward and less cringe-worthy and Ron won't notice anything but the way his GF's tits bounce whenever she is on top (of a staircase).

It's just that I had the feeling that Tonks or the twins or Ginny would have more of the snarky, sarcastic kind of humour whereas Ron would be more of a genial, dad-joke material guy, somewhat like his dad. This particular trilogy reminded me of it because it has a scene where Ron teases Scorpius in a friendly, light-hearted way for ending up with Rose while the others are mercilessly ragging on him (although, not in an antagonistic way)

Anyway, what I feel can't change what canon says and so, thanks for pointing that out.

** No, the less Ron the better.

Most authors aren't very witty and thus their incarnation of Ron won't be funny or witty either. They are better off just writing Ron as a best bro kind of character.

Of course talented authors for comedy exist (nonjon, Rorschachs Blot, cloneserpents), but they don't exclusively need Ron for that, as they can make anything and anyone funny. Ron doesn't add anything unique for me, besides his annoying presence... so at best I'd think: "This story could use some humor" instead of "This story needs some Ron".

I dislike the thought that you need to have Ron if you want lighthearted humor or banter in a story.

You misunderstand me. I'm not treating him as some sort of a clown. My point is that Ron does have a precedent of making some good jokes in canon. And this trait is generally missing in the ships I mention - either because he is transformed into a negative character or because he basically disappears for the length of the story.

Even in the trilogy I mentioned, he is more or less relegated to be a background character, but in a short scene in the last part, his good-natured humour shined through. He reminded me of why I liked Arthur Weasley so much and IMHO, none of his sons (even in canon) have that goofy, dad-joke creator vibe that he had - except probably Ron.

I have a similar problem with how Ginny's prodigious wit generally tends to disappear in fanfics, but it probably boils down to me not having read the right fics or like you mentioned, authors not being witty themselves. After all not everybody can be JKR.

** No. I don't really care about Ron one way or another because I find his themes and arc utterly boring. As a single child, the whole "big family" thing with countless brothers is simply unrelatable. And while I am by no means unfamiliar with jealousy and envy, directing it at friends like Ron does is a big no-no in my book. I have friends who are better looking, make way more money, drive fast cars and drown in girls, and yet I am simply happy that at least one of us has his shit sorted out.

And speaking from a writer's perspective, it is not difficult to simply use another character to fill that role. Tonks, Fleur or even a random background char like Katie Bell are well suited for that. Of course, I wouldn't exactly say that any of my stories fit the "average fic for pairing X" mould, but where would be the fun in writing that?

There are some unwritten ones, most of which are dictated by the pairing. You can go against them, but your primary audience will not be amused. For example:

- As soon as the possibility of a second/third/fourth/... wife is mentioned, people expect Harry to take up that loophole instead of being content with the one he has (or even just one girlfriend).

- Harry/Ginny has to stick to the canon spirit and overall themes (eg Malfoy is forgiven his war crimes due to magical fairy dust, Ron and Hermione end up together, Harry is fully assimilated into the Weasley family)

- Any Tonks/Fleur/Daphne pairing is expected to overly sexualise the character while at the same time depicting them as chaste with people other than Harry. Speaking from personal experience here, if your Tonks has an "adventurous" past, you'll get reviews where she is called "slut" or similar terms.

- As soon as Harry and politics are mentioned in the same sentence, the fanon "political" plot is expected, even if it makes no sense.

- The Bellamione community thrives for the unhealthiness of that relationship and they are not interested in stories which take that away.

- Any story with Susan Bones is expected to go with some DMLE plot and basically reduce her to a plot device to get to her aunt. Her parents aren't even dead in canon (we simply know nothing about them).

***** Okay, let me pose this question that has been on my mind since I started reading these next-gen fics - is the Scorpius-Rose ship basically a convenient way out for people who love Dramione fics, but can't get over Draco's transgressions and how he often seems to be let off lightly in fics?

He doesn't just SEEM to be let off lightly, he is let off lightly. For his violations of article 23 of the Geneva convention on land warfare (subsections a,b and f), even the Allies would have summerly executed him with no second thoughts (or a full trial). And that isn't taking into account any regular crimes like treason or attempted murder.

As you might have guessed from this, I am not touching any fic with (any) Malfoy as a protagonist (unless hypothetically, it has him tried for war crimes). And consequently, I have no interest in Next-Gen because it is a severe miscarriage of justice, even canon (other than perhaps some Teddy/Hermione or Victorie/Harry time travel shenanigans).

That being said, there is absolutely no canon on either Rose or Scorpius other than their family backgrounds. The author has a blank canvas and can create anything they want (preferably with an official name change as the first act). Therefore you can't really make such blanket statements since there is no canon structure you usually build a plot on.

Personally, I'd love to read a story where Malfoy's son tries to get him and every other Death Eater thrown away for life while people who +have shit for brains in the epilouge+ chose to path of forgiveness (the trio) try to oppose them. Imagine the irony if Rose founded SPEL (Society for the Promotion of the Enforcement of the Law), trying to counteract her mother who is overseeing things as Minister.

I seem to be having Déjà vu because I remember having a discussion with you on this very topic a long time back under a post about something else. Anyhow, the argument that I raised was that members of the Hitlerjugend were involved in some serious war crimes during the war, and yet nobody from the organization was ever convicted at the Nürnberg trials, with the exception of adult leaders like Baldur von Schirach. Although, technically Draco would rather fit the bill of a Wehrmacht soldier, there was a good chance of him being tried as underage, with most of his crimes committed while he was still a student at Hogwarts. And with Harry's benign attitude towards the Malfoys following Narcissa's deed, and legal maneuvers of treating Draco as being coerced, there's a chance that he could escape Azkaban/death. On top of that, you have canon, which indicates that he did escape a life-term.

Keep in mind I'm saying what *could* happen, not what *should* have happened.

#+end_quote

Irrelevant, since Murder and attempted murder are treated with the regular law in the UK. The Geneva convention has no minimum age either. It was established after the second world war that carrying out an illegal order (like Malfoys "help us attack a school full of children") was still a war crime. And coercion is not a valid defence for any crimes against life or involving a criminal organisation (such as the Death Eaters).

Twist it how you want, by the law Malfoy deserved at the very least several lifetimes in prison. He might end up with twenty years after a plea-bargain and testifying against other Death Eaters, but even that makes any Malfoy in Next-Gen stories impossible. Or he might just be hanged/kissed.

Also, 23 a/b is about the ban on poisoned weapons and treachery while 23f is about the need to wear a proper uniform/insignia, otherwise one is an illegal combatant and subject to summary execution. The German soldiers caught red-handed violating 23f were quickly shot after their capture and 23f was pretty commonly used to legally deal with any resistance fighter during both World wars.

I don't find him integral at all; Hermione would have come into Harry's compartment whether Ron was there or not, and Harry might have eventually bonded with her as they were both outcast or loners. About the only thing missing without Ron is any reason for Hermione to be assaulted by a mountain troll; or otherwise cry from being bullied by him.

The thought how Harry would handle school life without a friend falling right into his lap is pretty interesting to me. He's ... not great at making friends.

****** I like to imagine Harry or Neville being the only "nice" boys in Gryffindor in their year, and the girls being just as horrible as the Muggles were to her; so she shyly gets her courage up and approaches one or the other... practically glomping them at the first opportunity to help.

I imagine at the latest, Harry in the Library trying to figure out who Nicholas Flamel is and Hermione see's her chance.
