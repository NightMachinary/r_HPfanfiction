***** Honestly, that gap is the bane of any time-travel fic in which I want to have Harry travel back to the moment he got the scar. And the 'fell asleep over Bristol' on a journey to Surrey from... pretty much anywhere is odd too. Possibly he stopped over in Devon and Molly Weasley looked after Harry for a bit, which sort of makes the journey and the time make sense (and will now be my go-to solution for that gap). Harry definitely didn't go to Hogwarts infirmary unless something weird was going on.

***** I don't know if telling Hagrid about the Stone did anything for Quirrel and the Wonder Turban. They were already after the Stone, knew that Dumbledore was friends with Flamel, and that the Stone had just been moved from Gringotts; so when Dumbledore said (all on his own) that something very special was hidden in the Third Floor Corridor, there was little more Hagrid could have said to convince Voldemort to go a'looking.

Either way, on this issue, I fail to see /why/ Dumbledore would want people to know about the Lightning Scar. Blood protection aside, part of the point of keeping Harry with the Dursleys (as stated by Dumbledore himself) is to make sure Harry isn't recognized and swarmed throughout his childhood either by overenthusiastic fans, or by resentful Voldemort sympathizers. Informing the whole world of Harry's distinguishing feature seems counterproductive to keeping him hidden.

*** So....

I had always understood that those "random people" were actually Order of the Phoenix members or people Dumbledore trusted to "keep an eye" on young Harry at times. It would make sense that since its just blood wards, and there are still Death Eaters out and about, that Harry would have had "watchers" most of his life. Plus it would be odd for random Wizards to show up in his muggle life knowing who he is already, scar or otherwise.

This is part of why I have always been suspicious of Dumbledore not being more aware of what went on at Privet Drive between the Dursleys and Harry.

As far as I remember, nobody in the wizarding world knew in what area the Dursleys live. Wizards/Witches had to know about the scar beforehand, so they could identify him.

Was it common knowledge back then that he lived with his muggle relatives ?

Now that I think about it, I am not sure of the term "cursed scar" or something similar was brought up. But I still think, since Dumbledore admitted he cannot remove it, Hagrid thinks it has to be something magically powerful.

******* But how was he identified ?

The last time he was seen, he was younger than 15 months and not a lot of people have seen him, since the Potters had to go into hiding after he was born.

So the only people that did see him, had to be order members or close friends. He couldn't have met many of those in my opinion.

The only one, who we know about he met was Diggle, who recognized him immediatly and I do not think he saw baby Harry very often. So it had to be the scar.

It is pretty hard to identify a child based on how he looked as a baby/toddler, especially if you don't know said child might be standing in front of you.

******** He was dropped off that same day though, or that night(1st)....though looking back there is no text evidence saying that Hagrid took Harry anywhere else at all, and actually it sounds as if he drove to the Dursleys straight-away which timeline-wise doesn't make much sense. Saying that Harry fell asleep while they were flying over Bristol, and that he got Harry out of the house right before the Muggles started swarming the house. He's talking to Dumbledore as if Dumbledore had not yet seen Harry nor been updated on him.

So I think it's more a canon mistake of timing on Rowlings part than Harry actually having gone /anywhere/ first. Or Hagrid took a very indirect route...

********* Like I said on this thread already, it wasn't the same night because McGonagal spent a whole day watching the Dursleys because she KNEW that Harry was going to be living there, and she complained about stupid wizards breaking the SoS by celebrating the end of the war, meaning, it was the following day. I agree with you about the fact that it seems as if Hagrid flown directly, but that simply isn't possible, because it doesn't take a day to cross that distance, not to mention that a baby needs to eat and would've pooped a lot during that day. So it makes sense for Dumbledore to send Hagrid to Pomfrey, for her to take care of him (she's a nurse/healer after all) while Dumbledore creates his god-be-damned bloodwards without Minerva even knowing. Like I said in other comments... This series has so many plot holes that it isn't even funny.

*********** But then how were people celebrating Voldemort's downfall? Why were they talking about 'this blessed day' and bothering Vernon Dursley the day /before/ Harry arrived, if he went straight there?

************ Maybe since it was during the school year some students found out that Hagrid was going to go to the potters due to Voldemorts fall and spread the news so parents learned of it that way. Also harry arrived the day Vernon was being bothered and it could've been it took hagrid a little while to go to Godric's hallow from Hogwarts due to probably having to take a while by muggle ways such as trains and so on.

Edit: And Snape was there so he could've spread the news as well.

************* Hagrid had the flying motorcycle he borrowed from Sirius.

And even with the students knowing, there was still an attack at night, then celebrations during the day, /then/ Harry is put on the doorstep at night. There's still a day that needs to happen, between Hagrid getting Harry, and Harry being dropped off. Both happen at night, and stuff happens between those things, during the day.

************** Hagrid got the bike from Sirius when he was leaving Godric's Hallow. I meant he had to take muggle ways to get there in the first place. And Hagrid could've been sent around the next day which could've ben about 3 - 4 hours after it happened depending on when Voldemort broke in. So Snape could've spread that Voldemort fell or students who knew Hagrid was leaving could've spread it that Voldemort died. So there was enough time for them to celebrate in the day and another thing is that since it was later in the year it didn't have to be that early in the day for it to be night out so it could've been 5 o, clock when Harry got left.

** The people we know saw him between him receiving the scar and reentering magical society:

- Dumbledore
- McGonagall
- Hagrid

Snape, Riddle, and Sirius Black are also candidates for having seen the scar.

Hagrid has difficulties keeping secrets, and he had custody of Harry for some amount of time off-screen (possibly as much as a day, since there's about 24 hours between Voldemort's downfall and Harry arriving at the Dursleys). Riddle wasn't in any condition to spread rumors. Snape isn't the sort to indulge in rumor-mongering. Black was seeking revenge too assiduously to spend time telling people about a scar. McGonagall might have told as part of the Hogwarts gossip scene. Dumbledore could have spread the information to build up hype about Harry, but he said he wanted to give Harry a normal childhood, so it would be kind of weird.

There's a tongue-in-cheek fan theory that Hagrid spent that time visiting every magical pub from John o' Groats to Falmouth with Harry in tow. My personal take on it is that Hagrid just wanted a pint, but as soon as he entered a pub and mentioned what happened, everyone was so busy celebrating and making a big deal of Harry that they forgot to get Hagrid his drink. So naturally he went to the next pub over, but he didn't manage to get a drink until after he dropped off Harry.

Even if he wanted Harry have a normal childhood (which i believe to be a blatant lie), how would hype in the wizarding world affect Harry at all? He's living completely isolated and ignorant.

**** The "live a normal childhood" excuse is also why he takes so long to tell Harry about the prophecy, waiting until his hand is forced in mid-1996.

** Hagrid likely mentioned it in a pub while hammered one night, and an urban legend was born.

** I agree that Hagrid likely let slip some information since he's known for that problem.

However, isn't it also implied that Dumbledore intentionally let slip some information on Harry Potter to set him up as a hero and boost the Wizarding worlds morale? Wasn't Dumbledore the one who "told" the world what had happened at the Potters, even without knowing for sure what went down?

** Probably Dumbledore I imagine....I also imagine there were newspaper articles up the ying-yang reporting what went down. People would want to know.

I'm sure Hagrid spoke of it as well, because why would they keep it a secret? It's the only scratch on Harry for defeating the Dark Lord...what a celebratory headline that would be.

** Going by unconfirmed movie facts, could be Snape; per the movies he /did/ visit the wreckage of the Potter Cottage. If he spotted the curse scar (doubtless recognizing it for what it was; the man's a Dark Arts expert), it would be /extremely/ in-character for him to blab about it to everyone, precisely so James's son would be hounded wherever he went.

*** Interesting theory, more unique than what've I seen so far. IDK, the canon has so many plot holes that it isn't even funny.

*** It's an interesting theory. Tho if true than it's mostly his fault Harry is that famous. After all, if there is no other source of info on the initial gossip, it means that Snape was the one to say that Harry vanquished Moldyshorts. And then years later he complains about his popularity. OH the irony XD For all they knew Voldy and Lily could have simultaneously defeated one another.

That said, I'm not sure Snape would have so easily identified the scar. After all the AK is supposed to leave no marks, even if he had detected some dark magic from the soul fragment I'm not so sure he would have quickly found out the whats and hows. Especially since at the time he was just a few years out of Hogwarts. I doubt he was that well versed at the time...
