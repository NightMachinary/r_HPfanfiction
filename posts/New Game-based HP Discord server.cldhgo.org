Hello! We just opened a new Harry Potter themed Discord server! It is a game-based server (board games, logic games, etc...if you want to play a game, we'll play it!) where the point/scoreboard system is set up around the four Hogwarts Houses. Of course, the name of the end game is to win the House Cup! There is no role-play involved although you are free to change your nickname to a more wizardly name if you so choose. You will be able to sort yourself into a House which will have its own Common Room text channel and video chat. It will only be accessible to members of that House, and similarly, you will not be able to access the Common Room text/chat of other Houses.

All games will be "played" on the Quidditch Pitch. It is set up so that anyone interested in representing their House in their game will notify their Prefect. Representing players will be able to play the chosen game on the Quidditch Pitch text/chat in which any member of the server will be able to observe but not interfere. The game will be overseen by the Game Master. Observers will be able to converse in a separate channel to cheer, boo, indulge in a bit of good-hearted roasting, or even discuss potential answers while following along. You can gain points for your House mostly through the Quidditch Pitch, and can lose points for cheating or obviously impermissible behavior.

There is no application! If you like Harry Potter and games, this will be the server for you. There aren't many rules and the vibe is fairly chill. We welcome any level of Harry Potter or game enthusiast. You can spend as much time as you would like to invest into the server without feeling left out. The invite to the server is here: [[https://discord.gg/GeHQK5B]] . Send me a message if you aren't able to access!


** That sounds really neat!

**** I can't even focus on restarting my own RP subreddit right now XD But perhaps, one day, when things are more at ease in my life ^ _ ^
