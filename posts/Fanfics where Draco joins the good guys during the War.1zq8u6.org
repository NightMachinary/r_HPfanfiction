I'm really craving some bad-turned-good!Draco...if it has Dramione, it's a bonus, but not a requirement.

Does anyone know good fics?

** Harry Potter and the other Path is great: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=224105]]

Been a while since I've read it but it's one of my favorite AUs with a OOC Harry. Everyone else is close enough to their canon personalities that the differences can be explained through their interactions with Harry and the changes he makes. There are two OC that play a major role later but they're at least tolerable. It has some funny moments, very good action and plot twists and good character development. Features very good characterizations of Anti Voldemort Snape + Draco. Hardly any romance though.

** I wouldn't call it good, necessarily, (it's pretty angsty-emo and has its share of bashing), but there's a about a million words (complete) in Bobmin's [[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/Sunset_Over_Britain/index/][Sunset/Sunrise over Britain]]. It's Draco/Luna with Draco joining Harry's side.

A better story with Draco on the good side is Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4985330/1/The-Other-Boy-Who-Lived][The Other Boy Who Lived]]. 250k words, complete. (There used to be a WIP sequel, but it's been removed, apparently.)

  AU. On that night, Neville Longbottom was the child that You-Know-Who marked as his equal. Surprisingly, Longbottom lived through He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's Killing curse. Fourteen years later, the Boy-Who-Lived and Harry confront their destinies.

** Probably really late to offer a suggestion but I am currently reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8982722/1/Cruel-and-Beautiful-World][Cruel and Beautiful Workd]] and it is really well written.

Dramione included!
