SIYE.co.uk is a Harry/Ginny fanfiction archive that has been around since 2003. Apart from DLP and one or two other sites, this is pretty much the only actual, functioning, fanfic site that has stayed consistently at the top from the early days of the HP fandom.

So why is this? It is dedicated to one ship and one ship only - unlike DLP or even Portkey to a certain extent. Even Checkmated - which was a Ron/Hermione archive - shut up shop back in 2014.

So, to those who have been using SIYE longer than I have - since 2014 - why is it still doing well even thirteen years later?


** I modded SIYE for a few years. You'd be surprised how many hits and registered users there are. People like their canon pairing.

** I've published there (I won a couple contests back in the day) and used to be a more active member of their community.

I think they have stuck around for a variety of reasons:

- Active writers. There's always something new, of decent quality to read there. Since they do a QC check before publication, most of what's there is better than the average one finds on ao3 or ffnet.

- Engaged mods. Unlike, say, phoenixsong or portkey, a user can write a story and within a matter of a few days be green-lighted (or not). In contrast, the last time I offered a submission to portkey, I had to wait over a month for a tepid reply/rejection. Phoenixsong and fanficauthors.net are ghost towns with no perceptible mod engagement.

- Interesting contests. They have bimonthly contests with intriguing premises. Yeah, some are overly cutesy, but often they provide just enough structure to make them worthwhile. This has allowed them over the years to explore most every crevice of the fandom (modulo the H/G ship).

- It's the canon pairing. The "suspension of disbelief" barrier for entry into the fandom is lower than with some of the more obscure pairings. This makes it a safe harbor for folks starting out in the fandom. And many never leave the ship.

The site does have its flaws, granted (I find some of their rules overly constraining), but they do enough things right that they've been able to keep going and keep a community together after all these years.

Edit: fixed a couple commas

** Because there's a dedicated fan base for H/G stories?

** Because people still like H/G the most, despite JKR short changing Ginny in her last book.

** I like to think one of the reasons it is still popular (and the ship is popular) is that the fandom overall liked the pairing but felt a lot of the best stories for Harry/Ginny would come after the battle.

** I have never heard of SIYE... DLP and Portkey, I found those sites quite easily. Then again, I am not interested in H/G stories (I generally am not interested in fluff and pure romance fics), so that might be it. Why is it still doing well? Except for those, that are strong minded, people will almost always accept canon pairings. Since Harry's love life isn't really well explained, there aren't many arguments against this canon ship. Another point is, H/G is one of those - I call them - wishful pairings. The daughter of a poor family marries a popular rich guy, they are madly in love and have three children. How often does is happen in RL though, but it gives young people hope that everything is possible.

**** I actually prefer Gen fics. In my opinion, the aspect of love was not described well enough to result in a pairing at the end. So no, I don't ship any HP characters except for Lily/James, and that's just because they are Harry's parents. We don't have much info on their relationship either. EDIT: Strong minded is probably the wrong phrase, english is not my native language. But yeah, I know the facts about canon Ginny, hell I read the books just last week again. And I can't support a ship, that hasn't been developed properly, and "just happened" in the epilogue.

***** Yeah, Ginny still sort of worships Harry which considering his hate of fangirls always made the pairing seem odd to me too.

****** Maybe because Ginny was no longer fangirling around Harry once she got to know him and became his friend?

Just a thought.
