Remember, I'm not saying that it SHOULD be rewritten.

What if JK Rowling gave the series to another author (or team of authors)? How would feel about extensive changes to the series replacing canon, a la new timeline? For example, a change to the rebooted series could be greater house nuances. What if there were more significant changes like, e.g. character genders, new characters etc.?


** I think the general consensus would be that it should not from the wider fandom. Sure, there are alot of fix-it and re-do fics out there, but the fact that there are provides support to the general popularity of the overall story, even if others disagree on what they wish was different.

To give my personal reason, I think its worth pointing out that the seven books as a whole were written by a single author with a vision for her world. Not to say that the world is entirely consistent (in fact its often not and hence the immense issues people still poke at), but rather that what JKR wanted was what was on the pages. Her message, her morals, her ideals formed the backbone of the world as she wrote to reach a cohesive ending.

The triumph of good over evil. The virtue of innocence. The disdain of classicism.

Her work is as much a work of fiction as it is her take on our world. And this is why so many fics feel wrong to readers, and why many people long for writing that "feels like" canon writing. Its not just the Wizarding World and its peoples; it was Rowling's voice. And rebooting the series by another author, or worse by committee, would inherently give voice to different ideals.

Not to mention its rather foolish to re-do the series when at their core, stripping away the magic and HP stuff, the seven books are each boarding school mystery novels. If you already know the mystery, it sort of sucks the life from the story.

** I feel like the cons would outweigh the pros in my mind, so I can't say I'd like a reboot (at least not one that is considered canon

** I mean the Alexandra quick stories only share the Harry Potter type magic in them so that could sort of be something. But that's the only way I could see the HP world be rewritten. Not focusing on Harry and co. Like a previous person said, a mystery where you know the ending isn't as good. I doubt anyone here will ever be able to read HP or any book and enjoy it as much as the first time because not knowing what's gonna happen makes the story better.

** Fine if quality writing, and without the insane things JKR has 'added' after publishing.

** Maybe a story in the same universe, but set in early 2020s. Not Cursed Child. An entirely different plot, an entirely different enemy, maybe threat of muggles discovering the magicals due to technological advances. Witch hunting beginning again. Muggleborns stuck in the middle. A hero rises, either an intelligent muggleborn technomage (child of Elon Musk or something) who does powerful magic to hide the magical world again, or a muggleborn who is able to convince both sides to coexist.

** I wouldn't mind. It can't be done now, but 20 years from now it would be nice to have a rebooted series. The movies definitely should get a reboot closer to the original (Snape possibly being the exception).
