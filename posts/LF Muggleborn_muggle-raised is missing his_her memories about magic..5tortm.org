I reread a bit of The Perils of Innocence, and I got wondering, what if you /did/ have the scenario where a muggleborn's memories of accidental magic were removed, but they still had diary entries, missing time, more accidental magic in the future, and in extreme cases camera footage of magic happening?

What happens when you have someone older than 11, who strange things are happening around, and they can't quite figure out what's going on?

  Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.

  The Light side won the battle but lost the war. By Ministry decree, all Mudbloods have been Obliviated and "repatriated" to the Muggle world. When Draco Malfoy seeks out Hermione Granger, he wants only one thing . . . but gets far more. HG/DM, KB/MF, CC/TN.

*** Saw the first chapter or two. Please tell me that Hermione pulls off something cool like storing her memories in a Pensieve, setting things up to get them restored once the Ministry is no longer watching, to begin a campaign of terror against the "former" Death Eaters who can no longer defend themselves due to their oaths. Please?
