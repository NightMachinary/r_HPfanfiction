** If you're into HP and the Slince of Pritherin, you can check the discord for updates.

The author just posted a snippet to his blog this morning.

Think you can find the invite URL on his bio.

Ah, there's also one on his rules page. Here you go: [[https://discord.me/thesinisterman]]

** Have you ever read the Alexandra Quick series? It is quite a step away from the OC of the HP universe and the extended FF universe, so it reads like an /extremely/ unique story. I hate to cheerlead so much for it, but the author has been doing bi weekly updates of the 5th book in the series for the last few months as he totally finishes one book before releasing a single chapter, so you never are left on a cliff hanger.

**** A few words of of warning (no spoilers though): there are basically no Mary Sues. Don't expect one. The protagonist will have so many flaws that you might think something is wrong with the story. There isn't. This is a deliberate choice by the author. Don't expect too many parallels between HP and AQ either, despite similar sounding backstories and point of story departure. They are there (as any good fanfic will have) but the story in no way relies on those parallels. Finally, the cast of characters is totally OC, so don't wait up for Hermione Granger or Scorpio Malfoy to make some kind of grand cameo, it won't be happening. This is fan fiction in that the universe is mostly the same and is about a child beginning their schooling and introduction to magic around 10-11 years old.

***** Alex can be FUCKING annoying. I read it a few years ago and I don't remember much, but I do remember wanting to bash my head against the wall because she just made the same mistakes over and over again.

Great story, if you're able to enjoy a story without necessarily liking the protagonist.

That said, it's good to know the 5th book is out. Means I'll have to start rereading the series.

****** She's like a fungus, she grows on you. and she is literally like the way she is because she is the human personification of a higher power on earth, so yeah...she will consistently make errors, but is also consistently striving towards the greater good, even if she ends up having to take a bit of a bumpy road to get there.

** Harry Potter et al and the Keystone Council sort of fits the bill imo. It updates slowly as well though.

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.

** Hello,

I would recommend the following two: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13439553/1/That-Was-Part-of-the-Plan][That Was Part of the Plan]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/10948791/LysandraLeigh][LysandraLeigh]] + follow on. This has a lot of world building and detail in it -- it is sitting right now at a shade under 670,000 words and only a year has past.

The second is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12125300/1/Black-Luminary][Black Luminary]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8129173/YakAge][YakAge]]. It has a excellent twist to begin with and the author is slow to reveal information that mean you just want to keep reading. There are few FanFics that can do this. Only problem is it has not been updated in awhile (23/AUG/2019) and it is frustrating me as I want to know more.

At the moment I go to fanfiction.net every day and hit refresh (many times) to see if either has updated.

** Are you me? Those two are like my weekly ritual to see if they have been updated.

Anyway,I found this one: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13041698/1/What-s-Her-Name-in-Hufflepuff]]

Yes it's an Self insert OC but it's not a Mary Sue and actually quite fun. It puts a couple of tropes wonderfully on it's head and it's beautofully written. You just need to get past the first chapter

** Sarcasm and Slytherin

The first year of the fic is almost the same as in POS, but the story differ quite a lot after that, it is a really good read, would advise it to anyone who like more political fics.

** i think POS is one of the best written, the author is really good at drama and tension. a huge drawback is because it is WIP a year in real time was basically spent reading many updates which pushed the story forward what felt like 5 minutes at a time in longbottom manor which was extremely tiresome. (this happened at the same time that Intensity by Mauraderlover7 had a few chapters of draco snape angst that felt like it took 6 months to resolve (a really dreadful period for reading WIPs in my opinion)

the pacing has picked up again so its back to number 1 in my WIP favourites list
