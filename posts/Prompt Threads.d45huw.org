In the last three weeks, 937 threads were created of this subreddit. Of those, 153 were prompt-threads - which is around 16%, or a bit less than every sixth thread being a prompt.

On average, those threads seem to be rather popular, gaining around 49 upvotes, compared to around 15 for non-prompt threads - which makes them seem even more prevalent on the frontpage.

I like prompts as much as the next guy, but can we perhaps tone it down a little?


** So you're asking for something that is 3 times more popular than the average thread be created less - even though it is currently only 16% of the total threads? I would have expected them to appear more than they do actually.

I have to admit that I don't tend to click on the prompt threads unless there is more than 50 comments or so ( basically guaranteeing a few people have actually written something instead of just discussing it ) so why not just do as I do and ignore them unless they interest you?

** What else are we gonna talk about ? How Draco is a war criminal ? Why Lupin is a coward ? Our pet peeves ? How slash(except lesbians) is bad with a big essay comment by Taure somewhere in the mix ?

*** Personally, I don't think we discuss why Lupin is a coward enough and I've definitely discovered a new pet peeve and unpopular opinion in the past two weeks.

** I think prompt posts are revitalizing the sub, I hadn't checked in a while and all these interesting posts were popping up in my main reddit feed.

I know there's a sub specifically for HP fanfic prompts, but I like seeing trope-inspired/creative prompts posted here and reading the responses
