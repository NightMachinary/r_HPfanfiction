This was inspired by the recent bacon post and someone went into a great and long explanation about British breakfasts and how they differ from American ones.

I'm not going to write in British English for my fic because...well, I don't have much time to write, so it's American English.

But what common little habits or things stand out to you as incorrect or too Americanized that we can fix in our writing to make it more authentic?

Update: WOW I definitely didn't expect this many responses. Thanks a bunch! It was a thrill reading all of them. <3

** As one of the people who made a detailed comment about the absolute state of pancakes, this is a great discussion thread if I do say so myself ;)

I think a lot of the big ones have been covered above by others, but yes, the most general advice I can give is just research, research, research. Make it fun for yourself, treat it like you're going on holiday and you're trying to find places you'd want to visit to get the quintessential “English” experience.

1) Settings

As somebody noted above, go outside of London for your settings and homes. There's so much in the UK to be seen.

Environments can be great at reflecting characters, and gives great implicit insight into even what their family dynamics might be. For example, Snape. Spinner's End is a block of terraced houses in an industrial area of the North West. These areas were founded upon mass migration to the cities during the Industrial Revolution. They habilitated deliberate cycles of poverty where miner or factory worker families would get a job at the local factory that owned the house, give most of their wage back to the factory for rent, live on the breadline, be worked to death in the dangerous conditions and the survivors kicked out for another family to move in for it to all start again.

Now combine this with the political climate of the 1960s-1980's UK when Snape was growing up. Many factories were being closed down, thousands upon thousands of working class people were made unemployed and the areas that once thrived on the factory business became deprived, dirty wastelands where opportunities were rare and many turned to drink to cope. Suddenly, you get a better feel for how bleak Snape's life must have been before he went to Hogwarts with Lily. The house, the setting, reflects his own sense of helplessness. Of a want for power to rise above.

It creates this wonderful divide between the mechanic, drab world his muggle father probably worked in, and the bright, strange, magical world Severus pined so desperately to be a part of.

This isn't to say every single setting needs to be painstakingly researched. My point is that if you spend just a little time looking at different places around the country and their brief history, you'll find writing the UK much easier, and your work will really pop with character and charm because the world will feel weighty and vivid and appropriate.

2) Misc.

- We call candy ‘sweets' over here. A popsicle is a ‘lollipop', what you call cookies are ‘biscuits' here, whilst cookies are...uh, different to biscuits and just called ‘cookies'. Jell-O is jelly.

- If you've got hair on your forehead, it's not called bangs, it's a ‘fringe'.

- We don't have anything like ‘homecoming' dances or ‘junior proms', ‘spring dances' etc. Most schools have just one prom event at the end of high school, and even then, it's not nearly as big a deal as it in America. At most, you'd probably go to a school disco in primary school or the earlier years of High School.

- For a LOT of people back in the 1960s - 1990's when Harry Potter was set, they did NOT call Santa...Santa. He was more widely known as ‘Father Christmas'. It's only in recent decades due to Americanisation that Santa has become widely used in the UK.

- We don't have grades in school. We just have ‘Years'.

(Harry was going to be sent to the local ‘comprehensive', which basically just means the local state-funded school. They're seen as rough and rubbish by well-off people like The Dursley's because they tend to be underfunded. Smeltings, where Dursley goes, is most definitely a ‘Public School', which is a privately owned school where parents pay tuition fees for their kid to go there.)

*** Just to add to this, if you're planning on sending a character to school in Scotland, the system is slightly different. On the whole there is just primary school and high school. Before you start primary school at age 4-5 you would go to nursery for a year or so. For most people when I was wee (like 20 years ago oh my god) this was a nursery within a primary school although I think nowadays there are a lot more private nurseries. Primary school starts at primary 1 (4-5 years old) up to primary 7 (11-12 years old). High school, sometimes called secondary school, starts at first year (12ish years old) up to sixth year (17-18 years old). Some people choose to leave in fourth or fifth year to go on to an apprenticeship or college course, but the majority will stay on until they've finished sixth year and then go on to university (which is different from college). I don't know how relevant this would be to a Harry Potter story but I guess it could come in handy for a long immersive fic.

*** Since you went into schooling, I have a couple of questions.

Are kids allowed to just walk to and from school without a parent? That's still really common in the US even for kindergarten (UK year 1). Older kids (8-9 maybe) might even get on a public bus to meet their parents somewhere.

How common is homeschooling and would it raise any eyebrows for a child to be pulled out of school to be homeschooled?

**** Personally I'd say from my own experience that children in primary school are walked to and from school by parents, especially in the lower years. Most kids I knew growing up weren't allowed to walk by themselves to school until Year 6, and my school had a policy of standing with kids to make sure they were picked up by a parent or guardian before leaving the playground.

But as someone else mentioned, this can vary from place to place so my experience definitely isn't the rule, and given Harry is from a village then it does make sense that since there's less distance to travel and thus also less perceived danger, it might not be too strange for him to walk alone.

In the 80's, the ‘Stranger Danger' phenomenon was just about coming into play for a lot of British parents due to an incident known as the Moors Murders back in the 60's, but it wasn't as deeply felt as it is these days.

As for homeschooling, there'd absolutely be questions asked if he were pulled out, it's not very typical over here in the UK. I'm not sure what the protocol was back in the 80's but I'm pretty sure social services (CPS) tend to get involved in cases like that to make sure the child is safe and explore the reasons for withdrawing them from school before decisions are made - though I'm not 100% sure!

** Graduation ceremonies. We don't have them for school. If your idea involves a graduation ceremony with a valedictorian, scrap it. We don't have them. You just leave school on your last day. Something more plausible is a leaver's feast, but results aren't known and there wouldn't be any speeches recognising academics or from students.

See also "diplomas/ degrees". They're not a thing you get from school. The NEWTS are individual, independent qualifications in particular subjects based on A levels. We also don't have a GPA. Also no midterms/ extra credit/ points for homework/ participation/ classwork. None of that counts towards your grade, the only thing is your final exam. This isn't called finals either. They're just your exams. You get your results in the post in August.

At university, you don't have English 101 or whatever. You study modules in your particular subject. If you're doing a history degree, for example, you might have a module on the French revolution or the second World War. You won't have classes in maths or geography, everything will be about history. Also no roommates. Even if you live in halls, you'll have your own bedroom. It'll probably be in a shared flat, however.

Doctors bills/ medical debt. Again, not a thing. You go to the gp and get whatever treatment you need, and you don't have to pay. We don't have adverts for prescription medicines either. Drugs are typically referred to by their generic names. You wouldn't ask someone for a Tylenol, you'd ask for paracetamol. The brands are different here too, so stick to generics.

Don't touch Northern Ireland. It's a very sensitive subject and the Troubles are in very recent memory. Whatever you do, don't call an Irish, Scottish or Welsh character English. That is offensive and wrong. Don't call an Irish character British either, that's also offensive. There's a difference between Great Britain and the United Kingdom. They're not synonymous.

Don't have all your characters from London. London is one city, it's not the entirity of the uk. Don't imply that Northern characters must want to live in London either. Generally, we don't.

We get our driving (not driver's) licences at 17, not 16. The minimum age to buy alcohol is 18. From 16, it can be ordered with a meal. You can drink from 5 with your parent's permission, however. Underage drinking is very common.

Tea is made with milk and optional sugar, but never cream. A cream tea is a meal. We don't have coffee creamer either. If your character collects food, it's a takeaway. It's not takeout.

Houses are smaller. Don't have a character who's not rich live in a big, detached house. They'll probably live in an ordinary two or three bedroom terraced house. That means that you have houses attached either side. This goes for most families too. It doesn't mean that you're in dire poverty, it's just normal.

It should be very short and follow something similar to Dumbledore's typical speeches.

Snape's house likely had four rooms /total/.

A living room and kitchen downstairs, and two bedrooms upstairs. These rooms are very small. They likely shared a communal lav (bathroom) with the entire street. This was because the Sanitation Movement (which installed running water and proper plumbing throughout England from the mid-1800s to the late-1900s) would not have reached the poorer areas by the 1960s and 70s. That was at the very end of this era, the change of season, so people would be being moved into council housing as their previous homes were knocked down to be rebuilt.

There is no way that Lily lived in a large country house in an industrial town like Cokeworth. But she can have her own bathroom, putting her a class above the Snapes.

And the character is from East Lancashire or North Yorkshire, where the '-bottom' surnames come from. (Old dialect word hereabouts for 'valley', so Neville's surname means 'of the long valley').

#+end_quote

I don't want to side track the discussion into a healthcare thing, but this is actually a really interesting stat. So - this stat that's cited pretty often compares the UK's gov't spending with health care spending (as an industry) in the US. If you were to compare the US/UK's govt spending, the US gov't still spends more, but the different isn't as stark.

What's interesting is that technically, you want to spend more per capita on health care. That's good! Somalia spends just $33/person and we'd hardly call the country a paragon of health. But, in the US, this doesn't lead to higher life expectancy (which is the goal of the spending) or better mortality rates.

So we come back to yeah, the US is still cocking health care up, but transitioning to a straight forward medicare-for-all/NHS system isn't nearly as easy as I wish it would be, mostly because everyone involved in the process in the US just makes more. From the health care techs, to the big pharma office workers, to the doctors/medical professionals, everyone makes more and that cost is passed on to the consumer.

Oh, yeah. They'd have a hell of a time trying to implement an NHS style system. You could argue though that the power of the entire US federal government deciding what to buy and from whom could possibly lead to bulk purchase discounts. On the other hand, it is entirely legal for businesses over there to set up lobbies and give money to politicians so Big Pharma might make even more money from the power of corruption.

***** I'm American and the idea of American exceptionalism Ieaves me with mixed feelings. One on hand, it has very much powered the US to be the worlds largest economy, quality of life, and many other good things. There's a lot about startup culture especially that you can link to exceptionalism (the idea that you and you specifically have an idea that no one else ever has come up with).

On the other hand, it leads to the US military trampling all over foreign countries and human rights (which nets us cheap labor and goods), straight ridicule, and a stubborn refusal that maybe we can take an example that other countries have set.

I don't think the US would be in the position it's in today without exceptionalism, but it causes so much destruction in the world in return and treats the world like some zero sum game

** Would you believe, I wrote a fic about this :p

linkffn(13486013 )

[[/u/emeraldfaye][u/emeraldfaye]] made some excellent points not made in my fic, especially about Ireland. I second everything they wrote.

I'm not too fussy about spelling (colour/color, humour/humor, etc.) but an effort to use the correct words would be appreciated, especially where the difference is well known. I understand using "public school" instead of "state school", but using "mom" instead of "mum" is just a bit lazy imo.

*Clothing*

Most has been mentioned, but I would add:

Jersey = jumper (I think ... I'm not entirely sure what a jersey is. Ignorance goes two ways.)

Panties = knickers

Sneakers = trainers

Diaper = nappy (I know I know it sounds ridiculous but the word “diaper” rubs me the wrong way for some reason.)

Bathing costume = swimming costume (can we take a moment to appreciate how AMERICAN the phrase “bathing costume” is? I'm not bathing, I'm swimming, I don't wear it in the bloody bathtub.)

Zipper = zip, or fly is addressing specifically the zip on the crotch of your trousers. If you want to tell someone their zip is undone, you can say “Your fly is down”, or my preferred option, “You've got egg on your chin.” I've never heard anyone say it, but I'm holding out for it.)

Wifebeater = vest.

*Swearing*

Brits swear all the time. Anywhere, anytime. Teachers give up correcting you after year 11 (when you're 15/16. Tenth grade, I think?). Loads of words that would make our Atlantic cousins blush are barely even considered rude.

Here are some dirty colloquialisms:

Bollocks = balls.

Getting a bollocking = getting told off.

Bollocked = told off, or drunk. Mostly drunk.

Piss = same as America I'm fairly certain.

Pissed = annoyed. Or drunk. (If you wish to clarify that someone is annoyed, you'd be better of using “pissed off,” which I'm fairly certain is common in America too.)

Fucked = Doomed. Or the obvious. Or drunk.

Destroyed = no longer in existence. Or drunk. Or both!

Shitfaced = drunk.

(As a rule of thumb, any word with -ed on the end will probably mean drunk. Because we are. All the time. How do you think we deal with this miserable weather?)

To shit someone = to take someone for a fool.

*Law/Courts*

This may be news (or perhaps not, considering my sense of humour, pedanticism and general dickishness) but I am a law student. And I simply /cannot/ keep my mouth shut (or my opinion untyped) when there are legal fallacies in fanfiction.

I apologise to anyone who has ever had me review their court scene in a fic.

First, the word “attorney” doesn't really exist. We never call lawyers attorneys. That's purely an American thing and to be honest, I find it really confusing. What's wrong with “lawyer”?

Second, we have two distinct types of lawyer: a barrister and a solicitor.

A barrister represents you in court. They're advocacy specialists and whilst they may advise you on certain matters, they don't do transactions. They operate out of 'chambers' rather than firms (e.g. Blackstone Chambers). Any paperwork that is not immediately related to a court proceeding will be done by a solicitor.

90% of all lawyers are solicitors, they deal with more day-to-day transactions, such as filing for custody, business mergers and acquisitions (e.g. buying a company, if your version of Harry would like to buy Grunnings), and prepping files for court. If a business or a person is being taken to court, a solicitor will do the research, pour through files and evidence to find out what is relevant and what is not. They will pass the relevant documents along to the barrister, who will put together a case and prepare cross-examinations etc. for trial. Solicitors operate out of law firms (e.g. Kirkland & Ellis, Clyde & Co.).

Basically, if your Harry goes to trial against Dumbledore, or the Potters, or the Ministry, or anyone, he will likely have BOTH a barrister AND a solicitor. The solicitor is unlikely to speak in court unless they have Higher Rights of Audience ... but that just complicates everything.

Barristers may wear gowns and wigs, depending on the court.

There's also the fact that it's impossible for Dumbledore to be sent to prison, Harry to be emancipated, and James Potter to pay compensation for abuse or whatever all in one court hearing ... but tbh JKR's presentation of the court system in HP is so nonsensical that I wouldn't be surprised if that's how it actually worked in magical Britain; I just know it doesn't in Muggle Britain.

*** To be further pedantic to the point of uselessness. There are 3 legal systems (Scots, England and Wales, and NI) and Jurisdictions in the UK. Theoretically for instance, Hogwarts would be subject to Scots Law, if there isn't already a separate Magic Legal system.

For instance, Cases don't get referred to the CPS up here but to the Procurator Fiscal, who is also the coroner essentially.\\
Barristers are Advocates here and belong to the Faculty of Advocates.\\
Magistrates don't exist, we have Sherriff Courts for Low level Offences, moving to the High Court and then The High Court of the Justiciary, for serious criminal cases afterwards, it can go to the Court of Appeals.

Civil cases are dealt with through the Court of Session.

Most interestingly the Jury (12 in Civil cases and 15 in Criminal cases) can return one of three verdicts; Not Guilty, Not Proven and Guilty.\\
and somewhat uniquely, Scots Law has the Accused stand as 'Guilty until proven innocent'\\
Not Proven comes from a time when the purpose of the Jury was only to decide on whether the facts of the case where Proven or Not Proven, and it was not the Jury's place to render a moral judgement upon the Accused, that was the job of the Judge.

*** My responses as an American:

My understanding is that “jumpers” are equivalent to “sweaters,” not “jerseys.” A jersey is usually worn in connection to sports and often is made of a mesh material (though not always) while a sweater is a thick, long-sleeved top to keep warm.

Americans don't say “bathing costume” but “swimsuit” or “bathing suit.” I personally use “swimsuit” because I think “bathing suit” sounds dumb as I'm not bathing but swimming when I wear one. I believe the term of “bathing suit” originated from when people didn't actually swim in them but just played around and sat around in water, but that's just a guess.

If you call a “wifebeater” a “vest,” then what would you call what Americans call a “vest”? A “wifebeater” is essentially a form of tanktop or sleeveless top that is worn by men and technically is a politically incorrect term though is still a commonly used term for the top. A “vest” to Americans is a formal type of outerwear that goes over a long-sleeved buttoned-up shirt.

Americans also use “pissed off,” “fucked,” “shitfaced” and the like.

Usually Americans use “lawyer” and “attorney” interchangeably, but there is a difference. All attorneys are lawyers, but not all lawyers are attorneys. If you graduate from law school, you're a lawyer. If you graduate from law school and pass the bar exam in at least one state so that you are licensed to practice law, then you are an attorney. If you get disbarred or let your license to practice law lapse, then you may technically lose your attorney status and may or may not be able to reclaim it. Again though, most Americans don't know the difference and use the terms “lawyer” and “attorney” interchangeably. I'm just getting really technical here.

In the US, a “solicitor” is someone going door-to-door trying to get us to buy or do something without us asking them to come by. They're basically spam/junk mail in human form.

What you call a “barrister” is basically the equivalent of a “litigation attorney” or “trial lawyer” in the US. Most attorneys work in civil law and never see a courtroom. We don't really add an additional label for them not going into court, just for those who do go into court. Depending on the area of law an attorney practices is what they may have as a title if they only practice one area of law. So an attorney can be an “immigration lawyer,” “divorce attorney,” etc. Many practice multiple areas of law though.

Do you have paralegals or legal assistants or legal secretaries in the UK? In the US, while certain law firms may have lower level or less experienced attorneys doing research and preparation for the ones who go to court, a lot of research and preparation and paperwork is done by paralegals/legal assistants/legal secretaries in the US. (Technically, there is a difference between paralegals, legal assistants, and legal secretaries, but most people use the terms interchangeably. There are some differences based on education and licensing requirements and job duties, but it depends on the state in which you live, so it varies across the US. In some states, which label you use matters, and in other states, they mean the same thing.)

In the US, there are attorneys who practice state or federal law, but they either work out of a law firm or for the government. Really the only time an attorney works for the government but to represent a regular person is when it's a public defender because you are too poor to afford an attorney when the government is prosecuting you.

Even in the US we wouldn't combine multiple types of legal matters into a single court hearing. In fact, the examples you gave likely wouldn't even be handled by the same judge or the same attorneys even. Those writers who do combine them simply don't know how the legal system operates regardless of whether they're from the US or the UK.

**** What you'd call a vest, we'd call a waistcoat. A vest is strictly a top that you wear under another top for warmth or modesty purposes. For example, I have some tops that are slightly too low cut and I wear a vest to avoid showing the world my bra. My dad might wear a waistcoat with his suit to go to a wedding. We don't have a tux or tuxedo, it's strictly a suit. There are various types based on formality, but it's acceptable to call all of them a suit. You would wear a suit with a smart shirt. We don't say button up or button down, that's implied. Everything else is either a T shirt, top (generic word), polo neck etc etc. You can't have Harry pull on a shirt and reveal it's a polo later.

Women also wear suits, either a skirt suit or a trouser suit depending on preferences. A skirt suit will typically consist of a knee length skirt, a blouse and a matching jacket. You wear it with tights (we don't say hose or pantyhose) and usually heels. Whilst men would wear a suit to any formal occasion such as a wedding, dinner party, awards ceremony, job interview, etc etc. Women wear suits to formal occasions in a work environment.

You would wear a dress, typically to a formal social event.

**** In which case, jumper works for both jersey and sweater! It's a generic outer-layer without buttons/zip or a hood (a jacket for the former and hoodie for the latter, which I believe is the same as in the US?)

The bathing suit is one I only recall seeing in one fic, which stuck out in my head as so bizarre I had to mention it. Possibly it's only unique to the part of America where that author was from rather than widespread slang.

As emeraldfaye mention, an American "vest" is a British waistcoat.

In the U.K. becoming a lawyer is a bit more complicated, I think. You can do law as an undergrad, but afterwards you need to do other parts of vocational training. They're always being redesigned for some reason, so this comment will be out-of-date in a year I'm sure, but for now to be a barrister you do a 3 or 4 year law degree, a 1 year Bar Professional Training Course, and then a 1 year pupillage in Chambers before you qualify. During pupillage you're affectionate referred to as a "baby barrister".

For a solicitor, you do your law undergrad, followed by a one year (or six month, depending on the firm) Law Practice Course, and then a two-year training contract.

If you qualify as either you're a generic "lawyer," and law students tend to be called lawyers for brevity (also, feeds our egos).

We do have paralegals!! I'm not familiar with the term "legal secretary" or "assistant." I think we just keep it to plain "secretaries" and "paralegals." Most paralegals nowadays have UG law degrees (although many older ones don't) and are working to save up for their LPC/BPTC as only certain firms/chambers will fund them.

That sounds pretty similar to here except we don't have "state defenders" as such; we fund private law firms/Chambers to represent people through legal aid (don't get me started on legal aid because I have MANY opinions). Cab rank means you can't refuse a case you're offered (which is how they get away with having such a pittance in legal aid - damnit I said I wouldn't start on that!)

Also, fun fact: you don't actually pay a barrister in the U.K. You pay a law firm and the firm instructs the barrister, who charges the firm a fee ... apparently it's a hangover from when barristers were only upper-class gentleman who thought it demeaning to work for money, but it's a fun anachronism I think.

** Biggest gripe that makes me want to stop reading a fic is use of "sir/ma'am" to refer to any random adult.

This is a weird US thing where everyone is deeply superficially polite and deferential. It's very grating to read because we just don't have that intergenerational relationship in the UK. In the US you might think it's respectful, in the UK, it's pretentious and obsequious.

"Sir" gets used in the context of a classroom as an alternative to "professor". "Ma'am" is not a word I have ever uttered, nor do I ever expect to. People might use it for the Queen, but that's about it!

Harry wouldn't go around calling strangers "sir/ma'am". If you don't know a person's name, you just avoid addressing them by any title. We're very clear that our relationship with most strangers (including shopkeepers, etc) is transactional, and we have no illusion that we have to be friends.

Parents of your friends would be "Mr Granger" or "Hermione's Dad" unless they ask you to call them by name (which isn't uncommon here).

**** A notable one is muggleborn characters going off it about people having a say in the running of government due to having inherited a title, but we do actually have that in the UK.

The House of Lords, made up of the Lords Temporal (members either appointed by the monarch or who inherited their seats) and the Lords Spiritual (made up of bishops from the Church of England), are a separate chamber from the elected House of Commons whose role is to scrutinise bills passed by the latter and has the power to delay them or in limited circumstances even prevent them from passing - at the time Harry Potter was set, it was also the final court of appeal in our judicial system.

That said, it is a controversial topic, so it's by no means a thing all muggleborn would necessarily be okay with, but it's definitely not something they can really use to beat the wizarding world over the head with, either.

Yes, but actually no. The whole chamber didn't sit and hear cases, only specifically appointed Law Lords, who never involved themselves in the legislative functions of the House. So while in theory and by name it was one body, the House of Lords, in reality there was a legislative chamber and a court with no overlap between them.

** Okay, the biggest gripe I have is with people misunderstanding the university system. I wasn't born in the UK, although I have lived there now for a number of years so I don't really mind things like pants/trousers and holidays/vacations, especially because I have had teachers coming from the US or Canada before.

So: here's a guide to the university application and acceptance process, specific to ENGLAND.

If you're going to say that a character is going to Oxford and they are taking an English class that they have to pass or something, or something like Math being compulsory for English majors, this is not how the system works. So let me explain.

1) You finalise the courses you're applying to at the beginning of Year 13 (senior year). If you are applying to universities, this is all done through UCAS, aka the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service. You can only pick up to 5 courses, not universities, maximum (i.e. you can apply to 2 courses at the same uni, but this is not a good idea), and to apply you must fill in an online form and fill out a SUBJECT SPECIFIC personal statement (max 4000 characters 47 lines) focusing on more academic things; it is generally not a good idea to mention extracurriculares in more than one brief paragraph. Exceptions apply:

a) You can't apply to both Cambridge and Oxford! You can also only pick one course from ONE of these universities b) med school applicants can only have 4 of 5 choices be medicine. c) some universities have entrance exams. look them up if you want specific detail. d) weird nitpick, but in the event you have a character Imperial College London, THEY ONLY OFFER STEM AND BUSINESS COURSES (and business only as an MBA). e) Universities usually have grades for acceptance in to specific courses which they make clear in a prospectus or website. f) interviews are generally only offered by top unis and the format and difficulty varies, but they are ACADEMIC in nature. Their importance, and the proportion of applicants interviewed varies. They might ask you a brief question or two about why you'd like to attend a specific uni, but otherwise the questions focus on applying your knowledge. Cambridge ones are normally, according to a friend, 1 hour long and involve lots of weird, difficult questions on different topics as the Cambridge Natural Science course (and probably Durham as well), as a rare exception, does not require you to finalise what your ‘major' is in (and we don't really use major, just degree) until second year. In the case of Cambridge, questions might not even be on your chosen degree either. For example, my friend was interviewed for physics and was asked only maths questions. I'll just share a personal experience- I was lucky enough to be invited to interview for Imperial College London, although for something different from the friend mentioned above. We compared our experiences and we both thought that the Imperial interview seemed to be somewhat easier than the Cambridge one. In my experience, they started off with simple questions that you could answer easily, and gradually ramped up the difficulty to see what I knew and could infer from existing knowledge.

2) Receiving an offer of a place from the university is in 99% of cases conditional to you achieving the grades they enclose with the offer. For example, if you are given an offer at Imperial College London for Mathematics, you might have to get, say, A* A in maths and further maths A Level, and A's in both chemistry and physics.

3) Once you've received all your offers or rejections, you have to pick one as your ‘firm choice' and insurance. What this means is:

a) If you achieve your grades that you need you go to the firm choice. The decision is BINDING. If you don't you go to the insurance.

4) What happens if you miss both? You go through clearing, where leftover places from some universities are shown, and you can apply to those.

5) A bachelor's degree in England is 3 years; I believe Scotland's Bachelors are 4 years. By the way, you can apply for direct entry for a 4 year integrated masters program, which means you don't have to apply again in 2nd or 3rd year for an extra year of study to graduate with a masters. You do actually get the bachelors after your third year, so if you change your mind you can drop out of the masters programme. There is no concept of ‘grad school'. You have to apply separately to Masters and PhD.

By hearsay (may not be accurate) in the English system STEM courses seem to be much more competitive in terms of applicants- there are way too many applicants for places especially at higher ranked universities; while for things like arts and humanities and languages there is somewhat of a shortage.

Hope this is helpful for anyone wanting to write ‘muggle world' fics?

**** This!!! As someone with a slightly crummy northern accent, it's kind of insulting when people (/including/ JKR) try to write it phonetically - it implies RP should be the standard, which ew, no thanks. That's got pretty dubious implications in terms of class/regional bias. Accents are such a huge, surprisingly sensitive issue. People get turned down from jobs/unis/peer groups because they don't talk a certain way. Hagrid's phonetic accent in Harry Potter is pretty offensive and just another symptom of JKR's obssession with London.

** Doctors!!!! I read a fic recently where a character spent months looking to get a simple GP appointment, then self referred to what from context must've been a consultant somehow and got in within the space of weeks, which hoo boy, as someone with a chronic illness that is /not/ how things happen lol.

So. A quick rundown of how routine doctors appointments work in England specifically.

- Your first port of call is your GP. You have two choices here generally speaking, although this is more complicated now with more online systems.
- The first is getting an urgent appointment - a herculean task that involves waking up early in the morning and having your finger on the call button for the very second the phone lines open. If you are even a minute late you /will/ be unable to get an appointment. If, after waiting on hold, you're lucky enough for there to still be urgent appointments left, you have to face incredibly invasive medical questions from an unqualified receptionist trying to determine whether you're ill enough to need said urgent appointment and also not so ill that you need A&E (where they will tell you it's a chronic problem and you need to speak to your GP anyway). If you're lucky enough to get said appointment, you'd better not have planned anything for the rest of the day, because it's the luck of the draw regarding which of the practice doctors you get to see and when. If this sounds like a kafkaesque nightmare it's because it is.

  - The second option is to get a non urgent appointment, which is much easier, but also you will have to wait between 1-2 weeks for. Generally you also don't get a choice which doctor at the practice you see. I've never spoken to the same GP twice in a row.
  - Further notes on GPs - you don't really shop around as much as people seem to in the US. You're limited to services in your local area, and the GP has a relatively small catchment area. Depending on where you live, you'll have a choice of perhaps 4 or 5 in a big city, and much fewer in a small town/village.

So, you managed to ger in to see the GP, congrats! But, as it turns out, this is an issue beyond their knowledge to handle - perhaps you need a specialist test, or perhaps a more complex treatment. - Unlike how it seems to be in the US, you can't just walk up to a particular doctor and book in, you need to get a referral. This referral will be to a particular service or clinic as opposed to an individual, may require travel to London if it's for something particularly rare, and there's a 50% chance the aging shit show of NHS machinery will break down and lose said referral. Which you won't know about until it's been a year and you ring them up and they apologise profusely before booking you in immediately (gotta love CAMHS) - If you're lucky enough for your referral to actually get processed, you'll have an appointment at a clinic that generally happens in a hospital, unless it's for mental health, in which case it is guaranteed to be in the middle of some tiny village with terrible transport links and a nonsensical building that you /will/ be unable to find first time round and accidentally wander into the inpatient building (yes. this has happened to me more than once.) - Your referral, by the way, will have landed you on a waiting list ranging from several months to several years, so you had better not be dying because tough shit. - There will almost definitely be lots of tears and drama during this period.

Bassically, the NHS is a rickety old shopping trolley that's lost two wheels and has long since given up nicely rolling down the hill, taking instead to rolling arse over tits and making lots of noise. That said, we love it to bits, would literally die for it, and think Americans are dumb for not having one. This doesn't even /begin/ to cover the complexities of the system, and if you're looking for accuracy, you're best asking an actual brit to read over it.

** I'm going to take a slightly different road, and mention that it's okay to not overly obsess about 'brit-picking'. Note that I'm not from the UK - just French/American.

It's not a bad thing to try to accomplish, obviously - and for a lot of people, Harry Potter is very much tied to a British nature. However, by nature of how the world works, plenty of its setting in non-British places have gotten more worked into the magical setting... which then makes it much less important for verisimilitude to be entirely British.

My recommendations would be to try not to include anything that jumps out as American in particular. A few that come to mind are things like particular foods (eg, pancakes), political system (eg: healthcare assumptions), some lingo (talking in extremely american slang - ie, if you can say that it's using slang from a particular US region, it's probably too much), taking the US grading/education system, etc.

But past that, you can get by without too much obsession in my view. Just depends on how much you care about it being in Britain - and knowing that for some of your prospective readers, it does add a good bit to the fic/setting.

*** That comes across as Americans viewing their culture as the default and not caring to get their stories set elsewhere even vaguely accurate. It's enough to make me stop reading a story.

**** This is more a french interpretation, if anything. I read the books in French first, while living in France/having grown up there, and that certainly plays a role with me identifying the setting as more european/magical/non-American than specifically British. But that was also very much a strength of the way Harry Potter was written, and why it got so popular. (Edit - also, for British people it might be surprising how much internationally gets pushed into 'magical' society vs 'british' - eg, prefects as a concept is something that most people in France/the US that I've come across associate specifically with Hogwarts/magical education, not with Britain)

If you're talking about the 'Not-American' aspects I recommended, that's because I got the impression that OP was American - in which case I stand by that section (which also seems to agree with what you're saying)
