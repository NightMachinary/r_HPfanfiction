** linkffn(9002521) This is pretty much the only one I know of. Last updated in December last year. Still hoping for the author to crawl out of their hole. Let's hope the upcoming movie will inspire some authors to write a crossover.

** This doesn't really help you right now but if you haven't heard there's a Dr. Strange movie coming out later this year! Might inspire some people to write crossovers once it's released.

  The world is breaking. War and technology push on the edge of the unbelievable as S.H.I.E.L.D. desperately tries to keep the peace. Soldier and scientist no longer hold the line alone, as an ancient fire burns alongside them. The last of all wizards.
