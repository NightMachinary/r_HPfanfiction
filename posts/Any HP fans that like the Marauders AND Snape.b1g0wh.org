Marauders.. Maybe not so much Peter...üòÅ

(And maybe liking Snape not so much also üò± but still willing to read fanfics with him in it. )

But meaning Sirius, Lupin and James?

But then you read a fanfic where Snape is Harry's real dad (uh..yeah üòÅ)and Sirius is bashed/abused or humiliated. ü§∑

...Or maybe you're a big fan of James and hate seeing him horribly treat Snape?


** Yes, I love writing about the Marauders (especially Sirius) /and/ Snape.

I wouldn't say that I'd like all of these characters if I met them in real life, but I definitely consider them interesting, and I don't like it when fics bash these characters because it seems like lazy writing. Sure, if I read a fic from Snape's perspective, I don't expect him to like the Marauders, but I don't wanna get the feeling that the author dislikes the Marauders, too.

I also think it's possible to write James in a likeable way without sugarcoating the flashback scene in OOTP. Likewise, I enjoy fics which explain Snape's motivation to join the DE without finding a moral justification for Voldemort's goals.

Yes, some things these characters do/did are inexcusable, but that doesn't mean that you cannot give them a well-developed backstory. I have always admired Rowling for her talent to give characters complexity and flaws without making them (necessarily) unlikeable and without bashing them. For example, Voldemort is without doubt a terrible person, but I never get the feeling that Rowling dislikes the character on a personal level. I wish more fanfic authors would portray morally grey or even negative characters this way.

*** What are your favourite aspects of Sirius? As a Snape fan I find it very difficult to like Sirius, as I feel like they're pretty much polar opposites, but I'm curious about what you like about him.

‚Äã

Rowling is very talented at writing characters that are like real humans, and not just plot devices. And so many /different/ ones too--it's quite incredible.

*** James was very clearly in the wrong during that scene and acted disgustingly. That aside, I agree that he can still be written as likeable -- a single event doesn't define a person.

I do however have a very hard time liking Sirius. He may be loyal to his friends, but his strong malicious streak (which probably came from his upbringing) sits very badly with me.

** I am not a huge fan of Snape because of how he treated children in his adulthood. Basically, he should have known better but all in all I respect the way JK Rowling wrote him.

I like to read about him in fanfictions. I am not a fan of Snily but I make exceptions for AUs where he isn't on the way to be a Death Eater. (Seldom)

From the Marauders Era, James and Remus are my favourite. I also like Sirius a lot but he was kinda cruel. Peter did awful things but not while he was still in school so I hate seeing him bashed in Marauders Era fanfictions.

** I'm not really a fan of 1971-1976 Marauders at all -- OotP's "Snape's Worst Memory" heavily implies that their relentless bullying of Slytherins (or at least Snape) is /commonplace/ and a spectacle people in the school are used to. And then there is the werewolf prank... Not that Severus was a saint during this time, but to me, the Marauders always seemed worse during this time period (They were the initial instigators of the constant fighting, and Severus never did something matching werewolf prank in malice).

I think James did eventually grow up starting from the 6th year, especially during 7th year (he did become Head Boy). I have a much harder time seeing a more mature Sirius, however. Meanwhile, Snape turned into the bully we know from the HP era -- even worse during his true DE years, and I don't really like him in fics during 1977-1981.

I do, however, not like Jily. There's a few reasons for this: one, I simply, subjectively, prefer fics with the LESS pairing (allthough even if that particular ship doesn't happen, I still feel there's better alternatives -- particularly LERL). But in addition to this, James instigates the destruction of one of Lily's relationships not once, but /twice/ -- first with Severus during Snape's Worst Memory, then with Petunia during her wedding -- making me personally always feel James as being bad for her (why would you want to get together with someone who keeps ruining your friendships/etc?). In addition to this, I have similar reservations with this ship as with Ron/Hermione, another ship I don't like -- the fact that to me, they're simply too different. Moreover, James' pursuing of her during, at least, 5th year, when she clearly isn't interested, comes off as downright creepy, and I get the impression that she only started to give him notice at all as a result of werewolf prank misunderstandings... I always felt that, if not for special circumstances (the Prophecy), their marriage wouldn't have lasted. I don't /hate/ the pairing -- I can read fics with it, as long as it isn't the main focus of the fic.

I mostly read SS-centric fics, so I'm obviously biased here. That being said, I prefer to avoid fics portraying him during 1977-1981 (I prefer not to read about angsty villians, which I always figured was how Severus was during this time period -- fics portraying him as good during this time always came off as OOC), and prefer reading postwar (1998+, not 1981+) fics, where I figure he has opportunities to let go of unpleasant things from his past allowing him to become a better person, or 1960-1976 ones (or AUs where SWM never happens, or doesn't impact his life the same way).

** Yep absolutely. I love Snape, and I love Remus (and occasionally them together...), I like Sirius as a character, I don't think he's a great person but at least he's good to Harry. I don't much care for James, however I think he grew into a better person as an adult (and Peter's just an evil little rat).

** I'm a fan of all of them. Not as much Snape nowadays (tastes change), but I definitely like him more than other characters (Draco and Bellatrix come to mind). I have a time travel fic that gives the Marauders' antics and Snape's experiences if not *equal* weight, at least as much weight as each individual Marauder. That includes Peter, in that fic, because I'm trying to write his journey to betrayal as much as I'm writing everyone else's experiences.

** I like Remus and I like Snape, but I pretty much cannot stand Sirius and I'm generally ambivalent about James. I'm actually OK with Peter--he's a really interesting character, evil rat that he is. I think it's possible to like Snape and some of the Marauders, but what I'd be really interested in is finding a fan of both Sirius AND Snape, because they're like, mortal enemies.

** Marauder characters grown up in the novels, yes. I like Sirius and Remus, though Snape is my favorite. I am curious what it would take to reconcile their differences or find common ground. Some kind of life-threatening or crisis event, probably.

I don't like school-age Marauders. James and Black were arrogant bullies, Lupin was a coward for not standing up to them, and Peter was a sycophant. I didn't see much to redeem them, though we didn't see much at all from that time.

** I dislike both to be honest. Not the idea of them, but how they were portrayed by Rowling in the long run. Although to be fair, the more fanfiction I have read, the less I liked them so it wasn't like I just started off disliking them terribly. Plus I also dislike Dumbledore so... I guess I am not the most forgiving of all of the nonsense surrounding Harry they all were involved in in some way lol.

*** My biggest problem with JKR's portrayal of the Marauder-era people is her portrayal -- or lack thereof -- of James. We as readers hear people keep telling how great he was, and yet our /only/ direct view of him is his bullying of Snape. We can draw conclusions that he became a better person (he became Head Boy, and I like to think that he didn't just get it from bias), but JKR /never/ portrays him in a good light (the "Lily, take Harry and run!" scene doesn't really count in either direction), to balance from what we saw in Sev's memories. This, IMO, is unfair to James. One thing I would have liked to see is Sirius and Remus, after Harry confronts them about Snape's Worst Memory, actually tell him anecdotes about James as a /truly likeable and good person/.

** Personally, I feel that James is morally no better than Snape, and if we're considering all these characters as simply characters I love them nearly equally because they result from some of the best snippets of writing in the series. Both characters are worth writing and writing well. They've both got a lot of interesting traits and potential.

That said I also think James Potter was an absolutely terrible person who was entirely irredeemable for his actions and I think most fans I've spoken to (American fans because I'm an American) misread Snape due to placing him in the wrong cultural context. That's not to argue that I think Snape can be redeemed, he can't really, but it's a little out there to say he stalked a girl he stopped talking to when she said ‚Äòstop talking to me'.

*** How is James irredeemable? I mean he pretty much was "redeemed" in canon. We know he grew out of his bad behaviour towards other students and became a far better person. In my experience, this is entirely plausible, and I've seen it happen frequently. Actually, when I look at people I went to school with, many of them totally changed after graduation. And I would argue that several of them are now better people. Yes, they did mean and stupid things, but they are not 15 anymore, and people /can/ grow out of bullying behaviour.

I would even argue that Snape can be redeemed, at least if you write about his youth. His behaviour as a teacher was appalling, but I think it's totally possible to find a way to redeem him as a young man (either before or right after he became a death eater).

**** James Potter Joined the fight against wizard Hitler when he would have been fine if he just stayed on the sidelines

James Potter also befriended a werewolf which was a rare thing considering wizarding prejudice against werewolves

It's worth noting that in the first book McGonagall was quite broken up about James and lillys death

We also have to look at James potters last actions telling his wife and son to flee

bullying is wrong of course, but Voldemort is on the rise and this kid on the train is openly wanting to join said house

***** A person could do all of those ‚Äònice' things for selfish reasons and James was never Shown to get better. We're only told he got better by people who found him charming. Sorry if I take that with a grain of salt. I love the character. I just think people really idealize him in a way that's just not healthy. It's not realistic for someone to treat someone as badly as he treated Snape for no reason and just suddenly grow up and ‚Äòsee the light'. Dying for your family is still a selfish action in many regards. One might do that out of ego. Not every martyr is Jesus.

The Soviets fought the Nazis too man. Not everyone does good things for altruistic reasons.

******* Justifications that come after the fact don't work so good though. James was a kid with a good home. He had money and access to everything he wanted. He picked a fight with Snape for no good reason, we're shown this in the year one flashback JK wrote it's literally canon. James was a popular kid and so was Sirius, both being in the community and having money/connections before Snape ever showed up which means the antagonistic attitude they took towards him likely made it more difficult for Snape to find friends in other positive influences Lilly easily became friends with.

And beyond that I was involved in activism in my youth. Many people in that field are in it for selfish reasons. James fighting Death Eaters does not make him a good person just because he did it.

********* I don't see the point of this argument. I didn't say ‚Äúthis is the only reasonable reading of James Potter‚Äù I said ‚ÄúI don't think he's redeemable'.

It's an opinion. It was stated as an opinion and I'm entitled to think what I think. Personally, I've never met a James Potter type who wasn't a total trash person. No matter the heroic shit they'd done.

An individual reading is informed by life experience. This is mine. Arguing with me won't retroactively change the people I've known in my life, or the things I've learned. In my experience Martyrs are selfish people nine times out of ten. James has all the red flags I've personally been trained to see for that kind of person. That doesn't mean he is or isn't like that. It means it's how I perceive him and my perception is solid because he's not real so he can't prove himself.
