In an alternate universe where Harry Potter and The Percy Jackson series are in the same world.

If a God such as Zeus had a child with a witch would the child be an all powerful wizard/witch demigod with both Zeus powers and Wizars powers or would one cancel out the other or weaken the other?

Would you be able to do spell so monsters dont smell you? Or just avada kadabra at monsters instead of learning to fight like normal demigods?


** If you go with the fanon explanation that Avada interacts with the soul somehow then it probably wouldn't work on monsters since they don't really have a soul, right?

I think that if Zeus would have a magical demigod child it would have an extreme affinity to all spells that have to do with Air/Flying/Lightning. The same goes for Poseidon with water/earth and Hades for necromancy.

*** Interesting I was trying to plan character I was going to write a story for who come across Surius Black on their way to Olympus after he breaks out of Azkaban, these wizards beings a 14 year old daughter of Poseidon and 12 year old son of Hades, going to Olympus because they got a prophecy that this was the only way to prevent the great prophecy being for them.

I was going to have Sirius agree to help them if he helps him first, go find Peter pettigrew at Hogwarts where the kids meet 13 year old Harry Potter
