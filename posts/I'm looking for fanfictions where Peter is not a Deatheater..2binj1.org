Title sais it, basically. Anything is welcome. AUs, Time/Dimensional travel, intervention of the fates, I don't care so long as Peter is a good guy for once.


** Pretty sure that this is abandoned, but Peter is a good guy in this fic and actually dresses down James and Sirius for being quick to judge a incognito Harry.

** Sacrafices arc series has him as a good guy, but Peter doesn't show up until the third book. The series starts with Saving Connor.
