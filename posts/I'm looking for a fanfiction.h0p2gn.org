So, i'm looking for a harry potter fanfiction that was on archive of our own. I thought i saw it mentioned here on this subreddit a year ago, and i was curious if anyone knew of it and could give me a link to it. Here is what i can remember about it.

The Pollyjuice potion never came off. Hermione was forever a part cat. They couldn't remove every part of her cat side. Harry/hermione and a few other girls throan in there. Its about 150 chapters long, and the username of the person who made it has the word beard at the end of his username.

​

​

I'm sorry if this isn't enough information to find the fanfic i'm looking for, but i've tried looking for it for a few hours now and no luck.
