Hey guys, I am in the process of rewriting the harry potter series from an o/c characters p.o.v

Said character is a normal fan girl from the future whom is thrown into the HP universe just before Harry's first year. She knows everything and has to make choices that'll effect the future.

I have already decided that I'm gonna try follow the events book for book - but I am for ideas / changes.

I have seen a few headcannons and one shots over the years, which I will add into the story plot. Such as a slytherin hero for the Triwizard Cup instead of Cedric. Things like deaths, relationships etc will change !! (Relationships - will probably effect the outcome of the book, so help in the department is appreciated)

But ultimately i want to create a fanfiction series you will want to read. So please, I beg you - comment an ideas, suggestions or things you'd want to see. Be it conversations, pranks, relationships, events, lessons - go wild.

Even better if you can add detail (what school yea it occurs etc) although I may not necessarily use all of the ideas - as the book still has to be enjoyable and writeable for myself.

(I have posted this into other subreddits for more feedback)

Self Insert / OC stories like this, especially if they rehash canon, hold very little to zero interest to me (and many other potential readers). If you want your story to have any chance to garner popularity you'd have to change the main premise.

If you don't want to do that I'd suggest to change your goals and write for your own personal enjoyment instead of your audience (not that there isn't a niche audience for this kind of fic).

Whatever you decide to do I wish you good luck on your writing journey.

*** I'm really new at the whole fanfiction idea - could you tell me what you mean by the whole premise - I'm guessing I need to to make it more original and not follow the series? I really value your help x

"OC girl/boy (sometimes from America, sometimes a time traveler, sometimes literally the author themselves) somehow finds themselves in Hogwarts, befriending Harry and going on the canon adventures with them"

  and not follow the series

Yeah something original would be nice. Or find an interesting branching off point where the introduction of your new character derails canon events. Don't make me sit through the same Troll in the bathroom encounter, but now there's also Susan McCarthy from America, wielding her special wand inherited from her grandfather with a thunderbird core, saving the day with a well placed tickling charm (PS: She's also incredibly good looking and fun, everyone is just in awe!).

** Try this, it could give you a inspiration. Slog through first chapters until hogwarts. Worth it.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

** I'd say to not make her friends with Harry, or not at the same year as him. (A bit of amnesia could be very nice, so she isn't omnipotent).

Someone that has their own agenda could actually be interesting. (Like, trying to get home?) Maybe prevent her from changing anything, because it will ruin the universe somehow (like give her blinding headaches because she is not really supposed to be there).

She and Hermione could be besties (so Hermione wouldn't be in the bathroom and wouldn't befriend the boys).

Honestly, it's been done tons of times - it would require a lot of work for it to be unique. Sorry :(

** It's important to remember that most students who aren't in Harry's core friend group don't know anything about his adventures except wild rumors and blown out of proportion speculation. If they're in gryffindor they might know a bit more, but that doesn't stop them from trusting in the news or disbelieving that someone their age could do X thing.

Actually, it would be interesting to see if a story could be done with a S.I marshaling Harry's fanclub to be a mini militia built around the idea of protecting Harry and keeping him happy. The S.I would have to keep their knowledge of the future to themselves and work situations as they come, while keeping the fan club out of Harry's business for the most part , because Harry is wary and distrustful of the general public and off put by his fans.

** Following canon is so overdone, I've very little interest in another canon rehash.

SI/OC-insert is fine, if done well. Make sure your character has actual flaws and realistic relationships, not just magically insinuating herself into all the right places. Have the timeline shift around her.

Once your character starts changing things, the events will not play out the same. Think about the possible ripples, whether up-front or in the background. (I personally would take it even farther into AU-land and mix things up from the start, but that's a different discussion.) If you want to show classes, don't just repeat ones we've seen. For instance, if you want to do a potions class, look up one of the other potions on the wiki (or just make up your own) and have them do that, with accompanying unique character interactions.

Make her life difficult. Force her to struggle. Stories where someone just comes in and solves all the problems without any negative repercussions or obstacles is boring to read. It may be fun to write as a power fantasy, but conflict drives stories far better than wish-fulfillment. Give her personal stakes in the goings-on; give her a reason to really care about what's happening so her failures have weight.

I don't personally care about relationships one way or another, but if you do add them DO NOT put any romance in too soon. 11-12 yr olds dating and having adult feelings for each other is extremely off-putting.

Best of luck! I hope my advice/personal thoughts gives you something to consider. I'm currently writing my own version of the whole story as well. It's not an easy route, but I love reading long stories/series fics and believe it'll be worth the time and effort in the end. :)

** Your comment made me laugh !! Thats actually a really good point thank you.

My o/c character was gonna be a girl, who is mediocre at most subjects, but as for the whole adventure thing - whilst i wasnt planning to have her go along with them, it's basically similar to what you said. So I will need to do some changing. I already know how to change the plot of book 3 through to 7 it's just the first two lol.

Thank you for your help ðŸ¤—
