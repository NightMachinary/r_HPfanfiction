I want to read about Potter family but not like Harry goes to gringotts and gets a ring. I want a story that shows us ancient history of house Potter. Traditional but not dark but also not light. Maybe harry's grandfather stood against grindewald? One of sacred 28. Do you have something like that for me?


** linkffn(11933512).

Fairly unique.

  A curious 11-year-old Harry begins acting on the strange and wonderful things he observes in the wizarding world. He might just turn out very differently, and the world with him.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

** I don't think this is exactly what you were looking for, but linkffn(Black Sky by Umei no Mai) has a very outrageous Potter family story in chapter 248 (beginning), so if you can look past the background info characters will be alluding to, it might be a fun little distraction.

**** Yeah, I know. I found it when it was around 60, so it was /way/ easier to start.

If it helps, a lot of the information in especially the earlier chapters can be skimmed over (things like schedules, or, if you don't mind a bit of GoT-style character confusion, family trees).

******** Yes, it's going to get longer. But, at this point, a couple chapters isn't going to be that much of a setback.

The usual update schedule is a week of chapter per day updates and months of waiting in between, so while the first day is a bit difficult, the next (at least) five chapters usually go pretty smoothly. Also, I found it to be pretty memorable.

Sorry if I'm being a bit pushy.

Edit: To be fair to some of the plot decisions, it's a crossover with an anime not known for its logical world-building. Not the married/pregnant at fifteen bit, but some of the things that happened or will happen are just /weird/.

  When you're a Black, you're a Black and nobody gets to hold all the cards except you. Not a Dark Lord with a grudge, not a Headmaster with a prophecy and certainly not the world's most influential Mafia Family... Dorea is as much a Black as a Potter and she is not about to let anybody walk over her! A Fem!Harry story. Slow Build.
