This isn't just exclusive to fanfic writers, it's a problem that even professional writers have.

One of my followed story on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] just updated. It was a 13,000 word chapter, resulting in the story now having over 160,000 words to it, close to the word count of Half-Blood prince.

And.... it's not even halfway through First year yet. To be fair, it did spend a lot of time on preHogwarts Harry, close to 100,000 words by my estimate. And it did it pretty well, which is why I had high hopes for this story.

Now I just realize that this story will probably never be finish. The author will probably be burned-out by the time first year is over. I reckon that a lot writers have the same issue. They might have a good plot outline or general idea of where the story is suppose to go, but writing an efficient story will be difficult.

​

*What are some tips and ideas that will help minimize this sort of thing from happening?*

For me, a lot of dialogues in stories don't really have any purpose. For example, a lot of lines that basically result in Harry just saying hi and having idle chatter with people each morning at his table. They don't contribute to plot advancement or character development, but writers still feel like it needs to be included.


** Well, the fundamental question you should ask yourself is "is this scene necessary?" You brought up the necessity of scenes and exchanges, and I like too look at scenes through that lens. There are three ways that I like to look at to see if a scene is necessary.

1) *The scene progresses the plot*. This is the most obvious one, and the one that the least people struggle with. You can't very well remove plot progression and expect to have a good story. Scenes that contribute to worldbuilding also tend to fall into this category

2) *The scene establishes the characters*. These are something that a lot of people struggle with. This one encompasses a lot of fluff scenes. They aren't important for the plot, but showing your cast in more day-to-day situations helps to keep them established as actual people rather than plot devices.

3) *The scene adds humour*. Not every fic has humour, but I find that adding in the occasional joke can keep the serious scenes from getting too dark, and good humour does help to engage readers. This category shouldn't be overdone, of course, but neglecting it can make a fic feel very heavy.

If a scene doesn't hit at least one of these points, then seriously consider just deleting it. There's no point in having unnecessary exchanges.

That being said, trying to keep things short can be just as much of an issue as drawing things out. When you try and keep things short, you risk making things feel rushed, which can be just as big a problem. It's a delicate balancing act.

*** That's a good reply. To avoid a lack of conciseness in your story you need first to have a good idea of what exactly you envision your story to be in order to properly distinguish which parts are needed and which are not. Sometime we just don't think and write too much.

Honestly, I haven't ever seen a fic as terse as the HP books. Most if not all fics benefit from established world-building and characters to begin with, so we have less of a job in this regard than JK Rowling in this regard but despite that I haven't seen anyone cram as much shit happening in their story under 80k words as the first book for exemple.

**** Funnily enough, I don't really plan much at all. I maybe have a vague idea of what needs to happen in my head, then I just improvise all of the parts in the middle and let the characters write themselves.

*** I like the snowflake method of writing (google it if your interested in the details; it's worth a look). Basically, you iteratively build on your plan for the story, and by only two or three iterations in, you've already got enough information to plot a solid trajectory for a story (or at least a story arc).

  “Books aren't written - they're rewritten. Including your own. It is one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh rewrite hasn't quite done it.”

  --- Michael Crichton
#+end_quote

And you know what's the safest way how to not to rewrite enough? Serialized writing. I cannot believe how anybody can write anything at least reasonably good one chapter a time. Write the bloody thing once, rewrite it seven times, and THEN publish it.

** Edit. Just don't try to do everything at once. Write first, then a couple weeks later come back to it with fresh eyes and a critical mindset, and see what you can cut.

** Don't just trim fat from what you've written, sometimes you need to throw out the overly convoluted chapter you've written and think up a new, simpler way for the necessary plot/character points to happen.

*** Or four or five chapters. See that Crichton's quote above.
