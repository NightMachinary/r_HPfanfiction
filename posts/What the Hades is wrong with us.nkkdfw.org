I always thought Jason Grace and an Brick from Percy Jackson would be the weirdest ship. But no Drapple is a bloody thing. Draco and a bloody apple. What the hell? Can someone explain this to me?

** In Russian HP fandom classical cracship is "Lucius Malfoy and the vases". Yes, ceramic vases. Yes, in plural. It comes from poorly written fic whose name is lost in time, where poorly worded sentence resulted in phrase "And then Lucius fXcked the vases" (which is intended to mean "Lucius fXcking wrecked the vases [in the fit of rage]"). This was screenshot by someone, cropped, reposted and Lucius' infatuation with ceramics became inside joke in Russian HP fanfic community for quite sometime.

** It's a movie thing with Draco enjoying apples on screen (I think it's mainly due to HBP but he may also eat some in GoF?).

Anyways, it may seem weird, but compared to things like Hedwig/ Harry, Hogwarts (the castle)/ Giant Squid, or Harry/ Hogwarts the sentiant castle personnified by a girl (never saw it but I know someone must have written it), it's almost cute.

*** I don't remember the name but I did read one where Harry has sex with both Gringotts and Hogwarts. And has to keep having sex with Gringotts because the stud contract specified giving Gringotts an heir, not a daughter.
