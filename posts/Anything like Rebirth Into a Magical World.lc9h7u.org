I really liked rebirth into a magical world and how it fleshed out the magic system a lot more. I admit the isekai side of it was super fun too. I'm hoping someone has read something like this and can give me recommendations. It can be isekai or just a better magic explanation and world building. this was my first hpfanfic so don't leave out popular ones you think i might've read!

Summary:

“What's best for me and mine, and what's fair for everyone else.” The father of my second life told me to keep those words close. Even back in my first one, I'd been a zero or one hundred kinda girl --- those words defined my life, this time around.

Probably for the best, really. My father's name was Arthur Weasley, and I was born in a universe where the Boy Who Lived wasn't guaranteed to win. Looks like I had to pick up the slack, yeah?
