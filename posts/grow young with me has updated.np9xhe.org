*** Harry has been widowed and is struggling to raise his three children on his own. A quirky muggle lady helps to draw him out of his shell and start to heal, maybe even love again - but it's a bumpy road for them.

I find the summary to be misleading, it sounds more like a soap opera, but if you just read chapter 1, you can get a good idea of whether you'll like Abby.

**** It's a good story and the chapter was interesting, but I'm annoyed that she only updates it once every 6 months (at least that's how it's been for the past 2 years).

***** "Annoyed" is an interesting choice of word. It suggests that the author has done something wrong or failed to meet some obligation, which would really only work if we were paying her. Did you perhaps mean something more like "disappointed" or "frustrated"?

****** Google (that is, Oxford Languages) defines "frustrated" as "feeling or expressing disappointment or annoyance" so I don't see how that's much different from annoyed. Sounds like you just have your own connotations for words that aren't necessarily accurate to their definitions.

******* Frustration is about wanting something and not being able to get/achieve it (eg plans can be frustrated, and so can contracts). So it certainly can be connected to anger, but it doesn't necessarily have to be. I was just offering it as an option.

** I love this story. That chapter had a lot packed into a modest chapter length.
