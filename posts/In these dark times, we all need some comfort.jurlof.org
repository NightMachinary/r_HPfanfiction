This year has been rough. I think that, no matter where you live, we can all agree on that. In light of that, I ask you all if you can share with me your best comfy, feel good story. Something light hearted and low stakes, maybe even something slice of life. The best example would be a story that has almost, if any, conflict and focus whole on acts of whimsy and kindness.

I am not looking for a particular ship, or excluding any, and the only requirement I ask for is that they be relatively complete or still being updated. There is nothing more down heartrending then to really get in to a story, only to find it was abandoned in 2016.

I fear I don't have any stories that truly fit the bill, but the two I can put forward are [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13274956/1/Harry-Potter-Squatter][Harry potter, Squatter]], a light hearted and truly rare cross over that for the most part blends effortlessly the two source materials; and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13230340/1/Harry-Is-A-Dragon-And-That-s-Okay][Harry is a dragon, and that's OK]], which sides steps most of Canons issues by having Harry be unerringly congenial and practically invulnerable.


** Looking for the same thing, so hoping some others will post too. Sadly, the two you mentioned I have read already. Here are some of mine that I think fit the bill:

You probably know this one already, since it is basically a classic of the fandom. Very light hearted and not focused on any conflicts.

Make A Wish by Rorschach's Blot

linkffn(2318355)

I also think this one fits, could maybe call it slice-of-life-ish. Also my favorite fic of the last years.

Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19

linkffn(11111990)

For this one I can't say for certain that it will fit, I have just started it, but so far the first chapters are very fluff-y. Also has the "mild smut" tag, so take that as you will. Thought I'd just include it.

Pink & Blue by Hermione_Stranger

  While patrolling the castle one evening Hermione runs into a certain someone or rather falls over a certain someone. A rather odd someone in fact, who is in need of a little help.

  When Harry offers to help Hermione out by joining her at a quaint family diner, it's no big deal. But when he gets angered by her stupid cousin and decides to fake propose, it is. How far will they go to sustain their facade? And what happens when unwanted feelings start to blossom? This will be a romcom Harmony story. EWE. No Ginny/Ron-bashing. M-rating for smut in ch. 4 and up.

** I don't know how, but the author pulled off this Winnie the Pooh crossover one shot and it's absolutely charming and calming and wonderful.

linkffn(in which snape befriends an old grey donkey)

This is a fic where the Dursleys abandon young Harry in a park and since he has no knowledge of wizards, decides his magic means he isn't human and must actually be a forest elf. He lives his life as such. It's pretty dang adorable. If you like Harry is a Dragon you'll probably enjoy this one. It's complete and there's also a complete sequel.

linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them)

This one is a hilariously written light hearted parody. I've actually read it out loud to my kids, they love it.

  After the Dursleys abandon six year old Harry in a park in Kent, Harry comes to the realization that he is an elf. Not a house elf, though. A forest elf. Never mind wizards vs muggles; Harry has his own thing going on. Character study, pre-Hogwarts, NOT a creature!fic, slightly cracky.

  What if all of Harry's fame immediately went to his head as a child? What if the Malfoys couldn't tell the difference between a smartphone and magic? What if Severus Snape appeared cruel and scheming, but somehow believed he was helping Harry out?
