OK, I was browsing here earlier and I saw a post (sorry I can't remember which one or I'd link it) about Harry being a prodigy chef and this was linked: Linkao3(A pinch of salt, a dash of magic), its really sweet wholesome and the epilogue ends it off nicely.

Seeing these tags in fics like this is so baffling to me. I can kind of understand (though not agree) with turning these characters into villains when you're writing a Slytherin Harry AU and need to replace your villains, but why go out of your way to bash these characters in a fic about cooking?

*** Yeah, but it's a /Harmony/ fic about cooking, and therefore you need to bash them for /reasons./

Edit - Reading it now, and I'm appalled at the idea that fajitas are Mexican. Also: flour tortillas. I suppose it /is/ Britain in the late 80s... but it still makes my brain hurt.

**** I didn't even get to the fajitas after the seafood cooking. That's not how you do any of that. Ugh.

***** I'm fairly sure that the author doesn't actually know how to cook.

I don't really like crab or lobster, so I just shrugged at the lobster decapitation prior to cooking it as I've only done it once. (And really, all I did was boil water and then drop them in... isn't that all you do? I will, however, forever treasure the memory of pulling a lobster out of a garbage bag and hearing my mom screech "is that /alive?!?!?/")

The timing for some of the stuff was also atrocious - who the fuck lets poached eggs sit around for 30 minutes before serving? Here, have some overcooked rubber.

  'Food has a magical quality of its own' so Harry thought. So what might happen when he finds out that magic is real and that hearts and minds can be adjusted by serving the perfect dish?
