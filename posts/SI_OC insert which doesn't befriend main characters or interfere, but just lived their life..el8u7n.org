Would really like to find a fic where someone with knowledge of the HP world is reborn into it, but doesn't go out of their way to solve Harry's problems, such as a muggleborn a few years older than Harry and thus focuses on preparing themselves for the coming war (which to be honest, is likely to happen with or without voldemort, considering the growing tensions in the wizarding community)

​

Edit: I think i should clarify, i don't mean no interaction with canon characters, but i mean a story that follows a character that actually has their own life, without just becoming another add-on to the golden trio etc.

*** My head Canon: He's a self-insert that tries his best not to interfere with the plot. Instead, he's documenting Harry's life and taking his pictures so he has material for his post-war autobiography for The-Man-Who-Conquered and his political and criminal documentary on Harry Potter, the Auror Superstar.

Not involved with Harry and co, but has done some stuff in recent chapters to preemptively work against Voldemort. Whether that works out or not remains to be seen.

** I keep hearing linkffn(What's Her Name In Hufflepuff) is good but I got to ask, what's the appeal in a character that doesn't actively affect the world?

It isn't even a new world to explore which could draw me into an original novel with such a protagonist. I get not befriending or even interacting with the original trio but surely you have to interfere with the world or live a shit life?

I am just asking a reader's opinion btw, not telling you what to enjoy.

*** The story you mention clearly takes place in the same world, at the same time as canon. The story and actually does connect with canon in a peripheral way, just not with the main characters. It's nice to read if you want to explore the world and think about, what would ordinary people be doing? Things do actually happen, there is a story, it's not just OC swanning about watching canon events go on.

Then it's also engaging in its own right. What it definitely is not, is its own self contained novel. It draws on canon to actually make sense. The joy is, it doesn't take ages to 'get good' so you can take a look and decide if you like it very quickly.

*** I like that fic because I enjoy the writing style and character interactions, and the plot is engaging. Besides, she isn't exactly inactive, just perhaps active in a different way than what is usually found in SI fics. I think it's refreshing.

To be fair, she does actually interfere with the plot in What's Her Name In Hufflepuff. At least, she does in the most recent chapters. She went to Little Hangleton (summer after year 1) and replaced all of Tom Riddle Sr.'s bones. Also saves Frank the gardener.

** There's Fish Hooks in the Corner of Their Mouths by deletrear. It's not exactly what you were after seeing as it's placed in the marauder era. It's a SI youngest Black sister. Cousin to Sirius, who is not apart of the story 24/7. SI is not in Gryffindor and author handles the relationship between the Black sisters tremendously well. Marauders are also not a big part of the story - they're more background characters. And despite there being a new character added, events mostly stay the same.

There's a lot of time skips, and it's not a long story, though SI does fight in the war for a chapter or so before another time skip.

Have to warn you though, the story is a little dark. Not really the events, but more the SIs thoughts, as they were going through some mental stuff. Don't let that scare you though, this is one of my favourites and will always be lodged in my heart.

Still not sure if this is what you were after, but it's an SI character that sorta just lives her life with the Black's and it's the best one I've read so far. Good luck x

** I'd strongly recommend linkffn(Accio Butterflies) - it's an SI/OC that's several years older than the Golden Trio and basically ends up running a store in Hogsmeade, IIRC. They do pass useful intel on to the good guys, but other than that mostly try to stay out of things, to varying degrees of success.
