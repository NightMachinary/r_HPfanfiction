**** Yeah. I have a few scripts I can paste in the chrome-console to fix stuff like this. Here are my most used ones:

Remove crossovers in any listing (for examples communities)

#+begin_example
  $(".z-list").filter((a, b) => $(b).text().indexOf('Crossover - ') !== -1).map((a, b) => $(b).remove());
#+end_example

Replace a word

#+begin_example
  var searchFor = "MacGonagle", replaceWith = "McGonagall";
  $(".storytext p").find(":not(iframe)").addBack().contents().filter((i, e) => e.nodeType == 3).map((a, b) => { b.textContent = b.textContent.replace(new RegExp(searchFor, 'g'), replaceWith) });
#+end_example

Just open the developer console with F12, go to the console-tab and paste it there. Of course, to replace a word make sure to actually replace MacGonagle and McGonagall with the right stuff.

Usually the fics aren't worth dealing with it, but I had a good one, and just couldn't bear it after a few minutes. Note that this only works on ffn

I also have one to deal with annoying separators that I can dig out if you want.

But actually as OP was looking for words rather than broader American concepts/themes like guns or Harry having st Mungo's bills to pay (annoying enough), so I was thinking more like sidewalk instead of path/pavement, blocks instead of streets or alleys, candy instead of chocolate, references to downtown and people saying God dammit.

I appreciate people don't always know the British equivalent and although it can irk me I'm not someone who insists authors need to use British spelling (unless you whinge about me using single quotation marks...), but I think people should at least try to remember that the series takes place in the UK.

I don't include spellings for this reason - I'm not going to adapt my writing for the comfort of an American audience, you shouldn't have to for me. We can all learn to adjust.

But when it comes to words and phrases, certain things can be jarring. It's not that your characters have to talk like they're in Downton Abbey, but try to think whether you've ever seen/read anything British where they've said it. You'll gradually learn which words to pick up. It's a good idea to make friends with a Brit who doesn't mind answering your questions or giving your work a quick read through (Hi!)

** "Silent tears"

I have never known tears to make a noise, so one should assume /all/ tears are silent.

Edit: I should also add "silent scream" as well. The sound itself is what makes it a scream. So a silent scream shouldn't exist.

**** But any definition of the word "scream" describes it as the /sound/ So you can't have a silent scream, just like you can't have silent thunder or a silent boom or silent cacophony. All those words describe sounds. If you're talking about the face someone makes when they scream, that could be a grimace probably.

And I believe they do mean silent sobs, which makes me wonder why they don't just say "silent sobs" as it sounds a lot better. Or if they wanted to get adventurous they could write about emotional people who actually make sounds. :P I think a character losing control and emoting loudly has a bigger impact than all this "silent" nonsense.

Edit: "sobbing" is a noise too. Huh. So let's just go with my other idea and nix the whole "silent" thing altogether. :D

"Snape's eyes closed and Harry wondered if the man was going to finally pass out. He carefully climbed back onto the bed and worked to finish healing all the wounds. Once done, he checked on the man, realizing he was breathing evenly."

It is all over in the fic [[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=10818&chapter=21][Secrets]] by Vorabiza and is what makes me hate that fic even though it is really popular with Drarry fans.

Similarly, using too many descriptors in place of people's names or pronouns - like "she couldn't take her eyes off of the raven haired boy." I guess it is considered good writing to have descriptions, but everyone knows what Harry looks like, so it just makes me cringe when I read it.

Though it has fallen out of practice in modern writing because most people prefer a snappier read, which epithets crush rather adroitly. I understand why you might get frustrated or turned off by it.

To echo [[/u/SilverCookieDust]], I don't agree with this---well, not completely. You can tell when somebody uses epithets well---and sparingly---that it is a well read author. But often, it's very probably somebody who read other fanfiction and after reading "green orbed boy" decided that it is an awesome thing and like many authors before wrote "something like this, but /more/".

I once nope'd out of story, which was written like this:

#+begin_quote
  Certain bushy-haired girl smiled at her best friends, smallish green eyed boy and tall, gangly redhead. The green eyed boy with messy hair said: "You're one of a kind, Hermione".

  The buck-toothed girl replied: "Thank you, Harry."

  "Lay off, mate", said the tall redhead feeling his ears heat up at this.

*** I don't use magical cores; the whole concept is silly. But I do see magic as being a finite "biological" resource, like glucose or oxygen. Under normal conditions, if you're healthy, you don't have to worry about running out of any of them, but if you do the magical equivalent of running a marathon (whatever that might be), you're going to be pretty exhausted. Basically, there have to be /some/ limits, or it breaks the story.

This is what I don't get. There /are/ limits, without exhaustion or cores. Knowledge, Wisdom and Skill are the limits of magic. The mind sets the limits. Dumbledore isn't so powerful because of his magical muscle being super-strong or his core super-big. Dumbledore is so powerful because he delved into the depths of magic and has an understanding of concepts that most of the magical world finds utterly incomprehensible. Its not your magical stamina or your manapool that sets the limits, its the capacity of your intelligence, of your creativity and your dedication to learning and growing.

That has always been the greatest about Harry Potter. It wasn't some magical system that kept the limits, it was only the characters and their minds. In HP, in theory, the limit of magic is infinite and in practice it is as limited as you let yourself be. In theory, everybody could be a Dumbledore.

And wasn't that just the greatest message Rowling was sending there?

***** That's a bit silly. McGonagall clearly had the knowledge, wisdom, and skill to make 32 giant chess golems in first year that acted independently and with some permanence. The board even created more between games, the pieces lasted for years, and they couldn't simply be hit with a finite.

If it wasn't mentally or physically debilitating to do so, she could simply transfigure endless amounts of them, only pausing to eat or sleep. There could've been potentially thousands of the things following the lead of the Hogwarts' suits of armor during the final battle if she'd given herself enough time to prepare.

Rowling left things open-ended enough that having factors like a finite 'pool' of 'mana' or tying that into one's physical state is only sensible. It's certainly the most obvious solution without introducing new elements.

But... you are introducing new elements. That's literally what you do. You introduce a manapool to the lore instead of trying to figure out some way to explain things /without/ introducing something new.

Yes, Rowling did leave things open ended. Which is a great thing, giving us fanfiction authors all the freedom we want to write and do whatever. It frustrates me greatly that so many authors then go ahead and introduce a video-game mechanic. Tying the magic of Harry Potter to a stamina/manapool mechanic defies the message of the books, which is why I despise them so.

Time is another constraint.

(In a tabletop roleplaying game I play, GURPS, time is the primary factor limiting magic items -- you can cast a spell ten times in a row and repeat that every hour, but if you want a magic staff to replicate the same spell, it's three years in the making. I think they took balance a little too far...)

For the chess set, it didn't take more than two months of dedicated effort to produce it -- she might have spent the summer hols on the project. McGonagall might not have started preparing in earnest until 1995, and Hogwarts fell in, what, 1997? That left two summers of dedicated preparation. She could at least have generated 64 animated statues, I'd think. But if there were other preparations she wanted to accomplish, ones that were perhaps more effective, then it might have been unreasonable for her to complete those and the statues both.

Yes. We even saw it when Dumbledore fought Voldemort. It was only Dumbledore's superior /use/ of magic that won the duel, not his inherent or trained up power with which he outlasted Voldemort.

It also didn't take Harry physical strength to hold the Priori Incantatem, but Will.

I do concede, however, that in one way both parties can eventually be exhausted. Magic certainly takes focus. We all know that doing something for a long time lets focus slip. I can only guess that wand movements, incantations spoken or thought,... become off with time due to the casters mind having exhausted itself.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Why aren't there more Stephen Hawkings? Because it's damn hard to wrap your mind around concepts of such abstractness /and/ make use of them. I'm thinking in a population around the 15.000, which is an often used estimate based on the numbers we get to see, having 2 geniuses, Dumbledore and Voldemort, is a very good average for a nation.

And we also know, because it is told to us, that just a league beneath those two goliaths, we have a wide variety of wizards and witches who count as above average, or even masterful in their skill. Minerva McGonagall, Bellatrix Lestrange, Flitwick, Snape, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, Kingsley, Moody,........ Why aren't there more of them? I think there are enough.

But I will give you that: We are only told they are skillfull witches and wizards, but never really see it. However, this is a general shortcoming of Rowling's writing and I always chose to interpret canon in the light of Rowling's tendencies, shortcomings and strengths and not just latch onto some perceived hole in the lore steming from an authors focus.

******* I definitely agree with your points, but I still think there are some inherent differences in magical strength from person to person. I don't think two people each using a banishing charm on a ball will produce identical results. However, there are definitely some exceptions. An Avada Kedavra used by a Death Eater will produce the same results as one from Voldemort himself.

I would argue that there are more Hawkings but they aren't as well known. This is also assuming some or all factors of intelligence are not genetic. It is possible that more magical goliaths exist but are not involved in the story.

Also, although I don't think there's any way to directly compare the above-average population, there must be another factor to put a younger witch i.e. Tonks on the same level as McGonagall, who clearly has the experience advantage.

Well, by this logic, most people /can't/ be Dumbledore for the same reason most people can't be Stephen Hawking: most people don't have that level of native talent or intelligence. I actually don't have a problem with that as long as Dumbledore's power level (for lack of a better term) is more along the lines of Usain Bolt or Stephen Hawking than it is Superman or Professor X.

I'll note that we do get one clue from canon, where Fake!Moody is describing the Unforgivable Curses:

#+begin_quote
  "/Avada Kedavra's/ a curse that needs a powerful bit of magic behind it--you could all get your wands out now and point them at me and say the words, and I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed."
#+end_quote

Taken literally, this would suggest that one Death Eater is more powerful than an entire classroom full of fourth years (assuming Barty isn't lying). I suspect the real reason is more along the lines of "You have to mean it." But it does still suggest that magical power levels are a thing, since the students didn't see anything wrong with that statement.

My headcanon is probably closer to HPMOR, where more powerful spells are indeed "smarter" and more efficient, but spamcasting any spell for long enough will tire you out.

Dear Lord that sentence made me cringe. Thats the same mindset that lets movies about videogames become shit.

Other media means other rules. Ressource Pools in videogames are interesting and exciting because you engage in a competition that includes the management of said ressource in real time, with real counters and as of yet undecided outcomes.

As long as the author doesn't include an actual counter, any number and any status of a core you read is a completely arbitrary number that only serves to build some cheap tension. There is no inherent excitement in the matching of two energy pools in the media of text and prosa. None. Magical Cores are a cheap out, as they let someone simply state "Dueler A's core is depleted. Now Dueler B has the upper hand." - or you get the infamous Anime-galore scene in which Harry has his core deplete and through +the power of friendship found in the Guild of FairyTail+ some herculean effort and maybe some screaming he overcomes the enemy anyway, because of course he does. It gets authors out of the precarious situation to actually think of how a character would have to out-think an opponent by creativity, intelligence and tactics.

Also, if that is different in Dodging Prison, then that's nice for the fic. I never understood what the fuzz was about with that fic. I only remember that he, a 20 year old (?) thinks about stealing the eight year old girlfriend of his brother. Yeah... that was the point I kinda noped outta there.

** "One", as in "one Harry James Potter" (the middle name thing, also annoying) or "one Hermione Granger". When used properly, it's pretentious enough - but people keep misusing it, or even worse, adding "the" in front of "one", which is just wrong. Just use the characters' names like a good narrator and stop trying to sparkle.

Also, not a big fan of "Griphook". Unless its being lampooned fucking MASTERFULLY, the whole "I remembered a goblin's name and now we're BFFs" thing that that name heralds makes me want to stab.

Other irritants have already been mentioned, but I'd like to make special note of (1) uncreative adjective use ("greasy" Snape, "smirking" Draco, etc.) and (2) the dumbass nicknames, like calling Snape "Snivellus" (or worse, "Snivellous"... where'd you get that "o"?), and childish variations on Voldemort. It's not brash, cheeky, funny, or even confrontational... honestly, I'd get more of a laugh seeing Harry call someone a cunt... picture it...

/"Potter, detention! Just like your father!" Snivelliousity Snape spat, his greasy hair dripping greasy sweat down his greasy hooked nose./

/His fierce jade eyes glowing with untold power, one Harry James Potter, Heir of Myrrdin, met the greasy black eyes of his perpetual tormentor, and cocked his messy-haired dome to one side, "Snape," he sighed defeatedly, "why do you have to be SUCH a cunt?"/

*** From [[http://fanlore.org/wiki/Anime][Fanlore article on Anime]]:

#+begin_quote
  Anime sources often have a distinct aesthetic, and set of signifiers that are, literally, foreign to English-language media. In comedy anime, for example, a large sweat drop may appear on a character to signify not that they are sweating, but that they are uncomfortable or embarrassed. Anime fans are proficient in reading these symbols, but this may be a barrier to understanding for those new to the medium.

** I completely agree with OP with <insert colour> orbs. Crimson orbs, emerald orbs, sapphire orbs etc. Then there's ridiculous colours eg.cerulean, a colour I think only exists in fanfiction. Cringey curse words are a pet peeve too. But by far the worst is epithets, particularly when trying to avoid shared pronouns, for example:

#+begin_quote
  The older man looked into the younger man's cerulean orbs and cried 'oh my goddesses'.

*** 'fraid to disappoint you, but [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerulean][cerulean]] is absoutely a thing outside of fanfic. Crayola even have a crayon in that colour; it's probably my favourite shade of blue (though I would never use it to describe eyes, just to reassure).

** It's mostly just (what I assume are) british sayings/customs that can gnaw at me sometimes. These may be canon, or may be little0bird-isms because I've read their work so much.

"Merlin's holey Y-fronts" - this needs to go and never be said again.

saying "mo" instead of moment

"Father Christmas"

"Happy Christmas"

"Beatific(ly)"

Also just the weird usage of please throughout the books, I can't give you an exact quote because that would take some effort, but what I can remember is something to the effect of Hermione being called on and and beginning her question with "Please Sir/Miss/Professor......." but she wasn't requesting anything.

And the last thing would be the prevalence of sleeping in night gounds. Like as far as I know according to my personal experience night gounds are specifically reserved for people over the age of 60 and insane asylum patients.

*** Do you mean nightgowns? I don't think they're that uncommon, though younger women probably do pajama pants and tops more. But I'm reasonably sure I know women in their thirties and forties who sleep in nightgowns.
