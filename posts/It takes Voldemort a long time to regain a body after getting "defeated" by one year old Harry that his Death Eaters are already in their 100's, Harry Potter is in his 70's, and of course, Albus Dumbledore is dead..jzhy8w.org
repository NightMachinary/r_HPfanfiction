Edit 1: *One reply that I really liked but sadly didn't get many upvotes was this:*

#+begin_quote
  You actually raise a good point that i didn't think about. Voldemort would essentially be starting from scratch and so would Harry. No Death Eaters and no Order. Voldemort would also be weaker after 70 years and Harry would be somewhat stronger (although not as experienced and battle wise as he was in canon). They'd be almost equal. It'd be a race to gather allies and train to become more powerful before the other guy beats you to it.

  Which I honestly really like the idea of. In canon it's all about Harry having to get better in time to face an already powerful foe. By making it a race instead of a catch up, I feel like it's more intense and open to all kinds of twists and turns as they try to outmaneuver each other.
#+end_quote

Edit 2: Based on the majority of replies to this post, which were debates on whether this Harry would be ready to face Voldemort since he didn't go through the hardships he had in canon, I think this is one of the *rare* times that I would like to see a "manipulative" Dumbledore, whose reasons for manipulating Harry are to prepare him for the threat of Voldemort no matter how far in the future the Dark Lord would return. Remember that this Dumbledore wouldn't die in Harry's 6th year so he still has time to set things up. This could be a chance to redeem the manipulative Dumbledore trope.

/(I hate manipulative Dumbledore stories because they make him have odd decisions like stealing Harry's money, commanding Ron and Hermione to spy on Harry, and allowing Molly to douse the boy with love potions so that he would fall in love with Ginny. I honestly don't get how all of these things are for Harry's benefit. So none of these, please!)/

Edit 3: /Manipulative/ might have been a poor word choice; what we need is a good, *master planner* Dumbledore.


** Couldn't this be better for Voldemort? I mean his biggest rival is dead. Prophecy boy is getting on in years. Though I suppose Harry could still be in fighting shape depending on how his life has gone.

Sure his army is mostly gone, but he can build a new one. He did it once before and many people may have forgotten how dangerous he is or how vile his ideology is. It could be a fresh start.

So Harry still goes and lives with the Dursley's until 11, goes to Hogwarts and has a relatively normal school life revolving solely around quidditch as he doesn't have his yearly mystery to solve. Maybe Lupin sparks the interest in Defense. But a big driving force for Harry's original thoughts of becoming an Auror is the knowledge that he needs training to survive Voldemort.

Quirrel would be a regular teacher and the stone wouldn't go to Hogwarts because Dumbledore wouldn't hear rumours of voldemort in Albania. Second year happens as per canon, as does third, but fourth year is different, Harry isn't a triwizard champion and Moody is actually Moody. Fifth year the order of the Phoenix doesn't regroup as voldemort isn't back, Harry doesn't need to get the prophecy and Sirius doesn't die. Sixth year harry doesn't have to get horcruxes and dumbledore doesn't die, as he sees no need to get the ring if voldemort isn't coming back. Harry has a seventh year and life goes on. Dumbledore dies of old age or some such and harry has a family.

**** Hard to say on being an Auror, it's not like he ever expressed much interest in any other career, guess he could be a pro quidditch player.

1st year the big change is that he and Ron never befriend Hermione, without the troll fight there's just no way it happens. To Hermione Ron's the guy who made her miss the Halloween feast to cry in a toilet, Harry's Ron's famous best friend who apparently plays that ridiculous sport the school loves so much, and to Ron and Harry Hermione is just that bossy know it all girl who's obsessed with rules and homework and other boring stuff.

2nd year is either really close to canon, or really uneventful. Either Malfoy just doesn't decide to unleash the diary (though nothing has changed here to cause that) or he does and Riddle is still somehow stopped before he returns because that's the premise. Perhaps Harry follows the voice to the bathroom or something, since Hermione certainly isn't involved.

3rd year is sort of similar, except Harry keeps his firebolt (no way is he showing it to Hermione and she's unlikely to know that it's anything but a normal gift from someone he knows), the end is certainly different given that there's no time turner, not much could save Buckbeak, but Sirius could go either way, either he's kissed because noone saves him, or Dumbledore arranges his escape some other way.

4th year probably bares no resemblance to canon.

In 5th year there's no Umbridge or DA, without the whole Voldemort thing there's no reason for Fudge to turn against two of the most popular people in the nation, and even if he personally disliked them, they're not saying anything controversial.

From that point on it's just an uneventful education and career.

Harry never does any teaching or has any reason to push himself in DADA

Without the pressure of Voldemort, would he have trained as hard at defense? Would he have wanted to become an Auror? The Elder Wand will likely be buried with Dumbledore so, either powerless or up for grabs depending on author's choice.

Honesty, I think without Voldemort, Harry won't grow up to be particularly powerful or talented in things beyond quidditch. He never struck me as a great wizard. Honestly, I think Hermonie has more raw potential than him solely because she applies herself to magic.

******* I'd make the argument that Harry's Hogwarts education is stunted by his poor muggle upbringing more than anything.

Both his parents were academically gifted students; Lilly is described as being the smartest witch her age, and James was able to become an Animagus as a teenager and left a very high impression on McGonnagal.

Harry is likely very smart, but never got a chance to outshine Dudley growing up, so is not very studious (which is why Hermione always has to bug him to study). Quidditch is the first thing he's ever really been good at, so of course he clings to the sport over anything else.

******* Hermione and Ron are really bad friends for Harry to have if he wants to academically succeed. Ron is a lazy ass with an inferiority complex and a jealous streak 3 miles wide and twice as deep. He encourages Harry to slack off and gets jealous every time he succeeds or "gets" something Ron feels he doesn't deserve. Ron being Harry's first friend meant that Harry wasted years taking Divination and CoMC when he could have been taking classes with more practical applications.

Hermione, on the other hand, is a rabid perfectionist with a terrifyingly deep devotion and loyalty to authority despite learning, from the jump, that the authorities will not protect her. She can't stand being wrong, but will immediately roll over if (and only if) the person telling her off is a teacher. We literally see what happens when Harry starts outperforming her in HBP: she becomes resentful and starts sniping at him.

Harry's friends literally make sure he can't succeed, either by dragging him down or shoving him under if he starts to show competence.

Harry had been living with rampant abuse his entire life, and was probably punished if he outperformed Dudley at /anything/. What he needed to succeed was basically the opposite of Hogwarts and his friends: a supportive environment and real encouragement to succeed, not just to be punished for his failures.

But the part about his scar being a rune is not supported by any canon and has only come up in a handful of fanfics, so I wouldn't even call it established enough to be fanon.

***** Harry has more magical potential than people give him credit for, his patronus in third year and defeat of Voldemort in the battle of wills in fourth year is testament to that. Moreover, he did get reasonably good owl grades, the books just never focused on his academic performance. According to how the question is framed, the events of second and third year happen as in cannon and the events of first and fourth years could still happen, just that Voldemort is not successful in returning. The events of sixth year may still happen as Dumbledore may not die but tell Harry about the prophecy and horcruxes. Considering all this, the situation I see playing out is that all horcruxes are destroyed and harry goes to kill Voldemort in a suicide mission.

I think it is highly likely that Harry would still have been an auror, probably more prepared. It all depends whether or not Albus discovered the Horcruxes and was able to pass on the knowledge. It is likely he would still have died from being cursed by the ring ...

** Thoughts:

1. Would Voldemort even still be relevant to wizards and witches at this point in time?

2. I presume his hardcore supporters have already died in Azkaban. The likes of Lucius Malfoy might still be active in politics and maybe wouldn't want to be associated with a dark lord if they've already built a good life for themselves.

3. Harry can be whatever he was supposed to be if a dark lord wasn't messing up with his school life.

4. Funny thought for a Manipulative Dumbledore story: maybe that's why he was being manipulative, so that the problem of Voldemort could be fixed within his lifetime instead of getting passed to future generations.

5. Another idea: Voldemort got stronger and crazier through the years, turning into a malevolent spirit. He doesn't regain a body but he doesn't need one anymore. When he finally has enough power to manifest, nobody really recognizes him as Voldemort anymore. Instead, they treat him as a new entity. He becomes another person's problem and Harry just gets tangentially mentioned. And then it turns out that this person was trained by Harry and the "power he knows not" is mentoring.

6. Yet another idea, where Dumbledore is slowly descending into madness from paranoia waiting for Voldemort to appear and dementia brought about by old age. He doesn't die in Harry's 6th year.

/Harry resented Dumbledore for preparing him for a threat that would probably never come. The old man claimed Harry as an apprentice after his graduation from Hogwarts. Sure, he got training in Transfiguration, Occlumency, Legilimency, Alchemy, Dueling & arcane magics from THE Albus Dumbledore, who retired as Headmaster and resigned from all his other positions just to focus on Harry./

/So why was he being such an ungrateful protégé?/

/Oh, Harry understood Dumbledore's reasons. There was the prophecy. There were the Death Eaters who terrorized the masses from time to time with their Muggle baiting reunions, which started during the Quidditch World Cup back in Harry's summer before 4th year. Lucius Malfoy continued to influence Cornelius Fudge then the succeeding ministers of magic./

/But the years went by and there was no sign of Voldemort ever making a move. The Dark Lord became a thing of the past, his nickname "You-Know-Who" relegated to the annals of history. Young scholars were even starting to spell out his chosen name "Voldemort." The Wizarding World was somehow able to move on but Harry felt like he was stuck in the past because of an old man who couldn't let go./

/As Dumbledore aged, Harry questioned his mentor's decisions more and more. The last Potter wondered what his life would have been like if Dumbledore had just let him be and not forced him into this mold. What was he really good at? Would he have become a professional Quidditch player? An Auror? Something else? While Harry was better than his peers in the subjects Albus taught him, he was never going to reach Dumbledore's level of genius at those things. It was the difference of a natural genius and a hard worker. The old man's dementia addled eyes couldn't hide their disappointment in Harry for not living up to his impossibly high standards./

/Still, Harry could not bring himself to completely leave the old man no matter how frustrated he was with his lot in life. When the former Headmaster reached his twilight years and could no longer teach anything, Harry applied for the post of Transfiguration professor in Hogwarts and got accepted. He took Albus with him to Hogsmeade and set the old wizard up to live with his brother Aberforth. Harry went home to the Hog's Head daily until Albus died./

/When Albus Dumbledore died and still no Voldemort appeared, Harry felt like a puppet that had its strings cut. What was he going to do with the rest of his life? Would he continue to teach Transfiguration? Or would he finally get to live, to discover who he really was?/

This Harry can disappear, change his name, go on a world adventure, marry and settle down or remain in Hogwarts as Transfiguration professor until he is 70 and Voldemort finally returns.

** can't recall the title or author off-hand, but for some reason this reminded me of a Wheel of Time crossover. where Voldemort is the original Dark One. and Harry is the Dragon Reborn, and has memories of both Lewis Therin and Rand Al'Thor in his head, and winds up recruiting Grindewald, who winds up playing the role of Mazrim Taim (not an actual incarnation, just the same role). also has Bellatrix as a reincarnation of Aviendha.

has using The One Power and Magical be inimical to one another, only able to use one or the other. and the bulk of Harry's recruits as rather bitter Squibs.
