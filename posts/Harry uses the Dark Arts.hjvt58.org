LF a fanfic where Harry uses Dark Magic and the Dark Arts but ISN'T a Dark Wizard.


** He used dark arts in the book 7: he used imperio pretty regularly and one time he used crucio.

** By my understanding dark arts is just the British name for magic whose practice is outlawed (even though books of DM being banned is not completely out of reality considering what we see of the ministry it was also never outright said in cannon, so it's completely possible that it's legal to learn about it), and because of this Dark Wizards/Witches are only their word for criminals who use this kind of magic (to separate from others like Mundungus Fletcher).

** I think we must first define Dark Magic, is it just by Ministry definition? All magic that causes harm? A specific list of spells that require hate to power it? Blood Magic? Rituals?

I just think people blanket calling anything that's not a stunner as Dark Magic, and 'Harry can't be Dark' incredibly diminishes the story scope.

I think like Revan, it all depends on intent.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

** It depends on your definition of Dark Magic. For me Dark Magic is horrible and disgusting and everybody who uses it is the Dark Wizard and deserves anything which comes his way.
