I know some of you will cry of disgust, but tell me: what are the best Hermione/Harry match fiction that you ever read? Something as canon as possible, as realistic to the books as possible! Ideally, a long fanfic, which takes the time to put everything together so that the romance is well-led and credible!


** I compiled two big lists of Harmony recs a while ago:

For multi chapters click [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juV1sSMBpPdab-FgoAntz4XxOOg8gpM5nL-GZlrjrHo/edit?usp=sharing][*here*]]. For one shots/short stories click [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/11EkWs8qXJPU_if2D2Cn9yRnCAjqUsf5p-lE_Y_GXUIc/edit?usp=sharing][*here*]].

Check them out maybe you'll find something for you in there.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift) is a recent fic that starts with Hermione taking Harry, instead of Cormac, to the Slug Club. It treats Ron and Ginny respectfully and keeps involving them as usual, even gives Ron/Lavender a real go.

  We all know that Hermione went to Slughorn's party with Cormac McLaggen to make Ron jealous. But what if she didn't? What if she came to her senses in time and invited Harry instead? As friends of course.

** To me there is one that stands head and shoulders above the rest - Vox Corporis. It was written before DH was released, or at least started back then, so a lot of the later canon isn't included (no Horcruxes, no Hallows, etc.)

It has almost no action (i think 2 chapters have fight scenes, out of maybe 60-70), but DAMN is it a realistic and touching story. Starts after the Graveyard and runs to the end of 5th year, if memory serves.

Someone recently reposted the whole thing on FFN.

***** I am not much a H/HR shipper anymore (you'll find that those fanfics attract a lot of really irritating tropes) but Vox Corporis remains the best fanfic I've ever read in regards to realistic dialogue, relationship progression, and just general immersive writing. So glad you like it too!!!

  I DO NOT OWN THIS STORY. This story was removed due to some reasons and its one of my favourite stories. So i thought i should share with everyone. One chapter a day Reposted. Summary-Following the events of the Goblet of Fire, Harry spends the summer with the Grangers, his relationship with Hermione deepens, and he and Hermione become Animagi. H/HR

** On your request as canon as possible is a little tough and pretty subjective. If you mean as canon as the first 4 books (and maybe the 5th) that's pretty easy as I always saw a romance building between Harry and Hermione. I was thrown for a loop when the 6th and 7th books put Harry with ginny and hermione with Ron as I couldn't see either of those couples making it.

It might be easier to point you to authors who have a few good Harry/Hermione stories rather than individual stories.

So pretty much anything from

Broomstick flyer and her husband merlinsapprentice

Bobmin / bobmin356

Canoncansodoff

RobSt

Rorschach's Blot

Harry50

Hermantumbleweed

Ares.Granger

Mathiasgranger

If you like Broomstick Flyer's stories then check out the authors she likes and the stories she likes and you'll get a ton more stories to investigate/read. (Doing that with the authors I like is how I built up my "collection").

So this should keep you busy reading for awhile.

** its hard to name "the best Fic", as in my opinion the best fic would correct Book 6 and 7. I havent found something like that, but instead fics that have good Post-War progress. chemprofs "Notebooks and Letters" is, as far as i know, the only fic that i like and covers the Canon from Book 5 onwards, with some drastic changes as it tells the "Real" Story, about what happened.

â€‹

" *Harry Potter and the Resurrection Movement* " is a Post-epilogue Fanfic series by CPO Backstreet. Said fic is the first part of currently 7 (when i found it, there were 5). I havent read all of them, just the first 4 so far, but they are good
