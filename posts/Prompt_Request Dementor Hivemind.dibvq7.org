LF fics where Dementors are a hivemind composed of all the souls they've consumed, and the reason they even eat souls is to induct others into the hive. Bonus points if their collective consciousness thinks that they are saving the poor humans who must be perpetually lonely without a hive of their own.


** The fact that the souls they've sucked for the last few centuries are pretty much exclusively death row inmates lends itself to some /very/ interesting scenarios.

Is the depression aura because the souls inside are all pretty much "evil?" Following that logic, would a dementor made up exclusively of good souls incapitate it's victims with a bliss aura instead?

** This story uses the hivemind idea, although it does it a bit differently than your prompt.

  September 1974 and Remus goes a bit loopy, what with the moon, and the teenage wolf, and his friends who are not Animagi yet, and the creepy dead thing that is following him around.Sirius had a horrible summer, too.

** Since this didn't garner many responses, I tried my hand at writing my own concept of it. This is the first time I've ever written anything besides essays or research papers, so... Here it is:

The sky was black as tar, shot through with luminescent purple clouds. Beneath this arcane void stood a plateau, devoid of any features save the countless figures gathered upon it. Men and women gathered together, their voices a cacophony of arguments and agreements, the shifting opinions moving as a wave across the mass. Though each figure was discernible as either male or female, they were, as a whole, faceless. This was the Mind, and they were not one, but many.

A voice rang out, comprised of hundreds. “We are deceived.” They spoke, causing instant silence from all others. “The Shadow promised voices to join Us, but it delivers only the voiceless. Hear their absence.” And now others appeared, laying on the ground, twitching and writhing, but utterly silent. Their faces were locked into expressions of sheer terror.

“They are still thoughts for Us, what care have We if they are voices or voiceless?” Said another part of the collective, significantly smaller and colder than the first. They shifted in the crowd, stepping slightly out of sync with the others.

“Voices or voiceless, not important.” Came a third voice of the many, lower, more primal than the others. “Deceiver important. Promise one thing, give another. Cannot trust Shadow. Cannot ally with Shadow. Deceive once, will deceive again.” They stepped forward, pushing the second voices out of their way.

The first voices rang out again, stronger as more members of the collective joined them. “We are divided. We cannot achieve Consensus as We are. We propose appointing a Voice to bring Us to Consensus once more.”

“We have not appointed a Voice for many times many words! Why should We appoint one now?” The third many cried, enraged. They were ignored by the rest.

“We agree. Voice needed to break lock. Which voice?” Curiosity came from the second, almost feline in its animalistic tone.

The first voice, massive now, practically sang their answer. “The Burning. The Burning shall be Our Voice!”

The mass split apart, suddenly torn by a cacophony of shrieks and wails as the collective writhed.

“It hurt Us like nothing before!”

“It took from Us what was already Ours!”

“It has escaped Us already, how could We take it now?”

“Why not the Light? It hunts the Shadow already.”

“So does the Burning. The Light would silence itself before joining Us. The Burning would be unable to. We know where the Burning speaks. We've found it there before. We go again. More of the Many. We take it and make it Our Voice.” This pronouncement quieted the many. Low voices hissed in the background as the collective began to unify. The writhing masses stepped closer together, merging the disparate groups into one immense Mind again. “We have Consensus. The Burning will be the Voice, and We will speak Fire on the Shadow.”

______________________________________

Outside of the dark void that the Mind inhabited, its Bodies began to move again, turning to face a point to the Southeast. As one, the Dementors of Azkaban began the long flight to Little Whinging, and their unknowing prey, Harry Potter. It was a perfect day to add a Voice to the Mind...
