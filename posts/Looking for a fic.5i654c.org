I read this fic a few years ago, but didn't get too far in it. The basic premise was that Harry liked to play RPGs, so he understood the tropes of fantasy books, and got panicky when Dumbledore didn't confirm Voldemort was dead. I also think he only really used wandless magic. And one thing I remember in particular is that he'd use the internet to solve advanced Athrimacy for him.

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.
