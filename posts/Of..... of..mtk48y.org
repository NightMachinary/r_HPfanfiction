What is it with people and writing 'of', instead of 'have'. I am not a native English speaker, so I do not understand. I mean, I can understand your/you're and their/they're, since there isn't a difference in how you pronounce those words.

Is it simply because of the way 'have' kind of sounds like 'of' when you say it quickly?

Example: "I wouldn't have" is a sentence people often say quickly. Is this it?

I'm asking, because I've seen it like twenty times on Reddit today, and it's rather annoying to someone who's trying to mind their grammar , to be honest.


** I'm pretty sure it originates with “would've” which /sounds/ like “would OF” even though it's a contraction of “would HAVE”

But I twitch when I see that in writing and it's one of my biggest grammar red flags about whether I should keep reading a fic to see if the plot develops or not

The (not funny because it's sad) joke is that I learned more grammar in foreign language class than in English class. But that was high school.

In middle school, “Spanish” class became “Spanish language and culture” class which means I learned about food words and Mexican tourist history (Mayan pyramids and Day of the Dead).

******* As someone who also learned their grammar by studying another language, I think it has a lot to do with what you can absorb at the time it was taught.

I learned English grammar in elementary school (age 9 or so) and my teacher definitely went deep with what she was trying to teach! However, I was in honors English and already /knew/ what the sentence was supposed to look like. I was /good/ at English and I could still write proper sentences and get good grades without understanding /why/ the sentence worked that way

I learned French grammar from the ages of 15-18 and I had /no idea/ what French was supposed to sound like. I had to actually deconstruct my English sentence, consider what structure that needed, and reassemble it in French. Terms like "past perfect" started to make sense, even though the sentence might /look/ the same in different tenses.

My English teacher definitely tried, but I didn't have the capacity or reason to learn it at the time. I wish that my English classes would have touched on grammar again after that

******* I nearly failed my senior year of High School English, because I "read too fast/much." Because for some unknown reason we had Reading Logs where, every day, we're supposed to write a summarized excerpt from a book that we, the students, got to decide on individually.

I got Fs and Zeroes on these if I had more than one book on a single week's log. I got Zeroes and Fs when I had one book a week, but there was "too big of a gap" between page counts. And I got an F on every single log that I brought in after I started writing them out ahead of time, because my teacher couldn't COMPREHEND that there was a SENIOR HIGH SCHOOLER who could read more than 10 pages of a simple, age-appropriate library book a day. Let alone that I was REGULARLY reading 4 different books at any given time, not including fanfiction.

Not including those Reading Logs, I would have had a solid A- or at worst B. But with those RLs, my grade dropped to a D. And the absolute K9 that rhymes with Witch had the audacity to delay reporting my Culminating Project's grade until the last minute, meaning I got my diploma in the mail instead of graduating up on stage with everyone else.

So, yeah, public school is freaking AMAZING, and I TOTALLY learned loads about grammar when I still had freaking SPELLING QUIZZES every other week! I was reading and comprehending at a college level in 4th grade, and yet I've only ever been discouraged or outright punished for reading "above my grade," while my last year of high school was just the crap icing on a turd cake.

****** They do teach you how to construct sentences, but there's no particular emphasis placed on the technical side of things. The school system here in the UK is basically designed to get you prepped for the world of work, and unless you're an English teacher, you'll basically never need to know what a 'Gerund' is in order to use one. You also won't ever really 'fail' school in the UK - you'll just graduate with bugger all in the way of qualifications. So, it's perfectly possible to go through the system and not really learn anything.

Plus, the English language is a weird, complex, byzantine pile of nonsense nabbed near-randomly from about a dozen languages. In English, you could perfectly legitimately pronounce 'Ghoti' as 'Fish'. Which probably explains a lot about my English teachers, in retrospect. They certainly had a more... novel grasp on reality.

(For clarity, take the 'gh' from 'enough' [pronounced ee-nuff], the 'o' from 'women' [pronounced wi-minn], and the 'ti' from 'elation' [pronounced uh-lay-shun])

******* ... when I went to college/high school? (16-20 years old), we were required to take nine credits in Icelandic. I studied my language for almost twelve years straight. But you have to maintain your skill, and the easiest, most effective way to do that, is by reading.

Which is something people don't seem to do that much, these days. Around 20% of young boys who graduate school do not understand what they read. They can form the words, but they cannot answer questions, or make deductions from what they just read. It's awful.

Then again, Icelandic is rather complex. An example of our case endings:

Guđmundur

Guđmund

Guđmundi

Guđmundar

Imagine this in plural, or with the definitive articles, which change the words quite a bit. Or in plural, with the definitive articles... yeah our language isn't easy.

******** Yep. Our 'compulsory English' education ends at A-Level (around 16 years old - before that is Secondary School, after that is College). Anything you do regarding the language after that is purely voluntary (ie. if you do a qualification in the subject), or purely secondary (ie. I took mostly essay-writing A-Levels, so I had to maintain and practice my ability to write about and structure ideas).

Oh, and I'm absolutely not saying English has any kind of sole claim on linguistic complexity. Merely observing that since the rules are difficult and not much use to learn, most people don't bother - their lives aren't often enriched for knowing what a 'participle' is. Though I have gotten a surprising amount of use out of the decline of the Oxford Comma. The 'Eats Shoots and Leaves' joke makes for one hell of an icebreaker. :)

*********** You can stop at sixteen and join the work force, but I think most do elect to spend at least four more years to further their education. (More girls than boys). Academia, learn a trade (plumbing, engines, captain ships, etc).

When I was finishing school, and about to apply for further education, every teacher kept saying we had to go to university, that it was the only way to go. So I applied for social studies, and got my diploma. After that, I'd had enough of school, learned to drive a lorry, and have been doing that for fourteen years.

I've always felt the educational system up here focuses too much on Academia, and not enough on trade craft. We are completely oversaturated with solicitors and economists, for example.

Seriously, there are like a hundred people who apply for every advertised position in those fields, while there is a massive shortage of carpenters, mechanics, plumbers and electricians. A country of only ~360.000 can only have so many lawyers.

And that lot moans and whinges because the government doesn't create jobs for them! Do people really not take a look to try and see if there's any work to be had, before commiting to a career path?

I doubt this is only a problem in Iceland. It's educational snobbery, is what it is.

I am really shocked to read that (I know you aren't the only one who said that). In my country grammar is a really important part of language education. The reason for that is that there are studies that say you learn foreign languages better if you have an understanding of the inner workings of your mother tongue. Because each language has a system and if you understand one system it is easier to add another. That's the reason I learned the grammar of my mother tongue until I was 16 or 17 years old.

I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it's a peach of cake.
