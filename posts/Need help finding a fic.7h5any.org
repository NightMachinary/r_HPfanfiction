I remember it was a oneshot. It begins with one of Harry's sons proclaiming him as the youngest minister of magic. I think he was a raven animagus. He was also dark-ish I think and kinda op. He kills his uncle very early on in the fic by tampering with his car brakes.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
