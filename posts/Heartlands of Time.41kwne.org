I'm sorry if this breaks any of the rules (it doesn't any in the sidebar, are there any more?). I'm just so super excited. HoT just got updated!

** Doesn't break the rules. Joe also updated Unfound Doors. Here's to hoping he's back again!

** I actually hadn't read HoT after finishing Wastelands, simply because I thought HoT was abandoned. So, YAY!

** Does Joe have a blog/twitter or something? I thought he did... but anyway I can only hope that it is going to be finished, because that was my main stopgap for not reading wastelands. Joe is such a good writer who I become addicted too, that if their work isnt finished I freak out... and I dont need that trauma in my life.

*** It said on his FF.net profile that he has a Twitter, but I'm not sure if it's used for fanfic or his original stories.

*** He has a whole website for his professional writing and a twitter. If you have only read his fan fiction I highly recommend you check out his Reminiscent Exile series.
