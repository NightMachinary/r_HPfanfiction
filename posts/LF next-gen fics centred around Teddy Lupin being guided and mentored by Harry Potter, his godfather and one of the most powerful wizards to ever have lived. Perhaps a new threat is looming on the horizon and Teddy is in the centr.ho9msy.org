#+TITLE: LF next-gen fics centred around Teddy Lupin being guided and mentored by Harry Potter, his godfather and one of the most powerful wizards to ever have lived. Perhaps a new threat is looming on the horizon and Teddy is in the centre of it.

** Could be fun. Need a reason for Harry himself contending to only teach Teddy instead of ending the problem though. Don't think he would be okay with playing Dumbledore considering how it went for him.

*** True, I was thinking a prophecy (though I do think something else, more unique would be better but sadly cant think of anything)

**** While the whole prophecy deal has been overdone it does remain a sure way of making the story go the way you want with little to no questions and if done right could be petty neat.

Maybe try combining factors to explain why the prophecy is important? Like, Harry can't fight himself because of sickness/random magic making it so he can't be close to the villain/blood pact/any reason really; the villain being obsessed by prophecy making it so it's validity is irrelevant since they are making it self-fulfilling; or otherwise escalate it to the point the prophecy is too dangerous to try going agains, not necessarily world-ending, though it would also work I guess?
