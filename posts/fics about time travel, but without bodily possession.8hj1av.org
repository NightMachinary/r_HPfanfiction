*** I think the dude(?) is overseas in the military, and said they would update once out of the service, or had some time. They posted on this subreddit.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

  Their plans all worked, but the cost was too high. Voldemort might have died in the long run, but he takes so many people with him that it cannot possibly be considered a 'victory'. So a group of four decide to send themselves back in time to fix it... What could possibly go wrong? Alternate Reality; Time travel; Reincarnated Founders; Harry is Salazar; Canon pairs
