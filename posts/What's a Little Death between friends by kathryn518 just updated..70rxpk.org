**** I feel the same way. It just keeps crawling along building a cast that will never go anywhere. But god damn if I didn't read it right away.

***** And the fact that it is Star Wars bashing just infuriates me. I like Harry Potter, but Star Wars is basically my one true love.

** Well, I'm ecstatic. I greatly enjoy the writing she and plums do. The plot moves slowly, but there's so much character interaction! I love it so much. It makes all the characters feel fleshed out and alive.

** Ugh. Lord Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin? A Goblin Nation that falls over in obeisance at the first sign of politeness? A dominant-in-bed Harry that has Tonks swoon over him when he talks about "taking what he wants from her"? A plot premise straight from /Partially Kissed Hero!?/

Someone, make it stop.
