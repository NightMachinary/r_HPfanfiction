Ron is with Luna and together they raise Harry and Hermione's daughter, as both have died. I remember them being turned into portraits before their death, and that Ron lets everyone (including Luna) believe that he is the real father. I have tried the search function on fanfic.net and haven't been able to find it, thanks for any help.

** You mean people think the kid is Ron and Hermione's but is actually Harry's?
