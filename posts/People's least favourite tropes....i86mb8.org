Just wondering what tropes in HP Fanfiction really grind your bacon. For me, it's when a fic replaces the perfectly good name 'Harry' with something like 'Hadrian' or 'Heverrel' or, god forbid, 'Harveste'.


** Harems. Hate harems. it just kills my suspension of disbelief instantly. I know Harry Potter has a lot of excellent female characters, but harems just don't work. I've been in relationships before and I can tell you from personal experience that the chances of finding a girl who's willing to 'share' is less than your chances of circumnavigating in a rowboat.

Ugh.

*** To be fair they are not "impossible" just unlikely, and of course, fanfics do usually terrible depictions of polyamorous relationships, I've read a lot of harem fics and have only read like 1 or 2 convincing ones

**** That's very true. I don't really have anything against harems exactly, just how poorly they are portrayed in fan fiction.

** Character bashing. I don't mind characters making stupid decisions, I prefer it even, since it makes the story feel more real. Making a character so incredibly stupid, or a completely one-dimensional villain just seems like such cheap writing to me. I've never been able to stand it.

Harry going off on a caps-lock monologue ever other chapter is pretty annoying too.

**** That's fine, since its just a case of an unreliable POV. I'm talking about when writers make Dumbledore over the top evil, or have Molly Weasley some kind of criminal mastermind that birthed Ginny just to steal the Potter fortune. You know, that kind of shit.

** Everybody is trans, everybody is gay. look, I get it, it is a stance, and I really have no ground to stand on as I as an asexual read mostly slash fics but for the sake of a little bit of reality and diversity, not every character on fic has to be non-heteronormative.

** Characters being part creature, animal, etc.

Maybe I just haven't read a good one, but whenever I see [Insert character] as a veela, werewolf, etc. I can't bring myself to read it, even if I'm missing out on something.

*** I usually hate them too, but recently I've been pleasantly surprised by 'The Moon and The Sun' by marinstan - linkao3(61424119)

I don't know why this particular one though - maybe because the creature stuff actually serves the plot and not the other way around (in my experience, more often than not it seems like the author first decides to make the character a creature and then tries to figure out what to do about it - and it annoys me to no end).

Although imo this is definitely not for everyone - not only it's a veela!Draco, but to top it off a pretty heavy-reading Drarry.

** I hate harems so freaking much. Honestly. Harry is not the type of person to have a crap ton of girlfriends! And I hate when Harry's first name is stated to be Hadrian or Harrison, as well, unless there's a reason for it. (I personally like how Harry discovered his name to be Harrison in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Return of Heritage).)

I've also a dislike for evil Dumbledore. Bashing is fine, but Dumbledore isn't inherently evil. I can agree that he's made his fair amount of mistakes, which I'm assuming is due to both his mindset during the war and his old age and his Chessmaster personality, but he's not evil. He may choose to overlook the wellbeing of one to two people for the "Greater Good" but he's not evil.

Not necessarily a trope, but I hate it when they make Ron ridiculously stupid. I can agree that he has no drive and probably expects things to be handed to him due to his older siblings' success, but he does know a fair bit about the wizarding world. I'm pretty neutral on the whole Weasley bashing front. I dislike it when people bash the Weasleys when the author writes that Dumbledore was paying the Weasleys to be friends with Harry and there's a marriage contract between Harry and Ginny and that Ginny/Molly was love potioning Harry. I do like it when there are things that actually make sense for bashing. Such as Ron kicking Harry off the Quidditch team for something stupid because he's jealous and wants to prove himself, or Molly hiding Occlumency books that Snape meant for Harry to have because she thought they were dark and Harry was too young to look at them.

Authors who write Malfoy as stupid and brash and loud is ridiculous, as well. He's supposed to be the epitome of a Slytherin (the bloody hat barely touched his head before sorting him!) and there is no way and hell that he should act like a Gryffindor.

Fem!Harry is something I tend to stay away from, as well as Mpreg. I don't mind if you genderswap sometimes, but I'm not really a fan of it. It just changes things so much. I wouldn't mind reading a Fem!Harry that /doesn't/ ship him with his godfather, Remus, or Severus, and it would be cool if Harry was basically a carbon copy of his mum.

*** I like the goblins as a vicious violent race with a literal cutthroat sense of honor.

The fanfics that have goblin allies as a warrior race of violent greedy bastards are my favorite ones with goblins.

Cannot stand the goblins tripping over themselves to please stuff. What part of mouth full of sharp teeth says house elf!?

In one fanfic Hermione arranges for tutors to show up in Gryffindor. The goblin goes off on investments something along the lines of "a goblin invests their money made through graft, blackmail, robbery, pit fights, kidnapping" and I thought yeah that sounds about right.

Even *Hagrid* says they are "not friendly" as in he cuddled a dragon and kept a giant man eating spider as a pet, thought they were "not friendly".

That should tell you everything you need to know right there.

** ▪︎ Slythein AUTOMATICALLY meaning "Dark" or "Grey" Basically authors using a Sorting into Slytherin (particularly for someone who wasn't a Slytherin originally) as an excuse to make them edgy or gigawank their power/intellect.

▪︎ Another trope I hate, Malfoy being portrayed as a moron. Friendly reminder for all readers/writers, not only is Malfoy a Slytherin but the Hat did not hesitate. According to the expert on the subject, Malfoy is the epitome of a Slytherin, write him as such or accept that Ice Queen Daphne is not inherently better because she keeps her emotions to herself. You can still be cunning and ambitious whilst also being a bit hot headed and emotional (e.g. Lelouch vi Brittania). In the books Draco Malfoy is a child, thus developing into the man he will be for the rest of his life. He's not a bad Slytherin because he's still childish and petty, he's just a child and so should everyone else in his year.

▪︎ Another Draco centred point, fics that try and highlight Malfoy as someone beneath Harry's notice (kinda contradictory but bear with). If, in your story, Harry grew up at the Dursley's (or similar) and is supposed to be similar to his canon persona, Malfoy should infuriate him. He is his rival for a reason, Rowling made Malfoy his absolute polar opposite for that exact reason (and he is a contrasting figure for most of the main cast also). It's not the sign of a bad character that he gets under people's skin, and it's a shame where fics just add him in to pad chapters out and treat him like a gag character instead of a fully developed person.

▪︎Muggle apologists. The idea that Muggles are inherently better than magicals because each side are different. Rowling didn't expand her world enough to explain exactly why certain things are done or what sort of alternatives they have to muggle technology and practices. It's annoying to read snarky lines of text (or even entire paragraphs) where the author has decided it's time to shit on wizards and witches and then do nothing with the concept afterwards. If your not going to at least try and do a both sides comparison AND your story isn't about conflicts between magicals and Muggles, please cut it. Especially if it's not plot relevant.

▪︎Finally, for this comment at least, relationships. Specifically those with in Hogwarts characters below fifth/sixth year. A lot of authors (myself included) forget what it's like to be 11/12 and treat relationships between characters at that age as if they are as mature and solid and secure as relationships between two adults. Relationships can be messy when you have that life experience, but when they are kids entering into their first relationships and they aren't fraught with awkwardness, second guessing etc. It's not particularly realistic and can take me out of a story.

As a sidenote, more fanfics need to have characters getting together and then BREAKING UP. Things don't always work out, people aren't immediately right for one another and it's a perfectly natural, human thing to break up and date other people. You don't just pine for one person for months/years, get them and then live happily ever after.
