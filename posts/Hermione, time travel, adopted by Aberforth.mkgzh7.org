:END:
I remember that Hermione travels back in time shortly after the Battle of Hogwarts and Aberforth agrees to let her pretend to be his daughter who he is no longer in contact with. Albus Dumbledore is suspicious of Hermione, but allows her to participate in the order nonetheless. She has relationships with several deatheaters, and is a part of the lestrange family as well. I remeber that she is close to Kingsley and his family, and he knows her when she eventually travels forward in time at the end of the fic. she also gets to know Dean Thomas' dad who is a mystery in canon.

#+begin_quote
  (Complete) The love of the Minister's life disappeared just before the end of the First Wizarding War. When he finds her again, he can hardly trust his sanity. His first action as the new Minister for Magic is to break at least a dozen international laws to bring her home. Hermione soon finds herself in the early 70s surrounded by future followers of the Dark Lord.

** I don't know the Name of the Fic, but additional details: she had a volatile relationship with Dolohov specifically. The overarching plot point is her relationship with Kingsley. When she „vanished“ back into her timeline, Kingsley was heartbroken. He got a shock when he met her in Grimauld on an order meeting in her timeline for the first time.
