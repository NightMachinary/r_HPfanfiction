I want to read fics where Draco gets Lucius involved after Professor Moody performs illegal transfigurations on him, somehow gets him fired or something like that

*** He definitely has beef with Malfoy. Malfoy "sold out" the Dark Lord by claiming he was under the imperius curse while Barty ended up spending 10+ years in Azkaban (then a couple of years trapped under his fathers imperius curse!) for his crimes/refusal to denounce Voldemort.

Edit linkffn(The Green Girl) has the Malfoys unhappy about the transfiguration but they are aware it's Barty and not Moody who did it. BUT, based on the graveyard scene at the end of the book, this knowledge doesn't seem possible in canon. Sooooo just how scared of Moody was Lucius to not make a gigantic fuss about his only child being transformed into a ferret/bashed against the walls/floor?

*** I don't think shooting spells at someone's back is illegal . It may be a low move but definitely not illegal

**** He's talking about school rules, not laws.

Also I'm pretty sure that attacking someone, front or back, is illegal.

I think the magical equivalent of assault would be illegal.

**** Neither is transfiguring Draco into a ferret. It's against school policy.

** Instead of Malfoy, I mis-read that as "Mario". Read it again to discover my mistake. But... I'm wondering about a Super Mario + HP cross-over story now ... do they exist?
