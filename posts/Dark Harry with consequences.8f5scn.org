I would love to read a harry potter fanfic where all the "good guys" like the Weasleys, Dumbledore, Hermione sirius and remus aren't encouraging harry on his dark magic experiments. Basically I am looking for a fic that doesn't normalize murder. Political assasinations preferred.


** Problem is Dark!Harry authors don't have the balls to write a story like Breaking Bad where it turns out that the guy you rooted for is the bad guy and an irredeemable arsehole who deserves to die. They want to write their edgy little power fantasy, where they get to have slaves and crucio everyone who disagrees, but without the consequences.

I'd be surprised if there's even a single story that fits your request. Sorry that I don't have any, just needed to get this off my chest.

*** Plenty of people cheered for Walter White, even at his worst (I did too, up to where he let Jane die). There were actual campaigns lobbying Vince Gilligan to have Walter win.

My personal estimate is that it's a generational thing. Baby-boomers liked their stories clean-cut: This is the villain, this is the good guy, these are the obstacles he has to overcome, happy ending.

The generations after that don't like their stories that way. Perhaps mirroring the way the world moved - in the late 80's/early 90's there was a brief lull, a period of illusion where everyone felt that things would keep getting better. Later events shattered that illusion.

So yeah, we like our heroes dirty. With a murkier morality, more realistic, more cynical. Some even like them nearly indistinguishable from villains - not my cup of tea, but I understand where they're coming from.

That's what makes it brilliant! You go along for the ride until a point when you have to seriously look into the abyss of yourself and ask yourself "Why did I cheer for this douche?". Incidentally for me that turning point also was him murdering Jane (maybe "let her die" is technically correct, but to me it felt like murder, possibly because of his motives).

I can believe that, but I feel sorry for these people and sort of pity them if they still felt that way after he poisoned a kid. They miss out on, for me, one of the most profound experiences in fiction: Nodding along with the descent until at one point you're horrified and can't really tell when a line has been crossed ("but we are already killing innocent people *right now*, so the actual line was probably crossed long ago"). I was really impressed that they were actually going this route, with consequences and everything.

Not sure about the generational thing, but you're right that murky characters have become more widely popularised. I'm also a sucker for them. But those are very different from Walter White or most of the Dark!Harrys. At least Breaking Bad is self aware, but for some reason the Dark!Harrys still wear their hats proudly: There's this hard to describe vibe that I get, where the narrative actually seems to approve of the protagonist's actions, or worse, takes some sort of perverse pleasure out of them. It creeps me out! On the other end of the spectrum you have Breaking Bad which narrates almost with a cold neutrality (until arguably the very end when it becomes more obvious in judging Walter White: Look at how much misery and death this man created. It certainly never cheers him on, it tricks the audience into doing that instead, because of expectations).

It absolutely felt like murder, but could he have been charged (for that instance anyway)? There was a huge amount of debate online when that episode aired, which I guess proves how good it was. I'm very curious as to how a judge would have ruled, had such a case gone to court - I know some states have bystander laws in effect (i.e you're obligated to help), not sure if New Mexico is one of them.

Ah, that's just author fiat, i.e bad storytelling. I see it pretty much as the equivalent of thousands of Draco/Hermione or Draco/Snape fics, where they abuse her or treat her like dirt but she perseveres in the relationship because "he's a good man inside" or some such nonsense.

*** It is alright. It was a desperate request. It is very tiring to read about Harry who kills everyone, it would be refreshing to read a story where instead of murdering the ministry and the aurors he would be scared of getting caught or even better a murder mystery in the perspective of the murderer.

*** See, I have a totally different problem with Dark!Harry stories - the authors rarely accurately depict the state of mind a man has to be in, in order to take the lives of murders and rapists, without completely breaking down himself. Taking a life weighs on you, and while you may not feel it initially, or even immediately after, once you have some time to come down from the event and the aftermath, it is there. Waiting for you. You remind yourself that it was justified, necessary even, in defense of your life and the lives of others, but the weight is still there. But you put your pants on in the morning and keep going. If it happens again, you keep on going. Some people don't have the mentality to keep it together, and they break down. Some people are able to put the weight down in the morning, go about their day and pick it back up at night. A rare few are able let the weight go completely - and I freely confess to being a little unnerved around them.

Too many authors miss this.

(Notable exceptions are those who actually address the abuse suffered by Harry, or even take it further, not that it is needed - in canon Harry should have already been a socially stunted dysfunctional eleven year old, or for plots sake, a budding sociopath. Either is more likely than the selfless nonsense canon presented)

**** I do not agree with your last tidbit at all.

Millions of people suffer abuse much worse than Harry Potter and do not become budding sociopaths or have stunted growth. Some might, while others become bullies, some nervous and shy wreaks, some motivated to study and escape and more. It's not unbelievable that someone suffering abuse clings to the friends they made and will be willing to do /anything/ for them. In fact, it's probably the most likely scenario. Wouldn't you do anything for the first people to show you affection? People who are desperate for love tend to be incredibly selfless, which leads them to all sorts of problems.

***** I won't disagree with you on the potential scenarios, but rather expand my dysfunctional categorization to include the issues you listed above.

As far as becoming selfless, in my experience, between the dysfunctionality and the history of abuse, even once freed from it, they often become incredibly ~selfish~, having perhaps over-learned the lesson that no one will help them, except themselves. Only once their needs are met, and their resources secured have I seen them become generous.

** Linkffn(Antithesis by Oceanbreeze7)

I honestly can't believe I'm recommending this. This is not excellent by any means, but the way the author has written Adrian (Harry) is honestly nothing short of incredible. The last 3 or 4 chapters have been just flat out on point in terms of character depth and tying up loose ends. The first 100k words are a bit rough and the summary doesn't make it sound all that great, but trust me its worth it. Adrian struggles with his path, struggles with the acts he does. He struggles to choose between Remus as a father figure or Voldemort.

Harry is "Dark" but not edgy, and has a conscience that is always on his heels. Murder is most certainly not normalized, as there have been maybe 3 of them so far? The best part is I honestly don't know what is going to happen, so much is up in the air. Give it a try.

One last thing about Adrian's Character: /I don't like him as a person/. Can I sympathize? Yes. But I don't necessarily enjoy the way he does things. That alone sets this fic apart.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** iirc [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9057950/1/Too-Young-to-Die][Too Young to Die]] is what you're looking for if you can take a bit of bashing, angst and iffy writing. tl;dr Harry's sister dies young and he does some /seriously/ fucked up things trying to resurrect her. It's been a while since I've read it, but I don't remember any other characters patting him on the back for it. Don't recall any political assassinations unfortunately though.
