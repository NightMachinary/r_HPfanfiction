Was just watching /Chamber of Secrets/ and wondered if anyone had written anything similar.

Any/all ships allowed. I am mainly looking for a good quality, well-written fanfiction.


** linkffn(war paint by provocative envy) might satisfy your demand. The storyline of War Paint is quite unexpected.

  COMPLETE: It was small, slim, about the length of her hand; the leather cover was soft, the sewn-in binding was crisp, and the thick vellum pages were empty. 'Tom Marvolo Riddle' was printed in ancient, flaking gold leaf across the front. He had been a Slytherin, a prefect, and head boy in 1944. She had checked. HG/TR.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

**** No problem. I think it rather makes sense to be honest. Slytherin is a much more interesting house than the others in general which is why I've read several Slytherin Harry fics.
