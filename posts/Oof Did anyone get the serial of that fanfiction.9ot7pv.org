Seriously, what is it with HP fanfiction and that saying "Did anyone get the plate of that Lorry?" which is overused sooooooo much! I consider myself fairly well read and while I might be a compete outcast of society currently, I'm pretty sure no one used that saying back then anyway, so what is it with the HP fanfic microcosm and using that stupid saying at every opportunity in like 90% of all fanfiction over 100k words!?

** "Did anyone get the plate of that lorry" = "Did anyone get the plate of that truck"

Same meaning, and if you haven't heard of the latter than I think I might have bad new for you.

*** A mix mostly. I set the filter to sort by number of favourites, greater than 100k words and complete, and just picked the most interesting sounding ones as I went down.

Generally I think I tended towards the more AU and non-Canon ones, though I avoided slash.

** Never seen it myself. I alsonfeel obligated to point out that it's an Americanism. We would say "car reg", "reg number", "registration" rather than plate.

*** I suppose. Things like neville being bad at magic because he was made to use his father's wand, the granger's being Dan and Emma, etc. I like those kind of consistencies, but that Lorry thing just gets said by a new character each time I swear XD

***** They are just names, they don't carry any inherent meaning. Yes some authors use them to send a subtle message about the OTP, others merely happen to like them or even believe that it has to be mentioned in the extended canon somewhere because everyone else keeps using them.

I mean, not every Elizabeth/Liz is going to become Queen and not every unfortunate guy named Adolf is going to start a world war, so Dan and Emma on itself are not really an issue.

** Why do so many people say "OOF" lately? :( It's like OOF I just got punched or something? But nobody is hitting you so why do you make hurt noises?

** I gotta say, I can't remember having read that in many stories. In none that I recall.

What type of fanfics do you read?

** I've seen people adapt it to say hippogriff instead of lorry... I've read more fanfiction than is probably good for me tbh and while I've seen it or some variation of it, it's not super common.
