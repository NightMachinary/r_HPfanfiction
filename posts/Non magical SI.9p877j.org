Anyone written a fic from the point of view of a SI who knows canon but has no magic of their own (muggle or squib)? Doesn't need to literally be a SELF insert, OC inserts are just fine. Not interested in crossovers where they're Capes or Gamers or other crossover super/magical people. Just someone trying to deal with the HPverse without having an edge other than canon knowledge.


** linkffn(Why time travel should be illegal and other morals by mugglsftw) is exactly that.

  Ever dream of ending up in your favorite book? Think that sounds pretty awesome? Well you're wrong. Time travel sucks, alternate dimensions suck, and trying to raise young wizards without getting yourself killed and accidentally letting the bad guys win really sucks. But getting to give a kid the childhood he needs? Well, that just might make it worth it.

****** (expanded response)

What made me start thinking about this was the fic where a police officer figures out that something's going on because she keeps getting obliviated because of Harry Potter and starts realizing that she's missing time. She does things like carrying around a recording in her running music mix to remind her to check her notes.

So making the muggle immune to mind magic avoids one of the biggest problems a muggle main character would have in the HPverse.

  Dying at Voldemort's hand was expected. Coming to the afterlife and being greeted by an Angel not so much. Being told his universe was about to be completely erased and with it all his efforts was a nightmare. The silver lining? He was offered a chance at life in a new universe while also saving his friends. The catch? He had to become a God of Destruction.
