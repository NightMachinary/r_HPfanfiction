Slash, Het, and Fem slash all welcome. Romance can be a focus but plot is always preferable. Smut is tolerated but once again plot is preferable.

PLEASE NO HAREMS

Poly relationships are perfectly fine but no harems.

Ships I will never read: Haphne Harry/Susan Hinny

I will tolerate Harmony and Huna if well written. Personally the only time I really like Harry and Hermione together is when they're in a throuple with Ron.

In terms of plot, I like violence and a dash of angst. Not too much just a little. Enough to make me want to cry my eyes out but not enough to feel like a teenage drama.

Favourite Characters? Ron Severus Lucius Draco Luna Hermione

Please no Gary-Stu or Mary Sues. On the other hand I abhor bashing of /any/ character. Unless it's Umbridge then fuck her.

Please no Lord Potter-Black-Slytherin-Hogwarts-Merlin indie Harry.

I like long fics. Enough words to be a novel and tell a story but not enough to be a drag. Depending on the plot this can be anywhere from 50k to 500k. I like to think I'm open minded.

I'm going to link a bunch of fics I've read. Some rated anywhere from 3-10. I'm a harsh critic. But I'm willing to read almost anything.

  We need somewhere to learn to fight... he thought. A place to practice... somewhere they can't find us... “...A place to fight the Ministry...” Hermione's voice whispered. A place to learn how to protect people... Ron's lips mouthed. A heavy wooden door appeared, the ageing wood so ancient it appeared almost black -- if not for the single bright unaged golden design embossed upon its surface. A strangely stylised A without the middle bar, the base of the letter spiking out in only to curl in again like a pair of tongs, beneath it an almost bow shaped underline with three notches spiking out along its length, all contained within a circle. Three different desires blended into one open a different door to a new future, new possibilities, a new war, and the revival of a forgotten Chapter of the Brotherhood. It's about time the Wizarding World got a little freedom forced into it.

  After the war, Draco Malfoy was given a choice.But what no one knew was that the Veil is more complicated than Severus Snape, more enigmatic than Albus Dumbledore, and as unpredictable as those Weasley Twins.Now Draco is trapped amidst horrifyingly advanced muggles, without a wand or a prayer. All he has are his wits, a surfeit of trust issues, scars and tattoos he'd rather not explain, and a raging case of xenophobia.Then the aliens attack...

  Set during Deathly Hallows. After Ron leaves, Harry & Hermione barely survive a Death Eater attack and are forced to take Lucius as their prisoner. Once back at the tent, Hermione is left alone to watch him. Mind games and power play ensue. An astonishingly powerful elemental magic is growing within Hermione that she has no idea how to control. His every infuriating action seems to provoke it. An offer is made. Can they use each other towards survival? Warnings: Adult, Violence, War, Sexual Content

  AU. In an institute to help children with mental and psychological problems, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day.

Why should he assume the permanence of Sirius' death when that line was blurred, when that line was as fragile as the flutter of a Veil? Could fabric not be torn?

** I haven't read many of those, although I do quite like The Peace Not Promised. If you're ok with a sympathetic Severus, have you read linkffn(The Snape Chronicles)?

linkffn(The Many Deaths of Harry Potter) tend to be violent, if you haven't already read about them, but his level of angst isn't too bad considering what he's going through. I don't recall whether there's a pairing for Harry; if there is, it's not a big part of the story.

linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) series has a gripping plot, and no character-bashing (there are plenty of villains, for remarkably understandable reasons, but no-one that the author just randomly turned into cartoon evil). But it may be longer than you want; the first book is over 220k, and the fourth is over 440k (with one chapter to go). Harry is quite a bit more powerful and skilled than canon, but it's a) somewhat justified by growing up with both her parents and full knowledge of magic; and b) a liability when she's trying to conceal her identity and her gender and can't afford the spotlight. Not to mention it attracts people who want to use her in their political games or just outright steal her large magical reserves for themselves.

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.
