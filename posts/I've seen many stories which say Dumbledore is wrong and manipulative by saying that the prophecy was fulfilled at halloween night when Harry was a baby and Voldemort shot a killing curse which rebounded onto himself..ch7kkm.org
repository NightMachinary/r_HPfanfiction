But I thought about it for a while, and thought, what if Voldemort, because of this, managed to win and take over the whole world because of this, and turn it into a dystopia. Any other thoughts? Or maybe someone could write this or find a fic like this? Thank you.


** Does Dumbledore believe Voldemort is dead dead or does he believe he's still alive, but the prophecy was fulfilled regardless?

The former requires him to be incredibly stupid (both do really) and the latter changes nothing.

In HBP Dumbledore essentially tells him the prophecy is bullshit. In the very same conversation he tells him Voldemort "continues to set store by the prophecy" therefore one /will/ die at the hand of the other. Essentially, Dumbledore did little because of the prophecy. He did things because he understood Voldemort was too arrogant to let the prophecy go.

Yours works if /Dumbledore/ is dead, though.

This misunderstanding of canon Dumbledore has made me one of his staunchest supporters and idk how to feel about it.

** The prophecy can't be 'fulfilled' until one is actually dead by the hand of the other. Ergo, if Dumbledore said this its not manipulative so much as quite literally incorrect, since Voldemort is not dead either way. Why would Dumbledore encourage the belief that the prophecy had already been fulfilled, unless he was trying to maybe save Harry or kill Voldemort himself?

Anyway, Voldemort would still want to try and kill Harry to prove - both to his followers, his enemies and himself - that he truly was unbeatable, and that it was all luck. Since the blood protection is still a thing, the same thing could also happen again, with Harry unable to die due to Voldemort using his blood.

The prophecy only matters because Voldemort thinks it does. Facts are irrelevant; only opinions actually matter here.

*** The prophecy only says Harry will vanquish the dark lord, not kill him. That means Harry did fulfill his part, it is Dumbledore and the other adults who didn't do theirs by ensuring he died during the decade and a half he remained vanquished.

The second part of the prophecy is hard to insert into this theory but honestly all it seems to say is that they will keep going after each other as long as they live because neither will let the other remain alive.

**** 'Neither can live while the other survives' means that the two will inevitably try to kill one another for different reasons, as long as both are still alive (or whatever the hell Voldemort is as a wraith). The use of 'survives' in the same prophecy as 'vanquish' also seems to imply the interpretation of kill or destroy is meant by the word vanquish, rather than simply defeat.

***** I agree with you but wasn't Voldemort destroyed on 81? His body, his cause, his army.. all was gone. Since Harry killing him isn't specified I don't see any reason why we can't consider it fulfilled.

Also for me the surviving part aludes to the horrible life both will have. Neither is living, just surviving. But I don't think it changes the first part of the prophecy, after all even before 81 Harry was in hiding, and Voldemort was probably going mad trying to find the child. And after that...

** Dumbledore also manipulated Harry by telling him the special power that the "Dark Lord knew not" was love. Which meant that, for the rest of the year, Harry stopped worrying about it and just coasted off his blood protection.

#+begin_quote
  "So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not', it just means---love?" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.

  "Yes---just love," said Dumbledore. "â€˜You are protected, in short, by your ability to love. The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort's!"
#+end_quote

.

If Voldemort had decided to get off his high horse and joined a herpetology club instead of chasing after Harry, he could have broken the prophecy's power and taken over the world. "Love" was such a fragile thread to hang Harry's success on, and in the end, Harry didn't even need it, since he won by his friends getting rid of the horcruxes, and the Elder Wand backfiring in a freak coincidence.

  "You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! ...In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy."

In a world without author-mandated plot armour, Voldemort could have easily won the war.

This conversation happens in late April/early May and he's still following Malfoy around.

I'm almost certain Harry had to walk to his death. Just as I'm almost certain that those friends didn't find those horcruxes and the wand backfiring wasn't a freak coincidence.

**** Harry knew he didn't /have/ to walk to his death. He knows the prophecy's power comes from how much people set store by it. He /wanted/ to do it because he believed that facing Voldemort was the right and moral course of action.

#+begin_quote
  "Got to?" said Dumbledore. "Of course you've got to! But not because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about Voldemort now? Think!"

  But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew---and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents---that there was all the difference in the world.
#+end_quote

The combined power of love and soul magic allowed Harry to come back from the train station after Voldemort AK'd him in the forest, but the magical protection powers of love didn't affect the destruction of the horcruxes by Regulus, Dumbledore, Ron, and Hermione, or the mastery of the Elder Wand.

Regulus destroyed nothing. Harry did, though.

Those horcruxes weren't accidental.

What does love have to do with the Elder wand backfiring because the wand chooses the wizard and would never hurt its master?

Yeah, I'm not sure what this debate is even about... seems to be going in circles for no reason.

The point I wanted to make was that it was an extremely risky choice for Dumbledore to bet everything on "Love" being the power Harry had that the Dark Lord Knew Not. The final victory against Voldemort needed the horcruxes destroyed, and Voldemort's physical body killed, but that could be done, and /was done/ without The Magical Power of Love. The difference Love made was letting Harry come back after he died.
