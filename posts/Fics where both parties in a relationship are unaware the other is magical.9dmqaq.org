Are there any stories where, let's say Harry, somehow meets a nice muggle girl and starts dating her, trying to hide his magic, only to later find that she too is magical, and has been doing the same thing.

I'd prefer no slash, but seeing how incredibly niche this seems I'll take what I can get. Please and thank you

** It would be pretty hard for Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, Defeator of Voldemort, etc. to go unrecognized by a magical partner unless he was living under an assumed identity and had some permanent disguise.

I've never read anything exactly like you're describing, but I have seen fics where Harry dates a squib and assumes she is magical. It's been several years, but I remember they went on a date to a restaurant and after dinner she unlocks her car to Harry's utter bewilderment.

*** That sounds even funnier; Harry, sick and tired of the wizarding world obsessing over his every action shortly after his successful vanquishing of the dark lord, goes to live in a small quiet muggle neighbourhood to just get away from it all for a while... Meanwhile intrepid, eclectic, lovable Luna, still writing for the Quibbler, goes deep undercover as a local Muggle to get the real scoop on Harry's hidings. Serve lightly garnished with crackfic, season with memory charm intrigue for a more filling plotline.

***** Or a concerned friend who doesn't know how to reach out to Harry in a way that isn't invasive and so she treats him like a creature that needs to be observed before being approached, something she has experience in and I could easily see her defaulting to. Because she isn't mentally perfect, I can see her not being okay just walking up to him directly. I could see it working with some tweaks

** Never read anything like that, and as someone mentioned that it would be hard for Harry not to be recognized, but if she was a foreigner, like an American, he might not be so immediately recognizable.

Anyways I had a similar thought before. Basically my thought was Dudley in a committed relationship with a witch, as in engagement or marriage, without knowing she was one. Then he to try to explain to her that magic is real sometime when cousin Harry's coming for a visit. Anyone know any stories like that?

We'll see if it ever develops beyond that basic idea.

***** I'd have to decide what to write first! I keep switching between canon-compliant where Harry has a Perfect Life with a Perfect Wife and their Perfect Three Kids... or AU where Harry is a single dad of Teddy (who would come along with him and cause chaos) and he's maybe thinking of dating again now that Teddy's about to attend Hogwarts.

****** Nah, we have too manycanon-compliant ones already IMHO. The idea of Harry trying to control a mischievous Teddy at a wedding though is cracking me up already. And adding to it your ideas of a potential romance makes it all round terrific.

Go ahead and start writing - you know you want to! :P

I mean, if I could write even slightly decent dialogues, I'd have ran away with it - a plot bunny, if there ever was one.

  In a universe where Tom Riddle was sentenced to Azkaban for the murder of his Muggle relatives, Lord Voldemort never came into power, many lives turned out very differently. However, it seems there is such a thing as fate and Harry Potter is bound to be born in 1980 to Lily and James -- even if they are yet to meet. Peace can be just as eventful... {Jily, AU, no Voldemort/no war}
