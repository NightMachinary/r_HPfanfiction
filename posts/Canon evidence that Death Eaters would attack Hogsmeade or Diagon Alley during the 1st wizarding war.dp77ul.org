From what I've noticed, a lot of fics that are set during the first wizarding war have these skirmishes/battles happening in wizarding areas such as Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley.

But honestly, canonically, would these have even happened? It seems like Voldemort would usually operate more like the Gestapo by taking out families/individuals 1 by 1. The only thing I can think of that's similar is during book 4 when the death eaters attacked during the quidditch match. But we know for a fact that wasnt under Voldemorts orders. I guess there were attacks on muggles mentioned during fudges talk with the muggle prime minister but these didnt seem to turn into battles between Aurors and death eaters.

Voldemort doesnt really want innocent magical blood spilled either. So it doesnt make a ton of sense for him to just randomly attack Hogsmeade with the intention of taking it over. The actual take over happened with imperious curses.

Any thoughts?


** The short response to this is: no, its not likely at all that their was ever any big public attack on any location as we see in many fanfics for a variety of reasons. This is usually done to either 1) provide action sequences/show off Harry's power, 2) make some part of the plot occur, and/or 3) openly show the Death Eaters being horrible in public.

Long answer time, so buckle up.

There are several issues with that idea that make it infeasible with canon HP. Firstly, this fundamentally mischaracterizes both the nature of the "War" and how Voldemort operates. Voldemort is not the head of an army; its more accurate to liken him and his Death Eaters to modern terrorist organizations such as Al-Queda, the Irish Republican Army or even the FARC. Such groups are not seeking to subjugate an external foe but essentially engineer the overthrow of a government by attacking from within. Look at what we see of the war in OotP, HBP and DH.

- Voldemort is a charismatic 'revolutionary' who organizes the forces while largely remaining out of the fray himself. Only he knows the full extent of his various machinations, and without him the organization immediately crumbles.
- The Death Eaters wear masks and conceal their identities, possibly even from one another, similar to how terrorist cells are often compartmentalized to insure stability.
- The main activities are not to try and conquer the wizarding world. Mainly, they intimidate through various means, coerce cooperation, infiltrate the bureaucracy, deliberately discredit the Ministry's efforts, and occasionally assassinate potential high value targets.
- The Death Eaters essentially take advantage of the existing systems rules and methods to find weak spots to exploit, both undermining the system to the public and increasing the credibility of their organization/rebellion.

In other words, the wizarding war is more accurately characterized in our terms as an uprising or insurgency (although the later term has fallen significantly out of favor in light of recent revelations in the real world). And terrorist organizations /never/ engage in open warfare, battles and public displays of strength. Such organizations, including the Death Eaters, invariably have the /weaker/ hand compared to the governing body and the majority populace.

To paraphrase Sun Tzu, when fighting a stronger opponent you broadly have two options for success: 1) attack with full force at the enemies weak point in the hopes of breaking the opponents resolve or 2) engage in hit-and-run or guerilla attacks, fighting through asymmetric warfare. The second option is the natural choice, and with good reason. The Ministry and Order would probably love it if Voldemort attacked Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. That is literally why Voldemort lost in DH - because he attacked Hogwarts and created a united foe for the fence-sitters to rally against.

Mostly, battles are shown for a couple of reasons in fanfics: 1) its a simplistic way of showing the conflict without considering the implications; 2) provides opportunity for action sequences or showing off how powerful characters are; 3) can be used as a 'surprise moment' or advance a plot point the author wants to occur.

*** The only other point I would make is that if you look at past facist examples, they would occasionally ‘flex' their metaphorical muscles with displays of violence on the streets.

Think of the night of broken glass. Groups of certain people are targeted in a perceived safe area. If for example the death eaters went around Diagon alley at night it would likely be to burn down Muggleborn and half blood businesses or attack those who were known sympathisers with hit and run tactics until they would become so bold as to do it in broad day light because they know the average joe would be too afraid to act out themselves.

In terms of full scale battles, it's unlikely, as it's difficult to convince most people to actually openly fight (to the death) on a large scale unless there is a spectacularly clear idea of ‘us' and ‘them'.

*** You are why I love this sub.

But without Harry's sacrificial protection, could Voldemort have lost the battle of hogwarts? Assuming Neville couldnt destroy the snake, I think there was definitely enough forces to defeat him the 2nd time around as there were way more fighters in part 2 with much much more loss of life. But then I think he would have been overtaken but still alive and in the same form he was after attacking Harry.

**** That really depends on how it all goes down. Basically, Voldemort got caught up bragging and ended up in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_tactics#Eight_classical_maneuvers_of_warfare][makeshift double envelopment]], with the defenders in front and the forest creatures plus Hogsmeade inhabitants coming at his back/sides.

In the 1st part of the Battle, Voldemort held the numerical and magical advantage over the defenders. But now he was outgunned and out in the open - more succinctly, Voldemort made the mistake of literally bringing everything he had, as a show of force, out into the open so he could be trapped. Thats really the major reason Voldemort couldn't be taken down by numbers or possibly Dumbledore in the past, he could always escape if the scales tipped against him. He made it all or nothing out of overconfidence.

And even if Neville didn't get Nagini, Ron and Hermione were also aware and had Basilisk fangs. Worst case scenario is the crowds would mass fire spells at Voldemort from all sides and potentially wear him down through shear weight of numbers, the ultimate equalizer. Even if he dies, he only has one Horcrux and no one else to really call upon to easily revive himself. Worst case scenario there is now he has no Horcruxes and the public is less easily dismissive of the idea that he still survives without a body.

From the descriptions of the Wizarding War, that's not really accurate. The Death Eaters didn't just occasionally kill high value target - they regularly murdered Muggles, muggle-borns, regular witches and wizards, used the Imperius curse to have victims kill each other, and the like. They deliberately targeted and dispatched with entire families of those who opposed them (eg, the Order of the Phoenix).

For instance, when looking at the picture of the Original Order, Moody points out 7 characters who died during the war, 2 more who were tortured into insanity (Neville's parents), Harry's parents (not included in the dead), and 10 who survived.

It was a /lot/ more bloody in canon than you're suggesting - though yes, the strategy you mention would have been far better.

Here's another example of how the general population viewed the Death Eaters (from Arthur Weasley):

"You-Know-Who and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed. The terror it inspired... you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside... Everyone's worst fear... the very worst."

The Death Eaters were /casual/ about murder, particularly of muggles, and were far more likely to use terror and death than to work through other means, from what we know. That makes an attack in broad daylight more of a show of their own power than anything else - just like going in and killing a family of their opponents and putting the Dark Mark up in the air above it, it's not particularly discrete.

*** I disagree with comparisons between the Death Eaters and revolutionary terrorist organizations like some you mentioned, an essential characteristic of Voldemort's cause is that it aligns with the dominant political beliefs of the elite class within magical society. We can also see that the Death Eaters themselves are closely tied to the Ministry, with the higher echelons of government clearly sympathetic to their cause if not their methods. All this makes the Death Eaters much more akin to an unofficial paramilitary arm of the government like the cartel-affiliated militias in Latin America, the UVF, or any of the products of operation Gladio.

This doesn't change the fact that they are unlikely to do something absurd like lay siege to a shopping district, but it does change the character of their actions somewhat. These groups are more likely to take ‘proactive' action against possible ‘subversive' elements, traditionally repressed groups like Muggleborns, only taking nonviolent action outside of the movement's identity and with the backing of large amounts of wealth. Revolutionary groups are generally happy to publicly promote policy.

**** Those elites are a minority in magical society. Hogwarts /is/ accepting Muggleborns, who /are/ afforded the same basic rights as purebloods. Magical society takes pains to stay off the Muggles' radar, and Muggle baiting and hunting Muggles are both illegal. The Dark Arts are illegal. We literally see a Ministry official come to take the descendants of Salazar Slytherin to task for harming a Muggle. The Aurors were against them. Even many Pureblood families were against them. They might have been a majority among Purebloods, but that's not even for sure.

And I'm arguing that anti-Muggleborn discriminators did not hold the reigns of society. Unpleasant Death Eater children called Muggleborns names, but can you think of an instance before Voldemort controlled the Ministry where Muggleborns were oppressed on a societal level? The wizarding world was transitioning from broke to woke, which is why the Death Eaters wore masks instead of suits.

It's practically explicitly stated in the text that Lucius Malfoy owns the Minister. His undersecretary goes on to commit genocide. Harry, a hero of the anti-Voldemort cause, is almost exiled for performing magic in front of a muggle relative. Numerous known Death Eaters held high positions in government.
