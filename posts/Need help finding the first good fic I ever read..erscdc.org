:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Ok, I have realized my limitations and is now asking for help. I started reading fanfictions in 2016 as a joke. I found a horribly, badly written one with lots of smut and weird sex-scenes. The only reason I don't give up on fanfiction is because of the next fic I read, but I can't for the life of me find it again.

I remember it being on fanfiction.net and sadly, it was unfinished. I can't remember if it was abandoned or just not finished. Fingers crossed it's complete now.

The story is set eight (I think) years after the second wizarding war. Harry left the wizarding world without a trace right after the final battle, and now lives as a Muggle. He works as a pharmacist and lives with his boyfriend Greg. At least I think that's his name. Greg dies in a car accident and Harry decide to re-enter the wizarding world in disguise as a teacher in defence at Hogwarts.

I remember Snape being alive, and possibly Dumbledore. Hermione and Ron are married and both work as professors at Hogwarts. Ginny is married to Draco.

There is also something about the portrait of Slytherin, and terror attacks on muggles.

Please help me!


** I think the fic you're looking for is All I Crave Is A Normal Life by cazgirl.

  R for later chapters. (HarSev) Harry has defeated Voldemort at great personal loss and has fled the wizarding world. Circumstances force him to return and he must face all that he left behind, including his greatest enemy - and his greatest fear.
