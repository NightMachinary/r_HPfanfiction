I want to read some good Harry/Hermione fics.... Must be well-written, not smut, depicting a believable romance. Any genre beyond that is ok! Preferably post-hogwarts.


** [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/2mbzac/the_best_harryhermione_fics/cm2x1dt][This]] is a pretty good list .

** linkffn(Shadow Walks) is a great angsty one. It does have a good ending though.

Also, have you read linkffn(Resuscitation of Agape)? That one is a bit weird and the writing can suffer occasionally, but I liked it a lot.

  As his 6th year at Hogwarts nears, Harry receives a pair of mysterious, conflicting owls. Evidently, Hermione is dying to tell him something, but whatever he was expecting is FAR from the disturbing truth... T:LVS, gender-bending :COMPLETE:
