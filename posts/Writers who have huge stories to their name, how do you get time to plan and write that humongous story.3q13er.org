Since how tod have informed me that to write a huge story you have to palm a lot


** I didn't plan. I just wrote and wrote, discovered a plot hole, started over, wrote and wrote and wrote some more, and the next thing I knew I had 400,000 words of story. Of course, I also happened to be writing an "AU" that kept painfully close to canon (hence the quotes on AU), which helps your word count because most of the story's already written for you. Nevertheless, I'm using the same method of write write write on my latest fic, which does not follow canon so closely and is currently sitting at 150,000 with a probable finish point of about 200,000. (I'm not sure how many classifies as huge.) Point is, I'm not a planner. It's not my style and I know there are others out there the same. If planning works for you though, then go ahead and do it.

But the way I see it you shouldn't aim to write a big story. You should aim to write *a* story, and if it ends up huge then cool. If you've got an idea that will inevitably span several hundred thousand words then great, but your purpose as a writer should be to focus on the story, not the word count. A story will take as many words to tell as it needs - be that 5,000, 50,000, or 500,000.

As for finding the time, that's a matter of priority. I don't work, so I have all the free time in the world. If you have a job or school or other things to work around, you simply have to decide how much of your free time and effort you want to put into planning and writing your story instead of reading other stuff, or watching TV, or playing video games, or whatever.

** I had been subtly planning my own fanfic for a couple years before I finally started writing. Before I stopped writing I had over 100k words (in about half a month).

It took me about a year to write the first 250k words, it took about another year to write 200k words, and it took me almost an entire year to write the last 50k. (searching for the power)

I wrote by the seat of my pants and still did a pretty good job on keeping the plot from unraveling and dropping foreshadow clues (some that I didn't even see before they revealed themselves).

My next "big" novel (Hogwarts Shuffle) I started off by the seat of my pants and it was going great, and then I let my beta convince me to add more plot and try to make it "more epic"... so we planned it all out in detail and I lost interest / couldn't get behind the plot anymore...

For my original novel I HAVE to plan it out because I'm building the world and original characters. For Fanfiction it was like I was just watching a play and writing it down as it happened...I had almost no conscious control over the process.

** I planned for a year. Had it in my head, wrote a detailed outline for each chapter and then started writing a bit. I carried around note books and jotted down my ideas so I wouldn't forget then one day I sat and seriously started writing. I found a beta, sent them a few chapters and when they were on board I posted my first few chapters. Later I got another beta, who is still working with me and I've been posting chapters ever since. It was two years ago that I started posting and now I'm at 493k+ words and I posted chapter 71 last night. I still have a ways to go, but I know where I'm going haha I seriously would have been lost without the outline and the notebooks. They really do help in keeping everything on track and it also makes it so you don't get writers block and abandon ship. As for finding the time I set aside time to write every week and I am constantly thinking about the story. Note books also help out a lot with time and writing. Write on your lunch break, when waiting at the DMV, I write when my husband is driving or when we're watching a movie on Netflix I don't like. I also write when he's studying and needs quiet. Point is you find the time :) it can be hard to, but if your passionate you will find time. Also, it's not a race so go at your own pace.

** I tend to lay out the foundation - past, differences to canon, world building, and the characters and their goals, and some broad strokes, before writing. Then I tend to let the characters act and react, and then run with that.

** I had an outline and a bunch of ideas, but once I started to write, things took on a life of their own. I realized, for instance, that certain characters needed a scene to set up something that was coming later in the story. Or that I needed to tie up a loose plot thread so that something wouldn't be ambiguous.
