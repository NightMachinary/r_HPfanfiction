:END:
Can someone please help me find a deleted fic

It's ao3 fic and because it was deleted I don't have name of the fic or the author much to my regret but here's what I remember:

It's Harry Potter/Tony Stark fic

I'm pretty sure that it was a do-over/#'s of reincarnation for Harry and he moved to US at very young age instead of growing up at Britain

Harry uses last name Black and runs a company (starting at very young age) located right across Stark company building

Harry frequently run into Tony Stark and become acquaintance at the beginning and slowly develop relationship I think being CEOs of big companies and all

*might be wrong but I think Lily and James was alive? But gave up on Harry and dotted on second child they had after faking their death and went into hiding - Harry know this due to finding it out during one of the previous life when he was being betrayed (I think Sirius faked his death and started new life somewhere too but I'm not a hundred percent sure on this part) - but if this was the case, Harry actually helps Petunia (and her family though they won't know) to move to a nice neighborhood with nice house for her own good and as a payback/gratitude because she protected him in one of the previous lives, prevent magical world from getting to them to get Harry and informs her that Lily is actually alive etc. Harry does keep in contact with her though not often

It's Albus, Molly, Ron, Hermione bashing fic

He adopted several children who attends Hogwart for few years or so I think before transferring them to magic school he builds at US (some of the other student like Neville and Luna applies and transfer to school as well) - no loyal Order of Phoenix members were accepted but Harry does helps some of the Weasley (I think it was Bill, Charlie and Arthur?) who wanted to start a new life

He hires Malfoys (Lucius and Narcissa) as teachers and Draco transfers to the school too to escape war - betraying Voldemort (Harry have a way to erase the dark mark) - Harry originally reached out to Narcissa and she requested that Lucius and Draco as part of the deal I think and Harry agreed and said something along the line that he have no intention of separating them or something

Snape de-ages himself, change name and apply to Harry's school as a student to start new life in the US (he had few confrontations with Harry beforehand but eventually after talking/confronting Snape, Harry admit him to his school as a student)

Harry becomes US minister of magic - he purposefully do not reveal this when meeting with Dumbledore and other order of pheonix member at Hogwart knowing they will try to trap him and force him to help fighting Voldemort without even realizing he is foreign country's minister

Harry builds several orphanages throughout the country (US)

Killing curse doesn't work on Harry - Voldemort did get into fight/duel with Harry but after learning that this fact, he reluctantly agrees to Harry's term - leaving each other alone as long as Voldemort won't hurt anyone Harry care about I think.

Harry does eventually defeat Voldemort later and because Harry was under different identity (Black) he uses his original name of Harry Potter, goading Voldemort and defeat him. When others (I think it was Lily, James and order of phoenix members?) approach him, he claims that he only said it to piss Voldemort off, cutting ties and any association they try to form (probably due to his previous life experiences, knowing they are just trying to use him)

I think Harry meets other Avengers as well

That's about what I remember about the fic.

If anyone know the title and the name of the author (and possibly URL), please, please let me know!!
