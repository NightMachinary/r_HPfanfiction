It's about a year for me...


** Jori finished [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/18/12][Harry Potter and the Infernal Plan]] ten years after the previous chapter had been written.

Never give up hope.

** The trick is to follow hundreds of fanfics so that even if they all take long and inconsistent amounts of time to update you get at least one update per day or so.

*** I'm trying this but... When I first started reading fanfics, all these ideas and AUs seemed interesting. Now, I get picky and drop fics immediately for handling characters/romance/cliched ideas(looking at you, Lord Hadrian Lestrange-Black-everylastname, with the authority to change everything even as a child, megapowerful!Harry, etc)/canon/pacing badly.

Back to OP, I give up after a year. As such, most stories I follow are deemed abandoned.

** I don't generally lose hope, but at some point I forget it exists and then it's a super happy day when it does finally update (cuz I made an alert for it) and I get the joy of reading it all over again (because I've forgotten most of the plot).

*** As an author, I completely agree.

Life just gets in the way, and then there's writers block and all that... I still try to continue my unfinished story, but reading my own stories a year after I wrote it, I feel really ashamed at my writing style and my amateurish sentence structure and characterisation.

I actually deleted 2 stories of mine on WattPad that reached #1 on thriller and suspense a few years ago because of how ashamed I was of the writing style in that story...

** Depending on the update interval the author usually has, it's anywhere from a few weeks to a year. Some authors can consistently spit chapters out quickly, while others only every few weeks or a few months.

** How long did the previous update take? Have you tried reviewing a chapter to see if you get an answer from the author? If an author was previously putting chapters out regularly and then suddenly it's be a long time with no explanation, you're probably looking at an abandoned story.

However, there have been stories I thought abandoned that updated after a year or more of silence. Make sure you have an alert set up to notify you of an update but otherwise put it to the back of your mind and find something else to read.

** If I love a story and it's unfinished, I will let it sit in my Followed list forever, on the off chance that some day there may be an update. I think there's a story in said list that was updated in 2005.... Logically, I know it's never going to be updated. But nothing in life is certain!

** I actually never get back to a story after I finish the last chapter. If I start reading another story, then I'll forget about the previous one.

The only exception to this rule is linkffn(Balancing Destinies by DobbyElfLord). It's still the only story I've been waiting over two or three years for now. The prequel to this was just a really great story.

** I can't go more than a couple months before I lose interest and won't read the updates even if they come. But even that's an upper bound and only really applies to fics I really like.

** Honestly, I very rarely start unfinished fics . After being burned too many times, and considering the fact there are so many completed fics, stopped many years ago.

However, occasionally there are fics which I come across that I take a risk on (or don't notice they're unfinished when I start them). And when I do, I don't give up hope so much as forget they exist. Unless its really amazing - there is one fic that was started almost 17 Years ago and hasn't been updated in a decade - I'm still holding out hope. It's not a Harry Potter fic though.

** Nightmares of Future Past is enjoyable, despite its many cliches. It's been nearly a year since the last update, but I am willing to wait.

I tend to only lose hope if the author takes down the fic, or closes their account entirely.
