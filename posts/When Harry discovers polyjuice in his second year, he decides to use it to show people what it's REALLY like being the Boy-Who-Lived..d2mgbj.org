He spends the rest of the year sneaking it into other people's food, so that Snape, Malfoy, Ron, Ernie etc all get a turn looking like him. At first, they're all treated like Harry and have to experience the whole Heir-of-Slytherin condemnation first hand. Eventually people realize what's going on, but that just means nobody ever believes Harry is Harry, so he avoids a lot of the perils of fame


** He wouldnt do it to Ron in second year. Lockhart is a better and funnier target

*** He might offer it to Ron when Ron finds out about it (he's going to have questions when he hears about a Harry sighting when he knew Harry was with him) and I could see 2nd year Ron taking it, just as a prank if nothing else.

*** I think its just extremely hard to aquire the ingredients and instructions for it. Even Crouch junior had to steal them from Snape. And Hermione had to get the instructions from a book in the restricted section.

I also dont think there really is illegal magic, even the unforgivables are only illegal to usr on humans.

***** I seriously doubt anyone would receive a life sentence for using the killing curse on some random animal.

Id imagine that there would be some other punishments depending how they're used, like using the torture curse on a owl would probably still give you at least a fine.

****** It does specify either human or living being, can't remember which.

Though the intent needed to cast it is ugly enough that they might carry a prison sentence anyway.

  "Now. . . those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius, and Cruciatus - are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against. That's what I've got to teach you to fight. You need preparing. You need arming. But most of all, you need to practice constant, never-ceasing vigilance. Get out your quills. . . copy this down. . . ."

I'd assume that using them on a being like Goblin would still carry a similar punishment, but I doubt someone using the imperius curse on some cattle would receive any significant punishment.

*** yes but every time he gives harry detention, Harry just potions the entirety of Slytherin house then quietly polyjuices himself into a Ravenclaw first year. Snape is left with hundreds of fake Harrys and no real one

Polyjuice just has so much unexplored potential!
