Don't remember much about except it's in 4th year, Hermione and Ron leave him, Harry wins first task transmuting the ground into cow, gets OWLS(or some kind of certificate cause of it) and makes a body for the spirit of Hogwarts out of metal.

Found it if anyone cares :[[http://fictionhunt.com/read/10037020/1]]


** So i started reading the fic and i cant stop cringing. For some reason harry always swears to norse gods without any explanation at all and Luna is a seer...
