**** Dude, there's no definite, abstract quality of Ravenclaw-ness existing inside the universe. The four houses are based on very shaky, arbitrary, and rough groupings of various personality traits and motivations. And if you've seen a person who genuinely believes in a horoscope at least once in your life, you'll know that you can basically make everyone believe they have /any/ kind of personal quality, if you're vague and creative enough.

It wouldn't even take that much bullcrap and rules-lawyering to put literally anyone into any of the four houses.

***** Ron just rooted for a team and played a position. Nevermind that the two most passionate Hogwarts Quidditch players were Oliver and Angelina.

You can be in any house. Lockhart and Quirrell were Ravenclaws, but for Ron to 'genuinely belong in Ravenclaw' requires a 'heavy AU' for the personality change alone.

****** Ravenclaw is probably the House where Ron belongs the less. Unlike Harry and Hermione, I'm pretty sure the Hat didn't have any hesitation about putting him in Gryffindor, and he fits really well there.

But Ron also have some trait that, if they were pushed a little, could justify him going into another house :

- As seen in his vision of the Mirror of Erised, or in some scene in the later books, Ron has some ambitions. Ambition to succed, ambition to not just be "Weasley NÂ°6" or "Harry Potter's best friend". Couple this ambition with a "Way to greatness" from the Sorting Hat, and you can have a Slytherin Ron pretty easily.\\
  I'm a bit annoyed about all these Slytherin Harry fics that put Hermione in the same House (together against all and future Harmony I guess) even though Hermione doesn't belongs in Slytherin at all, while Ron, a perfect candidate to support Harry in these House, stay in Gryffindor and turn into some Slytherin hater .Canon Ron hates Malfoy, but could not care less about the House as a whole. The "all Wizards who turned bad where from here" sentence from the movies is said by Hagrid in the books, and considering how he got expelled I think he can be forgiven to be a bit biased. In fact, if anything it's Harry who dislike Slytherin as a House (and mainly because he thinks they hate him "because he keeps beating them in Quidditch").
- Ron is also a loyal friend.\\
  Ron hater always mention his "betrayals" in GoF and DH (and I don't even think they are betrayals, GoF was just a teen dispute, and Harry reaction played a part in why they didn't speak for a month, as for DH, they were all under the influence of the Horcruxe, except Ron was the only one who "could" leave, Harry pretty much told him to leave, and he would have come back after cooling off if not for the terrible timing of him meeting Snatcher and Harry deciding to move the moment he left).\\
  But outside of it, we are speaking about someone who chose to sacrifice himself at 12 so his friends could continue, followed his friend into an Acromantula den even though spiders are his worst fear at 13, and stood wandless and with a broken leg in front of a (thought) Deather Eater saying he would have to kill him to reach Harry at 14. So yeah Ron is loyal, so Hufflepuff could be a choice for him (and they take everyone anyways).
- But Ravenclaw is for the people who wants to learn, just for the pleasure of learning. And that's a trait Ron does not have at all (Harry neither for all that matter). Ron can work hard and learn, but it's always for an objective (passing a class, resolving a mystery, surviving the next "adventure" Harry's luck will bring to them), but he never had the urge to do some "light lecture" like Hermione did.

So, while you can make a Slytherin or Hufflepuff Ron while maintaining his canon personality. Ravenclaw Ron can only be brought by some sort of "Wrong Sorting", or by making him kind of OOC.

** I'm looking for the sort-of-crack fic I accidentally tripped over several months ago where the Twins put a confundus charm on the Hat and completely screw up Harry and Co's sorting. Harry and Draco are both sorted into Hufflepuff, and Ron gets Ravenclaw. Was actually pretty good and I was disappointed it was a one (two) shot.

** Well, [[/u/allhailchickenfish][u/allhailchickenfish]] already mentioned linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10621071]]), in which the twins confundus the hat prior to the sorting, putting everyone in different houses. It's a series that mostly follows the canon timeline, and goes up until the end of year three before it was abandoned.

For an in-progress fic in which Ron was placed in Ravenclaw on his own merits, look no further than linkao3(A Station South of Canon). Every character has a trait that differentiates them from their canon incarnation, to great effect. The main characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Draco) are all in different houses. Ron is the Ravenclaw member

  First year at Hogwarts is a time for self discovery, making friends, and possibly starting yourself on a horrible downward spiral where your exceptional abilities alienate yourself from everyone around you. Harry Potter, for reasons he's personally curious about, cannot seem to die or even be hurt. Draco Malfoy has been dealt the cruel hand by fate to have so little magical power as to be barely better than a squib. Hermione Granger is a deaf natural legilimens. And Ron Weasley has been inducted into the ultra-selective society known as the Sparrowkeet Lounge. One stop down the line is still a long way from canon.

  He glimpses a life in Ravenclaw. Unexpected, the opposite of what anyone who knew him in either life would expect of him. Average intelligence, lacking wit, never the Original but merely a copy.  

  They say a Ravenclaw's wit is matched only by their creativity. Pioneers in every field, they are inventors and politicians and their minds shape and build a better future.

  Ron the Ravenclaw struggles to make friends at first. He has an unusual knack for out-of-the-box thinking, and his tendency towards strategies that are maddening yet effective will be the spark that initiates his friendships. Evenings spent in the Common Room playing chess, his mind pitted against the greatest minds of his generation. In Ravenclaw, he will thrive.

*** I agree with your point about book smarts vs street smarts. But I think ravenclaw doesn't automatically mean booksmart.

Looking at people like Luna, Xeno, Flitwic and Olivander I think it is the attitude of open mindedness and passion for knowledge and curiousness often in one particular area Smart but necessarily nerdy.

Ron definitively could be in Ravenclaw. Everyone has traits of all the houses. I think the hat is looking at what each person needs help with developing rather than strongest atrinutes.

Neville needed to be in the house of the brave to find his courage.

The hat wanted to put harry into slitherin to give the downtrodden 11 year old ambition to make something out of himself and gain something to strive for so he "could be great there".

Ron could be put into ravenclaw to give him a unique way to show who he was and step outside of his brothers shadows. It would help him find his niche. Granted it is a bit of a stretch but not impossible.
