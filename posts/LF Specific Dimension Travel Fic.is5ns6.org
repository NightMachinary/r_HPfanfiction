:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to find this specific fic I read ages ago. I think it was dimension travel, where somehow Harry, Ron, and Hermione ended up in a world where Neville was the boy who lived. All three of them were in a relationship together and I'm pretty sure Ron was a werewolf. They replaced their counterparts and were obviously out of character, much more powerful and so on. I think I remember a scene where Hermione had to convince McGonagall that Harry and Ron weren't suddenly being friends with her because they wanted to use her for her school work?

Honestly I'm starting to think I may have made it up, or maybe I'm remembering different scenes from different fics. Any help would be appreciated!


** I think I've read this. They pretend to be adults right? And Hermione is the one that brews an aging potion. And they are really powerful/experienced and duel each other going all out and I think I remember something about Harry putting a sleeping beauty curse on Hermione during a duel and Hermione healing Ron and Harry afterwards. I read it a long time ago and I don't remember if Neville was the boy who lived but I think they started hunting horcruxes also. I definitely remember Ron being a werewolf in this too.

I think this is it: linkffn(5309378)

*** Sadly no. Thanks for trying though! I think the odds are it's probably on FFN if only because it would have been a lot easier to find with the tags on AO3 and I haven't had any luck.
