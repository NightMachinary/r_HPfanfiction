Always been a fan of Alternate Universe fics, particularly rewrites starting from the earlier books. Can't really seem to find many unfortunately.

A couple examples of what I'm looking for would be:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353809/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Boy-Who-Lived][Harry Potter & The Boy Who Lived]]

Which is a complete write of the series (sadly, it's been abandoned).

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2590595/1/A-Surreal-Tale][A Surreal tale]]

Which is also a complete rewrite of book one & two, though sadly it's also been abandoned.

So, anyone have any other recommendations for complete series rewrites (or at least starting from the earlier years)?


** Completed complete series rewrites are a bit rare.

I'd recommend BajaB's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3885086/1/Almost-a-Squib][Almost a Squib]], which covers the whole series. 46k words, complete.

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.
#+end_quote

Another is Lulu42's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]], 245k words, complete. It's crossover with Gaiman's Sandman, though you don't need more than a brief skim of the wiki to read. (That said, Sandman is my favorite graphic novel series, definitely worth checking out on its own.)

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Sandman Crossover
#+end_quote

Another is the HP/Calvin and Hobbes crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2760303/1/The-Best-Seven-Years][The Best Seven Years]] by Blu Taiger. 90k words, complete.

#+begin_quote
  Calvin is eighteen and living in England with his folks. Now, he's faced with the task of telling Susie what he's been doing for the past seven years.

** I've always enjoyed the R-series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/71268/Regulus][Regulus]]. It's a rewrite of the series starting in year one, centered around a relationship between Harry and Tonks (who is his age).

*** Hey, thanks! I've never heard of the series, but I love me some H/Tonks, one of my favorite pairings. I'll be sure to check it out!

** So far this fanfiction is amazing and writen very well. It's quite lengthy already so theres enough to sink your teeth into.

The Do-Over Fic - a chance to do things again, but this time-To Get it Right. But is it really such a blessing as it appears? A jaded, darker, bitter, and tired wizard who just wants to die; but can't. A chance to learn how to live, from the most unexpected source. Story is high on Political intrigue.

*** I'll look into it, thanks! I've never really been a fan of HP/LV fics (in fact, I've only ever enjoyed one), but then again, I also just spent the last two days reading a fic where Harry gets raised by cats from the age of three. Going by that standard, HP/LV doesn't sound so out there :P.

**** Heh I know what you mean, I'm not really a fan of HP/LV either. It just seams so wrong... but in this fic i dident mind it really because theres so much going on in it that the smut dosent become the centre of the writing. I would defo give it a try.

Heres also another good fanfiction, its not a re-do fic unfortunetly, its a voldemort wins one but my god it is writen so well. It's currently a WIP but it has so much potential. I get shivers down my spine every time I read it a look!

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/832559/chapters/1584001]]

I would also suggest getting a archiveofourown account, there are alot of fanfictions on there that I havent been able to find on ff.net or other websites.

** Ooh, as you like rewrites, this will be right up your alley!

A redo of DH, mainly canon-compliant, but 'fixed' by a fan to be more awesome, with less camping, less Expelliarmus, and a Harry with a plan. My verdict: great fun, and really feels like a Harry Potter book. My only issue with it is that it cuts out some of my favourite parts of the original book (but it does add some awesome stuff too).
