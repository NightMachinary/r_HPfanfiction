** I have a brilliant (complete) fic for you but undortunately it's not what you are looking for. It's a fic about what Fleur Bill and Percy are up to while Harry and Ron and Hermione are Horcrux hunting. It shows the other side of the war, how the Weasleys bring Ginny to Kings cross 9 3/4, Percy in the Ministry and Ron how he shows up at Shell cottage and later when he returns with Luna, Harry and Hermione etc.

** Linkao3(To Be A Magical Boy)

It centers around Dean and Seamus but it's a very good description of what happens at Hogwarts during the seventh year.

  Seamus and Dean met in first year. They were friends. Best friends. The very best of friends, even, and that was how it always would be. The world of magic was a gentle wave and then roiling madness around them, but throughout it all that one thing would never change.From first year to seventh, together or apart, some things were constant.
