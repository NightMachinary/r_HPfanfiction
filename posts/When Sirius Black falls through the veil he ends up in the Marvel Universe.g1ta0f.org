After Bellatrix blasted Sirius through the veil he ends up in a world without Wizards but instead Mutants and Superheroes. Would love a Loki/Sirius pairing or friendship because honestly a marauder meeting the god of Mischief, it would be fantastic


** It's not Marvel, but Worm, and there's no Loki, but otherwise, it fits: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/not-quite-sirius-worm-hp-crossover.333113/][Not Quite Sirius]]
