:END:
Can't find this fic where Harry gets a time delayed letter through post about heirship and goes to gringotts to sort out. Hires snape as mentor. Travels to his house he inherited and cleans everything up and in basement is a ghost re-enactment of evil dumbledore. Harry also uses a magic laptop. Goes into training with the goblins and takes ron and draco who have sympathetic magic. Think it was on ff.net not sure though as I can't find on my favourites?
