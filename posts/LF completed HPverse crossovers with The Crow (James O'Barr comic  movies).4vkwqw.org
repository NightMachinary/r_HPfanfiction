I'd think it would be somewhat common, with all the deaths in the series that someone would come back and kick some unholy ass.

Bonus points if it's Dobby or Hedwig.


** I just linked it before, there's only one on FFn. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5714450/1/The-Crow-Phoenix-Rising]])

Warning, has a LOT of unacceptable [to me] cliches in it. Is in first person. And not very long.

*** What bothers me is the "Oh woe is me, I have to hurt and kill the people who raped and murdered me! What kind of monster am I becoming!?" from Harry. That stuff is annoying on its own, but in the story it's completely out of place.

  What if "the power the Dark Lord knows not" had nothing to do with love? What if it had everything to do with justice? Crossover of Harry Potter and the Crow.

***** Apparently I'm in the small minority of readers who don't care about cliches like that. Bashing Dumbledore or helpful Goblins isn't a deal breaker with me. Neither is Good Dumbledore or asshole goblins.

****** It just becomes one of those "look at me, i know how to have goblins be helpful by doing this. Why didn't you? Oh, because i'm smarter than you are" moments where their harry is just so badass and awesome. And mob!dumbledore is almost always to show how harry can be independent and awesome but he can't be independent and awesome if he has an elderly mentor.

Once you see the same elements in a hundred different stories, you may change your mind.

******* I work security staring at a computer and I read about 90% of each shift. I've lost count of how many long fics I've read in the past few months. The only thing that I don't care for is abandoned fics, slash, volde/Snape/Draco x Whoever fics, and weirdly stilted wording. Anything else I will read.

Desperate to have their boy-hero back no matter what they really should have heeded the Muggle saying "be careful what you wish for". Crossover HP/WH40K.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.
