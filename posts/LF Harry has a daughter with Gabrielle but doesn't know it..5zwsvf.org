The story starts with Harry having his own little pub in Siberia or somewhere equally cold and north. His daughter (whom he didn't know about) comes to him saying that her mother was kidnapped. Harry returns to Britain and visits Neville and what became of the DA (it was Potter's Legion iirc). There's also some kind of training that consists of multiple steps and his daughter gets further on her first try than any who tried before her.

Eventually Harry and Gabrielle get together after she is saved and have a happy little family.

Oh, and the daughter was conceived in Shell Cottage when the Trio were planning their trip to Gringotts.


** Come on people! I found this fic in two seconds. You want to know how? I opened the google app on my phone and typed in "harry gabrielle pub daughter"... it was the first link. At least take a shot when looking for fics.

***** Bullshit reasoning. Especially since not even Fleur answered him where Gabrielle was when he asked for her a year or so later.

Like... what? What the fuck?

Then the fact that Harry built what seems to be a mercenary troop that semi-rules Britain /in absence of his person/ is so beyond my suspense of disbelief that chapter 3 was where I stopped reading.

Also... *also* his daughter was talked out of her doubt about her father in chapter 3. No tension, no bonding dialogue, nothing... she's just educated about his devotion to family by the cutout-characters that were supposed to be Hermione, Neville, Luna and Ginny.

Its reasonably well written in terms of grammar and such, but remarkably stupid once you sit back and think about what you read for a second.
