** Harry was scared out of his mind.

Voldemort had a new body, and got back his tremendous power. His followers came back to him, and he was gloating, moments away from ending his life.

But Harry was super allergic to flowers, and the graves in the graveyard had a lot of them. That, combined with his desperate plea for help, and his magical strength, led to the only logical conclusion.

Harry sneezed.

Voldemort and his Death Eaters exploded.

** Not quite what you're suggesting, but linkffn(Wandless Magic by Cloud Dreamer) has a magical disease, the effects of which are triggered by sneezing. It's a sequel to a Tenchi Muyou! / Ranma 1/2 cross, linkffn(The Virus by C. Jones).

  'The Virus' is a story about what goes wrong when we play with things we have no control of. It's a story that talks about life, chaos, and the mixture of the two.
