Title says pretty much it. Possibly Harry somehow goes into an AU and learn to know that Neville is the "Conquerer of Voldemort"...so you might say that Neville is the Boy Who lived instead of Harry. But since this is an AU, it can change totally. Although if i imagined that Neville would be BWL (but maybe hiding his Scar or it disappears after the Dark Lords defeat) and so became a War Hero. In this World he is good looking, so he has a lot of Female Fans and atleast a group of Lovers.

What im uncertain would be if Neville enjoys this fame (by reports an how all the Girls are onto him) or if he starts to get boring by it, if he is alone. In any ccase i would like if and older Harry shares his experience with him.

Well, Neville doesnt need to be the WBL at all. maybe Harry was it from the Beginning, but he die in the Battle and NEville took the Lead and succeded.
