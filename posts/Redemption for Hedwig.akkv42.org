Has anyone written a fic where Hedwig had a baby or babies sometime between 6th and 7th year? Hedwig doesn't make it through the flight to the Burrow, but while they're on the run Harry looks after the owl(s) and eventually keeps them for his family or close friends. Always remembering and being reminded of his beautiful owl, and his first birthday present.

There are so many fics where Harry never owns another owl of his own in the future, and I can completely see the reasoning. I'd just love to see a short story or one shot where Harry can find some peace in losing Hedwig. Its one of those few moments the DH movies did a scene better than the books, where she sacrificed herself to take the spell, instead of dieing in her cage .
