Hello all, first time doing one of these LF posts hope someone can help :)

To give context, i recently played hellblade: senuas sacrifice. It featured a dark gritty storyline where the main character had awful things happen to them throughout the entire story, but came out at the end stronger for it.

I guess im looking for recommendations similar to that. Dark horror, but with a rewarding and strong story. Preferably eith Harry as MC but open to trying something different.


** Well, if you're open to OC, here's my wip linkffn(13098062)

It's about an adult witch years after book seven, and it's pretty dark; the MC is hounded by a powerful, malevolent entity. I'm decently ahead on chapters, so updates every two weeks should be consistent for a while.

Otherwise, linkffn(Circular Reasoning) linkffn(Elizium for Sleepless Souls) are two dark stories I know of that this sub often recommends. I've read Elizium, it was pretty good.

  Nearly thirty years on from Voldemort's war, the world is no less unforgiving. Pyrrha Clay has lost all that mattered, yet one distant hope keeps her clinging to the earth, and she will set herself against evils within and without to realize her life's purpose. The Nightmare Queen will oppose her at every turn, haunt every corner of thought, until one of them breathes their last.

** Harry doesn't come out strong, but I love this story. It's a crossover but you don't need to know the context.
