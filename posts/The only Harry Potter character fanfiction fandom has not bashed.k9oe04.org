The only Harry Potter character not getting any bashing is Dobby. All there are bashed Harry himself, Hermione, Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore, Mad-Eye, Mcgonagall, Weasleys and no one is spared. But in all my years of Harry Potter fan fiction, I have never seen Dobby being bashed.


** I've /definitely/ seen fics in which Dobby gets mistrusted more for his questionable method of saving Harry's life, and Dobby doesn't get to redeem himself as a result.

Especially in Lord Potter stories where Harry has house-elves of his own, Dobby tends to get the "unnecessary dead weight" treatment.

I think the only characters that the Harry Potter fandom /hasn't/ bashed might be Bellatrix Lestrange and Fenrir Greyback - and that only because they're downright impossible to make /more/ insane and evil.

I'm with you on Fenrir but as for Bellatrix I highly recommend linkao3( we shall all perish if the dark lord comes) it's character study of her in canon and largely changed how I see her.

**** For the purpose of this thread, it didn't really change much for me.

A lot of what's being said in the essay is /very/ subtle and low-impact characterization with a lot of assumptions, and omitting those details, getting them wrong, or disagreeing with what's being inferred in the essay isn't the same as bashing the character.

** You're right, I don't think I've ever seen Dobby being bashed.

Thinking about others... I was going to say Nymphadora, but reviewing all the fics I've read in my mind (at least the ones I remember), I do remember a couple of oddball cases in slash fics where Dumbledore tells her to seduce Harry for... reasons (of which I don't remember). Strictly speaking, she doesn't really mean any harm beyond trusting Dumbledore (she seemed to have her own doubts on the matter), but she's still clearly portrayed as a bad person, justifiably so.

Have you seen Luna be bashed? Fanon loves her for some reason. Fanon also has a habit of portraying Lily as a Mary Sue in Marauder-era fics (whether the protagonist are Gryffindors or Slytherins) but there's a couple of fics, especially Slytherin-focused ones, where she's bashed (usually because she didn't forgive Snape, despite obvious justifications for not doing it).

Lilly I have seen bashed in a group effort only like Order is evil and she's in it story. Or the Marauders are evil and she sided with them story. I don't see people bashing Lilly on her own. Don't think I've actually ever seen Luna bashing

I've seen some fics where Andromeda was somehow a double agent who fed Order information to her sisters. Come to think of it, I once read a really good fic where instead of Bellatrix being turned and being Lord Voldemort's right hand, it was Andromeda instead (due to some trauma Andromeda had suffered, which left her bitter and seeking revenge.) Bellatrix Black ended up having to take custody of baby Nymphadora and raise her as a single mom while being DADA professor at Hogwarts.

But I would classify those fics as AU rather than bashing. I wonder if some would consider them bashing though?

You could for example argue that in Prince of Slytherin James gets bashed. He is a bad person in this Fic without a question, but all the bad and stupid decisions he makes have a reason that is understandable from his point of view.

At least according to my personal definition of bashing in FF needs to have excessive negative character Traits that weren't that prominent in canon and are not given a reasonable explanation in the fic.

I think it was the sacrifice, Harry's pain, and just generally the way the scene was written that got me more than it being Dobby. Or maybe it was that it was Dobby, who was so relatively innocent and harmless.

I do know that different character's deaths throughout the series affected different people different ways, though. My dad had a tough time with Sirius, and my mom cried when she found out that Remus and Tonks were dead. Neither cried for Dobby, both were very sad about Hedwig.

*** I actually tend to argue on the basis of house-elves and slavery in Harry Potter. Like, I /know/ that slavery is wrong, but the house elves don't think of it as slavery. Hell, they /need/ to be serving a family or they end up killing themselves or drowning themselves drunk in butterbeer like Winky. All of the house elves in Hogwarts were disgusted with Dobby because he was a free elf and he got compensation for working. (Though, that might be fanon, the last time I read the books was like four years ago or something.)

I don't see much of a problem with house-elves belonging to families so long as they're not abused and are treated decently. As a matter of fact, the /house-elves themselves/ didn't see anything wrong with it! You can't just pass laws freeing house elves as Hermione wanted to straight away--house-elves have been enslaved for centuries and both wizards and house elves are used to that. The best way to start would be by passing laws against corporal punishment against house-elves, eventually getting to the point that if house-elves want to be freed, they should be freed automatically.

There's also the fact that house-elves /aren't human/. Yes they're sentient beings, yes slavery's wrong, but you can't treat house-elves as humans. They have different needs than humans.

Many fics compensate for the blatant slavery by making it so that many house-elves like being bonded with families either because they get a boon of magic to use or because they're just more powerful that way. There's also a lot of fics where house-elves need to be bonded or they'll slowly die or go insane, like Winky. That's just one way featuring why house-elves aren't human.

Beings, yes; human, no.

Moody and Tonks I see usually only when it's a order or the light are bad actually story.

Tonks I also occasionally see bashed for Remadora critical stuff but that's pretty rare and usually that more likely to be Lupin bashing than Tonks.

*** Does it count as bashing when Tonks acts slutty and promiscuous for no reason? I've read a fair amount of stories like that.

For example, I read a story recently where Tonks decided to seduce Snape in her 5th or 6th year. Because Tonks decided she hated her mother and she would get back at her by sleeping with Snape. Or something.

But the worst part is is that it just came out of nowhere and wasn't even the main pairing! No underage warning, either. I was like, “Whoa, what?”

That seems to be the main distinguishing feature of stories with slutty Tonks in them. It's not PWPs where it's sort of understandable. She's just dropped into fics without warning to be an irresistible, shape-changing, wet dream for no apparent reason except to make one character or another jealous or stir the drama pot.

I would never be able to read this. This probably counts as Bashing, or a kind of very stupid, hateful and nonsense development.

I really hate all these teacher-student relationships that fandom has made. It's disgusting. And it's usually about Snape, I don't know where people's fetish for this character comes from. Fortunately I can just filter these tags most of the time.

And I mostly don't like the student/teacher pairings either. They can be good if they're done with delicacy, sensitivity, and nuance, and (of course) making sure all the characters are of consenting age, but that only represents about 5% of the fics in the genre, lol.
