For those who don't know, a big part of the plot of Mega Man 8 (aside from the usual Wily escapades) is that a dangerous substance called 'Evil Energy' has fallen to Earth.

Possessing the ability to infect people's (and robots') minds, it...replicates or something by using the evil in their minds as fuel, before spreading to others and repeating the process. I'm not sure, I haven't played it for ages and ages.

But yeah, can we have a crossover between Mega Man 8 (and this Evil Energy) and Harry Potter, pleeeease? Or, you know, any plot with Tom Riddle and his Death Eaters being turned evil by some parasite or stuff, if you don't want to crossover with MM8.
