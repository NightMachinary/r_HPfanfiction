I don't know if this fic exist but I think this would be interesting ;D do you know this kind of the story?


** [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/8127][*Shadow Walker* by lorien829]] fits this but I'd recommend you to read *Shadwow Walks* linkffn(6092362) first.

*** I consider this fic required reading, it helps set up all fanfiction as multiverse theory. Not only that, but the writing is amazing, and at times heartbreaking. There's one or two fanon Easter eggs (evil Harry makes an appearance, Harry's family never died, etc.)

Really suggest it!

**** It's difficult without spoilig the plot but if you're interested: [[/spoiler][Harry finds out Hermione may still be alive and was transported to a parallel universe. Harry ends up hopping through alternate universes and encounters different versions of the people he knows while looking for "his" Hermione.]] It's pretty angsty but does has fluffy moments in it.

Shadow Walker is sort of a companion story but has [[/spoiler][a Hermione from an alternate universe]] as the protagonist.

Both are great reads (any story from the author really) and have zero bashing.

***** Hmm, I don't want spoilers, so I'm not gonna read that, but I'll give it a try right now anyway. I liked the picture.

edit: actual spoiler marks. Now I know which parts I can read. Thanks for the info.

** I /kinda/ have one that fits it, but I'm having trouble finding it. It's an AU/time travel thing where Harry goes into an alternate dimension where many things are different. There he and Hermione are dating, Lily is still alive, and Sirius turned out to be a Hogwarts professor.

Gonna look around for it some more, or hopefully someone will recognize the description and link
