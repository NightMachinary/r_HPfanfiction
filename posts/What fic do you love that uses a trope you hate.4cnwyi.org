** The Life and Times, linkffn(5200789), is one of my absolute favourites but it's got the James-asks-Lily-out-for-years-everyone-knows-he-loves-her-she-doesn't-care-until-he-stops-asking-her-out trope going on. And Lily's a ginger. Why is Lily always a ginger in fics?! We've known her hair colour since literally 1997. It's been nearly 20 years. Everyone stop. Plus the author took every single member of the old Order and made them the same age, which is another trope I dislike. Also Marlene being close friends with Marauders/Lily.

All that aside, it's one of the few fics that actually has Peter being best friends with the other boys and not a tagalong! And Peter doesn't act suspiciously! And the OCs are fantastic.

*edit: I've come to learn that in the UK, 'ginger' is used as a catch-all for all shades of red hair (often combined with pale skin and/or freckles). My anger for Lily-as-a-ginger stems from the fact that where I am, the people I talk to generally use 'ginger' to describe only bright orange hair (Weasley hair, to be exact); other shades of red are just called 'red.' I didn't pick up on this in the books because Lily was only described by JKR as 'dark red haired' but never explicitly 'ginger.' It's a jargon issue, not an actual trope/mistake by fans.

**** Nope. She's got auburn hair. (Edit: where I am, ginger and auburn/dark red aren't used interchangeably. I didn't realise ginger is used as a catch-all in other places, so I've only interpreted ginger as orange hair)

PS: described as a pretty woman with "dark red hair" and eyes just like Harry's

OotP: described a girl with "thick dark red hair that falls to her shoulders."

DH: Voldemort's memory had a mother with "long dark red hair falling over her face"; Snape's memories: "pale face, dark red hair"; Sorting Hat barely touching "dark red hair"

There you go, first mention in 1997. Her hair colour is mentioned literally every time we see her (except as a ghost/shadow).

If he hadn't been a true friend, do you honestly think the other three would have kept him around since first year? Personally, I think of him as someone who was a genuine friend, albeit less much spineless, who was approached by Voldemort or Death Eaters and then scared shitless about being torchered or killed. It many just be my headcanon, but I don't think the others would have trusted him otherwise. I mean, they thought Remus was the spy in the Order. REMUS. The least likely of them all. The one that had been shown the most love and acceptance and was the most loyal, especially to Dumbledore. So Peter had to have proven somehow in the past that he was trustworthy.

** linkffn(Nightmare by Provocative Envy), linkffn(10253523), and linkffn(Shared Flame by Lady Miya).

I'll start off my saying that one of my guilty pleasures is the pairing of Tom Riddle and Hermione Granger. Due to that, I've read almost every fanfiction where they're paired.

I recently talked about /Nightmare/ in [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4cgqo8/whats_the_weirdest_thing_youve_ever_seen_in_a_fic/][this thread]], and last night, I was discussing with a friend of mine that, even though this fanfiction is somewhat enjoyable and well-written, it uses a plot that I absolutely despise. That plot being "a major, female character (Hermione) gets pregnant". /Euphoria/ also uses it, though I don't enjoy /Euphoria/ as much as I did /Nightmare/.

Hell, Hermione gets knocked up by Riddle, through rape by deception, in the first chapter of /Shared Flame/.

I also have issues with the abusive relationship portrayed in /Nightmare/, though I'm not sure if that's intentional or not. I also had a really hard time following or understanding what Envy meant to communicate, and using "fuck" every other word doesn't exactly help with that. Which...is weird, because I know my favorite fic, linkffn(Tied for Last by Speechwriter), also has been criticized for portraying an abusive relationship between Tom and Hermione.

My main problem with /Nightmare/, however, is that Riddle uses reproductive coercion to control Hermione, and I find how it's portrayed to be downright scary. It makes me think of how many young, impressionable people might be reading this, and get the wrong idea of how a proper relationship is supposed to be. Even more so, since most fanfiction readers (and writers) tend to be women themselves.

One of the main tropes I can't stand, but it's used surprisingly frequently by some authors in the Tomione sub-fandom, is Hermione getting pregnant by Tom, again, usually by rape by deception, or reproductive coercion. It's utterly scary to me how this seems to crop up more often in Tomione than other pairings, and I've read other pairings. For example, even in Dramione or Snamione fanfictions, or stories that pair Hermione with Draco Malfoy or Severus Snape, you won't see nearly the same sort of prevalence of abuse and manipulation.

It also makes me wonder why so many Tomione writers, who are also women, write Hermione as being a complete doormat when it comes to Riddle, or why they are writing Riddle as an abusive asshole to begin with. It makes me ponder why these women not only write, but also romanticize, such abuse and coercion. It makes me think of the kind of trashy writing you'd read in, for related fanfiction or the real deal, Stephenie Meyer's /Twilight/, or E.L. James's /50 Shades of Grey/.

I can understand some authors having kinks or fetishes - I do. However, the prevalence in which they pop up in Tomione fics, in particular, has me worried, along with the romanticization of abuse. My friend, who is a Tomione writer herself, also noted that "she notices these tropes a lot in the sub-fandom, too".

**** I would say that if that is the writer's defensive for the criticism, then he or she needs to take a closer look at Riddle's character. In the books, the films, and even as per Rowling herself, Riddle doesn't like "to get his hands dirty". Physical abuse would count as "getting his hands dirty". I'd argue that Riddle resorting to directly abusing others is not only OOC for Riddle, but that he'd view himself as above such a petty way of cowing others into submission. Most times, Riddle doesn't torture his victims, or toy with them before a murder; he simply kills them. After all, Morfin and Marvolo Gaunt were abusive assholes to Riddle's mother, Merope, and Riddle had no love for them.

  COMPLETE: A broken time turner shouldn't have sent me back so far. It was unprecedented. Stepping on it-smashing it-nothing should have happened. At most, I should have lost a week. At worst, I should have disappeared altogether. I shouldn't have traveled back fifty-two years; half a bloody century. This should not have happened. HG/TR.

*** Sort of related. I read a lot of Sirius x Remus because I believe, from the depths of my soul, that they were meant to be together. A lot of these fics though fall into the "everyone is gay" trope which drives me insane. Like I can deal with up to two other gay couples (like Harry x Draco which tends to crop up a fair bit or Percy x Oliver) but after that it starts to get ridiculous because I can no longer suspend my belief

**** If it's a version of Magical Britain that hasn't had homophobia for centuries, then we would expect more than the 2-3% of the out homosexual population we see today. At 10% of the population, we'd expect to see about a dozen students who are homosexual and of dating age at Hogwarts.

You'd practically need soul bonds just to find someone compatible to date. It's about as bad as with purebloods:

  Neville: "Gran wants me to marry a pureblood, but she won't sign a marriage contract for anyone closer than third cousin for me."

  Harry: "So?"

  Neville: "There are only four of them within five years of my age. Three are Slytherin pureblood supremacists. I like the last one, but she's getting married next year."

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.
