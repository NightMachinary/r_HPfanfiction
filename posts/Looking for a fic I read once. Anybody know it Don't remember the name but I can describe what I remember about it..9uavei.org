Yeah so this fic was half blood prince, maybe a one shot. It was about Harry flat out pressing Dumbledore to tell him everything and teach him how to fight instead of dragging it out all year long, so Dumbledore shows him the memories of Tom Riddle immediately and Harry is all like "I don't see how this is gonna help me dude". Then they go see another one and Harry says the same thing. Dumbledore's like "You'll understand if you see more". So they do and Harry still doesn't see the point of it. Dunno where it went from there or whatever but that's all I got. Soooo yeah. Anybody know what it's called? Thought it was pretty interesting to have Harry not beat around the bush and want to learn how to actually fight instead of coasting like he does in the canon books. xD


** sounds like every indy!harry fic ever.
