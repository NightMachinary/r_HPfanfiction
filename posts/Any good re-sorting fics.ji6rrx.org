Does anyone know any good stories where either the whole school is resorted or just upper classmen etc. and Harry goes into slytherin? I've read a couple I liked and just looking for more. Thanks!


** This one doesn't have a resorting, but they do an exchange program. So Harry spends time in all the houses, but stays in Slytherin the longest.

  Harry doesn't mind that so many Slytherins from his year have returned to finish their NEWTs, really he doesn't. It's just -- do they have to be so friendly? He's not prejudiced, really he's not. It's just -- they've got to be up to something, right? Unnerved by the attention he's attracting from everyone -- the Slytherins are the least of it, to be fair -- and struggling with a raft of changes to Hogwarts itself, Harry wishes he could be happy that one constant remains: Draco Malfoy really fucking hates him.When he's hit by an illegal love-spell though, Harry finds he has more to worry about than whether or not Blaise Zabini actually wants to be his friend. For if everyone affected has been blessed -- or cursed, by the look on Malfoy's face -- with a magical tattoo revealing the name of their soulmate, what does it mean that Harry's skin remains completely bare?

** Perhaps not a re-sorting exactly, but in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Scrambled Sorting by TendraelUmbra) most of the cast is sorted into different houses because the sorting hat gets bored.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.
