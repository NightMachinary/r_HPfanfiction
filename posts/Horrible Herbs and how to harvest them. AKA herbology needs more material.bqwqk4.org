So, I've been searching a lot and come up nearly entirely emptyhanded :

Are there any fics or even any sort of extra material tot go a bit in-depth about Herbology? Because out of all of Hogwarts' subjects, it seems the most ignored save for astronomy perhaps. A real shame.

I'm thinking along the lines of Fantastic Beasts and where to find them (the little book), but for all kinds of mysterious plants instead of magical beasts. Surely there must be some sort of guardian plants, plants with a near sentience, plants that are basically immobile pets, plants that are dark and malevolent, plants that support unique beasts, plants that try to eat you, plants that can become a cozy house, plants you can converse with, plants that bring you your tea and grow a biscuit right beside it, plants that have /magic/?

Potions, wands, brooms, magical ecology, there are just so many opportunities with it. Does anyone know of such a fiction, or really any fic in which herbology might be explored? I remember reading one where Neville and Remus go plant-hunting, but its main focus just seemed a lot of slash. All I want is my booklet of weird and silly magical plants.

/Herbology!/ /Wicked weeds, humorous herbs, peculiar plants, terrible trees, gargantuan grasses, and fantastic flowers, all if it now available in/ Dallying in the Daisies, by Biggertoy Throbhard. Or something.\\
(edit for layout)


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/964492/chapters/1891343][Harry Potter and the Trail to Hogwarts]] is about wilderness survival and is mostly low level Herbology and Potions for at least the first half.

** Semi-spoilers for the recommended fic below.

The Sacrafices Arc by Lightening on the Wave has a character who is a dark witch OC who specializes in herbology and does some cool/messed up stuff with it. A rose bush that blooms when a very powerful wizard born and shows their alignment (light, dark, grey), thorns that grow through flesh (like I said, she's a dark witch), even a pod she crawls into a la Poison Ivy... Kind of. And a bunch of other stuff.

It's a pretty huge series of all seven years with a really complex magic system and cool OCs. It's slash... Kind of. Harry and Draco do a really formal courtship and it's never explicit.

I don't know if you want to read something this huge when it's a secondary character that kind of fits your request, but it is an excellent piece of ffiction.

It's also pretty harsh against James and Lily Potter and Dumbledore, but they earn it in the fic. They so earn it.

*** Oh heck yeah!!! Thanks for bringing this up--this series is unsurpassable. OP, it takes awhile to get to Indigena Yaxley (also called the Thorn Bitch!!!), but she is so worth it, and the whole series is wondrously imaginative, grim, and lovely. Highly recommend. I basically treat this series like actual favored books--I read it every summer.
