I only got into HP in 2012 and since then I felt like this. That I missed out on everything and now HP is dead and everyone has moved on.


** Harry Potter still has a huge following and more staying power than a lot of fandoms. As far as fanfiction goes HP tends to have huge amounts of fics, more than a lot of other fandoms or media. Depending on how popular your ships are fanfiction is still being written in droves (I ship Drarry and there is /tons/ of new stuff, all the time.

You might have missed the initial craze but HP is anything but dead.

P.S. if you haven't already go to [[/r/Harrypotter]] and join in! Get sorted too, common rooms tend to be friendlier and more active than the Great Hall (at least my common room is, anyway!)

*** Nothing against slash, to each there own I say, but while Draco/Harry makes up most of new fics it also is responsible for the largest percentage of absolute shit in the hp fanfic community

**** I won't argue with the fact that a lot of it is bad but I will say that it might just feel that way because there are just more Drarry fics in general. If 70% of all fanfiction is crap regardless of pairing, and there are more Drarry fics than not, then of course a larger number of shitty Drarry fics are out there. There's also a larger number of good ones, if you know where to look :)

***** A fair point. When wading through shit you are surrounded by all types. And you are being very generous with 70%

** I grew up reading the books. I got the first one when I was six and my mum read it to me. I was seven when the Chamber of Secrets was released and read it by myself. I got the rest of the books the day they were released. When HBP and DH were released I was fourteen and sixteen respectively, both times I convinced my mum to let me have the day off school so I could buy them and then read all day.

This was something I got teased for a /lot/ as few of my friends were into reading at this point, and those that were, weren't into Harry Potter.

I found fanfiction in late 2009 at eighteen when I wanted to read the Artemis Fowl books that I owned but couldn't find. I downloaded them and from there quickly found Artemis Fowl fanfiction. Shortly afterwards I found the Harry Potter fandom and quickly fell in love with the depth and breadth of stories. I've been reading it ever since. I even tried my hand at writing some fanfiction in 2010 but decided writing wasn't for me.

I say all this because even with this experience of growing up with the books, it's only in the last few months that I've really /participated/ in the fandom. I love discussing Harry Potter. I love the world and the magic. I love arguing about theories and head-canon with other fans - and I'm finally doing that with other people who are just as invested in the fandom. There are so many different places for people to talk about it and it's just going to keep growing. You've already found us here, there's also [[/r/harrypotter]] and [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/][Dark Lord Potter forums]]. A lot of the fanfiction sites have their own forums.

[[https://www.pottermore.com/][Pottermore]] released new information yesterday and it's already generating conversation and personal revisions of canon. There's big discussion threads here every day that get 100s of comments. An official [[/r/hpfanfiction]] debate was started recently that is just awesome to see.

You haven't /missed/ anything, you're just a little late to a party that has no end in sight. Try to participate as much as you can and I think you'll find it really rewarding.

** I strongly disagree. Half the stories on my favorites list are active and updating... It's in vogue to like Harry Potter right now; a huge amount of writers haven't moved on.

I've been reading fanfiction since the books started coming out, and I think the pool of quality material out there has only gotten deeper. [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SturgeonsLaw][If 90% of any one thing is crap]], your late arrival to the genre just means that there is a really large trove of the good 10% for you to go through!

Think on the bright side.

** No Harry Potter fan has or will ever "move on" I grew up reading the books. And I still reread the series now that I'm 26.

** I wouldn't say that you've missed the party, you are just a little late. The main difference is that liking Harry Potter is now considered "cool", whereas I was a "dork" for being a fan all throughout middle school when it started. I have a feeling JKR is going write another book soon (am I the only one getting that vibe with all this new content) and with the addition of the "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" movie, it's only just going to keep up and up.

/Maybe/ fanfiction has been on the slight decline, but you wouldn't know it if you looked on here :)

** I'm an avid marauder era RPer! I miss what it was like a decade ago when we were all younger with tons of time. If you are interested in group writing games or private storylines I can point you in a few good directions.

** I lived through it... and ignored it, by and large. I was more interested in reading Terry Pratchett than waiting around for Rowling to publish.

Funnily enough, the HP era is just starting for real now. The ideas, themes and communities that grew out of the books have taken on a life of their own and spread across to other media. As for waiting around, well, there's still a LOT of material Rowling or her successor could cover if she/they felt like it.

Besides, fanfiction. There's a lot of crap out there (some published by myself) but the best out there is amazing... and easily as good as a lot of other books being released today.

Don't be fooled-just like with Star Wars, Dune, Star Trek, The Lord of the Rings and many, many other universes out there, the end of the Original publications era is only the beginning.

We have decades of good stuff to look forward to. Don't beat yourself up for missing some of it.

** Well, in a sense it is different to be part of a fandom during publication vs. after it's completed.

I won't lie: while not a hardcore fan, I was around on the internet while the books were still being published, and spent many hours on forums reading various theories, ideas, etc. It was fun. The theorizing and speculation is really, really fun. The sense of community, of anticipation, the eagerness and mystery. The desperation to know how it all ends. And, of course, the fandom shipwars were great for sitting back and watching with some popcorn.

I've been a part, to some degree at least, several 'ongoing' fandoms (mostly manga-related, like Fullmetal Alchemist and Inuyasha, back when they were still publishing), and it's true that there's a shift in focus and activity once they complete publication. But even those fandoms are still active fic-wise.

Even now, there are several book series that have very active discussion but very little fanfiction for them (for example, the Stormlight Archive series, the Kingkiller Chronicles series, even A Song of Ice and Fire though there's much more fanfiction being written since the shows came out and people are largely starting to ignore GRRM's preference that fans not write fic based on his works). Part of the appeal of unfinished series is the ability to speculate and theorize midway through the story.

That said, some fandoms leave a lot more room for exploration after they're complete than others, and HP is one that leaves a LOT of ground uncovered. There are really limitless possibilities - past generations, present events, future timelines and a new generation. Different places, different groups. Many, many side characters that could be explored. It might not have the same sense of urgency and anticipation, but it's still quite active, and has had much more 'staying power' in terms of fandom activity than other series have had. Much of the best fan-work has been created after the series ended! I'm also expecting a pretty good fandom revival with the new Fantastic Beasts movies.

** I only joined FFN in march and there have been literally thousands of fics written between then and now. The forum I frequent is well moderated and is full of people every day.

The Fandom may no longer be growing exponentially and while some fans "grow out of it" new fans crop up all the time (for example my 8 year old who is currently reading them the first time).

I think the Fandom is pretty stable to be honest.

Welcome

** The part you missed was a lot of fun. Especially waiting for the books---I'll never forget seeing friends at the bookstore, comparing theories, staying up overnight and trying (usually in vain) to keep from reading the whole thing in one go, arguing on message boards, etc.

And the fandom was bigger too. A little nuts---if you think shippers get testy now, it was ridiculous then---but bustling and fun, though now that I'm older it seems like it would probably be exhausting to deal with.

But all that activity left a lot of cool stuff behind, and whether you were there for it or not that cool stuff is all that would be left for you now, seeing as we don't have pensieves. So don't worry about it too much, and stick around here and help make sure this next push (with new Pottermore stuff and the spin-off movie) is fun, too.
