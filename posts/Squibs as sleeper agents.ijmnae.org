Since wizards are willfully and painfully ignorant of the muggle world, why not use squibs to infiltrate the muggle world instead.

Any time a squib is born, the ministry takes over as their guardians and sends them to the best schools to try to get them placed in positions of power in the corporate, financial, and government positions that can best help the magical world.

Not to mention having agents placed in muggle law enforcement would be ideal for information gathering and monitoring muggle attacks and baiting.


** Well, in HBP Kingsley infiltrates the office of the Prime Minister and no one twigs that he's a wizard. Also in HBP, the Ministry of Magic is able to arrange for a phone call between the Muggle Prime Minister and a foreign President to take place at a different time.

So it seems that the Ministry has a pretty well-developed infiltration of Muggle government already.

*** The sorting hat can tell, so they could use that. Additionally, you can test to see if they can see poltergeists and interact with kneazles but be unable to see dementors which would identify them as squibs as well.

Edit: Additionally, the underage magic test seems incredibly accurate. Neville, someone who was thought to be a squib, displayed underage magic at 8 (thought his first unnoticed time was actually at birth). It seems pretty clear that if you haven't displayed magic by 8, you're probably a squib.

** They are bigots especially those present in the Ministry such as Fudge and Umbridge so they would never even think about helping or taking help from Squibs or Muggles. Even the Weasley's (who are a light family) never meet or even like to talk about their squib cousin so you can forget about others.

And they would be foolish to throw away any resource the could. Even if they see squibs as inferior, they are still a good resource that they can use to avoid having to have wizards monitoring the muggle world and society.

*** To be fair, how many people see and talk about their second cousin? Especially to small children?

I mean, I have an uncle who lives in Tokyo and I've never met him because he moved there when I was quite small. I imagine the same goes for a second cousin who essentially lives in a different world from the Weasley's of ottery st. Catchpole. An accountant would need to live in at least a moderately sized town, and likely has a nice house of lots of muggle electrical items----and probably doesn't want his second cousin Arthur messing everything up and doesn't invite them down as a result? And he essentially grew up in a different world----muggle primary and secondary, university etc while the Wizarding world was embroiled in a civil war. I don't imagine people were reaching out to their squib cousins and turning them into targets while Voldemort and cohorts were out wreaking havoc. And I don't know about you all, but if you drop contact for a decade, it's quite difficult to regain any sort of relationship with family that also lives a completely different lifestyle and doesn't really want you to come visit and embarrass them.

***** That could be true, but also---when he is being a judgy little boy, arguably, he's also a teenager. And people as teenagers want, more than at any other point in their lives, to fit in and be accepted. It's much more difficult to be open minded when you are also internally wrestling with your own insecurities and feelings of not quite belonging, and Ron has it harder there too since it seems that his family tends to unintentionally overlook and disparage him (from the books). I think Rowling wrote him as no more discriminating ---and possibly much more proactive and inclusive----than most teenagers. When I was sixteen/seventeen you certainly wouldn't have seen me risking life and limb for any cause, even to save my best friend. I'd call 911 then run for my life. He has a huge family who are quite close (as large families go) and he risks them for his best friend!

** I always see this done the opposite way, squibs go to the muggle intelligence agencies and give them the skinny on the magical world because they're not happy not being able to be part of it fully (and being abused, looked down on, cast out by their families, et, depending on the fic.)

*** But it simply wouldn't work. The level of control wizards have over their respective muggle counterparts is astounding. They were able to reschedule a phone call between the Prime Minister of the UK and a president of a foreign country. Imagine if China had done that. Kingsley literally worked in the Prime Minister's office.

A squib might potentially be able to go a muggle intelligence agency. They might, however unlikely, be taken seriously enough to actually prove the existence of magic. The existence of magic might be taken seriously enough to be passed on to the higher-ups in the respective agencies.

But then wizards would find out. Obliviators would wipe the memories of those who found out about magic, paper records and computer records would be obliviated (FB), and computer programs would probably be confunded to inform wizards of any future similar events (GoF). The squib would probably be arrested.

To stave off any arguments about how wizards can't do that because they don't know enough about muggles, I'll present a refutation in advance. Wizards know enough to run the best espionage programs. Wizards know enough to obliviate muggles and cover up major incidents well-enough. Arthur Weasley might not know much about muggle technology, but it's not exactly like he needs to. He regulates the enchantment of muggle objects. You don't need to know what a rubber duck is to figure out that they probably don't fly in the muggle world. The average wizard, who lives their life in a separate world, needs to know nothing about muggles.

****** The topic is not touched upon sufficiently to draw a conclusion. The early books suggest that wizards were outsmarting Muggles during the witch hunts, but later on JK sort of changed the course, with Death Eaters using the fact that Muggles drove them into hiding as an excuse for their hatred (albeit that could just be a misconception spread by Muggle-haters) and the ISS being established to protect one from the other.

Also I'm not sure how well your example with US and Madagascar works, considering that US's military campaigns have not been very successful since WW2, all while they were the greatest military force in the world and their enemies not very well equipped.

******* A closer review of the later books suggests the complete opposite. The witch hunts resulted in almost no Wizarding casualties. Only children were threatened. One witch got burned at the stake multiple times because it was fun. Wizards were annoyed by muggles.

Ignoring the hilariousness of relying on death eater ideology, the whole “Death Eater” ideology revolving around the idea of the threat of muggles is incorrect. That stems from canon. Their ideology was designed to ensure that they could justify themselves. Look at how they justify halfbloods in their ranks in GoF and HPB.

Indeed, a closer review of the later books reflect the same Wizarding control of muggle government. The prime minister receives a courtesy visit from the magical counterpart and is let known that wizards destroyed a bridge and let giants replicate the effects of a hurricane. Indeed, the muggle requests for help are denied because they are useless. Kingsley is put in the Prime Minister's office without asking him or informing him until much later on and does twice the work of everyone else.

I'm not even going to touch on the US issue.

*** But Squibs are supposed to be rare, or as canon puts it, [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Squib]["quite unusual"]]. How many are born in a year? How many are stay alive to 7 years old (usually the latest age accidental magic shows in children)? To 11? To 17? Lets say over 10 years, five Squibs are born out of 1,400 magical children (going off of this [[http://members.madasafish.com/%7Ecj_whitehound/Fanfic/numbers.htm][semi-canon reasoning]] for the yearly student intake, with ~94 students attending Hogwarts and Hogwarts students making up two-thirds of the total child population.)

All five reach seven years old, only three reach 11, and only one or two reach adulthood. Every ten years. After fifty you'd only have five-ten Squibs and that's not really enough for any spying measures.
