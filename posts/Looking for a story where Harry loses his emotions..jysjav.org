:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry is cursed by Voldemort before he kills him in the final battle and Ron ends up taking care of him post-war. The fic is Harry/Ron but I want to reread it because I remember really liking the way the story was written and paced. Basically Harry slowly starts to feel again after several months. I thought I found it through a reddit post, but I've scoured this sub and searched through ao3 and still haven't been able to find it. Anyone remember this fic?
