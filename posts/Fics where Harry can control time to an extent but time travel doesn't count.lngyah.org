I'm talking about having the ability to stop time, slow down time, speed up time, erase/skip time, precognition but he can see only seconds or a minute into the future, maybe rewinding time but only for a few seconds or a minute.


** I think Magicks of the Arcane had something like that towards the mid/end of the story

** this is just overpowered to the maximum, depending on the way you take this.

if its unlimited the way he can slow down time for himself, he essentially becomes the fastest thing that can ever exist. It would litterally make him capable of taking on an army by himself nonlethally without issue.
