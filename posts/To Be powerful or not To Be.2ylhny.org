So as all of you know, there is a LOT of powerful Harry fics, and I was wondering why it is so? I thought asking you guys the following questions, while supplying my own answers too :)

*Do you love/hate godlike/powerful Harrys (or other characters), and why?

*What kind of powerfulness do you like? (MoD, creature etc)

*What is the best one you read either recently or at all?

My answers: *I like godlike Harry's because it shuffles the general underdog setup up a bit. Of course I read a lot of badly written or downright stupid ones and I have to say, it isn't easy to write a good powerful but balanced storyline.

*I like MoD Harrys but it's a bit overused I think. I didn't really read any "creature" Harry stories whatever that means. To be honest I don't mind what type he is as long as the other characters know where their place is :D

*The one that comes to mind at the moment would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10136172/1/Core-Threads][Core Threads]], which is a funny fic, not my usual darker ones, but it's really well written.

So what about you?


** I generally dislike Ultra powerful and Super Harry, mostly because most Super!Harry stories rarely have any meaningful conflict in them. Of course, there are a few stories where Super!Harry doesn't just curb-stomp all opposition -- Joe's Wastelands of time comes to mind, but they are extremely rare. Even there, it's hard to relate to the protagonist, with Harry being Harry in-name-only.

The best characterizations of Harry are those more or less close to canon. Stories like /On the Way to Greatness, Hogwarts Battle School/ and /Backwards with a Purpose/ come to mind. Harry Potter should always be recognizable as Harry Potter, or should at least start off as canon Harry before the author pushes him in an AU direction. Often Authors power up Harry for no good reason at all, or write their story so that Harry becomes powerful overnight. If you power up Harry, do it for a good reason and in a believable way. The level of conflict should match the competence of the protagonist. Super!Harry powering through all opposition is /always/ distasteful to read about.

** I like it if Harry is written as having the potential to become Dumbledore/Voldemort like given that he studies magic for another 20+ years. I don't like it if an eleven year old struts into Hogwarts, looks at three books and is ready to fight Voldemort, if you know what I mean. I think we all know these fics where Harry learns for roughly three chapters until he finds some secret ability (or the reader gets told Harry learns that because, horcrux, because telepathy because /insert supernatural aid here/).

If I read a powerful!Harry fic I want him to have something that plays with the magic system a bit, or something that gets him in a legal grey area. I once read a fic where he was a pyromancer, forgot how that one was called, and the Wizengamot wanted to imprison him for his ability to control fiendfyre with his mind saying that he must be a 'fireborn' aka. a literal demon.

The best one is, I think, Firebird. In that he is created to be powerful as part of a plan but he never gets to a point where theres no one around that can beat him. Theres always a bunch of wizards who could either outsmart him or overpower him in a 1v1.

** I'm not a fan of especially powerful or Godlike Harrys. I like Harry to be a bit more competent and studious than he is in canon but giving him uber powers usually ruins all suspense. Voldemort simply isn't a threat to any sensible Master of Death Harry. That usually means that the author concocts some random entity that is also rediculously powerful. It all gets out of hand rather quickly.

However, I have enjoyed a few Uber!Harry fics. They're pure wish fulfilment and not really worth revisiting but they were OK at the time.

Personally I think that simply giving Harry a decent work-ethic is enough to mute the frustration I felt with his canon characterisation. Anything more needs to be thought about very carefully. MoD Harry is, in my opinion, best used as a form of tragedy (immortality is a curse etc etc).

My favourite Uber!Harry is probably [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2829366/1/Dimension-Hopping-for-Beginners][Dimension Hopping For Beginners]]. It shows just how little plot there is when Harry gets that powerful. Although I also like the HP/Avengers crossovers that use a MoD Harry. They can get away with it because the bad guys are also much more powerful.

** Eh... giving Harry superpowers is almost always a bad idea. It's also often accompanied with the whole magical core/reserves and Heir of Merlin stuff, and almost always turns him into a 6'4 sculpture of David.

Why? Just why?

Not that I'm completely against Harry getting stuff done. I know a couple of users here are against an even slightly competent Harry, but the guy did make Head Auror before the age of thirty, and he had a strange knack for knowing what was 'magically' right towards the end of the series (i.e. locket at the Lake scene in DH). HBP did a lot to curb the potential many of us saw in him, I think.

So all that being said, I love a Studious! or Badass!Harry just as much as the next reader, but Harry is first and foremost a /wizard/ - not a dragon, Veela, elemental, demon or whatever. Likewise, simple and mostly crude wandless magic is okay, but a wandless Stunning Spell is just ridiculous.

And "Master of Death" Harry? Not sure how I feel about Death actually being an actual, singular entity, omnipresent or otherwise. I find Dumbledore's interpretation of the Peverell brothers to be rather more appealing, though I'm actually working on a story in my AU that somewhat bridges the two.

** My Stance on uber!Harry is that it should occur from the base canon!Harry. I like it when He becomes powerful on his own merits. I don't care if in the end, he ends up killing Voldemort with some ease. He just shouldn't have to rely on inheriting some obscure power from Merlin/Slytherin/Griffindor/Peverell or whatever.

I think the stories that portray this the best were Wastelands of Time, where everything is powered up along with Harry, or Knowledge is Power, where Harry works for every scrap of power he has with a single minded purpose.

I only enjoy MOD in crossovers. Mostly because Harry becomes MOD right at the end of Canon, and at that point, there is very little you can do with the plot regarding Voldemort.

** I too like reading Core Threads because it is genuinely original in its unoriginal super Harry trope use. It is so cliched, it actually loops around to being original again.

Similar to the likely-abandoned [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]], its a vehicle to explore tropes and odd situations, so I don't ever actually expect to see it finished. And I don't think it needs to be finished. It exists as a sort of continuing experience in my mind. As a story, it has serious flaws, but it makes up for them by being really engagingly written.

Also, it isn't pointless Grim Dark Seriousness, pointless AU rambling, or lol-tastic crackfic, which powered-up Harrys seem to attract like flies. This makes Core Threads a unique gem. It breaks a lot of rules by just being so damn easy to read, and occasionally flipping the table and doing something no really serious story could. That's something I really have a hard time finding, and really enjoy in a story. Being surprised by a fanfic is rare nowadays.

I'm tired of teen angst fics written by people trying to prove they aren't writing kiddy stuff for (ironically enough) sappy teens -- which is fine, but they over compensate in the worst way. Legion are the fics where Harry is oh-so-Dark, smokes, drinks, sexes anything and everything female, is close friends (but *maximum no-homo*) with only the /coolest/ guys at school (if any even show up in the story), and ohyeah: he's super powerful magically because he's so hard core, has a stronger will than Merlin, and got totally swol last summer.

Yawn.

Oh, and the conflict is Dumbledore being a vanilla unreasonable, manipulative, no-fun adult getting in the way of Harry riding a motorcycle and (again) sexing all the girls. So Harry's plan is to bargain with goblins to marry all the female things to defeat the blah blah blah?

Double-yawn.

On the other side, powerful Harry does silly things simply because because its /so random/? He has power-given brilliant insights about life, frolics with Mother Goddess worshiping, misunderstood, rescued damsel-in-distress Luna naked under the Moon literally for chapters, and reduces Draco to no-longer-Muggle-hating tears with the power of love and understanding, all while the tissue-thin plot waits until they're finished? Also, he's totally into late '00s pop culture and makes references that make no sense for either the UK or the '90s?

Christ. My eyes can't roll hard enough, nor my fingers close the tab on my browser fast enough.

But given that, some of the best fics I've ever read have ramped up everyone else /along with Harry/ to better add more and more interesting magic, while still keeping Harry as the underdog in meaningful ways.

Harry being the underdog is key to his very character. In the stories, he's never /not/ fighting against the odds in big, meaningful ways, even if he doesn't know it. That's why so many super Harry and "after Hogwarts" fics fall flat for me. They don't keep that up, and it is Harry in name only. An adult or prodigal kid with the same name, but none of the flavor, or with it awkwardly stabled back on in other ways.

For a number of reasons, these included, very few super Harry fics approach top tier in my lists -- that is, those that have Harry be absurdly powerful compared to canon wizards, not just canon Harry. The biggest failing is in basic storytelling.

/Hint: if your story doesn't have meaningful conflict, it isn't a good story. It is either a fictional diary or a guidebook full of oddly specific fantasy./

Angst alone isn't conflict, nor do simple dating politics or normal coming-of-age tropes raise the stakes enough to be engaging for most people in a story also featuring absurdly AU and overpowered magic.

I like lots of magic in my HP fanfic. Strong, original stuff that's well explored and explained is my favorite /subject/. But most of the time, that makes the story about a super Harry. And that almost always goes really, really wrong.

** Depends what you want out of a Power fic. If you want overwhelming, fantasy - fulfillment then you get a story like Sunset over Britain, but fics like that are pretty boring.

Similarly, fics where Harry is a genius and somehow skips and jumps to the correct conclusion despite very little evidence to draw upon also lose my interest.

Think of it like superheroes. Harry is the same. He is a Wizarding superhero.

But all superheroes need a good villain. That's where most fics fail.

** If the stories are written well enough, then I think it's quite possible to do a good powerful!Harry fic.

Off the top of my head, I'd say my requirements include:\\
1. as [[/u/PsychoGeek]] says, the conflict has to be scaled appropriately 2. the source of Harry's power must be "realistic," and not be based on a very flimsy precedent 3. there must still be a limitation (or at least a minor flaw) to Harry's powers or he's basically God

** Harry in canon is already extremely powerful. He is shown to routinely casting very powerful spells at an early age and be quite proficient at them. He did defeat 100 dementors at once with a single patronus at age 13 after all. And he did legitimately won the triwizard tournament against competitors who were the best of their schools and three years his senior (sure he had help behind the scenes to prepare him, but he did do most of the stuff himself. And the other competitors also had help so that evens out).

Later he became the head auror before age 30. All of which shows he is an extremely powerful and capable wizard.

So it's not that ridiculous to make him more studious or to give him that extra boost or a bit or training (why wouldn't it make sense for Sirius teach him how to be an animagus for example?). I don't think it's too farfetched to make Harry the next Dumbledore if done right.

the real question is: "will this make for an interesting story?" and more often than not this is where it falls flat. Making Harry more powerful doesn't work unless you give him a legitimate threat to keep the story interesting.

*** I think that's overstating the case a bit. Harry is certainly a significantly above-average magical talent (as is Ron, for all the maligning he gets), but significantly below Hermione and Snape, and nowhere near Dumbledore and Riddle.

Other than the Patronus, the feats you list are not primarily magical but athletic and social. /Routinely/, he learns magic along with his age-cohort; and he sometimes studies ahead in DADA, often with mixed results. Fortunately for Harry, all Triwizard tasks had a major athletic component, or could be approached in this way; good thing for him that there wasn't a Potions-brewing contest. And, while everyone received help in Triwizard, I doubt that either Maxine or Karakoff went as far as to use the Imperius on their Champion's competition to knock out their other competition. And, after defeating Voldemort (mostly with luck and wand shenanigans), and with many, perhaps most, Aurors either dead or compromised, he'd have to work /not/ to become Head Auror.

Patronus is a complicated gauge, because it appears to have to do as much with the mindset of the caster and the caster's environment as it does with magical skill. (There is a reason Harry practiced in front of a boggart; and in DA, several students learned to cast it in an ideal environment very quickly.)

The main practical difficulty with the Patronus appears to be that dementors suck away the very happiness one needs to cast it, and overcoming that is a function of courage and nerve, not magical skill; and in PoA, Harry was helped by the fact that the dementors were going after his time-clone, and since he was ambushing them from a distance, it didn't matter if it was 1 or 1000, as far as the difficulty level was concerned.

**** Harry's talents never lay in being book smart (though he is certainly no slouch either) but have always been in the more practical side of magic.

I don't think looking at his points in the classroom is a good indicator of talent. Because to even suggest that Hermione or Snape (given the same age) would be better than him is to completely miss the point of what makes a person strong/talented.

- Who could have defeated a basilisk as age 12?

- How many people his age could enter an arena with a Hungarian Horntail and survive?

- How many thirteen year olds can cast a patronus and successfully scare away a hundred dementors? Lupin said that most adult wizards can't even cast it.

- ...

Harry has always managed to get shit done when it was needed. Sure a Hermione or a Snape are good at studying and doing research but they don't have Harry's raw talent.

All it takes is a few small tweaks in his personality or a push in the right direction and his raw talent can become so much more. Harry certainly has a shit load of potential and given enough experience under his belt he can become an extremely powerful duelist.

***** So, just to make sure that I follow your argument, what makes a person "strong/talented" in a magical world is reckless levels of courage and /athletic talent/? Dumbledore and Riddle must have also been star Quiddich players in their time, then.

Seriously, I don't think that anyone doubts that Harry is a star athlete, and, that had he been a Squib, he could have been a champion race car driver, an ace fighter pilot, or maybe even a special forces commando. How that translates into a prodigious talent in learning and doing magic, I don't know.

Because, so far, the only actual magical feat of note that you've brought up is the Patronus. I've addressed the quantity issue in the post to which you replied (and hadn't bothered to address), but as for most adults not being able to cast it, consider that it's not taught until the DADA NEWTs (because, really, it's pretty useless unless your work brings you close to Dementors), and only a small minority of wizards ever take those. /Of course/ most adults couldn't cast it. OotP suggests that most adults could /learn/ to cast it in a few weeks to months of sporadic practice. (Casting it in the face of a Dementor is a different talent; and not a magical one.)

Isn't that what basically happened in canon, when he became an Auror?

I don't think that it's fair to imply that he didn't develop his dueling skills, though. The massive amount of time he had put into Quiddich practice was, essentially, practicing his situational and spatial awareness, evasion, and hand-eye coordination, and training himself not to flinch in the face of fast things flying at him (like bludgers and the ground). All these skills are directly transferable to dueling, and are what allows him to punch far above his magical weight.

He also invested a lot of effort into DADA, including trying to learn dueling magic ahead of the curriculum in time for TWT; and then consolidating that skill when teaching it in the DA.

Would more focused training yielded better results faster? Probably. Would it be some massive difference that would have allowed him to confront Voldemort in a pitched battle and win without wand weirdness? Not even close. Snape? Probably not either.

*Edit:* Fixed a missing word.

****** I think the biggest hurdle to overcome is how to define "talent".

You seem focused only on the academic side of things and point out that others are better at doing research or memorizing facts. Sure I agree that Hermione has him beat there. While harry is no slouch and managed to score 7 OWLs, including the highest score in DADA, he has been beat by others in written tests.

But in a combat situation (and that's what 99% of these stories are about) there are a shitload of other factors at play. The ability to think on your feet, your reflexes, your spatial awareness, your ability to keep cool under pressure etc. And it is canon that Harry is really good at this. He is by far the best duelist of his age-group and even managed to fight and win against fully trained adult wizards.

I agree that Riddle and Voldemort are above his league for another 50 years (wizards seem to age differently than muggles and have their prime much later in life) but others like Snape or most death eaters can be defeated by him. (not at age 11, of course. but near the end of his Hogwarts career)

And since you insist I address it:

I highly disagree that his actions against the dementors were a mere fluke or that "anyone could have done it". The patronus spell needs to be powered more for every extra dementor it faces. There is an enormous difference between 1, 2, 3 or 100 dementors. Harry's spell there showed an enormous magical potential that shows he is certainly capable of being a monstrous powerhouse on the battlefield.

I am not sure how you got this from what I wrote. These others I've pointed out I pointed out because they were better at learning, inventing, and/or /doing/ magic. On the other hand, 2/3 of your unsurpassed feats of Harry involve feats of swordsmanship and airborne dogfighting. In actually impressive magic, the only example you've given so far is the Patronus, which is a tiny, if very flashy, subset of magic.

Powerful!Harry fics are Powerful!Harry fics. They are not Fast!Harry fics or Agile!Harry fics. They generally involve feats of magic, not of manual dexterity. A fic that involves Harry who is worse at magic than his opponents but manages to win due to these factors is the exception, not the rule.

Like all the others in the DA, he wins some, and he loses some. With Snape, my assessment is that, unless Harry can learn general Occlumency, he will probably lose anyway; and if he does and gets some Auror training, they'd probably be pretty evenly matched, with the outcome depending on circumstances and terrain, because their styles are likely to be very different.

If Harry had the potential to defeat Dumbledore or Voldemort in a pitched battle and without wand weirdness, we'd have noticed it sooner. Athletic talent can only take one so far at that level (e.g., when your opponent can spam Apparation while interdicting yours, and conjure armies of things to attack you, it doesn't matter how quick on your feet you are), and his ability to keep his head under fire can be learned by others with experience. He might get good enough to "defy" someone like Voldemort --- meaning that he could last long enough to get away. His parents managed that, as did the Longbottoms.

Despite that expression being in quotes, I never wrote or implied that that was the case. Please don't misrepresent what I wrote. What I /actually/ wrote that most wizards could probably learn to cast it under ideal circumstances, and that casting one while being affected by a Dementor was a somewhat different talent. (To be specific, it's more about courage and nerve.)

I wouldn't say that it was a fluke. I would say that there were mitigating circumstances, and that it's not as indicative of general magical aptitude as you seem to be saying.

A Patronus is a glowing silvery animal powered by unreserved joy that repels Dementors by its proximity. It's not used up when it does so, at least not that we saw. Dementors make it harder to cast and sustain the Patronus by draining the caster's happiness and disrupting the caster's focus, and Harry is to be admired for his ability to sustain a corporeal Patronus despite that. Do you disagree with any of this?

Now, it is, indeed, an impressive feat for a 13-year-old, but most of his opponents won't be Dementors, and his aptitude for the Patronus does not seem to translate to any prodigious magical aptitude in other areas, and not for lack of trying. If it did, you wouldn't be stuck with the Patronus as your only decent example.

--------------

On a meta level, for better or for worse, it feels like Harry was never meant to /win/ through his own competence in anything that didn't involve brooms. At most, his own skills were sufficient to /not lose/ long enough to either break even or for fate or outside forces to intervene and defeat his enemies. (It's kind of disturbing, when you think about it; but, really: Every. Single. Book.) His level of competence was set accordingly.

There are powerful!motivated!Harry fics, and there are powerful!curious!Harry fics, and there are powerful!mentored!Harry fics, but make canon Harry Very Powerful, and what changes? He doesn't have to spend as much time on his magical studies and the adventures imposed on him extrinsically (i.e., nearly all of them) are suddenly much, much easier, so he spends more time hanging out with Ron and playing Quiddich. And, he doesn't exactly go out of his way to find challenges and things to improve. His heroic actions are almost universally impulsive and reactive in nature. So, giving him Great Power is good for him; but is it interesting?

So, vast, vast majority of the fics, good and bad, that fall into this subgenre feature a proactive, hard-working, intrinsically motivated OC whose name just happens to be "Harry", and who may or may not share some background with Harry.
