As the title says, I'm looking for a fic where the house system is more important to the plot. I've always felt that sorting everyone at such a young age was a bad move. No one stays the same as they were at 11. So, if anyone knows any fics where they reevaluate which house suits the students best every few years, I'd be very grateful if you shared it with me.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Houses Divided]] is a next gen story which is exactly this. The style is pretty rowlingesque, it's very well written, and concerns the folly of and prejudices surrounding the house system.

The author's summary: "The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?"

** It's very old, but Marshes to Banks's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1809837/1/Holding-Court][Holding Court]] has the house system be integral to the plot. They don't resort, however.
