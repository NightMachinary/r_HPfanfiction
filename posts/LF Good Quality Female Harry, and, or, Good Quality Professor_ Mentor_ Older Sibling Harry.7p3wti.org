*** As powerful as Harry is in this, I can't help but feel that the author still somewhat underpowers her to a level that's far too low for a thousands year old witch.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Five unique tasks. Eventual Animagus, morally ambiguous, and reasonably powerful fem!Harry. No bashing.

**** I haven't really decided on the final pairing. Romance isn't really a big part of the story. I'll be writing it in a way where I could choose from a few (Fleur, Tonks, or Daphne atm) when the time comes for the final pairing and it wouldn't drastically change anything.
