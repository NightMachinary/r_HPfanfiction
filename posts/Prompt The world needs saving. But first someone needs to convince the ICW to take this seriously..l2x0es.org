"It all began many eons ago, long before humans lived on this planet. Back then, there were billions and billions of lifeforms, and eventually they all died, but their life's energy did not simply dissipate away. Instead, it stayed behind, and over the millenia it slowly coalesced into something extraordinarily powerful and dark. For millions of years, the warped ancient energy stayed buried deep underneath the ground.

"That is, until relatively recently. There are people in the world have found the ancient power, and they have found out how to unleash it. But doing so would not be without consequence, for it would wreak havoc on the very balance of the Earth itself.

"And that is why we need to do something against the fossil fuel industry."


** My headcanon is that the ICW is like the United Nations: they can't really force any of their member nations to do anything.

** The fossil fuel industry is already dying:

- UK has reduced its coal consumption to the level of early 1800s
- Germany's renewables have exceeded 50% of its power generation mix for the first time. Coal percentage is collapsing
- US coal consumption is down 50% since 2010, and every publicly traded US company has gone bankrupt at least once since 2011
- Solar + Wind + Battery combo is already cheaper than coal and gas in most parts of the US. So cheap that the brutally rational billionaire capitalist Warren Buffett (who owns the 2nd largest utility in the country) decides to close all his coal plants by 2023
- China, the largest coal consumer, just saw its solar and wind installations going bonkers in 2020
- Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicle sales are collapsing in China and Europe, two largest auto markets in the world, while EV sales are skyrocketing
- Battery and EV technologies are improving at an accelerating pace. If you think Tesla Model 3 is good (it is very good already and annihilating its direct competition, the Audi A4/BMW 3 series/Mercedes C Class), you ain't seen nothing yet!
- The leader in EV, Tesla, will see at least quadrupling of its production capacity by 2025. VW, Renault, Rivian, and Chinese players are all busy ramping up.
- Wall Street has already realized this and brutally sold off oil & gas stocks. Exxon was kicked out of Dow Jones Industrial Average last year
- BP has admitted that peak oil consumption was 2019

The Magicals only need to speed up this trend and can even profit handsomely from it.

** Presumably the ancient evil will be released at the moment of Peak Oil. Possibly with accompanying planetary alignment /and/ a total eclipse.

*** I technically never said there was an ancient evil. Just something dark (which oil and coal are in terms of color) and that something would be released which would be bad for the balance of the planet (additional CO2 shifting the thermodynamical equilibrium). Basically a very roundabout way to describe global warming so that wizards can understand it as a threat.

** Easy: “My fellow racists, our very planet today faces a terrible threat! Muggles have somehow managed to use necromancy! Shocking, yes, but unfortunately true, and rather than having the basic human decency and common sense of keeping it a secret hidden from all who may seek to do something so foul as disrupting the sacred sleep of the dead they instead have chosen made it's use widespread! Terrible, yes, I know, but what else can you expect from filthy beings incapable of learning even the lesser of magicks? This time however they have gone too far and we are all at risk because of this abomination they have unleashed!

Lend me your ears my brothers in arms, for this is not for the faint of heart. Muggles somehow managed to get their hands on the rotten remains of magicless dragons! A species that has been killed off since before the first human walked this world, the corpses of those beings then fell into the very bowels of earth into a place no beast or plant could reach then to dispose of as is the correct cycle of nature, leaving their remains to rot and liquify into a black sludge that is today the only remain of the great suffering of those once proud beasts. But instead of leaving those remains alone to rest bellow the earth as is right the muggles unearthed them! And even worse, they managed to figure out a necromantic process to extract the strength of those poor animals to use on their wretched creations, making them slaves to their whims even in death to power the most unnatural of inventions: horseless carriages that have no magic! Terrible iron monsters that eat the elements of nature only to them give back bent and misshaped objects! Iron birds who send human dejects straight down to earth at great speed and that will dive-bomb the land killing hundreds!

At this moment, my trusted companions, you who are the wisest and more trusted of all our nations must be wondering as you rightfully should: ‘Why should we concern ourselves with the problems of muggles? They were the ones who let their arrogance and with their place on the world lead them astray despite all the stories and wisdom of those who came before to the point of choosing to defy nature through the use darkest of magicks. They were the ones to try flying to the sun when nature refused them wings, let them burn themselves' and I myself wouldn't be bothering those who sit on these hallowed halls were it to concern only our lessers, but it is unfortunately not the case! For the foul necromancy those wicked muggles have careless unleashed affects all those who dwell on this world.

For while might the magicless dragons who walked on this earth, even mightier is their hatred and suffering and through their careless use of such a foul art the muggles create a dark miasma that rises from the abominations they created into the very air as a smoke, that smoke then curses the planet itself to suffer as those beasts once suffered, rising temperatures to heights unfit to dragons, to say nothing of humans! Poisoning the very air we breath and fly in with untold diseases!

My companions, those rightfully given the burden and honor of guiding our society, I tell you now that we must take action immediately to stop the horrors those vile muggles have unleashed! For the darkness they have created is a threat for the survival of all living beings on the earth, sea and sky and if we don't act now... then I fear we shall be too late and all we will be able to do will be watch hopelessly as our children succumb to the dark powers the muggles have so foolishly unleashed while our planet burn around us”

--------------

In case it wasn't clear the entire idea of linking oil usage to necromancy is a reference to the excellent story linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12906362/1/Wyrd-Son]]) which I highly recommend, it is absolutely hilarious, though sadly it seems to be abandoned.

Yes, I realize and highly enjoy the fact that my bigoted nut job condemns muggles for finding ways of flying despite not being born with wings while in the same breath reminding the wizards around him that magicals did essentially the same thing.

Special thanks to the crazy street-preacher who sometimes goes to a square near my house rave his non-sense, I have had many good laughs strolling through the square on those days, I think about half of that speech is based on him..
