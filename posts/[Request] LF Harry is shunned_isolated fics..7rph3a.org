Hey there! I am looking for FanFictions where Harry is shunned/isolated by the school. (I tried using the search bar but no good results came). It can happen during the Norbert incident, the Heir of Slytherin incident, the Tri-Wizard incident, or the Daily Prophet slander incident (in the fifth book). I prefer, but it's not necessary if the fics handle the shunning/isolation in a very realistic or ambitious way like Harry get resorted into a different house or Harry begin to contemplate leaving or suicide. I also prefer the pairing to not be slash.

Thanks!


** Screw Them! and the sequel We're Screwed has what you are looking for!

** linkffn(8003129) is set during GoF. Harry is shunned by Gryffindor for his selection i. the Tournament, although several others (Hermione, Neville, Fred&George, IIRC) are shunned with him. Incomplete/abandoned but a decent fic nonetheless.

Edit: Also, linkffn(5797888) is kind of in the same vein as your request. One-shot were Harry is sorted into Slytherin and never makes any friends as a resut.

#+begin_quote
  During his fourth year, Gryffindor house is not as accepting of Harry's participation in the TriWizard Tournament, and use an old tradition called exclusion to force him into complaisance. Harry finds out who his true friends are and uses cunning to get his own brand of revenge.

  People often become who others expect them to be. When Harry was sorted into Slytherin, he realized he was alone, friendless, and apparently meant to be evil.

** Hmm...I know I've seen something like this in a collection of one-shots somewhere...it was a response to a challenge where Harry never quite gets around to learning about his fame and how his parents really died, so he thinks he's apparently somehow famous for surviving a car crash.

Ah-ha. "The Boy Who Never Knew" challenge. I've seen Dunuelos write a response to it: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10383313/14/From-the-Mind-of-Dunuelos-Plot-Bunnies][Here and the next chapter.]]

Be warned, his one-shots tend to be a bit bashy. Some of them still have good ideas despite that, though.

...Oh, wait, this wasn't exactly what you were looking for, was it? That one's not about Harry being shunned/isolated, it's about him not understanding what his fame is about and responding negatively to it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4348627/1/Parseltongue-Prejudice][Here, have a one-shot:]] It definitely fits your criteria, being about Harry being shunned and hexed and eventually fleeing Hogwarts with Hannah Abbott. Be warned, there's an utterly idiotic manipulative!Dumbledore in there.

  She was an agent of Evil who regretted her choices. He was a child with a destiny too heavy for his shoulders. Is the Wizarding World ready for a Boy-Who-Lived influenced by a reforming Fallen Angel? ...Probably not. NOT Harry/Lash
