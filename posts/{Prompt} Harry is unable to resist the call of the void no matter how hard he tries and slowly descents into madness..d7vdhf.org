The call of the void is a psychological phenomenon that (as far as I know) everyone experiences sometimes, it's that voice in your head that says: â€˜I could push that guy into incoming traffic and no one could stop me in time'. (I'm going by the top definition on urban dictionary, [[https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20call%20of%20the%20void]] )

This prompt just popped up in my head and refuses to leave so I thought I'd stop it here. As I thought about this idea the more enthusiastic I get and the more opportunities I see with this. For example:

Harry could eventually give in to the call after a long struggle to contain the urge while becoming violently unstable, killing everyone until he's the only one left with nobody to end but himself.

Even the storyline above could be taken on with different approaches, you could focus on the action and depict graphic acts of violence. Or perhaps explore the impact this would have on his psyche and the relationships he has with his friends.

Now, I believe I've been rambling on for way too long and I'll end it here.

Hope to see something good come from this!

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.
