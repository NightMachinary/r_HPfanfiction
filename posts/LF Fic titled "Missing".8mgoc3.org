It was a WBWL Fic where Harry was neglected by his (still living) parents. In the middle, Sirius didn't even recognize Harry when he was sitting on the couch. In the end, Harry runs out into the cold and dies of hypothermia. His parents find his pensive and discovers that Harry was the real BWL.

I can't find it anymore :(((


** Happen to know the author name? Is that the exact title?

I'll have a look through the archive when I get home. Haven't finished the merge though so it's missing the latest few years.

****** I tried with the archive up to storyid 10000000... doesn't seem to be anything in category =Harry Potter= with an exact title of =Meaning=.

I'm still working on importing/merging the databases of the next million storyids... I'll search again then.

Edit: here's a search for every title containing =meaning=. Any of them look right? Off-site cause it's too big for reddit: [[https://gist.github.com/ElusiveGuy/e9b4d5243e40cb96bde2946af17a3bef]]

Edit: fuck, searched for the wrong title. Trying again... found it. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/8mgoc3/lf_fic_titled_missing/dzoo3wm/]]

******** They're a lifesaver!

I didn't want to ask for the lot because the directory structures of the later dumps were different and uploading another ~130 GB probably isn't easy. But if you happen to already have it up somewhere I'd love a copy.

I've been sitting on it since someone posted a link in another thread here, and only just got around to trying to merge them together last week.

** Found thanks to the storyid & author from [[/u/Impulse92]] and [[/u/Eawen_Telemnar]], and of course the archive from [[/u/nerdguy1138]]

[[https://pubfiles.elusiveguy.com/D1J47yIznxPE1o4]]

It's markdown-formatted so you can use a site like [[http://markdownlivepreview.com/]] if you prefer the formatted version.

...and now I'm sad :(

** Had it in my Firefox history, can confirm it was deleted. Story ID seems to be 3540137 on FFN if that helps in any recovery searching
