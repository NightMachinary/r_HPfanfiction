any fic where tonks is the protagonist of a spy/thriller story? especially if she learned legilimency (and takes the memory of her victim, assume their identity, and memory charm the victim of the content of the meeting between the victim and the party she infiltrated).


** Wow, If she was raised a Black, then everyone would have been afraid of her.

**** I don't have any at the top of my head, but in many fanfics its mentioned that there exists many Metamorphmagi, but chose to remain silent so as to not to reveal their trump cards, and in some fics its mentioned that they are conscripted to Aurors, as a way to control them, otherwise they become good criminals, so many dark families hide their abilities.

Metamorphmagi are distrusted by people, because they can come to pretending to be other and can able to get a dirt on you based on what they say to you, assuming you are that person, In one fic a Slytherin Tonks ( goes by Black) does that. Just imagine a Metamorphmagus Tom Riddle and what he could do with that ability ( assuming he survived orphanage).

In lhe Voyage of the Starship Hedwig By: Ynyr linkffn(7135971), towards the end chapters, Ginny creates an army of them, loyal to her to conduct espionage, anyone not falling in liine ? - kill them and replace them and fake their death when all the murder trail vanishes.
