You're sent back in time, and can't think of a way to make money, so you decide to write a book. Naturally Harry Potter comes to mind. Do you choose to follow in the steps of J.K Rowling and just rip her story off, or would you try to put your own flare on it?

Is there a fanfic you loved so much, you could see yourself using that story instead?


** Harry Potter didn't get popular because of its consistent storytelling or airtight plot. People loved it because of its relatable characters, its whimsical setting, and the charming writing style which starts with classic Roald Dahl conventions and transitions into maturity. You could rip off her idea, but if you write like a fanfic writer and not like JKR, no one will buy the story.

By fanfic writing, I mean shortcuts and cliches that work in fanfiction but won't cut it in pro writing, like skipping descriptions of each character as they are introduced, or establishing each new setting or environment. Pro books do this; fanfic authors skip it because they assume readers already know, and seeing the same descriptions repeated over and over in fanfic is tiresome. (Draco described as pointy and pale, Dudley compared to a pig.)

And then you have "emerald orbed teen" and "bushy-haired bookworm" and other common epithets.

*** I mean, even if JK Rowling herself went back in time she likely wouldn't have the same level of success (if any at all) with the HP books.

Luck is by far the biggest contributing factor to success in most cases, and doubly so when you're talking about subjective/artistic disciplines.

She could go back in time multiple times and not see the books reach meaningful fame almost every time.

*** Very good point, I hadn't given much thought to. There's gotta be some fics that build up the magical world better than Hagrid did though. If you wrote the story yourself, you could add the backstory and build up. Basically I'm asking if you would risk coming up with an original idea or using something from a fanfic, when you know the original version made Billions of dollars, in order to change the story into something you like more.

**** If I could write like JKR, then I'd write a more streamlined version of HP. If I can't, then I'd write Twilight, another money spinner with a smaller cast and less sophisticated plot.

Honestly, if I got transported back in time, I'd be making money off the stock market, which takes less work than writing a book. It's not that easy to churn out a 100k word novel, while making sure the 100k words are actually good.

**** Fantasy in the early 20th century? Good luck getting enough money from that! - i am pretty sure JK Rowling's success had at least partially to do with timing. I also remember reading that fantasy was not truly seen as viable till the success of "The Lord of the Rings" in thd early 50's. You probably would have an even harder time finding a publisher than Rowwling herself.

** I'll finish memorizing the books to prepare for this possibility. She has a winning formula. It would be foolish to mess with it. I'm amazed at all these people who aren't professional writers who think they know better than her.

** No, if I can time travel to my past without causing a paradox, I'm going to do the following:

- Remember some important lottery numbers before the time travel
- Invest the winning proceeds in stock like AOL, Cisco, Dell, Qualcomm, and Yahoo until year 2000.
- Use some of the money to support JKR during her difficult times and buy the exclusive right of the Harry Potter Series.
- When it comes to its Movie production, Steve Kloves would NEVER be hired, and any script that attempted to bash certain main characters would be immediately thrown out and its writer fired.
- I would go over every final script and cut personally, and make sure that all plot important scenes were included. There would be no Confetti Voldemort or Shoelace scene under my watch, and Hermione would never steal half of Ron's best lines. Draco would be that “my father will hear about this” arrogant, sniveling coward.
- I would try to steer JKR to move the last two Books into different direction. Given that I helped out her tremendously during her most difficult times, I should have a reasonable influence here. If I had my way, Dumbledore would never become that criminally negligent dickhead in HBP, Harry would not be that passive dork, and DH would have very little Deus Ex Machina, author fiats, plot armors, and lucky hero trope. Oh yes, they would put many of those sadistic genocidal magical Nazis permanently out of business too. There would be more scenes after their victory, but no sudden time skip to 20 years later.
- The Cursed Child would have a totally different plot. Jack Thorne can have his play, but the plot will be mine! And whoever is the most qualified will play Hermione!

** Honestly I think the stars aligned for the Harry potter series.

If you were to Go back in Time and send your Version to a Publishing house even the Exact same one that J.K. Rolling sent the original harry potter to there is no guarantee that it would have the same success.

If i was given the option to go back in time i would ask for something else of equal value instead.

*** Change everything past OotP. No matter how unpopular Sirius' death was, it was good for the story. People realise that shit got serious. But then we get teenage drama 24/7 and horrible depictions of crushing.

Give Harry's custody to Andromeda, have her and Mad Eye train him. Have people realise how bad Dumbledore's plans are going. Ron dies to the poison, Harry confronts Malfoy and kills him after being tortured for a bit. Dumbledore is doing his redemption spiel, more fractures in the Order. Then Dumbledore makes some heroic last stand. Make it epic like 300.

Then Voldemort takes over the Ministry. The whole magical Final Solution becomes the main plot because Umbridge is doing more damage than Voldemort. And while Harry and co are busy dealing with Umbridge, Voldemort gathers more forces for the real showdown.

** I would want to try to take key themes and plots, and write something a bit more original. After all, it wouldn't do for JK Rowling to come after me years later, with a manuscript that looks uncomfortably similar to the books I supposedly wrote.

I've got a vague idea in my head of re-writing the entire story to feel more like "Tolkien does Harry Potter." Unfortunately, I don't have the educational background that Tolkien did, in myths and history and stuff. I would spend the majority of my time in Rowlings' shoes researching and gaining this educational background.

Among the things I would change, or expound upon; there would be more variation in types of ghosts, and some of them would be very dangerous.

The rift between magicals and muggles would occur around the time of the Protestant Reformation, and would be one of the results of the political and cultural upheaval of that time period. Hogwarts would have a much more complex history then what we see in canon, possibly involving an entire Catholic order of witches and wizards dedicated to studying magic. The Deathly Hallows would be described in more detail, and related to types of artifacts in the real world. Same for the horcruxes. The Hufflepuff cup, for example, might turn out to be a piece of Anglo-Saxon glassware that was discovered in a burial mound in the Victorian period, by an antiquarian named Helga Hufflepuff. Parts of the horcrux hunt would look more like National Treasure then Harry sitting around in a tent, waiting for a vision.

The Dursleys would be swapped for more three-dimensional, human characters. This family would have excellent reasons to treat Harry like they did. After all, how the hell are you supposed to handle getting an assassin target abruptly dumped on your doorstep? How the hell is some random housewife supposed to act as a body guard against Death Eaters? To give my Dursleys a reason to believe that they are adequate for the job, to give them a reason not to dump Harry off at the nearest police station and claim ignorance, my Vernon would be ex special forces, and I would hope that he would be played by Liam Neeson in the movies. He would have some of the necessary skills and training to act as a body guard. He would face off against some magical bad guy with a shotgun at some point.

In order to more efficiently do their assigned job of protecting Harry from a ludicrous plethora of unknown attacks from Death Eaters, they will construct a basement, and fully stock it as an apartment for Harry. Harry will never see the sun, not even for an education, until the day he leaves for Hogwarts. This will have a profound and negative effect on his ability to socialize.

*** Oh my. I like the idea of badass Dursleys who screw up Harry not because of neglect but overprotectiveness. Like, Harry only interacted with two or three people all his life because there are people in the outside world that want him dead and he only can trust his family. - i worry he may turn ouf more paranoid than Moody!

** I think the three major things I would change would be: 1) make Sirius and Fred live and give them their own HEAs (as neither of their stories felt completed, whereas Remus' did) and 2) have Harry get with both Hermione and Ginny in the epilogue. Don't get me wrong, I love Ron and Hermione together, but I really like the idea of HHr and HG both happening. Also, I really like the idea of Harry and Hermione having twins as mischievous as Fred and George.

As for minor things...there'd probably be some differences, but nothing that would effect the plotline majorly. I like the books as they are for the most part.
