This is just pure gold. Dumbledore is quite impressive and Harry is his usual self. It also makes fun of the usual fanfic cliches, like goblin names. It's only 2 chapters in and quite short but such a breath of fresh air.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** It reads like a crack fic I hope the author doesn't try and take it in a more traditional direction

*** I could see it going both ways. It does need levity though.

**** So could I, i just think this story would fail if it tries to be a real fic given the writing style that the author is using

***** I think it could a serious at times fic, but it has to focus on the heartwarming moments between Dumbledore and Harry.

I'm not sure crack! fic is the best way to describe it though.

****** I agree. I see it more as "lighthearted" rather than "crack".

I hope it will build the Harry/Albus dynamic some more, make some jokes but keep the plot serious as it has done so far, instead of going in the direction of crack.

******* I agree with you.

Jeff the Goblin was a bit too much, but the Griphook bashing made me lol.

The flow is currently a bit off, but no one is perfect and this fic entertains.
