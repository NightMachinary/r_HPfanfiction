** Where do you think most sapient magical creatures come from? A wizard or witch buggered up a power-up ritual, of course.\\
Swiftness of a horse? Oops, now everyone's a centaur. Keen senses of a wolf? Hello, lycanthropy. The grace of swans? Veela (though some would say that went perfectly).\\
Even when people wised up and stopped trying to use animal affinities in their rituals, stuff still went wrong. Wizards trying to get stronger became giants, witches aiming for cunning became goblins, and someone aiming for supreme control over magic ended up making supremely-controllable house-elves.

Harry...no, Harry, put down the vial of dragon's blood! This is an extraordinarily poor ideaaaAAAA!!

*** I always assumed magical creatures came about because various wizards throughout the years got a bit too kinky one day.

** (I'm gonna take Harry destroying the goblet for power as a senario for this to happen, destroying the goblet causes a backlash of magic in the Great Hall, cause the goblet bind his magic to the contract, Why not take the magic outta the goblet)

Harry - "Well, that was a party pooper"

Ron - "Mate, Hermione's going nuts, she's muttering all the theory she has read till now and is rocking back and forth curled up."

/Looks at Hermione's with an bewildered expression while she babbles uses of Aconite/

Harry - "Well that's wierd but not unusual."

Ron - "That's True, I'm gonna get some food. Care to join me?"

Harry - "Nah, I'm good, You go ahead."

Ron - "Whatever mate.‚Äù

/Ron runs like flash out of the Common Room/

Harry - "/sigh/ At least now the ministry has something else to talk about rather than slam me for being a delusional idiot."
