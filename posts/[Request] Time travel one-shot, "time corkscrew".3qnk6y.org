I remember that it was set during PoA. Hermione and Harry are back from doing their time turner shenanigans, when they find that one of the twins (or both, can't remember) was bitten by a werewolf (Lupin). To save them, they have to travel back in time AGAIN to make up a plausible reason why the injured twin exhibits the symptoms of a werewolf bite. I think the summary said something like "they turned a stable time loop into a time corkscrew".
