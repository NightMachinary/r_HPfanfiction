** One of my favorites right now is linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation by NoahPhantom) and the rest of the series. The first book is a bit slow but it gets much better as the years progress. The author has everything planned out so ideas and events that happen throughout the books all build on one another. He's on the last book now, the seventh, and he says it should be finished by the end of the summer.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

** linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction). Fits criteria 2, 3, 4 (lots of lore) and 11. It is an AU written pre-OoTP, so it has several interesting ideas that is unrelated to most of the cliches that now populate the fandom, and it is a large scale AU with places never mentioned in canon, so it fits criterion 5 for all intents and purposes.

My review [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=814217&postcount=19][here]].

Don't be too bothered by its abandonment. It sucks that it isn't finished, but the author finished his major story arc, so it has a satisfactory conclusion nonetheless.

PS You and I seem to share similar tastes in fanfiction. Would you mind recommending some of your favorites or linking your favorites list? The only condition I would add is no bashing, either of JKR's characters, or the Wizarding world in general.
