So it is a powerful!Harry fic and I think it went something like this. After his death, Dumbledore's letter to Harry asks him to leave school and his friends and go visit maybe 7 masters/teachers of magic to train him to defeat Voldemort. He doesn't tell his friends this, instead throwing a tantrum and accusing them of befriending him for his fame/money but explains it to Ginny/someone in a letter later. Throughout his journey he gets rid of all the Horcruxes.

In the end, he defeats Voldemort, stops by to crush Bellatrix's potential resistance with his vampire buddies and heads to the ministry. Hermione/Ginny gets a bad feeling and heads to the ministry. Harry passes through the Veil, a quake resonates throughout the Ministry which some character mentions indicates the passing of a powerful wizard. Hermione/Ginny is too late, all that remains before the Veil is a wand.

Here's bits and pieces, hopefully about the same fic but it's been too long. The teachers may have included a vampire, Mad-Eye and Snape. Snape may have turned against Voldemort in the final battle. It was short <15 chapters. Kind of popular (some hundreds of reviews)

It was one of the first fanfics I read and I was feeling nostalgic. Thanks for any assistance in advance.
