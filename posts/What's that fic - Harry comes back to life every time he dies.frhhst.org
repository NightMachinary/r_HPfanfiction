:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a fic where Harry periodically dies and goes back to some point before it happens. Like he has extra video games lives. He dies, like, kinda a lot, and he doesn't have any control over when he returns to relive the time before he dies. Sometimes its right before, and sometimes a long time before.

It's a Hogwarts era story.

I can't remember if it was complete or not. Maybe not since I didn't bookmark it?

Any help appreciated!

** I recall one on FFN in which Hermione creates a runic schema that she tattoos on his back that lets him re-do events when he dies.
