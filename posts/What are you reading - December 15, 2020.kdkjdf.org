** Right now I'm reading 'Loose Cannon' by manatee vs. walrus. It's about Harry's post Hogwarts life where he decides to give up being an Auror and pursue Quidditch. So far the writing's quite good but will very likely abandon it because it's 98 chapters. I especially like a conversation Ron has with Hermione about her talking down to him or treating him like he's slow.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13452914/13/Loose-Cannon]]

I read "Crossing Lines by Plutoplex" , which features the twins going to the Marauder's era. I expected it to be funny but it isn't, still quite good though. Snape's definitely in character and I think the twins are too. Albus is annoying but maybe I've read too many time travel/identity swap stories featuring him. I think it ended a little abruptly though it is complete. Would recommend. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11993367/1/Crossing-Lines]]

I also read "Canaries and Consequences" about when Hermione set those birds on Ron. A line stood out-"He was still just Ron Weasley, the most mediocre of his siblings." I like Ron and do think he's much smarter and more skilled than he gets credit for, but...well, it's true. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13605305/1/]]

** Magical Creatures Will Get Me Killed (Again) by Anubis Enfield

It's about an vereranaria that gets reincarnated into the body of an pureblood kid, whose father runs a magical creature ranch and slughterhouse. He integrates himself into the g9lden trio once he gets to hogwarts, and tries to keep things relatively consistent via future knowledge, but changes minor things via butterfly effect that affects the story at large, Interesting dive into magical creatures, realistic character development, an acctually realistic high school level dating subplot, just a good fic in general. 8/10, complete.

** I'm (re-)reading linkao3(Survival is a Talent), an WIP fic predicated on Harry/Draco being soulmates and finding this out during the dueling club meeting in second year.

To get the obvious out of the way first: I realize soulmates are one of those cliche premises that not many people like, but it's it's mostly just an impetus for the two of them to start talking and build a friendship through character development. A few chapters in, it's discussed that soulmates are a /chance/ at a deeper relationship, but they still require, you know, /work/ to make happen. It's not an instant "twu wuv" bond, and Harry's initial reaction to finding out that his soulmate is Draco of all people is more or less "Why him?"

There's zero bashing to be found, Harry doesn't abandon Ron/Hermione for a group of Slytherin counterparts, everyone's delightfully sassy and witty, and for those that care about such things it leans heavily into racial diversity and LGBTQ+ themes, all of which is treated as a very casual matter-of-course thing with little fanfare. As one of the tags puts it, this fic is not out to hurt you. (Which, after a year like this, is more or less exactly what I need.)

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

/It's like reading someone else's work./

Written in 2008, this was my younger self's attempt to create a time travel story that fizzled out before coming to completion.

Why I recommend it aside from the shameless self plug: It featured a non-indy Harry and non-crazy, evil, manipulative Dumbledore.

It tried to closely follow the details of the books, which was both a good and bad thing.

** I read [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/136245][we must unite inside her walls or we'll crumble from within]]. It is a series of oneshots about the women of Harry Potter. It is very meta but it made me fall in love with some of the female characters again and made me even sympathise with two I never liked before (Parvati and Pansy).

It is not action or plot driven but character driven and it works. I would call them canon compliant. Even with that there are some very nice twists in it. I am currently at Part 6 (Andromeda) and until now I would give the series a strong 8/10.

The sequence that captured me the most was:

#+begin_quote
  “Why are you here?” Parvati asked Pansy once. People asked her a lot, when they found her in Flourish and Blotts, or at work on the Prophet. Their eyes raked her, looking for green, for silver, for venom. Sometimes she'd smile back and let them see the danger.

  "Because I'm not fifteen anymore," said Pansy. "God, do you know what precious Potter Sr. got up to at school, the bully? But boys get to grow up to be men, you see, and us girls just grow up to be bitches."
#+end_quote

Because yes: Every male a*hole got appologised but Pansy is hated in almost every fanfiction - even in those with "good slytherins". And until I read that work I never realised that.

*** Pansy isn't hated because she's a girl. She's hated because she's an easy hate sink character. She's a cruel, one-dimensional character who is only ever described in extremely unflattering terms since she was based on Rowling's bullies in secondary school. There are always certain characters, male or female, that almost never gets redeemed while their companions do. It has nothing to do with sexism. For example, Bellatrix is redeemed in almost every time travel, but Pettigrew is always treated as evil incarnate.

**** I spoke not only from the fandom but from the canon work itself. That the fandom treats the women and men of the story like it does have to do with how it is portraied in canon:

James and Sirius were bullies but they got to grew up and be redeemed (even before the series started).

Snape was a bully and a Death Eater but he got to spy and love to be redeemed.

Peter Pettigrew was a coward and a traitor but in his last moments he hesitates and that got him killed. It is not a full blowen redemption but it is there.

Draco Malfoy was a bully and a coward but he didn't kill Dumbledore and he didn't betray Harry. It is not a full redemption either but it is there.

Tom Riddle didn't get redemption (and doesn't earn it) but we do get an understanding why he is the way he is. A shitty childhood and loosing your parents early isn't an excuse but it is an explanation.

On the other hand the women of Harry Potter who did horrible things never got this kind of characterdevelopement. We don't know why Umbridge or Pansy or Bellatrix are the way they are. The only female redemption we get is Narzissa - because she is a mother. And yeah, I would call that a little bit sexist. Not with intention - I know J.K is one of the authors who did great things for the recognition of female novel heroes with Hermione, Luna, Tonks, Molly Weasley, Professor McGonagall etc. But aside from the good side: Rowling didn't really give their female villains any character motivations beside "they are evil, deal with it." And writing the female villains is as important as writing the female heroes.

Don't we? [[https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/dolores-umbridge][Umbridge's backstory was already revealed by Rowling]], and for Bellatrix, it's stated multiple times that the Black family were insane, abusive blood purists, and that she was tutored in dark magic by Voldemort himself right after school. It's not exactly a stretch to see why they turned out like they did. If you consider Voldemort growing up in an orphanage an explanation, then their backstories are just as valid. Honestly, I'd say that Pettigrew had less backstory than them (we really don't know anything about him), and you're kind of stretching by saying him hesitating to kill Harry was a redemption.

Also, for Draco, its more cowardice than a redemption. He literally does nothing while Hermione is getting tortured a few feet away from him, and he tries to capture Harry to gain Voldemort's favor at the end of the book. IIRC, Rowling even says that he's an awful, despicable person who no one should have a fictional crush on. I think you're seeing sexism when there really isn't any.

  In the middle of their second year, Draco and Harry discover they're soulmates and do their best to keep it a secret from everyone. Their best isn't perfect. ~“Are you trying to get killed, Potter?” Malfoy drawls, stalking forward. Quick as a serpent himself, he reaches out and grabs the snake just below the head. It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  When Harry fails to keep his anger at bay and Voldemort possesses his mind, the events that follow lead him down a long road to realizing the world isn't as black and white as it seems. Chaos, hilarity, and tragedy ensue with a Dark Lord being honest all the time, a rival becoming something else, and a world demanding to be saved. Featuring frightened Death Eaters, deep conversations with a monster, Prueblood traditions being ridiculous, and the fight to do the right thing with no true options. Harry's life just gets more and more bizarre with each passing moment. ~~~Or, the one where Harry's life gets split in half, and he has to figure out how to bring it back together.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25477843/chapters/61802161][Of a Linear Circle - Part 9 by Flamethrower]]

10/10 - Even if so much is happening that I can barely keep up!

I think I rant about this book series too much but I just cannot get over it. Without spoiling it, in this book we're looking at how the secret society was set up which means there is a lot of people with alias's, loads of hidden secrets, secret agendas. Twists inside schemes wrapped into enigmas. It's intense. I've never read anything so amazingly intricate.

It's mostly set around the 2nd world war - 1981. How the cold war and nucleur tests affected elemental magicians was incredible. All the history they've woven in like the moon landings and Thatcher and Mining strikes. I've learned so much history just from reading it.

It's a testament to the Author that they are able to write such intricate plots and people and family trees and real world history and wrap it into a story that still surprises me at every turn. I understand this story isn't for everyone but regardless of that, you have to take your hat off to such an incredible artist.

**** The legally existing outside of magical spaces?? Oh that made me laugh 😂 there's whole chapters dedicated to the intricacies of personal law and social security and politics and the Queen of England makes an appearance (though in a different book) since a lot of the purebloods with long historys have magical Duke and Lord status of their lands so that's a whole thing. Which makes sense as it was originally granted before the International Statute of Secrecy was introduced in the 1800s or whenever so before that the king/queen would have had a wizarding advisor like Merlin was to Arthur and I'm getting side tracked....

Theres also whole chapters dedicated to the international statute of Secrecy and what that means in different countries and how much and for what and how governments are involved and different branches of that since Squibs and Muggle borns would need to transfer through two different societies and how they keep track of people.

It's so well thought out and done. So much thought has gone into closing every loophole it's really just incredible to read and learn the bigger world they created.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13391445/1/His-Darkest-Devotion][His Darkest Devotion]] by Lomonaaeren is a fantastic Tomarry story with elements of angst, betrayal, and hidden power/deception. AU with Tom as minister, Harry as a ministry employee, and the Order as a resistance movement. Possessive Tom but what else do you expect between soul mates. I actually wasn't too keen on the soul mark/bond trope prior to reading this story but I find the concept much more intriguing now after seeing it done tastefully. Includes bashing of Order members but it's not over the top. Incomplete but might as well be complete (last few chapters are satisfying enough)

​

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13750821/1/Genius-by-the-Numbers][Genius by the Numbers]] also by Lomonaaeren (surprise surprise lol). Tomarry pairing. A nice short story, easy to read in one sitting. I loved the new take on Arithmancy, so if you're into magical theory that might draw you in.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12707139/chapters/28977780][Diagnosis]] was incredible!! It's a medical AU (tomarry pairing) and follows the trials of Harry and his fellow healer trainees as they conquer hardcore cases. Very emotional but the characters are just so REAL. Phenomenal detail in the medical procedure scenes!

** It's been a busy couple of weeks. Here's what I've gone through in the last 2 weeks.

Currently linkffn(13388022) Albus and Harry's World Trip

I'm liking it because it creates interesting explanations to a number of things that didn't make sense in the original books. Like Snape teaching Harry occulmancy because it needed to be a quick and dirty version of the lessons. This way of learning it has to be done by someone adversarial to the person learning to get them to instictively bring forth disturbing imagery to someone assaulting their minds in the future to scare them off or distract them. It also gets the learner to instictively see anyone trying to enter their mind as an enemy. And of course you can't tell the person learning that this is the reason for this method because it would decrease the effectiveness of the method.

Linkffn(3659524) A Shadowed Soul

Decent Wandless! Abandonned! Diarymort! GryffindorHeir! story. I'd give it 3.5 stars so far.

Linkffn(13435630) Harry Potter and the Artificers Legacy

Harry as a blacksmith, enchanter, etc. Slowburn harem.

Linkffn(13694344) No Fate

Harry loses his 5th year trial, gets memory wiped and ends up in the muggle world. Voldemort takes over, Harry joins the British army, and gets found by Hermione while being attacked by Death Eaters, work up a plan to get revenge and eventually fix everything.

Linkffn(13315643) Cry of Freedom series

This is Year 1. There are 3 years so far, 4th year should be starting to be published soon. Very accelerated timeline. I think this will leave a lot of room in later years to explore new plotlines rather than just following the books.

​

A few more too that I've posted about already.

** - “Falling Through Time by wittyhistorian” linkao3(4475078). I really wanted to like this. Since “Arithmancer by White_Squirrel” I like Hermione/Weasley-twin pair, and it could be done very well. Moreover, fixing-history time travel stories are currently my hobby, so what's not to love. Too much, unfortunately. This is one of those stories, where we got the original text of HBP (thanks =$DEITY=, the book starts just after The Battle of Department of Mysteries, so we are saved all previous Stations of the Canon) just with a lot of angst how the main heroine shouldn't change anything, while she is changing tons of things left and right (for starters, she dates Fred). If the Fate, God, Death, or whomever send me back to fix the past, then I should probably should start fixing. I have managed to suffer this paralytic torment until the death of Dumbledore, but I cannot take it any more.

- to have at least something positive, I have reread yesterday “Behind Blue Eyes by elmembrila” linkffn(2095661) and I have been reminded again how lovely story it is (Harry/Muggle girl, but really very different from what you expect). Really great.

**** I don't think the word is “angsty” (“Falling Through Time” is in my opinion more angsty than this, if that means something like depressive). Neither Harry nor Kitty are particularly paralysed by fear and depression (which is what I understand under angst), but their life is desperate, dirty, and low-life. I can understand that it is not your thing, but I don't think it is the same thing.

***** Angst - a feeling of deep anxiety or dread, typically an unfocused one about the human condition or the state of the world in general.

Harry and her are constantly anxious/ worried about their situation, their safety, who will find them etc. It's got nothing to with paralysis because these emotions. But the story is undeniably defined by a high level of anxiety and dread.

I will mention their relationship is also quite chaotic. It tends to run very hot and cold in a whiplash like fashion that breaks down engagement with the story.
