:END:
I don't mean becoming sick or anything, but I'd like to see a fic where people witness Harry's more severe reaction, (sobbing, screaming, etc.) and understand how much closer of a relationship to him he had than they thought. (no slash) perticularly, McGonagall. I know this is a bit of an odd request but I got an idea of what I want to read in my head, and it won't leave. Thanks in advance.


** One of my fics, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14392005][pity the living]] linkao3(14392005) half meets your request - it's about Harry's feelings regarding Dumbledore's death, but the premise is that Dumbledore tells him about the curse before he dies, so there aren't any outside observers. Unfortunately, I can't think of any other fics that come closer, and I've looked pretty damn hard for (non-slash) fics about Harry and Dumbledore over the years.

However, I have a suspicion that this idea may not leave me alone now that it's in my head, so - while I'm loathe to make any promises - maybe I'll write it. If I do, is there anything in particular you imagine happening?

*** Like I said, I think it's a perfect opportunity for Harry and McGonagall to develop a closer relationship. Perhaps the daily prophet doing a Peice about how distraught he was. Maybe Voldemort could attempt (and fail) to recruit Harry, because he believes he's in enough of an emotional state to agree.

**** Done! I'm not sure if it's exactly what you were looking for, as it ended up being pretty short and undramatic, but I hope you enjoy it anyway:
