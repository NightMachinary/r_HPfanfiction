I wanna be clear that I don't dislike the ship ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dqvcb8/haphne_hate_thread/f6cyxrv?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][in fact, I've recently gone on record as saying that there's nothing stable about it /to/ dislike]]) and don't begrudge anyone who enjoys it. Hell, I actively seek the pairing out when I'm looking for new fics, but this is getting ridiculous: there's been at least four haphne request threads in the past week, plus a [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/dq95en/harrydaphne_compilation/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][compilation thread]] in a valiant ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/drgaxy/good_daphneharry_fic_suggestions/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share][but as yet apparently ineffectual]]) attempt to curb this deluge of repetitive request posts, and really, how hard is it to check if a question's been recently asked before posting?

. . . Okay, I guess I needed to vent a bit, but my original question still stands: what's the deal? Did something happen to precipitate this, or is it just some weird coincidence? Because prior to this, I hadn't seen many haphne requests on this sub, and I certainly haven't seen a ship blow up this much; the lack of an obvious cause is just the icing on this Cake of Confusion.


** I agree with you on the apparent disability of people using the search engine... Really, if your exact same request has been done a week ago, chances are nothing new came about in that time. Not to mention the compilation thread you pointed out.

But: You can apply this to MANY other requests. Sure, Haphne is asked for a lot, but not even close to the generic "OP!Harry" requests which sometimes pop up multiple times a day...

Also, as a theory of why Haphne has been on the rise lately: In the past two years there have been some really good fics with that pairing. Before that the pairing was mostly generic marriage contract stories, but with fics like "Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent", on which the whole sub usually agrees is excellent, people seem to be interested in finding more along those lines.

** You could take this several ways I think: (1) someone(s) is trolling the subreddit; (2) people keep hoping for a particular new fic to show up because they only read Haphne pairing; (3) they're too lazy to check previous posts and would rather be /told/ what to read (dubious about this one myself); (4) its an easy request that no one usually jumps on as horrible, like say Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny; (5) people really like the pairing because its essentially a blank slate but invariably ends up being a contrasting relationship, which are generally more interesting to consumers of fiction than relationships built on compatibility.

** Oh hey, that's my thread! And if anyone has a better way to format it let me know cause I'll try to update it at some point.

I honestly think people just don't use the search function, and that applies for pretty much any request, not just Haphne. Or people did use the the search bar, but have read all the common recommendations, and hope that someone offers a previously unknown fic. Or the more recent request threads didn't get a lot of traction and they are hoping for more replies. That was part of the reason I made the compilation thread. It can be frustrating to make a request and get 2 replies, one of which is a remindme! Finally, Harry/Slytherin girl is a general dynamic with broad appeal, so because Daphne is the default girl for this pairing, people seek it out when they first dive in to that relationship or hpfanfiction in general.

*** Give this one a whirl, but keep in mind that it is THE stand out fic for that pairing. Most others are not even close to that good, often using tropes like marriage contracts and similar stuff... So after this one blows you away, you can give up on the ship if you are not into the contract stuff.

**** There's /tons/ of solid Haphne fics that don't have marriage contracts. I can name four off the top of my head that have marriage contracts. Maybe /two/ of those are honestly good. I can name /plenty/ that don't.

Part of that is likely that I don't remember bad fics, but I honestly don't remember marriage contracts being nearly as pervasive with this pairing as some people make out. There's a larger number than some other pairings purely due to the character involved, but saying 'here read this, it's the only non-marriage contract fic that's good' seems really shitty.

***** Hey, go ahead and list them if they are as good as "Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent"... Very interested to see and read them.

And cmon, when you search for Harry/Daphne on ffnet or AO3 and use any logical sorting, at least 75% of the fics are contract based... I also never said that that would make them automatically bad or anything, there are some I enjoyed. I only said that if you take out all the contract fics, I am not aware of any other fics that I would class on the same level as the one I linked. Not even close. Obviously excluding sweet little one-shots like "Ice Cream".

****** Let's see - I thought linkffn(Contractual Invalidation) is quite good for a fanfiction, though it /does/ start with a marriage contract - but not one that forces Harry into anything, which so it's not played straight there. Another bonus is that she's portrayed as an actual pureblood in this fic - not a full on bigot, but with a big gap in worldview from Harry. Otherwise as an ongoing one I think linkffn(Novocaine) is also well done.

It has been a while since I read them, so it's hard to say if it's on the same level as Importance of Intent, but they should be worth a read I'd say. Though neither have much of a antagonist plot, so if you're more looking for a Daphne fic during Hogwarts that's not really the point.

****** The only long one I've really enjoyed other than The Importance of Intent is linkffn(A Champion's New Hope), bearing in mind it was the first Harry/Daphne story I read, so if it had a bunch of common tropes, I didn't notice them at the time. I still think it's a solid story though. No crazy out of the blue decisions, there's a believable premise for the story, and the characters make a decent amount of sense.

EDIT: Did in fact start a re-read. Was good up to chapter 24. Then I remembered that I dropped the story at that point back when I first read it. And will do so now again. Having Hermione perform some long lost ritual that opens a portal to another dimension where she sells her soul to become able to summon some people was just a bit too out there for me :D
