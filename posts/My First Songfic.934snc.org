The other day on The Harmony & Co Facebook page, we were asked about which songs made us think about Harry and Hermione (I'm sure other ships do this often too). One the responses was George Strait's Check Yes or No, which is a great song if you like country music (I'm not a huge fan of it, but I can enjoy a song every now and then). I decided to write a small oneshot, which turned into my first songfic. I thought I'd share it here.
