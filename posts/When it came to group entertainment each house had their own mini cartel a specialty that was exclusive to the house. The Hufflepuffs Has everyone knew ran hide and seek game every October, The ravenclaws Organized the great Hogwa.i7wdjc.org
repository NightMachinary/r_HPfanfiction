  The Slytherins had been trying to establish a game of schoolwide snakes and ladders but the 7th years had been unable to figure out how to turn the staircases into a network of slides just yet, so they hosted the yearly gobstones tournament until the technicalities could be worked out. The Gryffindors as always, at Christmas time, had a massive game of truth or dare. With Lee Jordan as the moderator, last year's had been particularly memorable as Dean Thomas had spent three days as a nematode they all called Chester. Hermione had finally taken mercy on him and ruled any further transformation detrimental to Dean's health so they transformed him back into his proper human form, though he did have nightmares for a few days after.

  No one really knew who started the games or how the tradition really was established but they all knew some poor bastard would need therapy afterwards and Harry Potter would always end up somewhere in the clock tower with a dictionary and half a pint of Heineken lager, trying to persuade a troop of pixies to do the conga.
