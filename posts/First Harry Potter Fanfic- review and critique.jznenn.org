I co-authored this fanfic along with [[/u/N1GHTW01F][u/N1GHTW01F]]*.* It's a story based around how Harry is gaining some of the qualities of Tom Riddle due to (spoilers) part of his soul inside Harry. This is just the first chapter- we'll be writing a ton more. Any thoughts and opinions are welcome!
