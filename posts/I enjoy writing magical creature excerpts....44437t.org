I've been trying to write a magical creature story but I keep losing track. I have more fun writing a sort of pseudo-science statement of the creatures.

Some examples:

#+begin_quote
  An excerpt from magizoologist Udgen Millstone's creature compendium, "Stuff it under a Glass Bell" has this to say on Jarveys. "Nasty foul-tempered loathsome creatures that would sooner scratch your face and insult your family lineage that look twice at you. The only thing a Jarvey likes better that using harsh lexicon is eating Gnomes. It's also how I once captured one in my youth, making me blush with its inventive use of the word 'fuck'. If my father wards hadn't held up, I dare say the beasty would've exacted revenge on me, forthwith."

  Mrs. Figg got a gleam in her eye. She went it to her room and came back shortly after. Holding an old weathered book. Flipping its pages muttering to herself, she pointed to a section and told him to read. "Faeries (Chromategima Laetitia) are insecto-homonid magical creatures that can be found all over the world, not just in Britannia. They are known to be vain, glow in assorted phenotypical colors by bioluminescence and communicate by high-pitched buzzing. They lay clutches of up to 50 eggs on the underside of ferns and during mating seasons can be found within rings of mushrooms. There are preyed upon mostly by Augureys and Bowtruckles. Every time they molt, they shed their old wings, which are used in potions such as the Girding Potion and the Beautification Potion. They are loosely related to another insecto-homonid creature the Doxy (Venenumdente Dolor) which are used for their venom; they do not however co-mingle well."

I can't seem to create a coherent story as of yet, but I enjoy these parts at least. I'd like to help anyone with a creature book excerpt if they need it, if you like the way I write them.

Mermaids:

A more curious tome on water fauna could not be found then "The Tempest Swells", written in the 9th century by a Saxon witch who had an affinity for water magic and a slight addiction to gillyweed. It included several throughout essays on the subspecies of Merpeople. The 'Ceasg' of Scotland prefer fresh-water and are generally tolerant of humans to the 'Sirens' of the Mediterranean and Caribbean who are quite aggressive and seem to enjoy feasting on human flesh from time to time.

Grim:

In "Northumbrian Nuisances" a clear distinction is made to dissipate the uneasy superstition that surrounds this rare canine. Like the Thestral, the Grim is often associated with death and the Dark. Thestrals are only seen by those who have witnessed and comprehended death. The Grim are magical canine who are attracted to wizarding cemeteries, and are very aggressive against grave-robbing. There is however a creature that takes a shape similiar to the Grim. The 'Barghest' is a spectral bio-entity much like poltergeists, ghouls or dementors. Armed with vicious teeth and claws, they mostly stick to mountainous areas and ghost towns. The Barghest is deadly to all who come across it, and is perhaps largely to blame for the fear of Grim.


** This looks like it could be a fun fanfiction supplement- something to post like a series of brief articles. If you just want to crank out a bunch, I'd suggest making a story file on Ao3 (where they aren't wedded to limits like 'no scripts, no lists, no meta content').

Name it something like 'Snorcack Society Field Observations'. Each chapter would be a different creature. If you later wanted to expand on it, you could add a story about the witch or wizard's encounter that led to the article, or about how someone followed the guide and found something quite different.

** The [[http://themonsterblogofmonsters.tumblr.com/][monster blog of monsters]] is something like what you are writing, but of course a blog on tumblr. If you don't like tumblr, as Wordhammer suggested AO3 is great for this sort of thing, as unlike FFN it doesn't have the same limits on content, and you can also embed images.

*** Well that, and I also brought it up a few weeks ago that I've never read a decent fic where Harry has in interest in caring, raising or learning about magical creatures. There are fics where he's all about potions, herbology or the dark arts but never c.o.m.c.
