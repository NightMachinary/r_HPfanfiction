I don't remember much anything else, than the scene where Harry picks up Dursleys (not sure whether Vernon was present or was previously disposed off) from the old Potter farm at Guernsey (or Jersey?). Potter family house-elves live there as well, and Petunia befriends them. Does anybody know what story it is? Thank you.
