:END:
I don't remember exactly what year this was, I'm guessing it took place in the summer of 5th year. Harry stays at the leaky cauldron and goes through the whole getting nutrient potions, getting rid of glasses, etc. It's a Harry/Fleur story. One scene I remember is death eaters attacking Diagon and harry defending the place and in the process getting bit or clawed by Greyback. Any help finding the fic appreciated!
