Starts at right before Fleur's wedding reception. Gabrielle tries to convince Harry to confronted Fleur about his feelings for her. When he seems to gather the courage. Someone interrupts them leaving Harry alone in Fleurs dressing room. He leaves a note saying goodbye and that he sorry that he can't stay for the reception(don't think she read it). Right after the Last Battle, Fleur tells Harry she couldn't go through with the reception without seeing him one last time. Since she wanted to see if her feelings for him are still there. And then Bill walks up to them. Being the good guy he is. Bill says there's no bitterness between them since he never really had her. He wishes them the best and hands Harry a ring to propose to Her right there.

I read this about a year ago. One of the firsts to introduce me to the pairing. Haven't been able find it since. There's no bashing, debts or bonds.


** I'd read that.

There was one that had Gabby interfering with the wedding by sending Remus and Bill off to Saudi Arabia via trap portkey, but that's not what you're looking for as that ended up Harry/Tonks/Fleur and was longer than OS.

  Harry was asked to be the Best Man for Remus and Bill in a double wedding. The problem? They didn't tell him that the Best Man has an important function in Traditional Wizarding Weddings. Minor AU. Please R&R with open mind
