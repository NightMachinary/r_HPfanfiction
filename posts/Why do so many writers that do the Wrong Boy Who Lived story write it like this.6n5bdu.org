I can't tell you how many times I've seen it go down like this:

Voldemort goes into the nursery and faces the two sleeping baby brothers. Harry's brother, [insert name here], remains asleep, but all of a sudden, Harry wakes up! Voldemort eyes him, says he somehow senses his power (what???) and is sorry to kill him and casts the killing curse. But, oh my god, the curse rebounded and caused an explosion! In that process, a piece of glass somehow flies and lands perfectly on [insert name here], and gives him a scar. 30 seconds later, Dumbledore rushes in, and despite all of his experience, without taking even a second to think, picks up [insert name here] and says, "I present to you, [insert name here], the Boy Who Lived!". James and Lily show up later and unquestioningly believe Dumbledore, who also tells them that they should probably move Harry somewhere, as they'll have to focus all their attentions on [insert name here], and Harry will feel neglected. And, get this, they /actually listen to him/ with little to no reluctance whatsoever. And then they do one of two things:

1. Send him to the /Dursleys/, although there are thousands of other families that would be better suited to him, and there's no blood ward bullshit in this scenario; plus, how in the world would Lily allow that to happen?

2. Keep him, but somehow /forget/ about him, and focus literally all their attention on the supposed BWL (99% of parents would never do this, much less James and Lily Potter)

Either way, Harry ends up as a vengeful, overpowered Slytherin while his little brother is some fat, spoiled, pureblood prince.

Like, are the writers just lazy, or can they genuinely not think of a better, more original way to write it? I'm not saying that I have better ideas for a WBWL story, but that narrative is so overused.

Yes. And that is why people with no idea how to actually handle it reach for that idea, making a degraded copy after degraded copy after degraded copy and leading to a situation when it becomes overused and not to a good effect. Sure, cliches aren't inherently good or bad; some authors can easily be described with those words, though.

** I actually HATE this trope, but then I love "Dodging Prison". So anyway, someone at Space Battles wrote a few snippets about an idea where Lily lived, but Harry still ended up with Petunia. I couldn't find the original page since I copy and pasted to my Google Docs a few years back. But I really like this concept and I'm certain nobody has written a full story about it.

[Snip 1]

Claymore mines. The best protection a mother can offer to her child. Shame James was hit as well, but it's not like she didn't warn him about the concussive force.

Lily: I am leaving tomorrow.

Petunia: Another one of your "errands"?

Lily: Yes. A new menace is rising in Australia.

Petunia: Is it that important that you can't stay another week?

Lily: Is it one of those discussions?

Petunia: Just tell me why you think you have to do it.

Lily: Because somebody has to. And it may as well be me. I have the means and inclination.

Petunia: At a cost of your son?

Lily: I left him in good hands, didn't I?

Petunia: But you left him.

Lily: ...

Lily: It will be easier when he starts Hogwarts. For you and for him. He'll be away for the most part of the year, among children of his age. He'll make friends. And I'll make sure to visit him on summer.

Petunia: I am still against sending him there. Didn't you tell me that the last war ended too abruptly? Tensions not resolved, merely put on hold? Do you really want to send him into that world?

Lily: I have no choice. He is too famous now. I can't hide him.

Petunia: He is famous because of you, you know? If you didn't disappear, if you didn't let the fools draw their conclusions...

Lily: You know how that happened. I was in a bad place back then. With James' death and everything else I... just... couldn't... The deed is done now.

Petunia: You can rectify it. You can reveal yourself to them, lift the burden from him.

Lily: My death is too important. It allows me to move more freely.

Petunia: You mean it makes life easier for you. What about him?

Lily: ...

Petunia: Just... When will you stop? The boy needs his mother.

Lily: When I find salvation. The end to all conflicts.

Petunia: There isn't one.

Lily: ...So I used a memory charm to make that guy believe he's my ally, and he turned against his boss.

Man: A memory charm? In the middle of a combat?

Lily: It was just a few memories. They wouldn't hold under any kind of close examination, but he didn't have time to think about it, he needed to react fast. It was a bit of a gamble, admittedly, but I needed backup badly.

Man: Hmmm... So, how do you feel about it?

Lily: Why does that matter?

Man: Feelings are important. To put them into words is half of my job, really.

Lily: It was a simple calculation. Their deaths would mean saving dozens. How they die wasn't important. If he believed to be my ally in the last moments of his life, well, he doesn't care about it now.

Man: Hmmm... Not a very healthy attitude, if you ask me. Well, I guess I can work on it.

Lily: Sure, you do that. Now, about what we've talked earlier...

Man: You can count on me. I'll watch over Harry the best I can.

Lily: And call me if anything happen. You have the emergency portkey.

Man: Of course. Though... isn't it a bit paranoid?

Lily: ...

Man: ...Well, maybe not for you.

Lily: After what happened last year... Better be cautious. Just in case.

Man: Can't disagree with you. Hogwarts is not what it used to be during our time.

Lily: Things change. Rarely for the better. I'll be leaving now. Busy schedule.

Man: I should be moving as well. Good luck, Lily.

Lily: Same to you, Gilderoy. Send me a copy of your book once you finish to prettify it.

[Snip 3]

/First year/

Lily: You are leaving with Aunt Petunia in a few minutes. Why don't you repeat our rules for the last time?

Harry: Muuum!

Lily: Please. Do it for me.

Harry: Fine. The first rule is to never talk about you.

Lily: Good. Continue.

Harry: The second rule is to never ever talk about you.​

Lily: And the third?​

Harry: Is to always carry a concealed gun on me. I shouldn't use it unless it's a matter of life or death, but then I shouldn't hesitate. I should also remember that it's a support weapon for surprise attacks and that most wizards will be able to take it from me if I didn't act fast.​

Lily: Correct. ...And it looks like it's time for you to go. Stay safe. I love you.​

Harry: I know, it's written on the handle. ...I love you too.​ ​

/Second year​/

​ Harry: I shot him. I shot him and watched him die.​

Lily: Was it a matter of life and death?​

Harry: Yes. I think he would've killed me otherwise.​

Lily: Then you did the right thing. Don't forget it.​

Harry: I still killed him. ...Does it ever gets easier?​

Lily: Yes. Once you cast your mind in steel and forgo all emotions in pursuit of your goal.​

Harry: Is that what you did?​

Lily: Yes.​

Harry: Is it why you are never home?​

Lily: ...Yes.​

Harry: ...I don't want to do it.​

Lily: You don't have to. I did it to protect you and other people, so you and they can preserve your innocence.​

Harry: But you aren't here to protect me. You weren't there when he died.​

Lily: That will change. I arranged the matters.​ ​

/Third year​/

​ Harry: Did you kill her?​

Lily: Yes.​

Harry: Why?​

Lily: A simple calculation. The diary was feeding on her. Cutting its source of power allowed me to end the fight quickly and potentially save the lives of everyone who was in school. Maybe more if he'd succeeded in replacing the adversary.​

Harry: You didn't know it for sure.​

Lily: The probability was good enough to take the chance. If nothing else, it eliminated potential risks.​

Harry: She was a sister of my best friend. She wasn't my friend, but I think she could've become one.​

Lily: Feelings don't enter my calculations. People could die if I do that. People did die. You could die.​

Harry: And if I enter one of your calculations? Will you kill me as well?​

Lily: ...No. You are the only sacrifice I will not make.​

Harry: You paused before answering.​

Lily: ...​ ​

/Fifth year​/

​ Harry: ...So now half of them think I am a liar or a lunatic, and that Dumbledore is the new Dark Lord.​

Lily: Don't worry. I will fix it.​

Harry: ... ​

[Snip 4]

Speak what you want about wizards, they weren't stupid. Lacking in common sense, according to some, but certainly not stupid.

It was easy to get into the Ministry, true: a lot of people had business there every day. Getting to higher-ups, however, required increasingly difficult security checks.

As usual in such situations, human nature provided the solution.

It was customary for high ranking Ministry official to have their personal Floo network nodes. It provided a simple comfort of being able to go directly to work from home instead of going with the usual morning crowd. Their homes, of course, were guarded as well by powerful charms and a few aurors always on duty.

While the possibility of one of those higher ups turning traitor and smuggling Death Eaters right into the Ministry was brought up a few times during the last war, the comfort and symbol of status the system provided always won over such concerns.

Either way, for an outsider to breach the Ministry security was almost impossible.

Normally.

With the Undersecretary occupying herself in Hogwarts for the year, the security of her home was deemed a low priority by people responsible for maintaining it. It helped that the Undersecretary was not exactly liked.

Aurors preferred to spend their hours somewhere warm, away from the rain. Charms started to show first signs of decay. Enough for her to slip in.

That was the hardest part of her job, and it still left her with little under an hour before the polyjuice potion which transformed her into some random muggle will run out. She was wearing a thick robe and mask, of course, but it never harmed to be careful.

Once she was behind the defensive lines, it was a simple matter to navigate her way to the Minister's office.

The office was tastefully decorated and projected an aura of authority the man occupying it did not posses.

Minister Fudge, hearing the door opened, raised his eyes from papers on his table.

"Who," he started to say.

"Avada Kedavra," she said. The man dropped dead, the look of surprise still on his face.

Dumbledore once said that using the Killing Curse damages the soul of a caster. She didn't believe it. By the time she started using the Unforgivables, she felt nothing at all seeing their effects. It there was a soul to shred, hers was in pieces for a long time.

"Morsmordre." She flicked her wand, a spell learned long ago just for such situations.

It was a simple calculation: one life to say hundreds or thousands. Fudge was denying Voldemort's return. His death was an easy way to both get rid of an incompetent leader and convince the public that the war is coming. Some would blame an imposer or even Dumbledore, saying he did exactly what she did. It didn't matter. She trusted Dumbledore enough to prepare his Order with or without the Ministry's support. And whether or not the public believed that Voldemort is truly back, they could not ignore the assassination of the Minister and the Dark Mark lighting in the sky.

Voldemort will reveal himself sooner or later, and the Ministry will be ready to take action.

If not, another prompting may be needed.

But you also need Lily and James to have a logical reason to give Harry to them. So something must've changed after they dropped Harry off that would cause them to literally abuse their beloved nephew.

If you're ok w/ possible spoilers (my and a friend's personal fan theory):

[[/spoiler][We know there's a Anathema codex spell called "The Nightmare Child". We also know Sirius has no memories of Jim, and he was in Azkaban and Ministry holding cells (heavily warded) since Voldemort's attack. It's possible Harry or Jim was actually created by Voldemort for some purpose a la HPMoR. That could explain wy Muggles hate Harry (which eerily mimic's Riddle's upbringing since he insists all his crimes at the orphanage were self-defense). There's some smaller bits of text that have slowly convinced me this theory is at least somewhat true, and if so it would definitely be a pretty crazy twist.]]

** The "the hero was betrayed and abandoned" trope plays a major role in those stories, in my opinion. As it does in canon, where the other students and later Britain turn on Harry regularily. (1, after the Dragon affair, 2 the parseltongue mess, 4 the "cheating", 5 the entire campaign). Something about the hero being spit upon and betrayed just appeals to some readers - I think because it seems to justify the revenge that often follows.

** Honestly? I think it's largely in part of trying to change the setting (eg: have James and Lily live, give Harry a brother, etc...) but still keep the canon framework and more importantly get more or les the same result. Which is to say a neglected/withdrawn/whatever Harry. To look at it a different way, and admittedly so I only seem to recall a handful even try to do this, but how many "wrong boy who lived" stories are there where James and/or Lily at some point realize their mistake and are genuinely remorseful?

Many WBWL stories also have James and Lily who are arrogant parents who are IMO no better than stereotypical Dursleys or Malfoys.

  Sequel to 'Mistaken Identity'. The Dunce Who Lived and his unfortunate brother have finally arrived at Hogwarts. Snape is both manipulative and placing bets. Not so oneshot.

** One I read long ago did this but it also had Albus' inner thoughts and he named the wrong boy the hero so he could ship Harry of even though he knew Harry was the right boy.

Short end is it's easy to do this as it's become commonplace in WBWL stories.

** I feel like - and I deliberately use the word "feel" here, as I have no evidence of it whatsoever - that these stories are often told by siblings of gushed over brothers or sisters. They read less like fanfiction, but thinly veiled coping.

Then again, given how utterly uncreative a lot of fanfiction is, it may also just be people copying something that has a lot of favorites to get those sweet sweet internet points.

** Linkffn(The Story of The Guys) Harry's brother is believed to the BWL because he has a larger scar. (Really it was from wood shrapnel from the explosion) Harry grows up in his brother's shadow, and is a bit bitter about it. However, in this verse, the Prophecy is different, and makes those who know it worry about Harry becoming the next Tom Riddle. (Which is hard to believe, because the Lone Traveler gave him help.) Also, he winds up forming a Marauders-esque group and waging war on the PFBs (Pureblood Fanatic /insert appropriate B-word/)

  Spinoff to 'HP: The Lone Traveller'. The story of Harry James Potter, the brother of the supposed BoyWhoLived, and his friends... My take on the old 'Harry the brother of the BWL' & 'Harry the Slytherin' plotline.

** Well, parents having favourites isn't unheard of - on the contrary most parents with multiple children have a favourite, despite not liking to admit it! If you couple this with the prophecy (they know about it of course, otherwise they wouldn't have gone into hiding etc.) and the prospect that the BWL will die facing Voldemort? Yeah, neglect/playing favourites is possible (they can justify it to themselves even "He will die facing Voldemort, so lets give him our love now - hm, Harry...yeah, well show him we love him once his brother is dead!")

** To try to keep with the original spirit of the book. One of the reasons the wizarding world is such a refuge that Harry wants to protect is because he came to it a sad orphan. To say it's 'just a trope' would be ignoring WHY it became a trope.
