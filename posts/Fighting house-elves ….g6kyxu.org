In the second book Dobby just with fingers smashed very adult and dangerous wizard to the wall so that Lucius Malfoy couldn't hurt his friend.

In the last book crowd of elves were defending their masters (students), I guess, with forks and kitchen utensils. Why?

Please, discuss.


** It would've been a very "why didn't they call the elves for their war much sooner?" moment if the elves could have snapped all the Death Eaters around.

As it is, it strains my SoD that elves can apparate through wards (or, permanent magical defences for the anal fanboys) and no on, ever, used them to save all their friends under attack.

"Death Eaters are attacking us!"

"Call the emergency elves!"

/Pop pop/

"Give Dobby hands! Give Twinky hands"

/Pop pop/

Or do that to lay down some Fiendfyre in Malfoy Manor and have the elf get you out.

(I tend to change elves into not being able to do that stuff in my stories.)

***** Because its completely unnecessary, Canon already has the frequently used term of 'protective enchantments' to describe such things, using wards is like replacing the word wizard with mage. I am not going to drop a fic over it,. But it will certainly make me feel like the writer has gotten lost in fanon to the point that they dont know the canon words anymore. It has even gotten so bad that multiple people I have discussed things with didn't even know what I mean by using the term protective enchantments in the context of Harry Potter.

Again why would you? You're writing Harry Potter fanfiction, not fanfiction about the likes of D&D or Elder scrolls. Sure nothing is stopping you from calling wizards mages, wands foci and pets familiars, but doing so isn't any less weird.

******** I ever only seen mage used as a gender-neutral term for witch and wizard because writing ‘witches and wizards' every time is long and redundant, just writing wizard is not really inclusive of the witches because I don't think it was ever used as an umbrella term (is that the right word?) and magic-user is... ish at best. Considering that the books already have the words witch/wizard, sorcerer/sorceress and Warlock, I don't see why the word mage couldn't be included as a gender neutral term.

********* The only time I can remember mage being used in fanfiction, it's been a title/descriptor for very powerful magic users. Eg, Dumbledore would be powerful enough to be a mage, as well as Flamel and Merlin previously. That seems like a rather fitting way to do it to me - though using it for a magic user regardless of gender could work great too.

********** That could work, too. I'm just so much engrained in the educational/title pyramid for witches and wizards that don't necessarily think about something's possible meaning or potential meaning. In my head it's: N.E.W.T.s level of education, Mastery level, Doctor of Sorcery, Grand Sorcerer/Sorceress, Archmage. Of course, you need multiple Masteries and Doctors to become a Grand Sorcerer like Dumbledore, and you need to be trained by an already existing Archmage and do ground-breaking discoveries or innovations in a specific field of magic to become one. At this point, if you're an Archmage - in my headcanon - you've become some kind of Cardinal Elector of Magic. Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel would be Archmages, but Dumbledore is only a Grand Sorcerer. Not one of them is under the age of 110 so much it takes work to become one.

Apperantly not in the case of protective enchantments since the spells Harry and Hermione used are the same ones that are used permanently for other locations, like the muggle repelling charm.

****** I'm not sure how that relates... What I meant above is that sane elves would find the idea of magically attacking a wizard or transporting a wizard to be unthinkable, and be shocked and horrified at the suggestion. You could still /order/ them to do it, but many would consider that order worse than how the Malfoys treated Dobby.

As far as wards, my understanding is that wizards just don't bother to consider or understand other races' magic, and so don't have any wards against such. House-Elves in particular aren't something they'd ward against - why ward against the furniture?

In terms of making use of House-Elves, the above explanation comes into play again - people just don't think about them (and most of the people that own them are on Team Evil and thus especially closed-minded).

******* My point is that even if elves would find the idea of attacking a wizard abhorrent, why would they have problems with saving wizards by separating them out of danger? Or transporting wizards, say, to the basement of Malfoy Manor, where the wizard cast Fiendfyre before thee elf transports them out again?

If elves are truly as powerful as shown in the books, not using their talents makes no sense. I can accept that most wizards won't realise how powerful they are. I can even accept that the first time anyone realised it was when Dobby had his moment in the spotlight.

But afterwards? How stupid does every character, on both sides of the war, you have to be to not realise how useful and powerful elves are? After Dobby demonstrated it by saving the trio?

** I always like the explication given in linkffn(The Arithmancer) which I think fits very well with wizards in canon: house-elves are simply overlooked. People don't think about them because they are a fixture associated with cooking and cleaning and people don't honk them capable of other things. But Hermione, who in her first year explored the castle and discovered the house-elves' quarters, became friends and learned more about them than possibly every other witch or wizard except perhaps for Dumbledore and Hufflepuff herself. House-elves are used greatly in this story and towards the end even the likes of the Malfoy learn about the threat they pose and ward their manor against undesirable elves.
