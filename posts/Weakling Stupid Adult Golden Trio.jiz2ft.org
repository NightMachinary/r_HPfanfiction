This is really starting to grind my gears. Too many fics where the older characters walk around like sheltered muggles who have never been in a fight. Getting out dueled by mooks, fumbling with their wand when drawing and getting stunned, leaving the bloody thing at home/lying about, grabbing someone and cowering behind cover instead of fighting, forgetting to use basic school level spells or shields.

"A dark wizard group is hunting us? Oh, I must be imagining things when I though that guy in the trenchcoat who dissapeared was staring right at us."

"Time to break into this enemy safe house. Im gonna just walk up and physically open the front door. What even are curses or traps?"

I can understand if it is an AU fic, but there is no reason why War Veteran harry and co. would ever do the dumb shit listed above. Dont make the protagonist stupid when they dont deserve it, just make the villains smarter.

*** Ya, Ive read a dozen fics this month with auror harry going to civilian hermione for help. Not once have I seen an auror hermione character. I dont understand why so many people want to include her in detective stories but dont just make her an auror with harry and ron.

**** My best guess is that it is an after effect of the whole SPELL thing back in third year. Many see her as this social reformer who will change everyone's life's for the better (admittedly, if it doesn't put an unreal workload on her such stories about political/social/economic reforms can be rather enjoyable) but since for this she would need to be in a political position it means that she can't go around solving crimes or investigating. Hence that when the authors want to put her in the story (love or hate her, but she is a very well-developed character after so much time invested in her) the way they find to do so is having her act as a consultant for the auror(s) Harry and sometimes Ron, fandom's interpretation that she is the brain behind the trio who solve intellectual problems/puzzles and always have some knowledge about whatever obscure field of study the story needs really doesn't help in this.

I would go as far as to claim that 98% of all fanfics are crap. But post DH fics seem to be particularly bad, and may handily beat the 98% crap rate

**** The vast majority of it is just a lack of research and proper writing practices. Which is understandable, considering that it's written by random people on the internet, not professional authors.

To any authors who might read this, do research. Like for OP's war veteran example, do research on how real world police/armed forces would handle a situation, and then try to apply that to the magical world. Don't just sit there and make shit up. As with all artistic pursuits, everything starts with research.

*** Wait, competence is not the definition of a Mary Sue. It's incompetence, or lack of action, while at the same time being praised. Am I going crazy??

So, OPs idea of incompetence + plot armour = more Mary Sue, then authors attempting to avoid writing, Mary Sue?

** I think it comes down to authors who aren't experienced at writing fighting scenes. Which is fine, and IMO it's not a huge deal if those scenes aren't a major part of the plot, but I've definitely read fics that feature a lot of fights/duels where the adult Trio fuck up to an immersion-breaking level.

** that's really interesting. I realise I haven't really read too many auror Harry fics, because honestly I just don't see him going into that career for long, but the ones I have he isn't bad at the job so much as listless and low morale until he works out what he wants to do instead. it's weird that it's such a thing though. I agree that he would have homed danger senses---unless they purposefully did it to show how much ptsd can fuck up your responses and stuff; but again that doesn't sound like what you're talking about at all

** This comes from people getting too used to the insane power-creep of fanon. Even your average fanfic Harry would absolutely dominate multiple Dumbledores in canon, let alone the Harrys that get labelled as OP.

Let him be outduelled. Let him be human and make mistakes. Let him actually have difficulties in his life. These all tend to make for better stories.

*** Power creep is a problem, yes, like time traveling harry who wandlessly duels thirty death eaters at once. That makes stories boring.

But thats different from war veteran, auror harry taking a wanted person into protective custody and not thinking to check them for charms or tracking spells, including the jewlery they were given by their captors that they never take off.

They can be outduelled, sure, but not by some angry drunk in a bar who, somehow, outdraws them. They were trading volleys with veteran death eaters/aurors, and escaping ambushes in muggle pubs as school children. Thats putting them in the upper leagues of competence before the timeskip to their adult version. They dont need to be Mad Eye Moody, but come on.
