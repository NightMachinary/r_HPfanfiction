I've been trying to search for a certain time travel story where Neville gets sent back in time to summer of 5th year by accident because of James and Rose.

The story starts with Neville going walking into Grimmauld Place.

Note: It's a story that's not in his point of view. It's in Harry's I think


** This sounds good and now I want to read it.

** The correct flair for this would be 'What's That Fic?'. Request is for /requests/. Like, giving guidelines based on which people recommend stories to you.
