One of the things I appreciated with the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/241642][Weasley Girl]] stories was that Hagrid actually got a fair bit of attention in them. He's not a MAIN character, but he IS a constant presence in Harry's life, often showing up to further the plot along or deliver exposition... in fact, I think that story pushes about as much exposition and "here's-what's-going-on" dialogue on Hagrid as it does on Dumbledore... weirdly, it works.

This did make me think about Hagrid in fanfics, though. He's generally not subject to bashing... at least not to the extent of Dumbledore or the Weasleys or even Snape... but he usually gets a very minor role, if he appears at all.

At first I thought that this had mostly to do with people not knowing how to write his accent, but... Fleur seems to appear in more fanfics, and her accent is even worse, not to mention she has a much smaller role in canon. So then I thought, well, maybe it's just that Hagrid isn't conventionally sexy, and can't really be written as conventionally sexy either. It's not easy to put him in a romantic role and actually get the readers to take it seriously. But then... well, I thought maybe the "seriously" part is the main reason here. Hagrid does seem at least marginally more likely to be featured in crackfics or comedy fics... if it's a serious fic, Hagrid's usually lucky to get even a mention.

So maybe it's just that fanficcers find Hagrid too ridiculous a character to work for the kind of stories they tell? There's something comical about Hagrid as a character that you can't really separate from him, and which doesn't really work if you're going for a very serious story. Turning him into a "tortured soul" like Snape or Draco doesn't really work because he wears his emotions on his sleeve. Turning him into a villain like Dumbledore or the Weasleys doesn't really work either because he's just so much of a big, friendly kid. And playing him off as a badass action hero would probably mean taking spotlight away from Harry, whom the fanficcers are usually more interested in writing... so in the end he's just ignored. MAYBE he gets one scene where he gets to be all down-to-Earth and reassuring towards the main character, but that's usually the extent of it.

Maybe I'm completely wrong here, but the theory makes sense to me at least.

But, I would kind of like to see if there ARE any stories that actually give Hagrid a good role. He doesn't have to be the main character or anything, but I would like him to get more than just a couple of small scenes... having him actually play a role in the plot would be nice too. Anyone know any stories that are good outings for Hogwarts' giant groundskeeper?

*** u/Dina-M:
#+begin_quote
  I like the usage of 'conventionally' here.
#+end_quote

Oh yeah... I know there are lots of people who would find Hagrid sexy. He's essentially a "teddy bear." But of course men like that don't generally appear as male models, and the movie industry certainly don't view them as sexy. Fanficcers in general seem to have more conventional mainstream tastes... if we ignore the fetish-fics, of course. Anything goes there.

There are exceptions, obviously.... there HAVE been a handful of Hagrid-romances, usually very short one-shots... but I'm speaking in broad terms here.

#+begin_quote
  He also rarely serves any actual plot purposes, so meeting with him would mostly just be for fluff.
#+end_quote

That's... just an excuse, though. If you WANT Hagrid to have purpose to the plot, it would be EASY to give him a function. People just DON'T. And I honestly think it's a combination of the reasons I mentioned.

Hagrid just isn't a conventional main or major character.

He's not conventionally sexy, so people usually don't want to make him a romantic interest.

He's not young, or at least he's not young at the "right time in history," not subject of any prophecy and neither everyman nor magical prodigy, so fanficcers have no interest in making him the main character.

He's got too strong a personality to be easily made into an angsty, kickass self-insert, so again not main character material.

He's not even really an authority figure, so he's useless as being the one Independent!Harry rebels against...

...and his intelligence and area of expertise center around subjects that authors aren't interested in exploring, which means he doesn't make for a good mentor. Can't teach Harry to fling deadly curses or brew potions that make him invincible, and he's so strong that he doesn't actually need to know martial arts, hence combat training's a bit of a bust too. PLUS, Hagrid is very clearly on Dumbledore's side, so he can't do the traditional "Harry's mentor tells that old coot Dumbledore where to stick it!" routine.

(If you see Hagrid as a mentor, then the fic is almost guaranteed to be a crackfic.. Lessons with Hagrid is a prime example.)

And being neither main character, love interest, mentor nor antagonist, a lot of fanficcers just don't have any interest in him. Which is a shame, because Hagrid is really cool... it's just that only crackficcers, and people who are interested in developing the secondary characters, seem at all interested in giving him something to do.

Broken Wings seems like it might be interesting, though the fact that the main characters of the fic are listed as Snape and Harry, I'm not HUGELY enthusiastic.... I rarely find Snape interesting as a main char.

I'll check it out though. Thanks!

Harris has a pretty decently sized role in events in this, I think it ought to fulfill.ypur requirements. It's also just fun to read.

  What if Hagrid took Harry away that terrible night his parents died? What if Hagrid wasn't as simple as everyone thought he was? REMEMBER THIS IS AU...a mix of canon, movie and books plus pure fantasy. Due to a time error I had to rewrite Chapter 47, made small editing changes to Chapters 48-51, and am writing Chapter 52. Will post soon.

Hagrid is just a Giant Shrek. Everyone thinks Shrek is sexy. Therefore, we all think Hagrid is sexy. To represent it as math.

Life = Shrek = Love Shrek = Giant Hagrid. Giant Hagrid = Love. So, Hagris = a smaller amount of love. But still some love.
