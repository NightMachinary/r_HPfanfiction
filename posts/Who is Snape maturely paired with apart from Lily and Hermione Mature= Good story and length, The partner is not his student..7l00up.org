As I saw the other post on Snape trending on this forum atm, I couldn't help but think :

Snape is a popular character in fanfiction "Some" of them have him in romantic settings It's usually Hermione or Lily

Have you come across any other possibility? Original character maybe? (Because there aren't much women around his age in the series).

I'd be interested in seeing how a Tonks/Snape turns out to be, but haven't been able to find anything major.


** Snape ends up with Charity Burbage in linkffn(The Best Revenge) there are two books and she shows up about halfway through the second one. The story is fairly AU, Snape is the first one to meet Harry, Harry gets sorted as a Hufflepuff etc but I found this it and the sequel really enjoyable.

The Stealing Harryverse by Copperbadge has a Snape/Tonks pairing. The series begins with linkao3(Stealing Harry) but they don't get together till part 9 (Harry's 2nd year at Hogwarts, the series starts when he is 8) linkao3(Laocoon's Children Year Two: Secret Tongues) basically Sirius doesn't get accused of murdering Lily & James and instead he opens a bookshop with Remus in Little Whinging to keep an eye on Harry before eventually “stealing” him from the Dursleys.

** I'd say the Snape pairings, in rough order of popularity -- Snape/Harry, Snape/Hermione, Snape/Remus, Snape/OC, Snape/Lily, Snape/Sirius, Snape/Lucius, Snape/Draco, Snape/Minerva, Snape/James, Snape/Regulus, Snape/Albus, Snape/Narcissa, Snape/Luna.

So for het, you'll find a lot of Snape/OC, a handful of stories with Minerva, then a scattered few with Narcissa, Luna, Tonks and Petunia.

An OC would have to do. Having just watched Sherlock, a woman like Mary would be an excellent match for Snape.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy. However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

** Are you talking about Snape-centric fics or all of the fanfic universe where Snape could be just another character with a small mention or plotline.

I usually read Snape-centric fanfics and its mostly either Hermione or Lily. Usually in the regular fictions, Snape is shown solely as a mentor or spy and is left unattached.

I searched for Tonks/Snape some months ago , there are some you may find on Fanfic if you put the right filters but nothing beyond that (unlike Snape/Hermione where you have dedicated such as sshg review and ashwinder etc.)

Snape/Narcissa is my least favourite pairing, and is (as a side pairing) usually tacked on just to cut Snape some slack because he wasn't awful in that fic.
