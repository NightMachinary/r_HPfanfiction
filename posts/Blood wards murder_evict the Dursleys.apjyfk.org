So the blood wards protecting Harry are supposed to be this extremely powerful defense that renders him completely safe from Voldemort and presumably most other things as well. That makes me wonder why I've never seen a fic where they defend him from the Dursleys.

I could see the argument that they wouldn't work against Petunia, and maybe Dudley, but Vernon isn't a blood relative. So I'm looking for any stories where Vernon goes to cuff Harry or grab him too hard by the arm or something, only to get immediately vaporized. Or launched out into the street, then barred from reentering.

Are there any good fics that feature this?

Thanks.

** I can start something like this.

Please give me a little more meat please.

Do you want him to be launched out and as a result they move somewhere else? Would you like them to attempt to move however Harry isn't able to, and as a result he lives by himself due to the blood wards seeing the Dursleys deserting the wards?

How far into the series do you want me to go? This can easily lead to strange ramifications.

*** Have them move, but Harry has to stay for some reason. this triggers something to let a person know from Child Services and Dumbledore, who work to get him farmed out to someone else.

They're not anywhere near as potent as people believe them to be. A house elf is able to infiltrate the house with impunity - and he thought that maiming Harry was okay since it colluded with its ideas of safety. A couple of Dementors attack both Harry and Dudley with impunity in Book 5.

Most of the inner circle Death Eaters and Voldemort wait just outside the house plot in Book 7 - the almighty blood protections don't do jack then either.

Mind you, I'd like to see the scenario that you've written out, where the blood wards do their thing and Harry is eventually labelled as a muggle-killer or something by some fool or the other.

But he doesn't hurt Harry within the house.

Again, this didn't happen in the house.

Why would the wards do anything? The bad guys weren't attacking or attempting to get onto the property. Apparently the wards were enough to convince Voldemort and minions against just storming the house.

Ehh, that's actually the exact opposite direction I'd want it to go. Harry Potter's strictly defensive wards killed the person/people who were raising him, the poor thing, what were those awful muggles doing to him?

There's not really a reason for the Ministry to slander him yet, and there's that built in bias against muggles working for him in this situation.

Maybe I've seen too many mugglewanking stories, but there are very, very few anti-muggle fics (believable ones, not the retarded LV/HP slash shit or the like). I've even seen some fics that have secondary characters glare at child Harry when he says that he doesn't like muggles too much, after said secondary characters rescue Harry from the shithole that is Number 4.

The blood protections are not just around the house - they're around Harry himself. Harry only needs to stay in the house for several weeks each year to reinforce/renew the protections. The protection activates in a dungeon of Hogwarts after all.

I mean yeah, that's probably true. Really though, this wouldn't have to be an anti-muggle fic, nor would I want it to be. Just a bit of an anti-Dursley fic.

Besides, just because it's rare doesn't that you can't look for it.

They're on the house, and they're on Harry himself.

It /seems/ as though it meant to be that the house protection works against a variety of things, but the one on Harry himself only works against Voldemort.

But yeah, it's rather iffy, like many other things in the series.
