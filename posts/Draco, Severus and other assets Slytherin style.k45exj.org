So I have spent far too much time scrolling through FFN for Slytherin!Harry fanfiction and I discovered it's actually woefully underrepresented. There is plenty of smut (most of it quite bad, all of it not to my tastes), a fair bit of whitewashing (or Fake!Redemption stories) and next to no stories where harry, or another Slytherin student is actually ambitious and cultivates acquaintanceships with useful individuals, maybe not taking it to the levels of Slughorn, but definitely profiting from association.

Cue Draco, who often is portrayed as Merlin's gift to Wizardkind and rarely if ever as a brat that could be easily tricked into wasting galleons on things that would benefit everyone, but him. Blaise Zabini, who despite being a Slytherin, from an unknown/dark/foreign house and having a mother who changes husbands like shoes is somehow never utilized as a fall guy. It would even be plausible! Then we have Crabbe and Goyle, who could be useful pawns - moved by proxy and entirely disposable. And even if the MC makes friends that are more than assets to them, or at least long term investments to be protected, I'd still like to avoid 'Draco in leather pants'. Snape is a good example - he can be useful, and still a complete prick. Having a working relationship and respecting his skill does not have to lead to a love confession, or even liking the MC.

Most fics that go for Slytherin either use that as an excuse to go full murderhobo, or turn into an overfluffed romance fic with an extra helping of smut.

Is it too much to ask for a MC who would just go about his/her business, not make things needlessly personal and then ride the gravy train off into the sunset, succesful and without too many enemies? A Slytherin that knows when to hold them and when to fold them, and actually achieves at least part of their plans? Where the House placement actually means more than green-edged robes and an underground dorms?

That is my question for you. Have you seen such a fic?
