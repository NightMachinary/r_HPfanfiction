A fan-fiction where everyone continues with their lives or a fan-fiction where harry's kids finds out the story behind their dad.

Preferably a long one.


** [[http://thequidditchpitch.org/viewstory.php?sid=5798&index=1][After the Flaw]] was the first to pop to mind.

** Everything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1443437/little0bird][little0bird]]. Suggested reading order is on the author's page, and there's over a million words. (The kids learn Harry's story somewhere in Questions and Answers, I think.)
