... and I have come up with the basic premise, but I really struggle to find a suitable goal for any of the main characters.

I have recently "come up" with the idea of writing a story, which includes a selection of a few tropes that may, or may not, be more, or less, very well known.

In the new story that I am writing, (to get my head finally free so I can focus on finishing my other project) I have decided that I want to change a few select things in order to combine all the prompts accordingly, so my vision works at least half well...

I have spent the last few hours writing character sheets, selecting wands that, according to Wandlore, would fit my imagined characters perfectly, and I even came up with a selection of prophecies that rhyme (needlessly so) in order to set up everything how I want and need it to be.

The story would be focusing on Harry and two of his brothers, (who I dubbed Richard Fleamont - and Septimus Charlus Potter.) who would all be born between 1978 and 1980, all three part of one (or multiple) three-way prophecies.

There would be three prophecies given over those three years they are born in. This would be the first one:

/Born as one in the sign of three, greater than any of the dark lords they shall be./

/First to be born with a heart made of gold, the fate of the world his words they shall mold./

/The second of the three with a gaze made of frost, raised he shall be by the child who was lost./

/Last of the brothers to be born to the stars, graced he shall be by a lightning scar./

/Born as one in the sign of three, entwined, their fates, forever they shall be./

â€‹

I had planned for them to be taken after the fall of Voldemort, each by a different "faction".

Septimus would be the first child. Born sometime in late 1978, he would be the oldest child of James and Lily Potter. He would have witnessed his family the most of the three brothers and taken in the love of his parents best. In this story, Septimus would be the godson of Sirius, as James would have likely made his firstborn child, no matter what, always the godson of his best friend. I feel like the character would be greatly inspired by Harry from linkffn(10610076). He would have been the one with the heart of gold, due to him being exposed to the kindness of Lily and James Potter, as well as the rest of the Marauders, for the longest of the three. In fear of being repetitive with my stories, I don't really want to have him being taken in by Grindelwald, but I feel like it would be a perfect choice. (I also love Grindelwald)

Richard would be the middle of the three brothers. Born sometime around mid-1979. Before his birth, the second prophecy would be spoken. He would be jealous, not harmfully so, but enough to be defined by that trait. He would willingly turn in the story, only to go against his prodigal brother. (Of course, I understand that at the age of one or two the concept of jealousy isn't as prominent or complex as in pre- or even normal teens, but I feel that it would leave a noticeable impact if one of the children was extremely prominent through accidental magic that would put the older of the two constantly in the foreground of the attention of the adults.) Lupin would be his godfather, not that it would leave any noticeable impact on the character as he was too young to really be influenced by sporadical visits of a stranger during war-time. (I realise how contradictive these two statements are.) He would later-on be taken in by Riddel ("/raised he shall be by the child who was lost./") turning, willingly, against the wizarding world.

Harry, who would still be the youngest and the one who would have caught the curse, would have been taken in by Dumbledore, but instead of being dumped at the doorstep, young Harry would be tutored by Dumbledore over the years to become 'the Dark Lords equal'. (Here, just like in canon, in early 1980, Trelawney would give the last and final prophecy. Either one that I myself created or the one that is canon about Harry being the Dark Lords equal.) Harry would be, logically, "the last of the brothers graced by a lightning scar". In his AU, Peter would have been Harrys Godfather. (Peter still a snitch though.)

The second prophecy I imagined would go something along the lines of this:

/Born as three with one destiny, the last they shall be of their family./

/Born as the first with all world at his feet, the duties of his elders, he is bound to complete./

/Born as the second with a task on him bestowed, a vision, with confidence, he seeks to uphold./

/Born as the third with no right to be, youngest, and saviour, of his family./

/Born as three with one destiny, chosen as champions by the greatest they shall be./

â€‹

This would have been the one that would have been foretold 1979 before the middle brother was born. It's more like a continuation than a separate prophecy, but I feel like it would come across better if it was separated.

To break it down, Septimus would have been the heir, so he would have to take up the duties of his elders. But I also thought it to be something along the lines of the tale of the three brothers, meaning that the three deathly hallows would sooner or later end up in the possession of the three brothers. In this case, Septimus would take up the elder wand, as did the oldest Peverell.

Richard would have been given the task to return Tom Riddle to a physical form (at some point later on.) This task he would be determined to fulfil, confident in the vision of Voldemort.

Harry would be the one to catch the curse, saving his brothers and thus his family. The three brothers would be the last of the Potters though, the rest of them would all die off within the canon timespan. (Unless I were to put Septimus into the arms of Fleamont or Charlus, which would be an alternative to Grindelwald.)

"Chosen as champions" would be a play on the fact that the three brothers /could/, later on, clash.

â€‹

In conclusion, I have no clue what the mid or end part of a story featuring these parameters would entail. Without a proper plot, this story would quickly turn into a training montage circlejerk with them facing off each other at the end of the story at unrealistic and unreadable capacities, making the story, in fact, cringe. There is no real drive for them to face off against each other, no real personal involvement aside from the fact that it would be a faction war between three brothers, who don't even really know each other, as all three of them were below the age of five when they last would have seen each other.

I also see no reason why they should really face off against each other. (again, no real personal drive.)

So I realise that this might sound like an appeal for you to write me my plot, but I simply ask you for your thoughts on what you think about a few of the things I am unsure about, as of yet.

/I don't know what to do with Septimus. (Who should take him in? Grindelwald? Charlus/Fleamont?)/

/I don't really know what type of story this would be... Action? Adventure? maybe even Romance?/

/How would the story progress? (Training montage nÂ° 103021? Time jump to them being all about sixteen?)/

/What would be the personal drive for the three brothers? (Emotion? Believes? Do they even know about each other, meaning do they realise that their brothers are still alive?)/

/How would a story like this end? (A gigantic face-off between Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Voldemort through the three brothers? A peaceful ending? A sad/bitter ending, only leaving one or two of the brothers alive?)/

I hope you guys have some ideas/insights to share. (I don't know if a story like this has been done before (most likely) but I haven't looked, nor have I read one, so I hope this is largely original.)

If you comment right away, I might not answer for a couple of hours as I am about to go sleep off the four-hour work I put into something I hoped I wouldn't write. (I have weird ways of coping with writing my A-levels and suffering "Oh man I have a project that I want to finish but I keep getting new ideas that clog my head and ultimately cause my story to turn into an eternally paused piece of data rotting on FFN.")

Thank you for reading and, hopefully, for your valuable insights. :)

** Ahmm...I can feel you jumping in excitment between the words of your story....

Looks like a A great plot...

About the first brother...Bring Grindelwald in the picture.. I guess...and the thread could link , when voldemort goes looking for elder wand...

Idk but I can see a pinch of Regulas Black in Richard...

A face off in the end sounds damn interesting , relating the brothers with those 3 guys grindelwald , voldemort and dumbledore

Who cares about adventure or romance.. it's harry potter... It's a genre itself...

Please ...Kill the first brother at the end...

You can connect them by legitimacy or occulumency (pardon my spellings) and they don't know that the others existed until ofcourse they meet....or have been told later...

I am eagerly waiting to read this...

All the best for A-levels... Happy Writing!ðŸ˜Š

*** Not saying that I wouldn't kill off one or more of the brothers, why would you want to see the older brother die? I am curious, as I don't really know why you chose him exactly, I could see it from a standpoint of like "a tale of three brothers".

Thank you, for your valuable insights, and for your well wishes. Maybe I'll get to write the first chapter in a couple of days.

** This is all just my speculations and suggestions that you don't have to listen to.

If Dumbledore still sets up Harry is a matyr then I don't see a reason for dumbledore to make attachments to his brothers who could be in the way for his plans, in my opinion. This kind of makes Harry apathetic in his feelings for siblings he never once thought to care about.

This makes Septimus who I'm guessing wants to be a happy family like what his parents gave him, if he still retains it if he does get taken by grindelwald. These brothers who don't care about anything but their goals.

Richard could feel angry about that apathetic feeling because he still wants the attention that he never got for not being the heir. Riddle could plan for the possibility that his family would try to change him so he would make sure that Richard's only memories of his siblings are tinged with bitterness and envy and things like that. With Harry not caring could make him feel betrayed-ish. Septimus well already the point of his jealousy and again wants to keep his last family alive.

Septimus I don't really know what to do for him.

*** Thank you for your thoughts and insights.

I will take them closely into consideration. I like that it feels realistic, like something that could actually happen.
