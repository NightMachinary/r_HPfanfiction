:END:
It was a trilogy, started HHr, Hermione is killed in the graveyard. Harry works with the goblins, and rather than a few battles it becomes an all out war


** I haven't read it but /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6859194/1/Years-at-War-Part-1-Triwizard-Warfare][Years at War, Part 1: Triwizard Warfare]]/ claims to be based on that fic.

  Harry forges his own path, turning to the Goblins of Gringotts for aid in the Triwizard Tournament? HP/HrG. Character Death! Written with realism, blood, and violence. Based on "Can't Have It Both Ways," by Robst. Used with permission. Sequel UP!
