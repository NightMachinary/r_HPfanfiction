Please recommend fics of GoF where Harry changed into the competent/noble/sentient wizard. Good if there will be Sirius like in the Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar). I like idea that the GoF is about totla Harry's betrayal and point of regaining the true knowledge.

PS Sorry for bad grammar. English is not even my second language

  Harry takes inspiration from a manga called Fairy Tail, as well as the great creation we call "The Internet". What follows is a different path taken. A path of strife, rebellion, and above all, power. Welcome to the New Age. Timeline moved to the 2010s. Eventual X-over with Devil May Cry 3, Stargate: SG-1, Smallville, Dresden Files and Ranma.
