Looking for fics featuring Grindelwald's rise or Voldemort's parents. Basically, anything that arcs before Tom Riddle Jr. comes into the picture.


** A fantastic story that includes Tom Riddle Jr. (but with a focus on Grindelwald's power and dominance) is The Skitterleap by enembee.

  [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5150093/1/The-Skitterleap][*The Skitterleap*]] - /Fifty years ago, Grindelwald won the duel that shaped the world. In a land overwhelmed by darkness, a hero emerges: a young wizard with the power, influence and opportunity to restore the light. Harry Potter, caught up in a deadly game of cat and mouse, must decide what he truly believes. Does this world deserve redemption? Or, more importantly, does he?/

**** I suppose. It's still worth a read regardless, and it doesn't end near a cliffhanger or anything, so you're good.

***** Alrighty, thanks, I'll add it to my list! I just have an unreasonable fear of reading something, enjoying it, and realizing it has been abandoned when I get to the 'end.'
