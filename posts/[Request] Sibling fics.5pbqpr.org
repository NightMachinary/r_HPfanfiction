I'm looking for fics where Harry has a brother or sister, younger, older, twin, it doesn't matter.

So long as it's a sibling fic that doesn't throw the sibling into Slytherin (Because the "Poor misunderstood pure blood supremacists" :'( ) , and isn't slash or Potter sibling x Draco or something similar, It's good with me.


** AntiHyphen is surprisingly good.

  The watchful eyes of the adoring public are locked on to the girl-who-lived-to-be-frustrated-by-society rather than where they ought to be: on her scheming twin brother. Slytherin!Harry, no Potter favoritism, no particular romance, HIATUS, but being worked on as of 2-1-16

** Linkffn(2970733) best WBWL story I've ever read, sadly abandoned in fifth year. Harry's siblings are lovely and trying to cope with a shitty situation once the truth comes to light in fourth year and they are all good friends beforehand.

** I'm working on a fic where Harry is the older brother of the TBWL, with Neville being the one that was announced as it.

Harry (Aged three years older than canon) though is in Slytherin dating Daphne Greengrass and his brother (who is canon Harry's age) is a Gryffindor who is good friends with Hermione.

*** I would probably replace "Dumbles" with "Dumbledore" in your description because people get really pissed at that for some reason. (Even tho it is entirely realistic for someone to call someone a stupid name, especially when it's a fic where they are against/don't like each otther)
