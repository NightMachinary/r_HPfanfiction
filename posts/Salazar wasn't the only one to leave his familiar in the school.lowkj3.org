Godric left his Griffin to protect the school from attacks rowena left her corvus to protect the knowledge of the school And helga left her familiar the giant squid to protect against attacks of water

So I'll be honest I'm obsessed with tge idea that the founders left there familiars to protect the school and speaking a phrase (like the speak to me salazar greatest of the hogwarts 4) would summon them to defend the school
