I've been reading “Harry Potter and the Swarm” and in Chapter 2 or so, there was a bit explaining how there was a demilitarised zone in the middle of the forest between the acromantulas and the centaurs. So, I was just wondering if there are any fics that just show a war happening between the two creatures. Maybe, Bane or smth (I forgot if he's the leader) and Aragog being the generals and so. Maybe you could sync it with the Battle of Hogwarts?


** I really want to see that. Really really want to. I had a bit of Forbidden Forest politics in my story, but as seen from the outside (their final battle had rather catastrophic consequences, because my Point of Departure had resulted in the Acromantulas getting and taming /Norberta/).
