Like JKR talked about how Fifty shades of grey overtook her in sales for a relatively short period of time. In an interview she says if she knew smut would be so popular and in demand for the general public and the fanon she would have included it in the last book.

If she did how would this have looked or played out?

** Well she was joking in that interview, it wasn't a serious consideration.

But I think you can read suggestion into that DH kiss with Ginny "giving" him something and how the kiss was "as she had never kissed him before". I think had Ron not interrupted them there could have been a romantic scene there.

** Yeah, I do wonder how she would include smut into basically a children's story. What, would she make the last book rated R or something? Would she put a naked Dobby on the cover? Up to that point, there was little romance and intimacy in the story, so if she was to include it in the last book it would be just crude. Not to mention that parents wouldn't buy such a book for their kids ^

** Hard to say. Hermione and Ron seem to be the clear candidates, but unless Harry is into voyeur stuff, it would be difficult, as he is the POV.

Ginny is away for most of the book, and, unless something freakish happened at Bathilda's house, the most likely cases would be a dream from Harry or some action with GInny early at the Burrow, with everyone in the house...

I suppose he could have woken in the night to pee, and heard Hermione and Ron going at it in the tent. Or come back from his sentry duty and caught them.

** Knowing JKR, she probably would have had Snape leave Harry a memory of him jacking it to a pair of Lily's panties, resulting in Harry declaring to the Wizarding World that his mother had made a terrible mistake marrying James and not the creepy, obsessed, murdering Potions prof.

Because let's be real, that's the kind of guy canon!Harry is (Albus Severus? Are you KIDDING me!?!?)

*** I can honestly forgive that had she written Snape differently. Like admitting that Harry is the reminder of his "greatest mistake and failure"
