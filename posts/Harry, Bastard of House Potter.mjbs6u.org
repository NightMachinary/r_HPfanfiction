Imagine a different take on the WBWL trope, where instead of being twins Harry is an illegitimate child of James. This would give a bit more realism as to why everyone treats him so badly, because he's basically proof of his dad's infidelity.

I imagine his and his siblings (who can be the real BWL or not) relationship to be similar to Jon and Robb from ASOIAF. Do you think this would be an interesting take on the trope?

  The boy grows more confident, smirk curling at his lips, “You don't recognise me, cousin?” he sticks out his hand, “Hadrian Gaunt,” he introduces himself, “It's always nice to find long-lost family, am I right?”It's only then that Tom realises the whole common room is staring at them, and it takes him too long to realise the reason why is because the whole conversation between the two of them hadn't been in English.It had been in Parseltongue.

Or a less abusive Dursleys story where Petunia takes Harry to Diagon Alley to avoid the FREAKS approaching her house. Harry doesn't learn he's Hadrian Potter, since Hadrian Potter has been off riding dragons and whatnot. All those books say so. While Harry would love to joke about their eerily similar names, he clearly isn't Hadrian Potter. Probably wouldn't work as more than a one-shot, but still fun.

I more or less spent the entirety of high school and uni reading fanfiction, and by now I feel like I've read all the great fics, so going on FFN or AO3 is pretty much browsing through the shit tier fics looking for something good that just didn't get popular.

You don't really notice it unless you dig through the archives a lot, but I'd say a good 50% of the fandom is the same five or so fics paraphrased by different authors. Especially ones written between 2010 and 2014, for some reason.

It's just that people think Harry is a too common name(even if it's the name of an /actual/ Prince) and Hadrian can sound noble and posh, and not too out there, while still similar enough to Harry.

Or if Harry needs to change his name, but the author needs the name to look similar, what would be an alternative?

Not like Harry seems to be a common name for purebloods? Maybe Henry would work?

******* Yes. the issue with Seer Luna as a whole is A. she's too sane and B. She gets perfect future vision. Give her seizure like episodes where she gets multiple different flashes of possible futures.

make the future a road with multiple paths and Luna is being constantly bombarded with different possible routes. It's only until things start getting closer to a route that she's able to discern what path they're heading on.

Another interesting take that I would love to see would be to make her Like Rikka from When they Cry (Higurashi), make it so she's time looping the time between 1991-1999 and whenever she dies she loops back to 1991 until she achieves her "Happy ending", that way she's seen as a "Seer" when in reality she's just time looping.

******* I think it would be less annoying (to the reader, not to the characters) if seer!Luna was like the Quills from Warframe. The Quills see the future with clarity. All possible futures. At once. As a consequence, they exist as some sort of collective consciousness of all their timeline-selves that drifts between past, present, and future. A single sentence walks between tenses at random. Focusing enough to exist in the present moment "excruciates". The scale of the ability would have to be toned down a bit for Luna to not manipulate the best outcome all the time, but that might be a fun portrayal.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** Do you want the biology? Here's a site that explains>: [[https://www.verywellfamily.com/twins-with-different-fathers-2447116]]. Basically, it's the same as with any fraternal twins. Fraternal twins happen when the woman releases more than one egg, and they are both fertilized, each by separate sperm. It can happen at the same time, but it doesn't have to. If a woman has sex with two different men during the time the eggs are viable, each egg can be fertilized by sperm from a different man. It definitely happens frequently with litters of puppies and other animals!

  AU GOF. Neutral! Harry. The 'Boy Who Lived' is Harry's older twin. Neglected by his family, intelligence constantly underestimated, his placement in Slytherin house is a shock. Disowning him was their worst possible mistake. Along with his friend Draco Malfoy he faces the challenges of the Twizard Tournament. Beware the Midnight Sun... Part One of a Duology.

Is there any reason for this? I mean, Harry said it himself, they never talked before. Yet suddenly she's acting like Dumbledore 2.0

** I find it very hard to equate HARRY POTTER to ASOIAF world. But I can stretch things, sure. Let's do it!!

Robert is the king in ASOIAF. The Minister of Magic is Fudge.

Master of Coin is Petyr Baelish. His opposite is Lucius Malfoy.

Grand Maester is Pycelle. His opposite is Dumbledore.

Master of Laws is Renly Baratheon. His opposite is actually his opposite, the Lady Amelia Bones.

Master of ships is Stannis Baratheon. In a complete reversal, Stannis is much better than Madame Edgecombe.

(This is where we learn that the spies are completely fucken useless. GoT side because he wants chaos, HoP side because he wants Harry Potter to suffer.)

******* I think it more has to do of how we perceive that person. Joffrey was raised by Cersei to think of himself as almighty and everyone else was an inferior creature compared to him. It's pretty much like we squash a bug (that's a life taken too). Dumbledore always appears superior to people around him through his dominating presence. Malfoys believe Muggleborns are inferior creatures, dehumanized.

Although I think that (and I neither agree with any trope that leads to Dramione, nor do I think it's romantic in nature) Draco has some respect for Hermione. He talks about her to his parents, he copies her tactics from OotP in HBP so there might be a possibility that those words might come from jealousy. So I'll give you that.
