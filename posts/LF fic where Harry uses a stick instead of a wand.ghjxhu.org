:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was a one-shot I think (or otherwise a 'short' story, under 10 chapters). It featured a greyHarry that learned/mastered wandless magic before Hogwarts, matched with his canon wand but never used it. The one memorable thing is that instead of using the wand exclusively or going all out with wandless magic, Harry polishes up a stick and uses it to make it look like he's using a wand while still practising his wandless abilities.

EDIT 11/05/2020: Found it! It's linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4133028/1/The-Birth-of-Evil]])

  "Will you wield greatness gently?" Harry was told the truth of the strange events around him by Petunia at an early age. However, the result of him exploring his magic led to Dudley's tenth birthday ending rather differently. A near death experience leads to an encounter with a far more sinister Truth. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. Innocence is no exception.

** This one isn't short, but there's some story on AO3 where Harry learns Latin early on and it lets him interact with magic differently, so much so that by the time he gets to Hogwarts, he has trouble channeling through a wand. So he uses a stick instead.

  Latin; a dead language with no practical applications except perhaps the deciphering of old texts and as a particularly quaint party trick. Thankfully, as Harry finds out, Latin is not as dead as he was first taught when he decided to learn the language. It wouldn't have mattered anyway, of course; he loved Latin, and would have been proud to know it even had it been as useless as it was pretty. But in the world of Wizards, the world of Magic, Harry realizes his rare talent with words is particularly valuable, and allows him to use magic that no one's ever heard of, that no one's ever seen. But as time goes on, and he becomes more and more entangled in the webs spun by those around him, he starts to realize just how deep the magical rabbit hole goes and how dangerous power like his can be. All Harry had ever wanted was for the world to make sense.
