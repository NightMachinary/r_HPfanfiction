I want to read a fic where Harry goes off to Hogwarts, gets a taste of not being miserable, finds out that he's got money and fame and whatnot, and decides that he's done with living at the Dursleys. So he goes on to somehow change his living arrangements.

It's fine if Harry talks to Dumbledore about it, gets refused, but goes ahead anyway. Just so long as it's not a full on tropey indy! Harry.

I'd also take any fics where he manages this pre-Hogwarts.

 

Anyone have any good recommendations for fics like this?


** I've read a couple of fics like that. From the top of my head I only remember Rune Stone Path linkffn(11898648), which has exactly that scenario. In this one he manages to get legally adopted by someone he actually cares about, even after Dumbledore's refusal. And in the end he gets a bonus in that department, but I can't say more without spoiling the story.

​

The Accidental Animagus linkffn(9863146) also has something like that, but in this one he escapes his home at a very early age and gets adopted by the Grangers. It's a good read, but this one's discontinued, seemingly abandoned, and just when it was getting good too, so I don't know if it's worth the read for you.

  10 year old Harry finds a chest left by his mother with books on some of her favorite subjects. Discovering he has a talent for understanding and creating runes sets Harry onto a very different path than anyone had expected. Shortcuts, inventions, and a bit of support go a long way! Pairings: H/Hr/NT/FD/DG. Ron/Molly bashing and GreaterGood!Dumbledore.

The Accidental Animagus, though, is part of a saga. It starts with The Accidental Animagus, continues in The World of The Accidental Animagus, and goes on in Animagus at War. It is in this last one where the story seems abandoned, It's been almost a year since the last update and it doesn't seem like it's going to resume any time soon.

****** Isn't White Squirrel the author for the Arithmancer series? It might be that they'll get back to it once that one's done, I vaguely remember a mention of that. It only has like 3 chapters left. So new chapters for the Accidental Animagus might be forthcoming.

******* I seriously hope this is the case. That story was actually quite good. Actually, everything I've read from White Squirrel is usually a few notches higher than the rest of the content in terms of quality. If this is the case, then I'll gladly welcome the wait. I'm willing to wait a few months to preserve the quality of two good stories. I don't want Annals of Arithmancy to be rushed, and if the wait means that the Accidental Animagus is going to continue with full strength, then so be it. I want to believe.

*********** Yeah, Annals of Arithmancy is an epilogue series. The entire thing is post Voldemort/Hogwarts Battle, and it shows Hermion'e life and most notable achievements in the years following the battle. To be fair, it *is* kinda complete, since the author has stated that the story is layed out already, and that it will have 25 chapters. I assume they just need some polishing before they're published, it's just a matter of time.

** This was the most recent I've read from Fictionhunt.com: [[https://fictionhunt.com/stories/p7xer58/serpens-armarum/chapters/1][Serpens Armarun]]. I was looking for creature fics though, so keep that in mind.

The story (Serpens Armarun) also has an unfinished (probably abandoned) sequel: [[https://fictionhunt.com/stories/8j4zwy8/serpens-arcanem/chapters/1][Serpens Arcanem]].

But here is another option that I really enjoy (from FFN) and it has two (long and finished) versions: 1) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9877185/1/Emancipated-Minor][Emancipated Minor FFN 9877185]] 2) [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10201587/1/Emancipated-Minor-Extended-EM-E][Emancipated Minor - Extended (EM-E) FFN 10201587]]
