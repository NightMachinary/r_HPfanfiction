Optionally, she marries someone other than Vernon. How would things be different?


** If Petunia was a witch a lot of her resentment she built up for Lily would never have been. Oh, there would be /some/ of it, still, of course. I get the feeling Petunia always felt overshadowed by her younger, brilliant and pretty sister (and it is a really unpleasant feeling, that). That would not go away completely, even if both of them were witches. - But, at least the Big Resentment would not happen.

Petunia would go of to Hogwarts one, two years before Lily, and for a while she was able to form her own relationships without any comparison to her sister happening. I don't think she 'd be Gryffindor (or Slytherin, for thst matter), so even after Lily joined her in Hogwarts the two had some distinctly different experiences.

Petunia probably wanted to fit in in the magical world more than Lily did. To have her place and be seen as completely respectable witch. That conformity seems to be in her core personality. But of course in wizard society that means somewhat different things than in muggles society /and/ she would find herself in a world where some people saw her as second class citizen or worse. Voldemort was on the rise, horrible things whe happen ing to people like her and her sister, and no matter what she did she would need ever quite fit in. - I think that would somewhat sour her on magical society. Not enough to give up on it, but enough to be a bit jaded a bit it. I don't think it would drive her to fight, at least not openly.

Lily would still join the fight, though, and the canon events up to Halloween 1981 would still happen.

Because the Big Rift never happened Petunia would be far less hateful to Harry. Actually, things could go different ways here, depending on different factors.

Petunia may be overprotective of Harry, seeing him as the extension of her sister, but this time in the sense of "I could not talk sense into her. Need to at least protect her son. "

Or maybe she'd take care of him but not be above using his image and fame to finally, finally be recognised as more than just that horsey-faced muggleborn girl.

Or the events and war happening were to much for her and she tried to distance herself from the magical world. Cannot hate Harry, but still tries to teach him from early on to be wary of things that seem to be too good to be true.

I think even in the last case, though, at least Harry grows up knowing love. Still, he will be a different child when he starts Hogwarts.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

  It's never easy to be brilliant, friendly, pretty, wonderfully talented Lily Evans' sister. Even when you're also a witch yourself. But Petunia Evans isn't one to just let herself fade in the background and be forgotten, not if she has anything to say about it (and she has plenty to say, even if she doesn't voice it out loud). Someday, she'll shine on her own, just wait and see! However, shining in a war-torn era isn't that easy when you're Muggleborn, and even more so when no matter what, Lily always seems to do everything better...

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
