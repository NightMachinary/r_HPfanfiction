Let's say Ron is using dark magic to kill off the Sntachers during the Hunt. Harry has reservations but Hermione is overjoyed at the sight and grows more attracted to him

  "Ron was great," said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. "Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're aiming at a moving target from a flying broom--"

  "You did?" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck.

  "Always the tone of surprise," he said a little grumpily, breaking free. "Are we the last back?"

Shit's canon, yo. Hermione gets murderboners. If Ron had gone all badass on the Snatchers and avoided them getting captured, she'd have creamed herself. :D

** Well then she must've been hella turned on when Ron suggested they kill the Death Eaters instead of wiping their memories when they got attacked in that cafe after Bill and Fleur's wedding.

Ron has a few Dark moments in the books. We saw a flicker of it when he expressed interest in the elder wand wheres Hermione and Harry thought the cloak and the stone were the best Hallows. Come to think of it everyone in the trio has their own handful of questionably dark moments (notably Harry using Crucio on Bellatrix and Hermione kidnapping Skeeter).

*** Forget Bellatrix, he cruiciod Carrow for basically nothing. Sure the guy was evil, but Harry could easily have used any other, less sadistic, spell.

** I mean this is certainly an area that's not explored enough, but it won't be a complete 360 from their canon selves. Hermione already has a nasty mean streak and she has shown that she doesn't mind breaking the rules if she thinks it's for a better cause. Attacking Ron, Skeeter bullshit, probably scarring Edgecombe for life, forcing something on house elves even though they didn't want it among other things shows that Hermione herself is a bit of 'dark'.

Ron doesn't really minding killing off Death Eaters if it's in his (and his family's/freinds') self-interest. He probably killed a couple in the battle of the Seven Potters anyway. He had no problems killing off those two Death Eaters after the wedding and I don't think he'll lose much sleep if he failed to save Draco from that fiendfyre. And personally, I agree with him. I sure as hell am not going to risk my life, my girl's life and my best mate's life for a racist bigot. Specially one that tried to kill me.

And they are both attracted to each other despite these 'dark' traits. I mean Hermione did physically attack Ron and he doesn't really mind these tendencies. And Hermione is aware of Ron's dark moments.

I would love to read a fic about that takes it one step further and it won't be much far from canon. And any Ron/Hermione material is good material as far as I am concerned.

** Teacher pet being attracted to a bad boy. Not very original but certainly interesting and I've never seen it done before in R/H.
