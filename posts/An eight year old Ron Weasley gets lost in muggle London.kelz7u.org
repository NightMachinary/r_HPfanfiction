Hermione finds him, wants to bring him to the police station or smthg, but Ron convinces her to go somewhere else instead and Hermione, not yet such a stickler for rules yet, drags him off to a museum but he end up bringing the both of them to the cinema instead and they snuck in and had an extremely fun day

3 years later on Hogwarts Express, in true Kdrama and Cdrama fashion:

** I somehow want to turn this into Hermione getting a sneak peek at the Wizarding World. Maybe have them (along with at least one of her parents because even then few 8yo wandered London alone) turn onto Charing Cross and Ron recognizes the street, then the Leaky Cauldron. Drags the Grangers in as the Floo activates, etc.
