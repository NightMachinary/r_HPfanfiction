I just rewatched my fair lady(if we could clone people, i would so clone audrey hepburn!) and immediately mused on Neville and Harry turning guttersnipe ginny into a lady then dismissed that idea and mused on gone with the wind's setting with hp characters replacing gwtw's and, shock and horror, fem!harry as Scarlett.

Laura would also be a good story to use as the basis for a fusion fic with auror!harry investigating the murder.


** The Arthurian Legends.

Harry is Arthur. Albus ends up as Mordred, and Harry is forced to have a final battle with him to save wizarding Britain. His holly wand becomes a sacred artifact of magical Britain following the battle.

***** My take on that is that the whole of the Arthurian legends /actually/ happened in the 11th century. When the wizards went about implementing the Statute of Secrecy, they found that the Arthurian history was too prevalent to be wiped out completely, but also too involved with magic to be allowed to remain in history books; so they changed a few details, declared it all myth, and altered the evidence and records to suggest it had actually taken place in the Dark Ages, so that if the Muggles ever dug up what was actually historical evidence of King Arthur they'd dismiss it because "the dates didn't fit".

This has the advantage of suggesting stuff like the Winchester Round Table may actually be the real thing, passed off as forgeries because the wizards' stratagem worked perfectly.

**** No, I meant more like that the Arthurian legends are repeated in wizarding britain as a sort of "destiny." A young child takes up the mantle of protector/king of Britain in a time of crisis, is able to bring about relative stability and gather a group of rag-tag yet talented and likeable individuals, has an old man as a "mentor", then ends his life in a final duel with a son who lived in the shadow of his more famous father.

That sounds like a great post-DH spin-off to me. Years later, the ministry keeps his wand under the name "dealanaich" (lightning), with only the worthy protector of Britain being able to command its loyalty (unique to other wands where you can "win" their loyalty).

** A page from the rise of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus][Augustus]]:

The trio Octavian/Agrippa/Maecenas was probably the only instance in world history in which a group of teenagers overthrew an existing government and proceeded to build a lasting order of their own.

Even more interesting, Octavian lost his birthfather at age 4, and his stepfather basically didn't want to have anything to do with him, so he became effectively orphaned. After he began attending a private school, he made life long friends with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Vipsanius_Agrippa][Marcus Agrippa]] and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaius_Maecenas][Gaius Maecenas]]. Later, his wife [[https://www.ancient.eu/Livia_Drusilla/][Livia Drusilla]] would rise in prominence and gain in influence.

--------------

In my version, things will of course not be completely analogous to Roman history, but knowledgable readers can definitely identify the patterns. I expect characters to be mapped in following ways:

Harry - Octavian

Hermione - Marcus Agrippa

Ron - Gaius Maecenas

Ginny - Livia Drusilla

Dumbledore - Caesar

Voldemort - Pompey Magnus

Kingsley - Mark Anthony

Snape - Brutus

Dora Tonks - Octavia

--------------

In this version of AU, the line between good and evil was far more murky. The 'real' Voldemort was nothing like described in the Books. He neither looked like a snake nor did he mutilate his own soul (although he did perform several dark rituals to increase his magical power).

Although he fought for a cause that might appear archaic to the modern Muggle world, it nevertheless made some sense in the Magical World (one major point of the conflict was the governing structure of Magical Britain. Voldemort favored the traditional oligarchy in which 'Old Families' called the shots, while Dumbledore wanted to turn MoM into a centralized modern government. The boiling point was reached when Dumbledore tried to pass a law that slapped enormous inheritance tax as a mean to weaken the 'Old Families'.)

Tom Riddle had been teaching DADA from 1957 to 1968 when he resigned the post in protest. The war began in earnest when MoM tried to arrest him for his almost militant opposition to the Inheritance Tax in 1971. From then on, he adopted the mantle 'Lord Voldemort' as he completed a very important power boosting ritual.

Voldemort inspired loyalty not through wantonly torturing his followers, as the Books fondly depicted, but through persuasion, protection, and true leadership. He was also very protective of his loyal members, and went to great length to extract retributions for their sufferings.

His tactics were brutal and ruthless, but so were his enemies that were supposed to be on the 'right side on history'. Both sides did commit their shares of atrocities, as was generally the case in a civil war.

But in the end, despite defeating his arch rival Albus Dumbledore in a decisive engagement, Voldemort underestimated the cunning and ruthlessness of the young Trio, walked into their traps, and was killed.

After his death, the winners instituted systematic purges in Magical Britain, and silenced most critics. I've not decided yet whether to have Harry and Kingsley fight each other out, but given how ambitious and ruthless this Trio was, I'm inclined to have a repeat of ancient Roman history. Ginny would then play a very important role during this second stage of power struggle.

*** This is a fantastic idea. A lot of themes in hp would translate well to Ender's Game. A few off the top of my head are

- Children gaining remarkable independence, but still being pushed around by those older than them. In harry potter, the trio goes on adventures that most adults wouldn't dare go on, but spend the vast majority of the books forced to obey the rules the adults set, such as the trace, the hogwarts point/detention system, not being allowed to join the order or here about order business, the prophecy being hidden, etc. In Ender's Game, Ender gains significant self agency from the moment he steps on the transport, and yet spends the entire first book being manipulated by the higher ups.

- The protag's mental health being weighed against the needs of the great good, and other instances of adults not giving a shit about the protag. Just like how Dumbledore has to make choices between harry being happy and winning the war, the higher ups in Ender's Game repeatedly disregard Ender's well being to better shape him into a tool to beat the aliens.

- When adults distance themselves from the protag, the protag forms bonds with those their general age. Both harry and ender have ride or die relationships with their peers, in part due to the adults holding themselves above the protags.

- The protag having great empathy. Part of what makes ender such a Greta strategist is his ability to empathize with the enemy, and even in his final battle, harry offered voldemort one last chance.

There are tons more but I can't be bothered to elaborate on them right now.

**** Okay, in my head it sort of works like this:

Goblins are one of the known magical species (as appear in the Fountain of Magical Brethren in the MoM), and I imagine that (as we see Jareth manipulate it) at the heart of their magic is the manipulation of time. They use this to put The Goblin City slightly out of phase with the Muggle/Wizarding world, thus hiding and protecting it. It is also how they came into the money to establish Gringotts. There are different castes of Goblins, two we see being the erudite and swift of mind who are often found working at Gringotts (and similar enterprises) and a warrior caste which are the ones we see in Labyrinth protecting the Goblin city, and would have once been the ones running amok during the Goblin Rebellions in HP. Obviously some of the most powerful like the King are skilled in other fields of Magic as well, like Glamours. Which as he became enamoured with Sarah he utilized, though his appearance is still somewhat off-kilter and eccentric when compared to Muggle attire.

** If you're talking classical classical, like Greco-Roman mythology or early chinese literature classical, The Odyssey and Journey to the West would be my top choices. Indian literature would probably have some great ones too and arabic fiction from the time of the Ottoman Empire (1001 nights-style snippets, for example) would go over magnificently.

If by classical you mean more western-style classical, then the Norse and germanic legends would fit the bill there too, as would the Arthurian legends and tales of chivalry from France and Italy, especially those parts pertaining to quests and magical beings.

But hey, classical these days generally refers to anything up to the 1930's, so with that in mind, Robert E Howard's Conan the Barbarian series and Howard Phillips Lovecraft's mythos would provide much fertile ground for crossovers.

Personally, though, I've always wanted to see a treasure Island-style adventure where the golden trio get entangled with pirates and have to help the crazy captain get his treasure so that they can get back to England in time for the next school year.
