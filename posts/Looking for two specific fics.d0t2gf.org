:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
First was one that had Harry in the tournament and he defeated the Dragon by simply suffocating it with (if my memory is right) a scarf. I don't remember anything else, I'm afraid.

Second was one set in the afterlife. I believe a lot of the plot was Harry getting to know his family. Maybe they were reviewing the events of his life? I seem to recall that people had their own houses, and I think Hermione was some sort of guide? It's not the one with the toasters I'm pretty sure.

I hope this is enough to find them, it's been bugging me for a while now.


** I don't remember reading the second one, but the first one is this I believe, it was a piece of cloth (ch 18):

*** Yep, that's the one. Thanks for finding it!

Forgot it was a Sinyk story. Guess I'll skim through the chapter dealing with the dragon to refresh my memory on the details of that bit, and then ignore the rest. I'm really not in the mood for one of his stories at the moment.
