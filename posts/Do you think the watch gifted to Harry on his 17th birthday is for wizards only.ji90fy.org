** Molly didn't need a watch, she had the family clock (which could have even been something Arthur had tinkered with and created out of her watch given its apparently one of a kind).

But I'd ssume it's also traditional to give witches a watch as well since time keeping would be just as important to a witch. However, given that nearly every witch and wizard in the series is either a student, teacher, or adults related of HP and co in their homes it's unsurprising that we get no mention of watches outside of Harry's wrist watch, the traditional watches, and I think one of the Order member's that yelled at people?

** I'd think family jewellery? A necklace, a special pair of earrings etc.

** Even witches get a watch. Wizards being the only ones getting it is pure fanon.

** I always thought that the heir got their dads, like a family one. Any other kids would get a new/bought one. So everyone gets one but one is passed down and the others will be when they start families.

** Canon had no real evidence either way.

From what I can tell in a few minutes if research on the history of watches, pocket watches were mostly worn by men, and were passed down in families. Women mostly wore watches as pendants (which would basically just be a pocket watch worn differently, to be fair), and then as wristwatches.

If the intent is to mimic real life, it would probably fit more for a daughter to be given some piece of jewelry, which could still be a watch pendant in some cases. Watches are one of the only types of jewelry most men wear anyway.
