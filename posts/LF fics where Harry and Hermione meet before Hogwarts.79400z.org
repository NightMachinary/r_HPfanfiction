Looking for fanfiction where Harry and Hermione somehow meet in primary school (or elsewhere) and how that changes things.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6439871/1/A-Different-Halloween][A Different Halloween]], linkffn(6439871): Lily met Mrs Granger on that fateful Halloween day, and everything changed.

In the non magic AU [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/8941561/chapters/20467861][half awake and almost there]], linkao3(half awake and almost there), Harry and Hermione knew each other from very early on and were currently roommates at an Ivy League college. Harry has an interesting background and is entering a nice, slowburn romance with Ginny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146): Harry ran away at age 5 and was picked by the Grangers. Dumbledore found out soon and was actually happy about the situation. He also told them about Harry's real deal and brought Tonkses to help them. Harry and Hermione grew up as siblings and had lots of fun together. Unfortunately, the author still decided to rehash canon stations in Years 1,2, and 4, but Year 3 and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12088294/1/Animagus-at-War][Animagus at War]], linkffn(12088294), have completely different plot.

** linkffn(The Perils of Innocence by avidbeader) is a good one where Harry is left at an institution by the Dursleys and meets Hermione when her parents take her there to get help with her accidental magic. The fic is unfinished, but it did update recently after a long hiatus so hopefully the author will keep working on it.

  AU. In an institute to help children with psychological issues, a child is abandoned by his guardians because he does extraordinary things. Rather than fear him, the doctors work to help him try to control this ability. They discover other children with these incredible powers. And then odd letters arrive one summer day. Rating will probably go up later. Eventual H/Hr.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Thanks for all the suggestions.

I've actually read almost all of these suggestions. Personally the accidental animagus was my favourite and I've read up to animagus in war. The only one I haven't read was half awake and almost there so I'll have a look at that one. Blindness was interesting but I couldn't really get into super Harry stories.
