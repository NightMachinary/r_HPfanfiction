I want to see fanfictions where character parallels are mentioned, for example, Harry having similarities with Snape, but not the most-mentioned Harry-James, Ron-Sirius, Hermione-Remus paralells.

If anyone knows a fanfiction like this, could you please link it?

Edit: *Different

Edit 2: *Parallels


** linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12369512/1/]]) The peace not promised. A work in progress. Brought up interesting parallels between Snape and Dumbledore.

linkffn(Severus' Dreams) Parallels between Snape, a sort of OC and Harry. This is a sequel to 2 other fics, but you can read it on it's own and it mostly makes sense. It's a bit too apologetic of Snape at times for me, but still good and based on a unique premise.

linkffn(Blurring realities) This doesn't exactly fit because the parallels are not between different characters but between characters and their own AU versions of themselves, as well as events going on and canon plot but this fic is all about parallels (and blurring lines between what is real and what is not). I know it sounds really stupid from the summary, but it's so well written and kind of amazing and completely not what you would think from the summary. Unfortunately incomplete though.

  Tom Riddle, top student of the prestigious Hogwarts School for Dance. Albus Dumbledore, searching for the hero in his famous end of year performance by holding open auditions. Harry Potter, attending said auditions only to listen to the live music for free. Severus Snape, dance instructor, tolerating nothing but perfection. The line between imagination and reality, a fickle thing.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.
