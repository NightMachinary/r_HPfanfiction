  Yr 2: Harry has returned in time after one too many things went wrong, his careful plans have been messed up, so he's trying a few new things. He's searching for the diary, but while things are similar, his presence has altered enough to keep him on his toes! No pairings. Dumbledore/Goodguys bashing. 2nd in series. Rated M because I'm paranoid. Everything belongs to Jo!

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

** linkffn(Elsewhere, but not Elsewhen). Sadly, it's likely abandoned or dormant. I'm hoping the latter.

  Thestrals can go a lot more places than just wherever you need to go. Unfortunately for Harry Potter, Voldemort is more than aware of this, and doesn't want to deal with Harry Potter anymore.

  James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his family, his world, and his future. HHr, through the evolving eyes of James Potter. HHr/JPLE
