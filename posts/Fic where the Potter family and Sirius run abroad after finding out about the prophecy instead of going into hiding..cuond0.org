:END:
Dumbledore tells the Potters about the prophecy and instead of going into hiding behind the Fidelius, they abscond abroad, baby and 'dog' included, without telling Dumbledore or Remus or Peter.

I'm pretty sure it's a series on ao3, or if not a series, then at least pretty long. It also doesn't have any slash pairings in it, as far as I remember. All characters are canon and there's no bashing and no billion lordships and no woobie dark wizards and no WBWL.

It had seemed like a fun read when I came across it a while back, but I was in a wolfstar kind of mood at the time. I thought I had bookmarked it but maybe I didn't.

I'd be very glad of it if someone were to find it for me.


** That sounds a lot like a one shot I read, linkffn(11831304). If there's something similar but longer, that would be awesome

Edit: wrong link

  An hour after Dumbledore told them about the prophecy, James had his entire family- including the dog- bundled up on a Muggle ferry to France. Because there's valiantly dying for the greater good, and then there's good parenting.

***** I like the story, but I always kind of rme at the idea that hiding was bad parenting. I think they should have taken off, too, but it makes sense that they think hiding would be easier than traveling around the world with a baby...especially because James probably can't fit in with the muggle world well.
