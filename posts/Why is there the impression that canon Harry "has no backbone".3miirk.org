I've seen a lot of fics with descriptions including things like: "What if Harry stood up for himself" or "A Harry who isn't Dumbledore's lapdog". Even in otherwise innocuous fics, I've seen that, particularly in his interactions with the Dursleys, Harry is portrayed as being, meek, quiet and downtrodden.

This has affected my view of canon a lot more than I thought; I'm currently re-reading the books for the first time in years, and I was surprised to see how much shit Harry gives people, especially the Dursleys. Canon Harry is willing to backtalk /anybody/, and there is a really great dynamic he has with the Dursleys that I think is a missed opportunity in a lot of fanfiction. Examples below:

- The whole exchange between Harry and Uncle Vernon in Prisoner of Azkaban, where Harry is generally disrespectful and basically blackmails Vernon into signing his Hogsmeade permission form in return for not revealing his magic to Aunt Marge. In most fics I've read that would be worthy of a sound beating and a week in the cupboard without food. In the book Vernon acquiesces to Harry's request.

- Harry's complete refusal to give in to Umbridge in Order of the Phoenix, even when perhaps the smarter thing to do would be to pay lip service to the idea that Voldemort wasn't back (especially when she started forcing him to slice his own hand open night after night). That alone shows some serious balls.

- In particular, Harry's rage at Dumbledore at the end of Order of the Phoenix. This pretty much shows that Harry doesn't view Dumbledore as an infallible figure, and more importantly, it is shown throughout the books that Dumbledore makes some really serious errors.

I'm quite tired, and I'm not really sure if I'm successfully communicating what I'm trying to. I'll cone back to this in the morning and tidy it up. In the meantime, please leave your thoughts on this below.


** People have unrealistic views of what children get up to and are interested in. Hermione is very much the exception, not the normal. Take any other person and drop them in Harry's position, age 11, and with no extra knowledge of what's to come and they'd do the same thing-play Quidditch, chess, and goof off with friends. It is a very rare person that takes the initiative upon themselves to dedicate their free time and effort to learning and practice.

I think Harry does have a backbone. I also think he behaves like the average child towards school work and I don't think that makes him less of a hero.

*** I think it makes a lot of people sort of angry that here Harry is at a freaking /magic school/ and he doesn't seem super interested in /learning magic/. It's just incomprehensible to a lot of fans who would give their (non-wand) arm to be there at Hogwarts.

But honestly I think this is part of JKR's genius; if you have to work hard to learn it, I think the shine would wear off comparatively quickly for most normal people. We who read and write fanfiction are huge fans; Harry is just a normal kid.

So people get the impression that Harry is just a horrible slacker. I think one other thing that contributes is that he is so isolated with Hermione and Ron. If we could've seen Dean or Seamus or Neville come up to them at some point and be like "Oh noes, I didn't finish my homework last night" i think it would have shown more that Harry and Ron were normal kids and not the worst in their class like some take them for.

**** You've made some great points here! I think you've hit it on the nose.

Sure, they're learning magic, but that's the norm for them! To them, it isn't /MAGIC/ with all the sparkles and rainbows that we want so badly but can't have. Did any of us study organic chemistry in elementary school because we were curious? Spend our time relentlessly learning kung fu? No? Looks like we're terrible, lazy people like Harry and Ron :)

***** But it should be MAGIC with sparkles and rainbows and amazement for Harry. I can understand Ron taking it all for grated, he grew up with it, but shouldn't Harry at least treat it as this great gift that should be fully taken advantage of?

Hermione has this great pep talk in Applied Cultural Anthropology where she tells Dennis Creevey that as a muggleborn, there's no excuse for him to be anything short of wonderful with his schoolwork because he should be seeing it as a gift and an opportunity, even if all his pureblood classmates are slacking off because they take it for granted

**** I agree up to a point. For someone like Ron, it isn't magical. Magic is simple everyday life for someone like him. But for Harry, magic represents freedom and power. For someone who came from at best, a negligent home and at worst, an abusive one, magic is a power that means independance and an oppritunity to a much better life. This is why I would think Harry would be far more interested in magic than how he was portrayed.

#+begin_quote
  The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.

  “In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don't ask questions.”

  *Don't ask questions --- that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.*

***** But magic became work for Harry too. Sure, the idea of transfiguration is amazing, but when you're fifteen years old and have essays for History and Potions in the morning, you're not going to rush off to the library in your spare time. The main reason that Harry loved Hogwarts was that it was away from the Dursleys and he finally had friends. It could have been a muggle boarding school and he would have loved it as much.

Seems like a case of Gary-Stu. From your point of view things seem clear. Harry is a kid, no long term goals, no unquenchable desire for power and freedom, he is afraid of authority figures and doesn't know much of anything about the world. Yes, magic would give him a leg up against the Dursley's, except he can't do magic at home.

#+end_quote

Freedom? Magic is why he's at the Dursley's, why his parents are gone, why he got beat up as a kid, his own magic could better his life at home but the ministry uses magic to constrain him. Power? Everyone else at school is roughly the same as him or better. I agree that Harry could have been more inquisitive and learned more spells. But that wouldn't naturally lead to him solving the big issues in his life.

An adult wizard's wand is like an extra organ or limb, it seems like it would be basic to have charms to prevent it's theft, or to help in locating it. They could also just have a friend do a point-me spell (if it works like that, not sure). No matter what, it would be a big risk, with unknown consequences.

Sure it's a risk - but in Harry's situation that risk would have been worth it (because even if he was caught and charged, they would have started to ask questions, maybe even the right ones!)

** I think it's principally due to Harry not having much motive force to achieve his own ends, and the fact that, narratively speaking, he is often 'bailed' out by other characters. I realise, of course, that that is part of the message of the books- the whole 'rely on your friends' and 'love is the power he knows not' angle- but part of the cathartic satisfaction of the hero's arc is seeing the protagonist finally pull himself together and defeat the villain (i.e. Star Wars, Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit, Back to the Future, the Matrix etc. etc.).

Looking over the seven books very quickly in my head, I find it difficult to find a situation where Harry triumphs over evil without some third party pulling the strings- whether it is Hermione, Dumbledore's manipulations from beyond the grave, or the magical representations of his parent's love for him.

That is part of the reason Harry Potter Fanfiction is so popular- because canon, arguably, fails to provide that cathartic release we expect from following one character for so long. I think so, anyway.

Protecting the stone? Gets thrown in the middle of it and he can't pass the responsibility off to anyone as no one (or, actually, McGonagall) listens to him.

Rescuing Ginny? Gets thrown in the middle of it and can't pass the responsibility off to anyone appropriate.

Rescuing Sirius? Gets thrown in the middle of it and, even though Dumbledore believes him, it is still up to him as no one else takes a stand.

Surviving the tournament? Gets thrown in the middle of it and he either goes through with it, or he faces the horrible undefined consequences.

Rescuing Sirius again? Gets thrown in the middle of it and no one else is apparently available.

Horcruxes? Dumbledore throws him in the middle of it and then goes off and dies. Apparently everyone else is busy with their neighborhood watch program.

An interesting drabble capturing this (for the first book at least) is linkffn(Harry Potter vs Mr Potato Head by Perfect Lionheart).

Then again, we are talking about imaginary characters, in an imaginary setting, were we don't know what everyone is thinking at all times. Every different reader can look at it a different way and come to a different conclusion that fits his own interpretation.

Well, duh. he's barely a teenager. Of course he'd want authority to deal with those things. He didn't just come to Hogwarts and say "I'm gonna save the world all by myself!", even though he investigated those mysteries.

The underlying idea was that Harry's end goal is to defeat Voldemort, and he's not delusional enough to just charge head-on without asking for help from the ones who are in position to do so.

Slightly OT, but it just occurred to me that for the first pair of stories, the lesson /is/ to rely on your friends, and that love is the power the bad guys know not:

- In /Star Wars/, Luke destroys the Death Star by trusting The Force over a targeting computer, and his defeat of Darth Vader is actually a step towards the Dark Side: the victory over the Emperor is accomplished by trusting Darth Vader to do the right thing. (I imagine that Emperor Palpatine thought that if he killed Luke, Darth Vader would go right back to his old position.)
- In LotR, the protagonists' whole plan is to destroy the concentration of power that is The One Ring instead of using it /because/ Sauron cannot imagine anyone doing something so crazy, and, to that end, Frodo and Sam need Aragron and Gandalf to draw Sauron's attention, while Aragorn and Gandalf need Frodo and Sam to destroy the ring.

*** In Star Wars, Luke would be dead a hundred times over if it wasn't for his friends. Without Obi Wan he wouldn't have blown up the Death Star, without Han he would have died on Hoth and without Darth Vader turning on the Emperor he would have been killed then.

In the Lord of the Rings, Frodo is literally carried up Mount Doom by Sam, after Aragorn distracts the Eye of Sauron at the Black Gate. Gollum then accidentally sends the ring into the volcano by biting off Frodo's finger.

In Back to the Future, there isn't even a main antagonist. In the first film, Marty accidentally travels back in time, and has the goals of getting back to the future, saving Doc Brown's life and making sure his parents get together. He achieves the first because he's friends with someone who can get a time machine working, and because of the pure random chance of having the leaflet telling him when the lightning struck the clock tower. He achieves the second by the pure random chance of the wire on the clock tower breaking, distracting Doc from throwing away the torn up note. He ultimately achieves the third one by giving his dad enough confidence to stand up to Biff, so he can have that one.

I've never seen the Matrix.

My point is that in all the stories you named as examples of the protagonist pulling himself together and defeating the villain, the hero only manages because of his friends. I can understand being unsatisfied that Harry won his final duel with Voldemort because of an obscure piece of wandlore that had never appeared in the series before the second half of the last book, but I don't get why people don't like Harry winning victories because of his friends. Actually, let's look at how he won his victories in the books.

In Philosopher's Stone, Harry, Ron and Hermione make the conscious choice to go to defend the stone. Whether or not that was all set up by Dumbledore is, I think irrelevant, because they would have gone whether it was or wasn't.

- They get past Fluffy because Hagrid let slip that music calms him down. Team effort.

- They get past the Devil's Snare because Hermione recognises what it is and knows its weaknesses, and because Ron uses a bit of common sense. Ron and Hermione's victory.

- They get past the room with the keys due to Harry's Quidditch prowess. Harry's victory.

- They get past the chessboard because of Ron's chess acumen and willingness to sacrifice himself for the others. Ron's victory.

- They get past the potions room because of Hermione's logical ability. Hermione's victory.

- Harry defeats Quirrel because of his mother's sacrifice. Harry's victory, albeit one handed to him.

In the second book, Harry and Ron make the decision to go down to the Chamber of Secrets themselves when they find out that Lockhart is cowardly and incompetent. Something a lot of people forget is that up until the point that they find him packing to leave, Harry and Ron thought Lockhart would be able and willing to combat Slytherin's Monster. They avoid Obliviation the first time due to Harry's speed at disarming Lockhart. (Another victory Harry wins due to his own skill). They then find the Chamber of Secrets due to deduction made based on Hermione's findings. They avoid being Obliviated a second time due to Ron's defective wand. This also forces Harry to go on alone. He then defeats the Basilisk and rescues Ginny because of the loyalty he shows Dumbledore when facing Tom Riddle.

"...I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!"

"You're not," [Harry] said, "... the greatest wizard in the world is Albus Dumbledore."

This prompts the arrival of Fawkes with the Sorting Hat. Harry then draws the Sword of Gryffindor, something he was only able to do because he was a true Gryffindor, and slays the Basilisk. As he lies dying, Fawkes heals him, then gives him the diary and Harry destroys it. Later, in Dumbledore's office, Dumbledore explains why Fawkes showed up

"You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you."

It is Harry's own courage, determination and, yes, his faith in Dumbledore that allow him to win the fight. If that doesn't fit the model provided by the examples you gave then I don't know what does.

Let's skip ahead, because I'm not going to do this for every single book. In Deathly Hallows, Harry defeats Voldemort. Initially, he sacrifices his title of Master of Death, by abandoning the Resurrection Stone in the forest. He then willingly walks to his death because he wants to save his friends from Voldemort. Voldemort fails to kill him, because of the Horcrux in Harry's scar, a result of Voldemort's own folly. He is then saved by Narcissa Malfoy's love for her son, something Voldemort completely fails to comprehend. He takes her word for it that he is dead, because he is literally incapable of understanding why she would lie. It is then revealed that Harry's sacrifice worked; Voldemort is unable to harm his friends, and spells he places on them stop working. Harry then dramatically reveals himself, confronts Voldemort in an extended dialogue, and then defeats him in a duel. He defeats him, not because of any protection from his parents, not because of any manipulation on the part of Dumbledore, but as a direct consequence of Harry's actions. He defeats Draco Malfoy, he realises that that means he has ownership of the Elder Wand and he uses Voldemort's own hubris against him, and defeats him with the simplest spell he knows: expelliarmus. All the while he was fighting for a relatable, down-to-earth goal. Not power, not riches, not fame. All Harry wanted was to protect his friends and defeat the man who killed his parents and caused so much suffering elsewhere, and he was willing to give his life for it. That is why he defeated Voldemort, far more than the manipulations of anyone else.

**** I completely agree. The examples I chose were very detrimental for illustrating my point; I obviously inadvertently chose ones that followed the same 'reluctant hero' stereotype. And I agree with your point regarding Harry's final confrontation of Voldemort being something completely attributable to Harry's own ability- or, rather, Harry's own nobility and selflessness. I would, however, question the series of events that led him to that point; but that is an argument for another time. The same goes for the battle in the Chamber of Secrets, although I fear that the Fawkes' /Deus Ex Machina/ was a little bit on-the-nose (/Deus Fawkes Machina/, if you will).

However, I am not so certain that he is at his best in the other books. Take, for example, the Goblet of Fire Tasks. It is revealed to us that Moody has helped Harry pass each of the tasks (provided him with the idea of the Firebolt and given him Gillyweed respectively) meaning that he did not pass the challenge entirely on his own. Now, this is a careful distinction; we can see that Harry has performed impressively- it is not everyone can outfly a dragon, after all, and I will admit that seeing his ability to navigate the traps in the Third Task provided some of that cathartic release that I mentioned earlier. However, that knowledge is tempered by the fact that the competition was essentially rigged by Moody. That is why we think that Harry has no backbone; because there have often been extenuating circumstances in each situation he has been in.

I will say, after hearing some of the arguments to the contrary, that this appears to be common to the fantasy genre. This is by no means limited to HP. But it does make us wish for more.

And another thing; I would agree that Frodo was basically carried to Mount Doom by Sam, and the Ring was essentially bitten off his finger by Gollum, so that rather dilutes my point. However, in /Fellowship/, Frodo decides to leave the group completely, something which dramatically changes the course of the war, and was his decision to make. This makes Frodo less of an underdog figure, and conveys his strength of will. I would argue that- and feel free to contradict me, here, as I know there must be some example that I missed- that there is no equivalent moment in the HP books. Admittedly, Harry does decide to go on the extended camping trip, but I would argue that that was something completely planned by Dumbledore. I would be find the break in the fellowship less significant if Gandalf had given them a map to Mordor and a whistle to call the Eagles in his will.

I'm probably being overly cynical. I realise that Harry does show a lot of thought in his actions; I'm just explaining why, in my eyes, the trend of Harry-has-no-backbone is so prevalent.

Let us briefly compare a similar scene from two books; /Deathly Hallows/ and /The Hobbit/. I realise, of course, that these books have widely different tones, and completely different stakes involved, but I believe it (somewhat) illustrates my point. Bilbo has to free the rest of the Dwarves and defeat the spiders who are holding them captive. Likewise, Harry (and Ron) have to rescue Hermione from the hands of Lucius Malfoy and his fellow Death Eaters. Again, the stakes are different, but I think how the characters go about their actions helps prove what I'm trying to say.

Bilbo, using the One Ring, turns himself invisible, and confuses the spiders by singing a certain song. This form of psychological warfare (and yes, I realise I'm reading too much into a children's book) scares the spiders, and causes them to separate, distracting them from the Dwarves. Bilbo proceeds to kill the Spiders using Sting. He then frees the Dwarves, who assist him in polishing off the rest. Mission accomplished. Bilbo has not had any assistance, and has used his ingenuity and quick-thinking to help frighten the Spiders. This also serves a narrative purpose, as it shows that Bilbo has grown in confidence and ability, and can now hold his own as an important member of the group.

Meanwhile, Harry is locked in a dungeon at Malfoy Manor. He uses the mirror to summon Dobby, who helps free him. He uses a Life Debt (and I thought that was just a fanon term) to stop Wormtail from attacking them. He is captured, but is freed when Dobby drops the chandelier. He apparates out with Hermione and Ron; Dobby is tragically lost.

I realise, of course, that Harry Potter is a more realistic book, but it is still notable that it is Dobby, and not Harry, who is the motive force in that scene. Strictly speaking, First Year!Harry could do what Harry does here. The Patronus aside, Harry has not developed in terms of magical strength and ability since the first book. Actually, that is a lie, and a huge over-generalization. But I hope, somewhere in this mass of contradictions and pre-emptive apologies, you understand the point I am trying to make.

***** I completely see your point. It's not really until I see it laid out like that that I see how ineffectual Harry was in some of the situations in the book. I think at this point we're agreeing on how effective Harry was by himself, but just disagreeing on whether or not that makes him less of a hero or not. I think I understand why Harry is viewed the way he is by a lot of the fandom now. Thank you.

*** Well, yes, Harry does get an immense amount of help, and that was JKR's intention form the start. The whole point of the series is that love and friendship is above all else.

I do agree with you that I'm quite disappointed that Harry isn't more of a hero. I wish he would have had more magical prowess or inventiveness that he uses to win fights or outsmart his enemies.

But I don't think that's exactly why many people think Harry has no backbone. True, a very part of it is, but another part is the subtlety (or greyishy?) of canon. Let's start with the quote:

"You are Dumbledore's man through and through, aren't you, Potter?"

"Yes, I am." (note: not really accurate, but you get the point)

This is really important, but I thought it was a bit disappointing. Harry grew up neglected and possibly abused (Dudley did use him as a punching bag until Harry got too quick and nimble for him), then he gets thrown into a world where he is vilified and praised to no end, and in the end he has utter and blind faith in a man who kept many, many secrets from him. Plus, this quote kind of squashes a bit of premise for the last part of the series. When Dumbledore died, Harry broke up with Ginny and decided not to come back to Hogwarts, he stands on his own two legs completely, right?

No, he doesn't, because Dumbledore is pulling all the strings, even from beyond the grave. So is he a hero or is he a neutral character the reader can identify with, who is used as a sacrifice? Is he both? It's unclear, and some fanfic writers waltz over that and thus deem him a meek, spineless boy because he isn't the hero they expected him to be. Other fanfics go completely overboard the other way and make him some super magic god who is the descendant of half the big magical names.

So in the end, canon offers the best answer to this, because most fanfic writers, including me, can't do subtlety (is subtlety even the right word for this?) quite like JKR did in canon (though to be honest, she was /very/ subtle most of the time).

In a perfect fanfic, I would have Harry be slightly above average but below Hermione level, have him improve gradually over the series as his self-esteem grows (and he starts realising that you won't beat Voldemort unless you work in school!!!!!), have him be a sassy mofo to anyone who stands in his way and yet have him be completely loyal to his close friends.

EDIT: an afterthought: I think the fact that Harry is very relatable and people immerse themselves in his personality while reading is also important. Because of this, you get a lot of thoughts like "If /I/ were Harry, I would have done it better!" So people get frustrated by his mistakes, remember these moments a lot more than the moments where he is smart and solves things well and in the end are left with a rather negative opinion of Harry.

** While I understand JKR was writing a series for her audience to grow up with that got away from her in scope and breadth, the fact remains she wrote a damaged character but then made him passive.

And in that we, as a reader, begin to interpret and fantasize.

Harry has no idea how to re/act like a normal child would much less a magical child. And he's one but not the other.

His upbringing is abusive (even if it's never hinted at physical) and neglectful, yet is somewhat adjusted (even hopeful(as hopeful as he can be/was written)) when he boards the train.

And once he's in the school there's a sense of wonder but then it's business as usual until the plot kicks in.

Then that plot kicks in each book. It's true that Dumbledore didn't specifically know how to train Harry for his 'destiny' but Dumbledore could have done more. Tom was a voracious student and terrifying terrorist.

But instead Harry stumbles through school, kinda like most of us would, except he's the hero.

And several have said, the hero /is/ special. The hero /is/ different. Yes there should be a learning period for the hero in series like this. But then the hero comes into their own, with power near or exceeding their destiny.

That really never happens with Harry. And while its cool that he's sorta just like 'Hey. I just want to be.' He's not allowed (simply by virtue of being the hero).

Sure we all get our 'happy ever after' but Harry the Hero is lacking. Thus we get certain authors that might call him spineless.

** There's an impression of Harry being just... well, /no/.

I'll be honest; my interpretation of Canon!Harry's personality, skillset and achievements are probably on the generous side. But us Harry fans can be allowed that, I think, because of the sometimes massive swing in the other direction, whether it's Hermione, Draco, Snape, etc.

Yes, Harry is thrown into spectacular situations which he would certainly struggle with alone. That's the whole point of the story. I assure you, if the narrative focused on Hermione and gave her similar challenges with no help from outside characters save her own two mits, she'd be just as screwed.

Why, you ask? That's the story JKR wanted to tell.

The series is all about choices. When the chips are down, more often than not, we see Harry do the right thing. He's a good wizard - a great one, even. Hermione says it herself, and it's because - even at the tender age of twelve - she realised that there /is/ more to magic than knowing the right spells. His instincts about how magic works are odd and spontaneous, and yet they seem to get the job done often enough (see the Lake at the Forest of Dean as well as the oft-touted Hundred Dementor Patronus).

I talked about his (and Ron's) grades in another thread, and will paraphrase here: an /E/ is considerably more accomplished than many of us are taking for granted. By the way, to credit Hermione with their O.W.L scores is as strange as the decision to attribute several of their lines to her in the films.

Just why?

I think we were all disappointed by Harry's performance and demeanour in HBP, and that may have coloured our opinions of him in the final installment for the worse (because after multiple readings, I think he did a pretty good job considering). But the bottom line is that he had to do just enough to get by: it was what the overall narrative required of him. Nothing more, nothing less.

To see what Canon!Harry is capable of when thrown into dire situations with little outside help, the fic linkffn(Ectomancer) is probably the closest we'll get so far. He deals pretty well.

It's a wizarding school, and a British boarding one at that. The closest equivalent we can hope for are O-Levels (would have said GCSEs, but O-Levels would be most familiar for Rowling).

To get a C at O-Level was often considered an achievement. Hence "Acceptable" being a perfectly respectable grade (as evidenced by McGonagall when she congratulates Neville for his performance in Transfiguration despite not being able to admit him onto the N.E.W.T course). If you ask a few Oxbridge graduates from the 80s and earlier what their exam results were, you might just hear the same.

So the grading system you're used to just doesn't correlate with the one at Hogwarts. The US system doesn't either - nor does the current UK one. It's completely independent of them.
