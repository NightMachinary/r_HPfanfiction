** That is a tall order. Though it's not all about inheritance, it is one of the subplots : Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin is a good one. This one doesn't really over do it in the inheritance department as many others do.

** Given what JK Rowling recently wrote about the Potter family, the speculation about family vault and Potter manor may actually be right.

** /Out of The Night/, by Raining Ink, is easily my favorite inheritance-focused story.

He only has one inheritance (the Peverell one), and taking it doesn't make him absurdly powerful-- just introduces him to a side of wizarding culture he otherwise would not have been able to see. Indy!Harry without bashing, pairings, or most of the other tropes associated with Indy!Harry.

Abandoned and deleted, for reasons listed on the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1944343/Raining-Ink][author's profile]] (essentially they were afraid that working on fic was impeding their ability to otherwise launch a writing career). However, you can get it on dropbox either [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/s4ww9xm0o9zsllu/Out%20of%20the%20Night.html][here]] (unchanged) or [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/27qcq652zq2o8xf/Out%20of%20The%20Night.zip][here]] (no author's notes, pretty css veneer).

** I'm only three chapters in so far, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4578658/3/No-More-Strings][linkffn(No More Strings By: Ginnyfan99)]] reads well so far. It's not marked 'Complete', so it might have been abandoned at some point, but as of chapter two, I think I'll enjoy it anyway.
