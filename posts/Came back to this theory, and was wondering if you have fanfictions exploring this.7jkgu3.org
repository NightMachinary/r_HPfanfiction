** Eh. I'm so sick of "theories" like that. I think this is like the third or fourth "Harry is insane and Hogwarts is his delusional fantasy" theory I've come across on the net.

Every time a work of fiction is the least bit supernatural, magical or fantastic, then come the "clever" theories that it's a sign that the main character has gone insane and all of canon is just delusional fantasies.

Or alternately, that the main character is in a coma and everything that happens is just a dream, and when the story ends it means the main character finally died.

I'm not against stories where fantastical dreams are metaphors for a grim reality, but not every single fantasy story has to "really" be a horror story about how the main character is dying or being abused or stuck in a mental ward or whatever.

*** Well, I read a huge part of the french fanfiction worth reading (according to my criteria) in the 10+ years I've been reading fanfiction. Then began reading english fanfiction 2 years ago. So i guess I've seen a LOT of fanfiction types/trends. But this is a "theory"/idea I haven't had the chance to read, so I'm a bit curious about how it would work out.

** That's...hardly a theory. That seems like a fanfiction only loosely connected to the canon plot of Harry Potter.

Still, I did see a one-shot where everything was portrayed as a fantasy, and Harry's killing Voldemort at the very end was revealed to his actually having stabbed Dudley in front of everyone in school. That fic was solely twist-without-plot, though.

--------------

Still, a fanfiction can be made out of this; a less depressing one, too.

Like, let's say, what if the author of the Harry Potter books...is Harry Potter? After being rescued from the Dursleys, he struggles with basic life skills and living normally, so the psychiatrist he regularly works with encourages him to practice writing stories (something he is good at), to look at his problems from an outside perspective.

Thus, the events of the books are a combination of his desires and what he wants to be (confront and destroy his parents killer, become good at sports, make proper friends), and also express stuff he struggles to face directly as fictional things (the Dursleys neglect, unfair punishments, being singled out, et-cetera).

The house-elves are an anthropomorphisation of the 'safety net' that Harry feels, grown adults who do all the little things and housekeeping responsibilities that he's not up to yet; dementors are similarly an anthropomorphisation of Harry's worst bouts of depression and how they threaten to turn him into a vegetable. Et-cetera et-cetera, all of the more fantastical elements are metaphors for various ideas that Harry is exploring as a writer.

**** Afraid not. It's fairly short, the scene with Harry killing Voldemort fades into Harry stabbing Dudley with a stick or knife (I forgot which), before he whispers "I'm a wizard" to himself. Or something like that.

** That theory is aiming too much about JKR's intentions.

As simplistic and childish as Harry Potter series is, with all the simplistic morality, I don't think she bothered to weave such complicated metaphors in her work.

** there are some fics which play with the idea that hogwarts and magic are just Harrys delusions

** The thing about this theory is that it is too realistic and depressing. No matter how good a writer is I try to completely avoid fanfics that even faintly hint about this premise.

*** The best story I ever read was a super-depressing/dark one. 450k words, I even printed it so I could reread it years later. Plot twist --> it's french ><
