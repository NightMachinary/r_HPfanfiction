I'm currently writing a relativley serious take on professional Quidditch. I aim to expand the current lore in HP books whilst also providing an original story, with basically lots of Quidditch action and matches! Think the movie Goal! but with the HP touch and written in that style. If this interests you please check it out! 11 Chapters out so far.

I'm a reddit noob so no idea if the links worked.

Ive seen so many sports movies as I grew up, and telling a story about Quidditch just felt like it could really work. I'm also from the UK and follow British football very closely. I understand the passion fans can have and the team dynamics, importance of a good manager etc. I'm attempting to convert this all into the Quidditch scene.

Edit: Fanfiction.net link In the comments lol


** I had the idea for a Miracle/Remember the Titans/Generic Feel Good Sports Movie style fic with Ron and/or Harry trying to lead the Chudley Cannons to victory. Never been enough of a sports person to pull off the writing though.

*** I find it crazy no one has attempted it before (to my knowledge.) I found a few based around Quidditch but the plot always focuses around some sort a romance between Oliver wood loll and someone else. Do you know of any that focus on the team and the journey of a player from academy to stardom? I would be interested to read it.

**** Sport does not lend itsself well to plot.

Frankly, there isn't a lot interesting about sport itself for anyone who isn't a fan of the teams playing. You either win, or you lose and the emotions in that are pretty paltry and fleeting compared to a lot of the actual facts of life.

There's a reason a lot of the great Sports films aren't really about the sport but the human element involved in it. And the ones that are about the sport often end in Failure, rather than Success (IE, Sugar).

I've said before, Rush doesn't exist because the 1976 F1 season was any more fascinating than ones before or after it. It exists because of the incredibly human nature of the Rivalry between Hunt and Lauda and how Ecclestone's acquiring of the rights made F1 Must Watch from there on out. That season effectively changed how people view and consume Formula 1. There's a reason there's very little on track action in Rush.

Good sports stories often have sports as a backdrop rather than the focus because, frankly, the 'Job' aspect of sports are boring.

Very few people will want to read about the charcter getting up at six in the morning, eating a healthy breakfast of fruit and egg whites mixed with a protein shake. Going through morning calisthenics and yoga before going for a run. Only to return home to shower and go to the pitch for the morning team meeting to discuss strategy and review video. Followed by a couple of hours in the gym at the pitch to go through daily workouts. Then a few hours of running the same plays over and over and over again. Followed by more review. At it's core, for it to have any credibility, it becomes incredibly boring and monotonous.

Sport becomes much better as a backdrop to the plot than the plot itself. That's why there's so many more pieces that use something else as the main plot.

Even the movies cited in this thread are more about the community around the sport with the sport being secondary.

***** Oh yeah I totally agree. Sports at it's very core is not good for story telling. But it's the friendships made, rivalries that are birthed and the emotions that are seen in tight games that I think the Sports/Drama genre can shine.

On top of the fact that Quidditch is a magical sport, I feel there is immense potential for a good story. In my fanfiction, I start by introducing the family of the protagonist. With the 4 brothers introduced, 2 of them are already Quidditch prodigies. The protagonist is a squib and obtains his abilities later. There is already an intense rivalry there, with the brothers going onto play for different teams. I also focus on the aspect of a squib trying to survive in the magical world, because although he has a niche in that world, he is still stigmatised by his own family, peers and even his own team.

I don't want to ruin anything else, but I really like your well formulated argument and would appreciate your take on my story, if you have the time:)

****** Normally I make [[/u/rpeh]] do this for me. I mean it's what I pay him for and all. But I think he's either dead or still drinking after whatever the hell that extra time was earlier tonight. I should send him a nice birthday gift. Someone get me his shirt size....

I feel like I should preface this by explaining a bit of who I am....but that seems exceedingly arrogant. But meh. Who cares?

There are a lot of inconsistencies in your story. I have a hard time, for example, believing a squib could fly a broom. I would suspend my disbelief on that point, but it rings false for me.

I also have a hard time believing a family that can't afford a quaffle and is struggling financially has enough throwaway money for the kid to buy a brand new broom oh and for his brother to have a Firebolt. The Firebolt strikes me as more of a Ferrari than, say a Honda Civic. Even if it's six or seven years after Canon as the 'Numbus 2007' implies. I doubt the Firebolt has depreciated as much. There's ways around that, sure. Maybe the Broom was a gift from a pro team as part of the academy...but that's not said in the text and if so, the kid is pretty blase about handing it off to his brother. Even professional sports teams keep track of things they give away to students. Seeing how people take care of their possessions reflects on them.

His 'natural talent' awakening is...unrealistic. You seem to have a sense that talent is just there to be drawn on and not something to be worked at. Nothing about his betterment of his ability feels earned. It all feels given.

There's very little interesting about the MC. There's not enough text there to make it so each chapter is barely a complete scene. And he comes off as insufferable and entitled to an adult.

My experience with highly competitive youth sports, which is granted limited to Hockey, also makes the time skip seem unbelievable. They would know if he quit. Those communities are often far more insular. You know a guy who knows a guy. A lot of times the youth leagues are playing against the same people their entire young adult lives. Someone would have mentioned something to them long before.

And then it rings false anyway. It doesn't matter how much 'natural talent' he has. Four years of 'training by himself' going against kids who have four years of highly specialized professional training....he's going to get his ass kicked. Which, maybe that's the plot. But it certainly doesn't seem like it. Again, this goes back to it feeling like everything is given and not earned.

Very little of it feels true to the situation you're attempting to write a story about. But you don't really focus on anything. It flashes around and it's like 700 words here 700 words there move on repeat.

There is probably something there but it needs to be flushed out a lot more than it is.

What you say doesn't come through in the text. There's not enough there to make it seem like 'an intense rivalry'. So his one brother is a dick, lots of older brothers are. That doesn't make them rivals. So he's a squib...that plot is resolved in about five hundred words of text and then dropped.

It goes back to what I said above. You're trying too hard to make the sport the main plot point when other things are far more interesting than it. You should spend far more time building up the relationship between the brothers. And you should spend far more time on what it means to be a squib. You drop both plot points almost immediately just to throw him in a youth camp. It never feels like he earns it.

Early on you have a lot of oddly formatted dialogue. Lots of mid paragraph random dialogue. You seem to drop that later, which is good. But it's jarring in the first couple of chapters.

The immense potential for a good quidditch story isn't....about quidditch. I mean shit I've arguably written four. Sport is boring to read about. It's dry. It's dull. Most readers will just skip to the end to see who wins. There needs to be compelling relationships built up to keep things interesting.

You have an interesting premise. There is a story to be written about brothers bonding over quidditch. But I would suggest you shift your focus from 'brothers' to 'quiddithc'. After reading it, I'm honestly not sure I could name all four of them. Hell, I know more about the toddler sister who feels more like a throw in character than I do the Brothers.

I don't want to sound too harsh. Your text here shows more ideas than what appear in the story. I'm more than willing to let you bounce ideas around. But really my opinion is that you really need to flesh out the relationship between the brothers. For the story to work you need the reader to care for the family. And at the end of eleven chapters I don't. I'd personally probably cull one of them too, but that's just my opinion. You introduce a lot of characters in not a lot of text and for the most part it feels like name vomit. As a reader it makes me wonder if any of them will be important to the plot.

The same is true for the squib plot. It's referenced plenty but the payoff boils down to.....nothing. You don't show what it means past an offhanded comment. There's more thought on it in your post here than there is in the text of the story.

I think that's about all I'm going to say for now. Please no one tell my beta that I spent four hour on this rather than writing Ithaca...

******* Thanks for reading and I very much appreciate the criticism. I think it's essential to become a better writer

I was watching the match yesterday as well, although I was rooting for liverpool lol

First of all, I need to save some face, by saying this Airborne is the first creative piece, I have ever written. I also write it in secret, because if any of my mates found out I'm writing fanfiction...Joke. But yeah there will be some errors in writing and formatting here and there.

On top of the fact I don't really have a beta reader and feedback is sparse, I just trudge on in my style. I mean I'm willing to pay good money for a beta reader, so if you know any send them my way please.

Although I appreciate many of your points, I think some can be explained by the fact that the story is not finished. Whilst some are down to interpretation and are meant to be thought provoking

1. In terms of a squib having Quidditch abilities. Squib in my opinion is just a label. Hogwarts labelled the MC a squib as they did not believe he had any magical abilities. The thing is, he has to deal with that labelling. His brother, some of his team members , his manager, they all thrive of that squib status, as they obtain feelings of superiority. But end of the day it is just a label. I don't think you will read my story further, so I'll just explain what is coming up. MC is not a squib. He has immense magical abilities, but it is all manifested in terms of finesse and flair with a broom. There is a scene I plan to write, where he enters Olivandders with his friend and trys to get a wand but it fails horribly.

2. With regards to the expensive broomsticks. The family are not poor per say. They can afford Quaffles and have done before. They just don't like to waste them and save them for special occasions. I mention they do own a family business in Diagon Alley. This has only come under financial strife very recently. Which I mention. I feel that if the main hobby for most of the brothers is Quidditch, and the parents have professionally installed 2 sets of metal Quidditch hoops in their backyard, they can probably afford relatively old brooms.

3. I can see how the awakening can come across as given. I feel that is up to interpretation again. As I mentioned I will explain later, how MC is a very good Quidditch player. All his magical abilities went towards flying. In the 'awakening scene' he reached a point of depression, he was basically carrying out a suicidal move by flying off the cliff, but the his latent abilities with flying saved him. I definitely see your point, and I should probably spend a bit more time fleshing some scenes out. Which I definitely will from now.

4. The 4 years solo training lol. Again it's a matter of opinion I guess. In this case, MC has a magically binding contract until he is 16 to train at the Chudley Cannons Academy and no where else. The new manager and board members certainly don't want a 'squib'. But they cannot offload him as he signed the contract with the previous manager. MC also doesn't want to be there. so I feel like both parties agree it's better for him to stay away. Hence why nothing is mentioned for so long.

In conclusion (I feel like I'm writing an essay lmao) I appreciate your points, But I would not be a man if I did not defend a few of them loll. But yh I deffo need to improve some of my chapters and include more text. Naturally that will allow me to expand on some relationships, which will allow readers to engage with my characters more. I can also see how I could do a better job explaining some plot points. Once again thanks for reading! This was quite insightful.

  A young squib is rejected from Hogwarts, but drafted by one of Britain's long-standing Quidditch teams. The Chudley Cannons! A questionable decision by its manager. Are the fans in for another season of disappointment? (An original take on the fantasy/sports genre.) *Cover art adapted from Etsy and depicts Sora from the story.
