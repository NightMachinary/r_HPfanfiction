I read this Mauraders-era fic years ago and only remember that it portrayed Hogwarts students as being a lot more like, well, regular high school students, only these teenagers are now free from parental control (teenagers aren't known for their best decision-making, so there were parties, underage drinking, sexual encounters and the like). Weird request, I know, but I found the perspective of Hogwarts being more like a "typical" high school or college campus than the rather conservative manner it's portrayed in the books fascinating.


** Here's one called The Life and Times by Jewels5. It focuses on Lily and James, but this is plenty plot and development for characters.

*** Is it true that the author herself has said that she's abandoned it?

I've waited years for her to update and need closure.
