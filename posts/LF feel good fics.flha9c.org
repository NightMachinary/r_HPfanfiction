Everyone knows many of us are stuck at home. I'm looking for some just happy endings or all around happy Harry Potter fics. No preference on anything, the longer the better :)


** Two stories, both of them next-generation, just because I feel so:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][Holly at Hogwarts by Forest_of_Holly]]

- linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox)

OK, one more, most of them post Battle of Hogwarts, but not all of them focused on the next generation:

- Most [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][stories by Northumbrian]]

I think it could take you through even rather long quarantine.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
