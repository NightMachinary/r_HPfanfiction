I know the idea itself isn't believable, but any aspect to it that might be more believable?

-Cornelius sends Harry to Azkaban because the Malfoys told him too.

-Harry was put under a curse and he was sent to Azkaban

-His friends try to get him out/believe he's innocent

-No super powerful Harry.

-Either Harry as insane, doesn't forgive easily, or so on.

-Would rather have no focus on Harry/anyone for a pairing. But definitely not Harry/Hermione, please. I don't really like that pairing

Doesn't have to have all these aspects, but just to give you an idea.


** linkao3(15068012) Lily puts a spell on Harry to automatically transport Harry to Sirius if they send him to the Dursleys, no one notices he's in Azkaban because there's no human guards, only Dementors. The premise isn't completely believable, but it is a well-written fic.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

** You probably were inspired by this but :

The Nightmare Man by Tiro

To be honest, I liked Birth of A Nightmare Man by Tiro better because we can see his journey and how exactly he became insane like in The Nightmare Man, but they are all good and The Nightmare Man is supposed to be read first.

***** Totally agree, it was really weird. I cant put a dtory down if i've invested a lot of time into it, so i read the rest, and it wasnt interesting at all, a sort of unnatural progression in terms of character interactions.

** This is the only one I've enjoyed. Admittedly, I've not read all of the "Harry in Azkaban" stories, but what few I tried to read were very angsty and edgy. In this one, Harry is in and out by chapter 2 so we can get on with the story without delay.

*** Honestly, this story broke my suspension of belief by chapter 3. No healthy relationship should be built upon a lie. Harry here has been hiding his past and his real face from his family and that's pretty despicable.

Edit: I read till chapter 7 and the suspension of belief is still broken. The story is deliberately trying to put angst where unnecessary. Also characterization of Harry is just too out of the realm of reality.

***** On the contrary, detailed criticisms of a fic are useful because they provide alternate points of view. This is helpful to those who haven't read the fic and would like more information to determine whether it might appeal to them.

If you /actually/ believe that the criticism is invalid, then you can contribute to a constructive discussion on the topic by explaining /why/ you believe that specific points the other redditor made are incorrect. This would be more helpful to potential new readers of the fic.
