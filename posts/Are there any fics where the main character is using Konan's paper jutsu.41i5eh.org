** I have not found a complete fic for Naruto in which the protagonist uses Konan's Paper Jutsu. There are a couple of incomplete ones that you can google for that are shit.

Also Konan's paper Jutsu is perfect for Harry Potter, its easily explained as magic if one tried, and i can just how... versatile it would be, much like Harry's butterfly spell in A Cadmean Victory, except with paper that could be sharpened, and used as a weapon easily.

I dont think anyone really writes about Konan's Paper Jutsu; it doesnt really have much in the Naruto wikia either, and in reality, its probably one of the most dangerous techniques, especially if the user specializes in Fuinjutsu. I can already think of a shinobi who with a flick of their wrist, sends out thousands of seals to paralyze, or incapitate, or form barriers around... In the midst of a war scene, that ability would be insane. Have a seal that absorbs a technique while simultaneously attacking with a modified storage seal, and shooting thousands of paper shurikun, that unfolded formed explosive tags...

  Draco Malfoy was a strange child, even by wizard standards. Actually, no, scratch that, to say he was strange would be putting it lightly, to be frank, Draco Lucius Malfoy was a insane pyromaniac who had already committed multiple acts of arson by the time he was five. Not that anyone would ever say anything about it of course. And knowing Deidara, for him this was downright tame.

** ...how are we all supposed to know wtf you're talking about? Like, this would make a smidgen more sense if Harry Potter was also an anime. As it is I don't even know what you're looking for - a crossover? An HP fic where people use jutsu because reasons? A Naruto fic? A random fandom fic? What?

** You could try asking in [[/r/FanFiction]], too, if you haven't already. There are lots of Naruto fans there, as far as I can tell. Unfortunately, I'm not one of them, so I'm afraid I can't help you. :/
