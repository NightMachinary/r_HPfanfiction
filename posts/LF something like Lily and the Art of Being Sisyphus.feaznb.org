  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

**** Unfortunately I don't know of any other lighthearted absurdist fics besides The Carnivorous Muffin's other stories - which are all excellent. I also don't know of any other fics in which Harry repeatedly 'visits' death.

However, I have read quite a few fics in which Harry befriends a horcrux. Since "Accidental Horcrux" and "The Devil You Know" were already mentioned, here are a few others that revolve around Harry talking to a horcrux (or Voldemort himself) in his mind:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675297/][Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]] - (also by The Carnivorous Muffin) Harry talks to the Diary while growing up. linkao3(15675297)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13212984/][A Memory of Shadow]] - Harry befriends the Scarcrux after his first year at Hogwarts. linkao3(13212984)

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14190288/][The Voldemort Connection]] - Harry has a mental link with Voldemort's disembodied spirit throughout his childhood, which leads to them becoming allies. linkao3(14190288)

And here's a crossover fic in which Harry's childhood friendship with the scarcrux takes a somewhat different form:

  Ever since Harry was little, he's had recurring dreams of being with someone else, someone who's little more than a ghost. After doing some reading on it in the school library, he'd decided it was his version of having an invisible friend. Except as he turns eleven, it turns out his dreams are closer to reality than he'd ever thought. What happens when he meets his dream companion, for so many years his only friend, for the first time in the waking world?

** It sorta depends on what elements you like?

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13719279][Still Life with Skull]] by TheDivineComedian) has a similar feeling of a darkish unreality.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162][The Devil You Know]] by SilchasRuin) has the more lighthearted aspects of a Harry talking to the Horcrux from a young age, trying to help it, but Harry making Riddle miserable with his tendency to want to do things his own way. Also includes a disturbing Quirrell incounter and friendship between Harry and the voice in his head.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675435][October]] by The_Carnivorous_Muffin) is by the same author and has a Harry who is Death.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6614155][Full circle]] by tetsurashian) is similar in that it takes absurd concepts and then writes it as a somewhat serious plot. Also includes a Tom and Harry stuck with each other for long periods of time.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6997183][the train station]] by dirgewithoutmusic) is a lot like some the more dream like bits, especially ones with Rabbit.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.
