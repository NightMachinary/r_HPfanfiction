**** I was interested up to the point where I read in the OP that Harry's parents and Dumbledore are manipulative.

Why is it that so many of those stories have the characters behave in such a cartoonish "evil" manner? It is so over the top most of the time.

I can't say that this story is like that, but I'll give it a shot. It is just curious how common it is for the so called "bad guys" in these fics to be so over the top.

**** Read the first little bit... did someone drop a thesaurus on their head as a kid?

Sure, you want to avoid being monotonous in descriptions, but come on!

***** Speaking as someone who has to consciously tone down my writing for precisely this reason, it wasn't a thesaurus dropped on my head as a kid.

...it was the Lord of the Rings books in grade 2.

****** Yeah, I can see that. I never actually did finish reading those books for just that reason. I don't need 30 pages to know what a mote of dust in a shaft of light looks like.

******* I read everything I could get my hands on as a kid - honestly, I inhaled books for lack of a better way to put it. Lord of the Rings fit right into that. Thankfully, because it happened so early, I got lots of practice at /not/ sounding like Tolkien all the time :P
