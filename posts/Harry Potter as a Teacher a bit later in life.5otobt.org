I am curious if anyone has come across any Harry Potter as a teacher stories. I mention "a bit later in life" in the title because I have come across a few ones where he acts "like" a teacher when younger such as with the DA but is not really a true teacher, or stories where he is "hired" by Dumbledore as soon as he graduates and it always seems kinda silly how quick it happens. Think... mid 20's or a bit older in years Harry, not an 18-19 year old teacher or similar.

--------------

--The entire story does not need to be oriented around him teaching but hopefully it should play a significant role.

--Action of some sort would be preferred whether its a nemesis or "new Voldemort", or simply something as fun as a dueling tourney or something.

--Romance is also preferred. To be honest I would rather have him not with Ginny but a situation where a new romance develops, either with another character, teacher, or OC, or even an "old enough" student.

--No slash (M/M) please. Mature+ rated stories usually preferred. Smut is fine if it also has decent plot.

--------------

Feel free to recommend anything and why you recommend it but I figured I would list above mainly what I was looking for.

Thanks all!

  COMPLETE. The other children in class stared at the teacher. Then they stared at Harry, then back to the teacher, then at Harry, in a never-ending loop. Harry found he couldn't blame them. Everything from the bespectacled emerald eyes to the messy black hair---the resemblance between them was uncanny!

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

***** eh, I think hope is lost. They've been funded on Patreon for a year now, which promised "A new chapter every two weeks. Guaranteed; no exceptions."

Since this has been the case for over one full calendar year, I've pretty much accepted that it's abandoned.

  DONE! Harry has defeated Voldemort, but it was a costly victory. Aberforth Dumbledore presents a plan to go back and kill the infant Riddle, but Harry will have to stay there 10 years. Can Harry alter the wizarding world's destiny? WWII and Grindelwald

** hits all your points even kinda has a darklord subplot; is mature+; is kinda an absurdist fic in that reasonableness has no effect on the plot at all. Is an singularly unique fic (wouldnt call it good but is "intresting") [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/neil/HE01.html]]
