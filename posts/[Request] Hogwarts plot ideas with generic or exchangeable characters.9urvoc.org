Hi guys!

I want to host a HP tabletop role playing game for my fiancée and wanted to look into fanfiction for plot ideas, as I can't for the life of me think of anything original. An idea I'm toying with for a later year is for a/the rival to become an animagus, I hope one of the players will want to compete with that. I'm setting the game in Hogwarts in 2001, so I'm planning to keep most of the teachers who are still alive. I've already generated and sorted into houses over a 100 student names :-D Expecting my fiancée to play a Ravenclaw, but as this is meant to be a surprise I don't know who she's going to pick as the other players - cross-house friends could be an adventure of its own.

The problem I'm facing is that most of the fanfic I can find are alternative plotlines concerning the personal stories of canon characters, which would be too old to appear as students and too young to appear as settled-down adults in one form of another. I don't want to contradict canon (too obviously), so I basically am looking for something to expand on the world but not replace anything. Stories where the plot doesn't rely on the protagonist being one of the original characters but will work without their specific back stories will work as well.

So what I'm asking is this: Do any of you know any fics that could be expanded into school-year-spanning plots or could be cool little flair newspaper articles or tidbits happening in the wizarding world? Do you have ideas yourselves about what could make an interesting plot for prospective first-years (or, if it goes well, of course, older students after that)? Maybe several smaller story ideas?

I'm looking forward to your input! I hope this is not too far off-topic, but I figured you guys know the world far better than many of the muggles over at RPG subs ;-)

Thanks in advance!


** Sorry you haven't gotten any replies yet.

Okay, so a couple things to flesh out. The setting is in 2001, right? so post war, only a few years after the Battle of Hogwarts. One thing you might include is the division amongst the school houses. Now the younger students may be more cooperative, but there could be a lot of tension still among the older students, the ones who went through the dark year of Hogwarts, where students were torturing other students as classwork and punishment. There would be some students who would never be completely okay with people from other houses. On the other hand, there may be many students who learned to forgive and forget. It all depends on how you want to have it play out, but it might be easier if the younger students had begun steps for cooperative Houses.

Another thing is, at some point, Neville Longbottom became a teacher at Hogwarts, taking over for Professor Sprout in Herbology, so you could have him there as a teachers aid, or already taken over as the Professor. He's a war hero, so he would generate a lot of respect among the students.

The castle probably had extensive damage done from the Battle of Hogwarts, and repairs probably took awhile. What if, in the rebuilding process, ancient tunnels, and secret rooms, and priceless artifacts were constantly being rediscovered? In canon, one of the secret passages Fred and George used to use was caved in. Who's to say this was the first passage to be blocked off?

The castle of Hogwarts is 1000 years old. What kind of mysteries could be be uncovered?

If a band of first years got it into their heads that they could gain wealth and glory and prestige by finding a priceless relic lost to the ages, they might go exploring those tunnels in pursuit. Gryffindors, because its a fun adventure. Slytherins would go too if they felt adequately prepared because of the glory. Ravenclaws would go for the sake of curiousity and thirst for knowledge, and Hufflepuffs would go to look after their friends.

Now, all sorts of little creepy crawlies may have found their way into the tunnels, like acromantulas, doxies, and a number of other smaller creatures that like dark cramped spaces.

And who knows what might be hidden in the darkest depths of Hogwarts? From Pottermore, we know Merlin himself was a student there. Perhaps he left an artifact at school?

For tidbits and easter eggs outside of the School, it's a general consensus that Ginny Weasley goes on to become a star Chaser in the pro leagues, possibly for the all-female team the Holyhead Harpies.

Harry Potter would be a rookie Auror around this time, or just finishing up Auror training, and the wizarding community would have their eyes on him for more signs of greatness. The-Man-Who-Conquered would have a lot of press, if say, he got his first arrest as an Auror.

Ron is also usually depicted as becoming an Auror, and with his family connections and his own tactical mind, it's very possible he does well.

Hermione was always very vocal about fighting for rights of sentient magical beings. It would be right up her alley to be scene as a spokesperson for a group who pushed through motions to repeal anti-werewolf laws, or advocating for equal representation in Wizard Law for Centaurs, Goblins, and House-Elfs.

There could also still be Death Eaters on trial from the war. Like in the case of the Malfoys, who are extremely rich and very controversial with their decisions at the end of the war.

Also, keep in mind that the wizarding world might have a new prison system if they can't get a reign on the dementors. It might be that one of the Death Eaters escaped from prison, and maybe that Death Eater is the parent of one of the PCs, who hates his family and wants a fresh start a la Sirius going to Gryffindor even though he comes from a Dark family.

These are just a few ideas off the top of my head. Hopefully I got your head gears whirling.

Also, Critical Role did a Harry Potter/Breakfast Club one-shot recently using the DnD 5e system, so if you're looking for a few ideas, this might help too. [[https://youtu.be/2MKE78FweGA]]

*** This is awesome! Thanks! I was initially planning to replace Sprout around easter, but then changed my mind to do it a little later to allow Neville to do some research outside of school first. Having him pop up from time to time as an assistant or for some deliveries makes so much more sense. Right now I have the new DADA teacher set as head of house for Gryffindor and the new Muggle Studies one for Hufflepuff. Neville could take over once he's older and there's another staff change in the DADA post for some reason.

A friend of mine suggested some stray creatures who fought for the dark side still hiding out in the forest, this could tie in well with what Hermione is doing and score her a cameo, I think.

Will have to look up what creatures are already there that are fitting, maybe I won't even have to make up so many.

Will have a look at Critical Role!

I'm amazed at what's wafting around at the top of your head alone - thanks!
