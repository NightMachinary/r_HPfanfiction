So idk why but I enjoy reading stories where the main character is disowned and has to rise above the problems that might cause them. So i'm looking for stories where Harry, Hermione or Ginny are disowned by family as a main point or sub point of the story. No slash and no shipping with death eaters (including Snape) On a side note, There was a fic I read where Ginny was disowned by Molly during the Final Task of the Goblet of Fire and She was adopted by Sirius...I think she had been helping Harry throughout the tournement and was eventually Disowned for some reason or the other I don't remember but if anyone can find it i'd be grateful


** Here's what I have,

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10090975/1/][Marked]] Whump!Hermione fic, Hermione's abusive parents hate and fear her magic, so when McGonagall shows up they tell McGonagall to keep Hermione, They don't want to see her again.

There's one fic I don't remember the name of where Hermione's parents think Sirius is grooming Hermione (he wasn't) so they do the worst possible thing if it was actually a grooming situation and give her a "us or them" Ultimatum. She picks "them" and basically gets adopted by Remus.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/991572][Harry Potter and the Pet Fiancée]] Hermione's parents try to pull her out of the magical world, Us or Them, Yada yada, Harry's vow that he will take care of Hermione as if she were his own gets interpreted by magic to mean Harry wants to own Hermione. yada yada, Luna owns an elephant gun, yada yada, gun-toting Tudor-era brony yada yada.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11420434/1/][Moments in Love]] and its furry counterpart [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10619866/1/][Hermione's Furry Little Problem]] has Hermione's father fly off the rails because (Mr. Weasley's attempt to be disarming came off wrong/ his daughter is a cat now) so he tries to pull her out of hogwart (and have her fixed using surgery) but she refuses to go because (she likes Hogwarts and Harry/she likes Hogwarts and Harry and doesn't want to be cut apart)

  Second Year AU. After Hermione is disowned by her magic-hating parents, the combination of a Life Debt and Harry's promise to always care for her leads to our favourite couple finding themselves in an unusual relationship and making the very best of it with the help of their friends and two sympathetic professors. Yes, Hermione wears a collar, but this is in every way a safe, sane, consensual, and age-appropriate relationship between decent people who love each other, with absolutely no humiliation, coercion, or violence and no activities more sexual than kissing and snuggling. Still, if that particular kink bothers you, you might want to go and read "On a Bright Summer Morning," "Hufflepuffs and Harmony," or "Summer of the Bundling Charm" instead.

  In First Year, Harry realises early on that he has more in common with Hermione than Ron. Their friendship gradually blossoms into something more - something that Voldemort will come to regret - the Power he knows not. First through third year near canon, more AU from fourth year on.

** I can't easily link on mobile. But I know that near the end of "Silent World of Cassandra Evans" has people getting disowned and at least one of your mentioned characters does.

I'm also not sure how to hide spoilers so I won't say which one. Sorry for not being more helpful :( but the story is well worth reading!
