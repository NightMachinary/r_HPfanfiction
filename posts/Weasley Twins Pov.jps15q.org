  Harry has given Fred and George his Triwizard winnings, and they can hardly believe their luck.

** I'm so sad you didn't get many responses in this post. I'll share some fics with you that I liked and that are /close/ to your request, even if they're not exactly what you're looking for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14846531/chapters/34366397][The Marauders' Apprentices]] is an incomplete fic about Fred and George's first year at Hogwarts. Seven chapters so far; appears to be abandoned.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3698850/1/Wheezy][Wheezy]] follows George in the years after the Battle of Hogwarts. It's kinda angsty. 10 chapters so far, and it's incomplete (and appears to be abandoned, even though the author posted a new chapter last year for the first time in years).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12898088/1/Tired][Tired]] is one of my favorite one-shots of all time. It's a 2,297-word fic by [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]] about George in the months after Fred's death (it's sad but also surprisingly funny).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11419408/1/Not-From-Others][Not From Others]], also by [[/u/floreatcastellum][u/floreatcastellum]], is a really great Deathly-Hallows-from-Ginny's-POV fic. Fred and George are spot-on in this story, and they're in the fic a fair amount. Side note: The scene here where George realizes Fred has been killed is incredibly sad, and incredibly well-written.
