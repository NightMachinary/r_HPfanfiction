:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The couple met before Hogwarts. Sorted in different houses, etc, etc.

Gryffindor destroys the Nimbus that was actually a gift from the Parkinsons and not McGonagall.

Harry later has enough and leaves Hogwarts to go to the USA.

I'm afraid that's all I remember.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thank you!

  What if Harry met someone different in the Alley when he was eleven? What if it was someone who was looking for a friend as well and whose heart went out for a boy who appeared to be lost? Harry/Pansy.
