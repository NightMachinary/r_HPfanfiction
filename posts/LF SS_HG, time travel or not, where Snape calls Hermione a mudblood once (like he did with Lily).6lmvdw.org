** I have read this fic a long time ago and it was brilliant and i am positive that Hermione time travels into the Marauder era in that one. I tried searching for it and I'm not quite sure that linkffn(11879260) is it. I kinda want to read it from the start all over again. It's just that Hermione Devereux caught my eye and I think that was the name Hermione used. Do you have any more details that might help?

Edit1: Okay. False cry I think. I just skimmed through until chapter 8 and Dumbledore introduces her as his niece and while Snape doesn't necessarily call her mudblood, he does say that "he doesn't need nor wants her help" and Marauder duo act all chivalrous and Hermione gets teary eyed at his harsh treatment of her.

Onward search! I must find that fic.

Edit2: With my magnificent powers of skimming I have definately concluded that this isn't the fic that was requested. However, I shall not fail in my quest.

It is pretty okay if you want to read this one though.

*** What's your favorite Herus fic? I finally found a not stupid ship name, congratulations me. i.e. Hermione/Severus. Sione doesn't sound so bad either, but I'm pretty sure Hermione wears the pants, if you know what I mean.

This is very unrelated, to the topic at hand that is, but [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/9202556/chapters/20877623][this]] is my favorite.

**** I always referred to their ship as Snamione. It's a stupid name I know. Herus tho, sounds like an Ancient Greek/Roman name. I like it.

I have read a lot of HG/SS, most of them were not that good but i was binging on those fics. My favorite is actually a one shot and Hermione doesn't have that much screen time but I just like this. linkffn(7095055)

I was just planning to read the fic you just linked. It seems so interesting.

Edit: Although there was that one fic where both Hermione and Severus time travel back into the Marauder era and have to pose as DADA teacher and wife or assistant. That was good.

***** I dunno, Snamione is just a... name that doesn't seem like it was meant to be, like the Harmony ship name, Herus is more... composed I suppose - its short, gives it an air of mystery like the two might have, it makes me feel as if the ship is more, err, grounded.

I asked my previous question as the Herus pairing has been my favorite for several years, it was one that sort of snuck up on me - that I didn't even contemplate until I'd seen myself falling... in love with it.

The fic that you recommended was superb, even though it's incomplete state leaves a gaping hole in my chest. I'll have to get back to you on your favorite, but was wondering if you had any more suggestions - based on what I've seen I won't be sleeping tonight if you do.

Edit: The fic I mentioned is extraordinarily interesting, it's short and a bit rushed in parts - but the premise is fantastical and intriguing.

Editx2: "...inevitably (evidently?) I was too suicidal to make sandwiches now." And I have to watch that movie now ;p

****** Yeah, I get it. Snamione seems a bit off.

I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I don't have many brilliant Herus fics to recommend and my favorite really depends on which one I'm so hung up on that I reread and reread it many times. But time travel to Marauder era has always been great no matter who the protagonist. linkffn(Regarding Time Travel by katmd) is the one I mentioned earlier. linkffn(5563595; 11160509) are also pretty great.

******* My favorite group of TT fics are the ones where Hermione travels back and stays there - actually changing things. I remember one, but I can't quite recall enough details to search for it - I've only recently started a bookmark collection, you see, the 'Scales of Judgment' convinced me to save it by being brilliant - so I am in quite a similar boat. Though my tendency to read so many different fics makes it hard to remember which was which anyways.

Thank you for the recommendations, I've been on the prowl for good Herus fics for months. If your so inclined I'll send any good ones your way in repayment for the donations.

Not to be a stickler for the details, but I do believe the second one isn't quite... relevant...

*** Yeah I just read this one since it was recommended in another thread, I wanted to post this thread for a while and this fic made me do it. I liked their interactions, but they're a bit too young/childish in this fic for my liking, I prefer when the characters are a bit more mature (even if it turns into a bit of OOC for teenagers their age). Thanks anyway !
