Writing a story that takes place in the second year of ALBUS SEVERUS POTTER (good god that name!). Basically, Harry and Hermoine have sad married lives and think they made some grave mistake my marrying their current spouses. Hermoine thinks that Ron is good, gentle, sweet and a good father but ultimately boring and not very successful. Harry knows he peaked in school and is constantly looking for trouble & adventure (as an Auror hunting dark wizards) but his wife is too professional for his taste and is kind of cold & aloof towards him (and vice versa), there is basically zero chemistry and almost no sex.

What exacerbates the problem is that Harry and Hermoine keep seeing each other at the various Weasley family functions. They talk and realize the thing that is missing from their lives is each other. They purposefully never hooked up because neither considered the other a good match but reality has dawned on them a bit too late.

So I want to write an adult oriented tale of infidelity within the HP universe. I want to stay 70-80% accurate to the characters since the 20% OOC is used to justify that any of these people would ever cheat on their spouses in the first place. I also want Ron & Ginny to come off as the victims rather than go full RON THE DEATH EATER, which I hate. Would like some advice.

Also, I kinda redeemed Dudley in the story. He joins the army and finds 'real family' among his fellow soldiers and commander. He resents his now dead parents and has grown up to be bro type who loves to hang out with Harry and share stories from either side. He's still kind of an uncouth ass but in a lovable British way.

Would love to have some input on how to go about all this.


** How could Ginny be cool and aloof? That sounded more like the fanon characterization of Ice Princess of Slytherin Daphne Greengrass. The Canon Ginny was a very aggressive, fiery, and energetic person. She was also mischievous and sneaky (stealing her brothers' broom at age 6). Perhaps you confused Movie with Book Ginny?

In 2014, when Rita Skeeter made fun of them at the Quidditch World Cup, she sent her straight to the hospital. That fact alone showed Ginny hadn't lost any of her fiery spirit (or aggression).

** Staying true to the characters wouldn't really allow for H/Hr in my opinion. You're saying that Harry wants adventure? Hermione is a freaking bureaucrat in her adult years. Not at all adventurous. And How the hell is Ginny Fucking Weasley boring? She fucking gives Rita Skeeter a smackdown (or at least a good hex). Also that whole leading a rebellion in her sixth year thing. I don't think you can stay 70-80% in character without having to make significant changes in the past (relative to your story). Don't let me keep you writing, though, but you may want to adjust more than you're thinking.

*** I'm certainly not the target audience for this type of fic as a big Harry/Ginny fan, so take this with a grain of salt, but I agree totally with the above by [[/u/ssnik992][u/ssnik992]]. The series makes it pretty clear that Harry and Ginny work exceedingly well together, IMO. Can't speak much for Ron and Hermione but I certainly buy their relationship too. So a lot of the natural dissolving of their marriages just doesn't jive with what we know about them.

Your characterization of Ginny is so off it sort of ruins the entire premise. If anything, as mentioned above, Hermione is the cold, professional type. You said you want to justify their affair, which is simply not possible unless Ginny and Ron were themselves unfaithful or perhaps abusive. You also want to show Ron and Ginny as the victims, thereby implying Harry and Hermione are acting selfishly and callously. So you're already making the people we are presumably supposed to root for pretty awful people.

Also, you set the story up as Harry and Hermione cheating. While I believe this would hold true for Hermione, too, Harry simply would not cheat. He is far too noble to do so. He isn't even the type to leave an unhappy marriage out of duty to his children and to honor the commitment he made.

Here's my advice: It sounds like the characters themselves aren't that important since they would need to act so OOC as to render them strangers to the reader. So why not take the same basic plot and just use some lesser-explored characters. Maybe it's Percy and Audrey and George and Angelina, and George and Audrey have the affair. George is resentful because he thinks Angelina still views him as a replacement for Fred, the one she really wanted. And He justifies cheating with Audrey by claiming to still be angry at Percy for abandoning the family. Audrey wants more fun in her life and Percy sucks all the fun out of life. Meanwhile Percy feels he is spending his entire life trying to make up for his past mistake and when is enough enough? The family gets involved when the affair is discovered and everyone has different reactions. Maybe you can insert Harry, Ginny, Ron and Hermione and have the affair threaten to tear them apart too because maybe Harry and Ginny disagree with Ron and Hermione.

This could be a good fic with the same basic premise but different characters. It could force us as the reader to look at two characters (George and Percy) one we love, and one we dislike, and flip the script. I'd read that.

** Like the others, I think you do need a better line of reasoning for Harry to even consider leaving Ginny for anyone, let alone Hermione, if you're remaining true to the characters. One of the more difficult things about writing a post-canon fic like yours is that there isn't any easy way to break up Harry and Ginny without either of them doing a characterisation 180. Ron and Hermione have some pretty obvious flaws that could be exploited when writing a fic. But, imo, Ginny, was tailor-made for Harry, to the point where I'm convinced that JK sat down with a pen and paper one day during the planning stages of the series and listed all the qualities Harry might be attracted to, and just coalesced that into one character. Even her flaws aren't really flaws: she's a bit judgmental and quick-tempered, but that's always rounded into her being fiery, which is something Harry likes in her. And, Ginny's just underdeveloped enough throughout the series that we don't see any other appreciable flaws she has that might signal a rocky romance, but just developed enough that we buy her characterisation and the relationship with it.

In a way, it's actually quite clever that Rowling didn't turn her into the main heroine: if she had gotten the same amount of "page time" as Hermione, Jo would have either had to introduce real flaws to her that Harry would actually be bothered by, to make her a more interesting literary character, thereby ruining the whole fairytale romance aspect of it all, or she'd write Ginny as is and that'd be a dreadfully boring Mary Sue (pls don't kill me Ginny fans).

But that's a digression, and more of a characterisation nitpick as someone who writes, than me spotting a logical problem in character interaction. Your problem is a logical problem: If all the characters are more or less true to their canon selves, Harry would have no reason to leave a person like canon Ginny in your fic. They have chemistry; if anything, they have /too much/ chemistry. You would either have to contort Ginny into being something she's not (i.e. cold and aloof), or twist Harry into something he's not (being suddenly attracted to bookish types like Hermione over sporty types like Ginny, or even being likely to entertain the thought of infidelity). Even the generally good H/Hr post-epilogue fics, such as Unlike a Sister, are guilty of warping characterisation somewhat, exaggerating Ginny's fiery nature into being someone who is genuinely kind, but also unknowingly callow and career-obsessed. While it's up to you to decide whether or not this better than Jo's version of Ginny, it can't be denied that UaS's version of Ginny is not canon Ginny.

Furthermore, there's the complication of kids, and I don't think either Harry or Hermione would jeopardise their relationship with their children for each other. Hermione's not the type to choose her own happiness over others, and Harry is basically a Jesus analogue, so he's /definitely/ not the type.

Unfortunately, the only way I can think of breaking up Harry and Ginny without messing with the way they're portrayed is to kill one of them off or to set your story at some point before an H/Hr romance becomes logically impossible, which is definitely before the kids, and probably before the marriage itself.

*** Yes, an excellent way to bring Harry and Hermione together after the War is to kill off Ginny and/or Ron, like in [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7460][Love Lost, Love Found]]. Everyone stayed in character, no bashing, and the kids would gladly accept the new reality.

** I think this is an interesting concept, but I do agree with other comments that you have Ginny wrong. I think it would be easy to have Ginny stay as she is in cannon and have Harry stay as he is, and still have them grow apart and fall out of love. Relationships take work, and sometimes people don't realize that you change as you go through life. Maybe Harry and Ginny were madly in love for a while, but with all of their kids getting ready to leave the nest they have more time to look at each other and Harry feels that the spark is no longer there. He still loves Ginny, as the mother of his children and his friend, but he can't remember the last time that they've even kissed.

*** Eh, but I think even having them lose the passion for each other is OOC. Harry and Ginny are both passionate people. I just can't see them losing that for each other. A better idea would be for the stresses of life and kids slowly taking the passion away, but once the kids are all gone, they rediscover it. Not a H/Hr story then, but more realistic and in-canon.

The idea that he would wind up in a marriage where Ginny is his friend but not more but finds that with Hermione doesn't work because that is exactly the type of relationship he has with Hermione.

And again, the basic premise that Harry and Hermione cheat is wildly OOC.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

*** You're story idea is fine. And despite the objections of some people here, including myself, there are plenty of people who will like the idea of H/Hr regardless of what you do to the characters. I myself have enjoyed stories with people acting OOC. I suppose the difference here is that you are changing the characters in a negative way, rather than a neutral or positive way. Point is write what you want. People will criticize and you should take them to heart, especially if there is a consistent criticism. But that's part of being a writer, taking criticism.

In my comment above, I advised changing the central characters of the story but keeping the plot the same. How important is it to make this a Harry/Hermione story? And how important is keeping the story the same, one of infidelity?

** Well, I kind of disagree with people on Ginny (maybe it's my personal dislike of the character, that lacks fleshing out IMHO (I mean really: What do we know of Ginny? Temperamental red head witch, good at quidditch with a crush on Harry - IMHO that's it! A few tidbits here and there otherwise, but over all: Not much! We know tons more about Hermione!), talking!):

It's not like a lot of passionate people don't turn into total bores later in life, especially if they pursue a career that eats up all their passion (an athletes life (Ginny play quidditch professionally if I remember correctly!) isn't all fun and games, it's daily training, pushing your limits, only eating certain foods (many athletes have food plans etc.) etc. that can take a lot of the fun and passion out of life if you return home at night dead tired - not much time for sex, fun, going out, sleeping in etc...more so if there's kids involved, kids are a fucking energy drain after all - that's why many unstable relationships are ruined if people decide to have kids because they believe kids make it all better, newsflash: They don't...have them if you both want them and if your relationship is rock solid - otherwise do NOT have them!)

What do I want to say with that? IMHO it's easily possible for Ginny to become a dreadful passionless harpy only interested in her career (and maybe in parties and high society events, the Weasleys are fucking poor and IMHO all of them, except for Arthur and Molly, want success in their own right - Hell, Ron resents Harry (who's an orphan, while Ron himself has a loving family!) for having money! I mean even the twins (they run their own successful shop!), Charlie (who left ASAP after Hogwarts, probably because Molly being overbearing) and Bill (intelligent with a well paying but dangerous job) went out for success, hell even Percy is very successful (for a boring paper pusher!)...so would Ginny not want something similar? I mean the only one without ambition in that family is IMHO Ron (ok, and Arthur and Molly) and IMHO the OP is right that this might cause a rift between him and Hermione! I mean Hermione sounds like a strong and independent woman, but on the other hand she's not someone who wants or needs a house husband who is only good at saying "Yes dear!" and doing what she wants - in fact I'd say she would probably be disgusted in the long run by Ron's lack of propper ambition to make something of himself! Hermione would rather have someone who'd fight her if he thinks she's wrong and who makes something of himself (Harry fills that better than Ron, but not ideally! Unless he changes his habbits and gets his NEWTS, IMHO Hermione in canon should protest Harry leaving school without graduating, especially since it makes other careers than the Aurors impossible, should he want to change later on!)...hell, we have WOG that that relationship basically is pure fanfiction (Rowling admits that it was wrong and that Harry and Hermione make a lot more sense as a couple!)
