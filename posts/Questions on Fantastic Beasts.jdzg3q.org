  GRINDELWALD drives the carriage down onto the Hudson River, chased by the AURORS on broomsticks. The carriage wheels graze the surface of the water. The broomstick riders are catching up.

  GRINDELWALD touches the Elder Wand to the river and at once the inside of the carriage begins to fill with water.
#+end_quote

How did Grindelwald fill the carriage with water?

#+begin_quote
  Still driving the carriage, GRINDELWALD swirls his wand in the air toward the surrounding storm clouds. One by one, forks of lightning strike the broomstick riders, knocking each in turn from the sky.
#+end_quote

What spell manipulates lightning? It seems he manipulated the sky or weather to shot lightning at people?

#+begin_quote
  GRINDELWALD appears at the door and nods to ABERNATHY. He throws the door open so the water pours out---along with the two remaining AURORS. GRINDELWALD clambers inside and retrieves the vial from ABERNATHY'S mouth by the chain, casting a spell that grants ABERNATHY a new forked tongue
#+end_quote

Is this anormal thing for Wizards to do? Healing someone to this extent? Is it because of the Elder Wand?

#+begin_quote

  1. Hearing this, NEWT frowns, watching as CREDENCE'S face emerges in the surface of the table

  2. GRIMMSON walks toward them while the ghostly image of CREDENCE shimmers on the enchanted surface of the table.
#+end_quote

In these two different scenes, they was a table that showed things like a pensive does. Is it a pensive or something else entirely?

#+begin_quote
  FLAMEL looks over at the large crystal ball, in which dark billowing clouds and flashes of lightning have appeared.
#+end_quote

It seems flamel has a crystall ball that actually works. What's different about this crystal ball and why does

#+begin_quote
  FLAMEL shuffles back into his studio and opens a cupboard. We glimpse glass vials, tubes, and the glowing Philosopher's Stone. He heaves from a shelf a padlocked book embossed with a phoenix. He touches the padlock and it springs open.

  Each page holds a photograph captioned with a name. FLAMEL turns the pages, but the subjects of all the pictures are missing

  DUMBLEDORE'S portrait is blank. FLAMEL flicks open another page. EULALIE HICKS, a young American professor at Ilvermorny, looks around, worried.
#+end_quote

This book seems like a communication thing for Dumbledore and his contacts. Similar to a magical protrait and the mirrors Sirius gave Harry.

​

#+begin_quote
  At once, every portrait along the corridor turns into NEWT. An alarm sounds.
#+end_quote

It seems an alarm system was triggered when Newt's polyjuice potion wore off. How does it work? And why doesn't the British Ministry have it?

​

At 4:40 when MACUSA Aurors arrive, some people manage to disapparate but then the Aurors use some spell to bring them back then [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP6_sdJRFag][trap them.]]

What is this spell since we never saw it used in the books?


** Most of these are up to your own individual interpretation. It's a screenplay which means that we only see the effects of the spell and not the rationale behind it. Harry might have explained what it was in the books but that won't happen in a film

If I had to take a guess, most of which is pure speculation:

Movement of the water through the method Dumbledore used to "summon" (not the summoning charm though) Rosmerta's Mead

Just a spell, we don't get a name.

Yeah, it does seem abnormal unless MACUSA used dark magic to cut out his tongue. Unlikely though, so I think Grindelwald was just being an asshole and trying to be poetic.

Not a pensieve

It shows the past and not the future

System that stops unauthorized people from entering. Recognizes specific people, which is why polyjuice fooled it. British Ministry could simply not have used the charm.

I don't think they fully disapparated. The animation is still visible before they get pulled back.

The crystal ball flamel had showed Grindelwald's rally and the fire dragons before it happened.

They did actuallly. Most of the occupants have disapparated when the Aurors arrive, and they point their wands at the places the wizards disapparated and they were brought back.

**** Fair enough on the crystal ball, it's been a while, but I rewatched the bar scene and I don't think anyone who fully disapparated got pulled back.

** The idea of magic is usually the caster imposing their will over reality. Assuming this to be true, in theory a skilled or practiced enough caster may not even need spells.

A lot of what Grindelwald was doing over the Hudson could be explained this way. A basic idea for the water suddenly showing up in the cart could be a Switching Spell. "Swap water in river for air in cart." A wind manipulation spell could explain the lightning. Create a vacuum or whatever it is that would make a feasible path for the lightning to travel. Such energy always takes the path of least resistance.

The Elder Wand is also a powerful tool, possibly even sort of sentient, and in many fanfics what makes it so powerful is that it takes in user experience, giving the current user the ability to simply will effects into existence and letting the wand do the actual spellcraft, not to mention that it probably makes the use of spells as efficient as possible. There's a real chance that one of the users of the elder wand was a healer, giving the wand knowledge of human anatomy and allowing the next user to power heal.

Wizards can already show memories, there's basically nothing that says other image-projecting runes can't/don't exist. It'd be impractical for them not to.

Nicholas Flamel is six-fucking-hundred years old, that's more than enough time to pick up tricks like how to use divination to see across distance rather than time, and hey, he's 600, he probably can give himself something like a false Third Eye, which would allow him future sight.

And it's canon that portraits can communicate, so it's probable that maybe even something like Chocolate Frog cards (say, Dumbledore's in the future) could be used to communicate with him, and all of Dumbledore's friends and tools in the future carry one around. As it stands /maybe/ he already made pocket-sized portrait that was linked to the one flamel had.

The reason the British Ministry doesn't have Polyjuice Alarms is the same reason Lucius "Luscious Hair" Malfoy is allowed to just walk around the building despite being an actual War Criminal. They're idiotically corrupt and don't particularly care if terrorists are walking around the building disguised as staff.

** For the filled carriage, I would assume it is the Switching Spell.

Grindelwald is a powerful wizard, not every piece of magic he uses would be something in a student's arsenal or even known to him (Harry isn't known for his extensive reading skills).

He healed a cut tongue, which would be quite easy for someone like him if MACUSA didn't use dark magic.

It could be, but I'm not sure.

We never saw a crystal ball that /didn't/ work before, I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Of course, Harry and Ron would see jackshit in a crystal ball because they don't have the gift nor basic skills in Divination because they never listened in class. Flamel had 600 years to become proficient in Divination.

The book is something we never saw before and I don't know which scene you're referring to with the portraits. In any case, if this is a protection inside the French Ministry, I would see no reason why they would ever want to share it, certainly not with another country. There's such a thing as top secret information.

The Apparition thing seems to be the Movieverse version of the Anti-Apparition Jinx being put into place while people are apparating. We must remember that Apparition in the books and the movies are quite different, the former is instant with no smoke while the second seems like immaterial very fast flying.

** Most of these are reasons why the Fantastic Beasts films are taken with huge spoon of salt and mostly ignored (especially for their completely confused magic).
