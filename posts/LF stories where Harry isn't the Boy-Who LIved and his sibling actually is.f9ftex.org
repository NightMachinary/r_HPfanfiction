So I'm looking for the opposite of the whole Wrong Boy Who Lived plot. I want the sibling to be the real Boy or Girl Who Lived and Harry isn't.

But, Harry is his own person, maybe he accomplishes different things outside from what his twin accomplishes.

Maybe he's super into Quidditch and ends up becoming a player or a Coach, maybe he becomes an Auror or a Professor or whatever else.

I don't really want bashing from James, Lily and the sibling, if possible.

It just doesn't make sense to me that pretty much all the Wrong Boy Who Lived Harry ends up doing stuff/fixing stuff because his twin is in danger or trouble or whatever and then never gets thanks or anything like that.

I don't want Harry to be super powerful or super smart, smarter or more powerful than in canon is fine, but make it believable.

Can be on ANY site.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather have as very little or few bashings of characters as possible. Characters disliking or hating a character is one thing, but an author going out of their way to bash is normally a no go.

Horcruxes can be a thing or not.

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine.

** You can download a WBWL fic then find and replace Harry with his brother's name and vice-versa. Will output exactly what you're asking for.

*** Exactly this, I don't understand why people act like this is a foreign concept. Also bwl and pos are the best wbwl stories.
