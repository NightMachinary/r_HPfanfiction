** There are 4100+ Spanish HP fanfics on AO3, excluding crossovers. You can use this link to find them, narrow it down by selecting "edit your search" and filling in one of the characters you want. You can search by bookmarks/kudos to find the more popular ones. I can't read any Spanish, so no comments on the quality or what you will find.
