Don't really know why I want to see more of this... trope (?), but the new update of Lord Jeram's Far Too Many Time Travellers made me wonder if there's anything else out there where that friendship is explored a little bit. Obviously doesn't have to be the focus of the fic but it'd be great if it was somewhat big in the story.

If there's a good pairing fic then by all means do recommend it


** linkffn(Harry & The Mysterious Curse of the Girl Who Lived) qualifies. Harry actually spends his summer at the Patil residence in the second half of the summer, as opposed to the Weasley residence

  Harry always knew that there was something unique about him. In a way, the arrival of the Hogwarts acceptance letters was almost expected... except, why are they all addressed to 'Harriet Potter?
