I've read a couple of stories with this theme, and I'm not really sure of the specifics.

One particular story I'm looking for is where Harry & Ginny break up because he doesn't want her to become an auror.

Harry ends up having to protect Ginny and her family because of some unknown threat, and they eventually get back together.

Another small detail I remember is where Harry takes Ginny to a waterfall. I really wish my memory wasn't this terrible!


** I remember this fic. Lets see if I can find it...

I can't, but heres what I can add to the description: Harry was part of the council that was voting for new Aurors, and he was the deciding vote that prevented her from joining. She figures it out, and they break up.

A few years later (5 I think) she is playing Quidditch and Harry is assigned to either her team or her personally and has to guard her.

The waterfall scene is near the end, and is where Harry ends up proposing marriage.
