I have read a lot of them, so its getting harder to find good ones, but if you have any good ones, i would greatly appreciate it. But like the title says, im looking for Time Travel Fics where the pairing is Harry and Ginny. Time traveled character can be either or both. Soul Bonds would be nice but not required.

** "Ginny Returns", linkffn(4740107): The only completed, Ginny goes back in time, fic. She accomplished her primary objective very efficiently, but...

"Gryffindors Never Die", linkffn(6452481): Several years after the Epilogue, Ginny and Hermione divorced both their husbands due to political disagreements. Some higher powers decided to give the boys one more chance.

"Strawberry Fields", linkffn(4940094): This one is not strictly a time travel, but Harry and Hermione read all 7 Books before even going to Hogwarts, and they were prepared.

"We are the Golden Trio", linkffn(7405516): The Trio and a 5 DAY old Rose were thrown back to the day before they boarded Hogwarts Express. They decided to strike out on their own, and the 10 year old Ginny got accidentally caught up in their adventures.

--------------

"Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw", linkffn(11574569): This one is still WIP, and Ginny would become part of a harem. Otherwise, it's a very well written story.

"Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past", linkffn(2636963): It's the highest favorited fic on FF.net, but the author suffered a RL accident. I don't know whether it will ever be finished.

linkffn(5251301)

linkffn(4175909)

linkffn(6386016)

These all have Ginny in them, a few have many characters going back(A second chance and past, present, future) a few are just harry and ginny (bonds of time and gift of time) and a few have ginny returning by herself (ginny returns and furious angels).

please note that I'm only 70% sure furious angels has ginny going back in time but I might be wrong.
