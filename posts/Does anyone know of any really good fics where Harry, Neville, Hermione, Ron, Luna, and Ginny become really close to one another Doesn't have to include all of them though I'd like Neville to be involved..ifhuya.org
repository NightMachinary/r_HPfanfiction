** There is! It's quite long and still being updated. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12924292/242/][A Second Chance]] by Breanie. I don't know how to link to ffn so you'll just have to use the link. The story basically follows the main plot points of the original series in one way or another. However McGonagall petitions for Sirius to get a trial. He's exonerated and Harry grows up in a loving home. As a child he befriends Neville, the Weasleys, Hermione, and Luna. There's a decent bit of erotica that can more or less be skipped without detracting from the story in super meaningful ways. It is a harry/ginny plot but we're 242 chapters in and still not quite there yet, so if that bothers you can read for a while before you have to deal with it. It also includes some deeply graphic content regarding Death Eaters and Voldemort thT really justifies the amount of fear people have for them. I think it makes the world more real, but it can be hard to read. I highly reccomend.

** ooh i've got a couple for this: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2531438/1/A-Better-Man][A Better Man]], which is about if vernon changed in the beginning (it's really good and i've read it about ten times) that has that group + the triwizard champions when you get to that part. the ship is harry/ginny and other than that i can't remember, but yeah. the second one would be [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093897/1/H-J-Potter][H J Potter]], which is a harmony soulbond fic but it's quite long and the group of characters is really well thought out. this is definitely one of my favourite fics, although it does mainly focus on harmony (so i don't know if you'll like it). but they're both good, give 'em a read. hope you enjoy!!

** Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. Harry Potter kills himself to go back in time and fix the worst case scenario the world has become. Part of fixing things is treating his friends better and being more open with them. It has some really good drama with Harry both trying to be more open and needing to hide what he is until they can protect the secret for him.

  really close to one another
#+end_quote

Really close like "this fic's version of the Golden Trio is expanded to all six main student protagonists" or like "I want a polyamory fic between the main student protagonists, especially Neville, but I'm kind of hesitant to ask directly because it'll sound like I'm requesting smut"?

I'm sure I can pull a title for at least one of the former. Not sure about the latter but I'll glance around; My HP fanfic library is spread across at least four apps on two phones (including one that needs to stay plugged into a wall to function), so that takes a while to search.

*** Oh and its complete. Nice and long too. Its a harmony story, with good slytherins and bad dumbles. Healthy dose of marauders too, and all of the weasleys are represented and well written. Starts with mpreg, which is not something I would usually go for, but its very well done and not really dwelled upon, but its massively important to the story.

  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?

  November 1, 1981. The day Petunia Dursley, nee Evans, had her world turned upside down. With the death of her sister and brother-in-law, she is left as the guardian of her nephew. Her husband, Vernon, refuses to accept Harry, so Petunia packs up and leaves, taking Harry and her son, Dudley. This is the story of how she got to that point. But mostly, it's the story of two sisters.
