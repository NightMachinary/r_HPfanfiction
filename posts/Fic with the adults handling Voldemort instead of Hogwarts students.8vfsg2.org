Are there any fics where adults handle the problem of Voldemort instead of a group of Hogwarts students? I'd love to see a more competent "Light" and "Dark" side. Bonus points if the prophecy/Harry/Neville don't exist or aren't relevant.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11265467/1/Petrification-Proliferation][Petrification Proliferation]], linkffn(11265467): Dumbledore took the Basilisk a little more seriously, and the canon plot was basically shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Although this Harry was significantly stronger than the canon version, Dumbledore really did the heavy lifting, even the Ministry was cooperative. But Voldemort would still have beaten them all, if Hermione and Aberforth hadn't picked up the slack. Canon Harry would never have a chance against this Voldemort, and canon Horcrux hunt would have never worked.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

*** Thanks! I remember reading both of those a while back; I don't remember much about them, but I do remember enjoying them.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12834801/1/The-Coven-of-Albion][The Coven of Albion]] linkffn(12834801), written by yours truly, has this. It's done/is doing some of what you ask. Since Voldemort is making a more international play for power a few years before Harry's time at Hogwarts, the adults are the only ones who can do anything about him right now. Their responses including voting for certain measures, political shakeups, petitioning for literal divine intervention, etc.

  Upon realizing his strange abilities, a young Harry develops them to free himself from his hateful family & runs away. Given his importance to a world he doesn't know exists, how will life on the streets change the Boy-Who-Lived & the destiny he is fated? Through faith & family will he gain what he'd never had. AU, Black Coven & political themes. Formerly titled "Break the Limits"
