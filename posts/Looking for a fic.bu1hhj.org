:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, I'm looking for a fic I read a few years back, could either be on ff.net or ao3. The main part I remember is that when he sleeps Harry ends up being like a ghost/spirit thing and is stuck with Voldemort, I think Voldemort also goes through the same thing. I'm pretty sure as time goes by they can interact with the others spirit and that at one point Voldemort helps Harry at school.
