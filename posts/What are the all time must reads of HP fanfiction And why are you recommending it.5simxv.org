** The Hogwarts/Giant Squid fic is a semi famous sendup of smutfic and actually well written (for smut). Linkffn(first encounter by lyris malachi)

Linkffn(cauterize by lady altair) great example of fanfiction that relies on your canon knowledge to pack a heavy emotional punch.

Linkffn(seventh horcrux) fandom classic dark comedy. Trope subversions galore.

Linkffn(Alexandra Quick and the thorn circle) best wizarding America fic, populated by OCs. Alex's journey parallels Harry's in some ways but usually demonstrates what different characters they are.

Linkffn(fantastic elves and where to find them) AU Harry is delightful. A Harry-raises-himself story.

Linkffn(doubting Thomas by azardarkstar) Luna time travels and raises Tom Riddle as a good man. Great 'what if' story.

It is superbly written in a way that most fanfiction just doesn't reach, its characters are well-constructed and totally believable, its plot is ambitious while not being ridiculous, and it also holds that same kind of magical yet domestic appeal that the books have. I love it. I wish I saw it recommended more often.

** My two favorites:

linkffn(harry potter without harry potter) has great characterizations and really builds up secondary characters like Percy Weasley. The plot diverges from canon in interesting ways. Hermione's story is unique and awesome.

linkffn(magical relations) has what I think is the best-written Harry with great new friendships and believable conflict. It balances humor and story really well with some laugh out loud moments and some that will for sure make you cry.

** For stuff that's reasonably canon-compliant, my recommendations are:

- /Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness/ by Thanfiction (sequels are major AU and super dark though). 7th year, mostly from Neville & Ginny's POV
- /Backward With Purpose/ by Deadwoodpecker (including sequels if it has them, I've forgotten). Lots and lots of time travel.

For stuff that's not particularly canon compliant:

- /Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality/ by Lesswrong. Petunia married an Oxford biochemist rather than Vernon. Everybody gets a major intelligence upgrade. 1st year.
- /Duality/ by Andafaith. Harry/Daphne, 6th year? Gryffindor Harry, now with Slytherin allies.
- Pretty much anything by Rorschach's Blot. My favourite is /Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood/.
- Also everything by White Squirrel.
- /Harry Potter and the Natural 20/, by Sir Poley. Sadly seems to be abandoned now. Crossover with D&D, lots of munchkinry.

That's probably enough to be getting on with...

*** I'm upvoting for sake of discussion but I'll be argumentative and say Methods of Rationality, for those of you who haven't heard of it, is a mixed bag. It's interesting in its premise and occasional idea, but horrid in its repetitive writing, bad pedagogy and plotting, lack of consequences, and tension between themes and setting.

Additionally, linkffn(Not From Others by FloreatCastellum) is far superior to Year of Darkness.

YoD has some major breaks in believability. Most of the criticism at it focuses on its excessive militaristic vibe, OOC developments and implausible plot devices. Snape sending Neville/Ginny/Luna to be killed by werewolves in the Forbidden Forest? Victor Krum saving Neville from ministry execution chamber? Yeah...

Taste is subjective, you're free to not like whatever you want to not like. But whether or not the writing is repetitive is not a matter of opinion. Whether or not the plot is laid out poorly is not a matter of opinion. Whether or not there are consequences for characters' actions is not a matter of opinion.

Please don't take my statements as intentionally hostile.

I read HPMoR over a year ago, when I first discovered fanfiction (less cynical days). I devoured it in a week. Despite my misgivings today, I am still glad I enjoyed the story back then. Harry's demeanor never put me off at the time; justified disrespect can be thrilling, and that's how I experienced his character.

HJPEV /is/ arrogant; he shows an offensive attitude of superiority. He flaunts his rationality in the faces of adults; he's a hard character to connect with; his exaggerated intelligence is improbable for a 12-year-old. Arrogance is one of his flaws as a character---and that's a /good/ thing, because that makes him human. That trait on its lonesome is not enough mar the story. But negative traits usually face some resolution in a narrative---resolution is indeed the aim of a narrative. It's arguable that Harry's arrogance---his superiority---is never challenged head-on; in the end, he saves the day without confronting his own self. Instead, the arrogance is treated as a positive trait; the reader is expected to cheer for his blatant disrespect for a JK Rowling's whimsical, magical, cherished childhood tale. Acceptance of such a character is highly dependent on the cynicism of the reader.

At the very least, the bashing of the magical world could've been veiled better. Insidious decay is far more effective than brute force.

Additionally, consider the pedagogical implications of an arrogant teacher. If HPMoR comes as readers' first introduction to rationality, then at least a few of their core beliefs will be challenged by the author. And an arrogant teacher will simply force his students' mental paradigm shifts behind defensive walls. Thus, the superior attitude hurts one of the author's primary intents.

Now perhaps you say that his arrogance---his character defect---is challenged by his colossal failure in being out-smarted by Quirrell. He feels shame for not confiding in Dumbledore. But then what is resolved? There's no character lesson that affects the story; Harry merely thinks /harder/ and saves the day yet again. Furthermore, this challenge of his arrogance occurs after nearly /half a million words/; demanding patience for a grating flaw while simultaneously demanding attentiveness to the aforementioned goal of education is unreasonable.

Readers are emotional beings; successful stories are emotional tales. Consider for a moment that all the philosophy is correct. Yet none of it takes hold without an emotional undercurrent. And the time-honed structure of setting up conflict within a person and resolving it is necessary for this undercurrent (e.g. Lord of the Rings: Frodo's character conflict is his constant battle against the Ring's call; without this conflict, the external challenges of the story would quail beneath Frodo's unblemished purity and resolve). Replacing literary techniques with figurative shouting merely furthers a divide away from agreement.

This is merely one flaw in the fic---not enough to draft an opinion about the work as a whole, but a critical starting point.
