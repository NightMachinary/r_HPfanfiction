  Admit it, you've always been curious about what the professors were thinking while Harry, Ron, and Hermione got themselves into all kinds of shenanigans.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12181042/1/Order-of-Mercy][Order of Mercy]] by MandyinKC. This features Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey as well as others creating their own Underground Railroad to hide muggleborns. Takes place during the Deathly Hallows from their perspectives. linkffn(12181042) Status: Complete

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11769405/1/Dudley-Dursley-and-the-Deathly-Hallows][Dudley Dursley and the Deathly Hallows]] by Grey Streaked Fur. The title is self explanatory, but I'll give a basic run down. This story starts right after Dudley said good bye to Harry and the Dursleys left Surrey. Everything about what happen during the war is from Dudley's perspective. He grows to be a character that I genuinely like. There is one major OC in the story, but that's the inevitable since this story is about Dudley. Overall, it is an excellent read. linkffn(11769405) Status: Complete

The last two also takes place during the Deathly Hallows, but are from Percy's perspective. In both stories Percy essentially does a sort of espionage type of work after he discovered how much Voldemort had taken over. However, the two fics are different versions of that prompt. I love both the stories anyways.

** The canon story told from Dumbledore's point of view. The author fills in the blanks here and there, but in a way that makes it believable it could be canon.

Edit: I'm guessing I'm doing something wrong with the linking. I though you only had to type in the name of the fanfic?
