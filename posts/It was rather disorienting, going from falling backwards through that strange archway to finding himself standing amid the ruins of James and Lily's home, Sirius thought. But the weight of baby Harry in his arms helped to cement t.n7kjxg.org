He realized that he had two choices: either go after Pettigrew again, and hope that knowing how the confrontation went last time would be enough to alter it's outcome; or go to Dumbledore, tell him the truth (though perhaps just the bit where Wormtail was the real Secret Keeper, as telling Albus that he had the memories of the next 15-odd years might seem too crazy, even for a member of the Black family), and do his absolute best best to be there for Harry like he should have done the last time around.

*** Yeah if I was book-time Sirius I wouldn't think Dumbledore evil BUT he believed the worst last time and if he doesn't/can't capture Pettigrew than he can't prove his innocence.

So either get Pettigrew and xlear his name (maybe go to Remus and get his help) or run away with Harry and maybe tell Dumbledore the truth from a distance where he can't do anything if he doesn't believe it (bc without Pettigrew he probably won't). Maybe run away with Harry and left Remus hunt down Pettigrew to clear his name.

**** Well, a good part of the reason why Dumbledore didn't believe in Sirius innocence was the whole "killing Peter Pettigrew and a lot of Muggle".

If Sirius doesn't do anything stupid and just go to Dumbledore from the start, he would probably be given the benefice of the doubt. And unlike Sirius, I doubt Dumbledore would let his guard down when confronting Pettigrew (especially if he knew that he was an Animagus).

Then again, just sending a letter to explain the situation while hiding may also be a good alternative . . . just in case.

***** That maybe be true about Dumbledore but would Sirius risk it when in his mind he went to Azkaban for Peter's betrayal (for the death of Lilly and James) which still happened and he's still the one everyone thinks is the secret keeper?

  For Sirius, going through the Veil opens up doors. Pretty much literally.

** First of all, Dumbledore is pretty open-minded and while never directly implied, I'm pretty sure he is also a user of legilimency, so he could trust Sirius with whatever he had to say.

Secondly, Harry, growing up as a child celebrity raised by the guy who confuses him with his best friend, makes Malfoy look like a sweet angel by the time he gets to Hogwarts.

*** I think that the reason Sirius confused Harry with his dad at all is because he just spent like 12 years of his life getting tortured, and is desperately grasping on to anything familiar

**** It also seemed to be more of a movie thing, than a book thing. In Book 5, at least to me, it seemed like Sirius wanted to mold Harry into an idealized version of his perception of who James was.
