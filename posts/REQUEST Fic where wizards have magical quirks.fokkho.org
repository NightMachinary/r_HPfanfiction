Was reading a fic recently and read this line

#+begin_quote
  "That was 'The Unforgivable Gaze,' my signature wizarding effect. You know the type; Snape has his cloak billowing, Albus has his eye twinkling, Hermione has her hair with varying levels of bushiness depending on how much stress she is under. I have my intimidating glare that the younger Aurors started calling 'The Unforgivable Gaze' and the name kind of stuck, my eyes are green so I guess it fits." Okay, as if that didn't just open up even more questions.
#+end_quote

And realized I would love a fic where this is actually a thing. Different character quirks manifesting themselves or being explained by a sort of unique thing every witch/wizard has. Is there anything out there like this?


** Can't help you with your request, but for those who wonder where this is from, it's from this fic: linkffn(6763981)

  Years after the Epilogue things look bleak; Harry Potter agrees to go back to the Ministry Battle to change history for the better. Premise; "canon makes sense" though not in the way you think. Fight scenes, humour, romance, magic, and insanity. FINISHED

** Agreed, that sounds hilarious. Very much like something from Seventh Horcrux in tone, or possibly Oh no not again.

** I don't remember the name of the fic but it was a HP/Bleach Crossover where wizards get some special powers at a certain age. It seemed pretty interesting at first but kinda spiraled down into cliches and common tropes later on.

** Not exactly what you're looking for, but linkffn(11502532) has multiple characters besides Harry having magical superpowers (flight, lightning, etc). Really good, but sadly on permanent hiatus.

  [Development Hell] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi
