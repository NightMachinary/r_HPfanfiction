:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In the fic Harry was in a coma when he wakes up ginny has moved on with draco.

Some random facts I can remember of the fic are:

I am sure Harry hooks up with the healer that's looked after him. I think her names katie

Ron and hermione have a crazy powerful son.

Any help would be great üòÅ
