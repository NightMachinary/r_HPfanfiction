So, I was thinking, whenever I see a Ravenclaw Harry in a fic, and he answers a riddle by the Ravenclaw door...the thing about those riddles in fanfiction is that they seem less philosophical, and more reliant on prior knowledge. On one occasion I saw a pun based on the French language.

The problem is, what if you have a student who's not familiar with some random vegetable or animal or random muggle/magical object or language or such? It doesn't seem very fair to them, the house is supposed to be about learning, not knowing.

So, I'd like to ask, what are the better Ravenclaw riddles you've seen? Ones where the needed information is supplied as part of the riddle, or just don't require much foreknowledge to figure out, or are open-ended with no one right answer, or so forth?


** I would love to see a mathnerd!Rowena, and have the door force them to find roots of very difficult set-ups. Given her time period, from my knowledge of math history, she could issue diophantine equations, or if she wanted to be very mean to upper-year students, I recall an infamous challenge problem from very roughly that era, which was a 45th degree equation only solvable because you could do some very clever substitutions and then apply trigonometric identities.

This is assuming that the door is working off some master list that Rowena compiled. If it can be added to by later Heads of House... mwahahahah

** Damn there's one in the Albus Potter series (linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation)) that recurs throughout the story. Albus, a non-Ravenclaw, can't figure it out and none of his claw friends will tell him. I think the riddle pops up in book 1 or 2 and by the end of book 5 (where I stopped for a reading break and never continued) it still hadn't been solved. I wonder if anyone better than I at remembering will know it!

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
