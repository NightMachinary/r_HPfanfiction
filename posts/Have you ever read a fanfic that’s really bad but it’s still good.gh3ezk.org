Where you're reading a fanfic and it's r e a l l y bad, like it's horribly written, and it's all grammatically incorrect, and the characters are all wrong, and the spellings are terrible, but it's still good?

And it's really cliche and it has too many overdone tropes, and there are so many blatant disregards for canon that is hurts, but it's still good?

And the writer's ideas don't flow, and the writing style is blocky and rough, and they've cut chapters down so short that there may as well only be a paragraph for each chapter, but it's still good?

And it's still good because it has your ships that don't get all that much love, and it's so rare that you can ignore all errors?

And it's still good because the characters, while not accurate to canon, are still loveable and cute?

And it's still good because it's put them in situations that almost never get wrote about, situations that you've never thought about that actually work?

And it's still good because it's obvious that the author is a new writer, and you remember yourself when you were a new writer, so you push through all the mistakes, because in a weird way you're proud of them for putting a piece of themselves out there?

Have you ever read a fanfic that's really bad, but it's still good?


** Anything by Sinyk is liable to cause a trope overdose. Just imagine it's a really cheesy Shakespeare play where everyone is whiny.

*** This author has a bizarre ability to find an interesting trope, play with it for a while and then drown it in an unending torrent of worst fanon cliches.

What is even worse, I can't even say that all his works are 100% unreadable. The good and bad points are so extreme that together they somehow result in being mediocre at best.

And come to think of it... It was his fic (Three to Backstep) that, among others, actually sparked my interest in HP fan finction.

** I've read a number of fics (didn't save them) that fall into grammatically terrible but story is pretty good. I'll soldier on and mentally correct the errors as I read. There have been a few I haven't bothered with though because they have no punctuation and terrible grammar.

*** I've come across quite a few of them myself, to be honest.
