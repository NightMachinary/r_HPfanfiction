The books and movies were mentioned, but not copied I think


** The Movies came almost a decade after the events in the Books. Emma Watson was born in April 1990, so how could the actors possibly help them out?

On the reverse, I'd like to see a Harry from the HP Universe thrown into ours sometime around 2010/2011, with no ways of going back. Then he found out that his story had been published in an altered form and a certain JK Rowling made billions off it. He confronted JKR and identified her as a witch from his home dimension (not Rita Skeeter though), who offered him a cut of the proceeds.

Financially secure, Harry settled somewhat and began exploring this magic less world. He watched the Movies and became infatuated with Emma Watson. Emma's post Movie career impressed him further.

With the help of Magic, no competition from other Wizards, and no interference from pesky Ministries, Harry adopted the identity of tech entrepreneur William "Mack" Knight, and began courting Emma after 2013. The two have been together since 2015.

**** If that were the case, those guys would certainly try to make a killing in the stock market. They could get in Amazon, AOL, Cisco, Dell, and Yahoo at bargain basement prices. In turn, they could use some of the gains to build a large army. Pounds were after all exchangeable into Galleons.

  What if the world of Harry Potter WAS real . . . what if Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton were asked by the REAL Harry, Hermione, Ron & Draco to go back and tell their younger wizard selves how to change everything?
