Hi all, I'm looking for fanfic that shows Hermione the way that books didn't show as great. I'm looking for studying and hard work, motivation and determination. If it's also Snamione, it would be awesome!

(I've read Post Tenebras Lux, Bound to him, Chasing the sun - liked all of them)


** Just remembered another: linkffn(For the Only Hope by ausland), and it's Snamione as requested. Also, I've just posted a list in response to a query about Grey!Hermione, and it occurred to me that some of the fics also fit here:

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][/Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived/ by Diane Castle]]: Nonmagical AU in which Hogwarts is a school for superspies; Hermione is a genius, but she has to work a lot, because so are many others.
- linkao3(Making Their Own Heroes by slythernim) and sequels have Hermione trick her way into Durmstrang (It's a long story.) with many of the attendant consequences.
- linkffn(Divided and Entwined by Starfox5) has Hermione leading a paramilitary group; she is not an instinctive leader, and the story shows her learning the skills involved.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)Year 1: Ron Weasley is not as alone as you might expect.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology by jacobk) fits the bill---the very traits that made her not fit in in Gryffindor, she has to turn up to 11 to make it in Slytherin.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.
