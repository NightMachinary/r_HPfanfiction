And when I say Troll Harry, I mean stories in which he trolls people, not him literally being a troll.

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

I mean, i've seen Harry magically turned into an elf, a vampire, a werewolf (which apparently has a bunch of strange sexual connotations), a mermaid (ugh, that one fic ._.), an owl, and a centaur. On and dragons. Lots and lots of dragons.
