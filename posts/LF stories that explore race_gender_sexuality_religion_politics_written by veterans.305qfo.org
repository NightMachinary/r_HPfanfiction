** I may have a recommendation, but I'm unclear about the intent with this. How is a story including gay relationships /not/ exploring sexuality? Certainly not every story will consider the tough issues, but it certainly shouldn't disqualify a story for consideration.

*** I certainly agree with you and believe that a story including gay relationships clearly does explore sexuality. Any recommendation that you have would be great! My hope was to try to avoid a pornography ONLY style story, as I know there are some out there. But I do not want to discount anything.

Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

Harry Potter - Rated: M - English - Adventure/Suspense - Chapters: 50 - Words: 405,903 - Reviews: 713 - Favs: 677 - Follows: 402 - Updated: Feb 8, 2011 - Published: Mar 11, 2009 - Harry P., Hermione G., N. Tonks - Complete

Actual sex scenes were relegated to a companion story called Spiral Tangents, but mention is made to some very mature material.

For an example of the content in full-soapbox mode, check out Chapter 40, specifically the entry for 5th October.
