Hi, I recently reread Hope by Jeconais and have been reading Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19, as it updates, and was looking for some more fics where it's Harry just going on and living life after Hogwarts and the war.\\
I've been enjoying reading about Harry's life and stories where it doesn't involve major catastrophic events that define the fic.\\
For pairings I want to avoid Ginny/Harry, Hermione/Harry. Wouldn't mind gen or unusual pairings. Also, no slash please.

Thanks!


** linkffn(Days to Come)

One of my favorite fics.

linkffn(11858167)

New and awesome fic, another favorite.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant. AU.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.

  Post Book 7 AU; A little over six years have passed since the events that ended the second reign of Voldemort. Now, Harry Potter is the one that needs to be rescued. Rising to this challenge is... Draco Malfoy? Apparently I have to say No Slash.
