** I thought about it for about 2 seconds, but my writing schedule tends to the sporadic and I feel like it would be too much pressure. I know some folks in the general fan fiction sub are doing it though.

** Yup. I'll probably be working on a longshot called "The Dreaming Tower." It's a Master of Death fic where Harry, injured and on the run from his greatest enemy yet, finds himself in investigating Ornoch, an isolated, Lovecraftian-ish town off the coast of Scotland (in the Orkneys to be precise) that's said to be home to a tower cursed by Godric Gryffindor himself and is central to several rumours, legends, and prophecies over the past millennia. Harry's enemies are numerous, counting up the whole of magical England under the rule of its newest Minister of Magic, as well as the strange and secretive folk of Ornoch. For help all he has is Draco Malfoy, the Hallows of Death, and an evil, soul-eating sword. Sometimes immortality is overrated.

So, it's part sword-and-sorcery fantasy, part cosmic horror, part buddy cop fic between two people who hate each other, and most likely to crash and burn at about 10,000 words rather than its anticipated 30,000. Here's hoping it doesn't and I get it done by December.

** Yeah. Just not sure what I'm doing. Last year was an HP/SW fic that I still haven't finished uploading the chapters for. I might try doing the same thing again and just restart it. Hard to believe it's already been a year since that.

** Yup! I'll be splitting my word count across my WIPs. Less a "Complete a novel" month and more a "Push forward your shit, [[/u/whatalala]]" month

** I'm still undecided if I'll try my hand on one of my dormant fics, or if I put some effort in it and actually go for something original.

The latter would require me to do a lot of preparation in October. Writing a fic would get massive worldbuilding, character design and all that out of the way. Really depends on wether or not my schedule allows it.

** I was planning on it! Either a pre-HP fic about fifth year Snape (and I guess I have to add Lily lol) dealing with the oncoming war or a fic with the Death Eaters going up against various dark creatures to win allegiance

** *raises hand*

I'm hoping to finish the one I started last year, since I'm in the last arc now. It's the final countdown! :D

** It completely escaped me that it was so close. Usually I work on original things, but I am writing a fiction currently, so will probably do that.

*** NaNoWriMo, or National Novel Writing Month. It starts in November, and the goal is to write an entire novel (usually about 50k words iirc) during that time. You can either do it on your own, or through their website to get encouragement and tips.
