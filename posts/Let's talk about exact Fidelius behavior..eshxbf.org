** I think that what happen is Option 5 : People not in the Fidelius forget about B.

In the books, Kreacher is able to contact Bellatrix and Narcissa by purposely misinterpreting an order ("Get out of here" as out of the room, become get out the house).

Thanks to the presence of Kreacher, it is already known that Sirius is in 12 Grimmault Place, (so B and C), and by going around its order (something like "Kreacher cannot talk to miss Bella and miss Cici about all the blood treators going into the Mistress' home), they can easily deduct that this is the Order's Headquarter (or at the very least, a safe house).

The fact that the house is not attacked after that show that, even with a lot of clues, the Fidelius can only be broken by its Secret Keeper. What I think happen is that someone like Bellatrix can think "Sirius is hiding in his parent's house, and this house is probably the Order's HQ", but she would be unable to remember where this house is. She may even remember 12 Square Grimmauld, but she could stand in the middle of the Square, and still can't remember where the house is.

** The Death Eaters and the Ministry know that Harry inherited the house and were keeping watch outside in Deathly Hallows, so they know the address. But they still can't enter the house without the Secret Keeper.

*** Was it really that? Or was it that he kept saying Voldemort and they show up for the Taboo and realize that there is a fidelius there?

â€‹

And with the Fidelius, the ministry knows Harry inherited A HOUSE but now where the house is.
