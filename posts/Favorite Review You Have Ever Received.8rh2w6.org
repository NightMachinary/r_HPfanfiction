Funny, mean, encouraging, or downright strange! What is the best review you ever gotten on one of your stories? If you're not a writer, what's the best review you've ever seen? I'll start

"realy fucking reatarted. go fucking die in a hole and take this pece of shit with you" ~Anon

Classic. Another...

"Please write the next chapter already. Thank you very much. I really appreciated it and liked it a lot. Please have Harry take a potion to look like a girl and then have him get r*** (raped) by a boy. Thank you in advance." ~Anon again (I'm sensing a pattern with these kinds of reviews)

That one was so funny I showed it to my family.


** He didn't use the word rape, he just hinted at it and then used it in a completely different context to explain something. What a great guy. /s

** I mean take your pick on chapter 11 of Pureblood Princess. Pretty much any review that states that because Daphne may not be a virgin she does not deserve to be with Harry Potter.

The fact that such idiocy exists both amuses and saddens me to no end.

#+begin_quote
  Terrible chapter. Your Harry is a jerk and your Daphne is a slut which actually is out of character for an Ice Queen. This chapter absolutely imploded your story.
#+end_quote

That's probably my favorite of the bunch. Because not only is it blatantly wrong, it doesn't even try to hide that it hasn't bothered to read or pay attention tot he rest of the story and is instead just assuming familiar tropes onto characters. She doesn't act like the asinine trope of an 'Ice Queen' for the entirety of the story. So it's obviously super out of character when she isn't one.

Some other favorites include:

#+begin_quote
  Where is emily? Will she remain dead? I think despite loving her husband she has a deeper bond with harry.
#+end_quote

No. She doesn't.

#+begin_quote
  Sigh...You seem to have lost sight of the plot, all characters here including Harry is not capable of a committed relationship. It seems most your fics always have an apathetic and sleazy Harry who cant keep it in his pants, and they don't seem to be interested in solving the case of some dead girl. Why go solving when you got partner to knock up and ohhh there are soooo many women to knock up for him and the list goes on and proves just how much of sleaze harry is.
#+end_quote

I don't think you know what knocked up means. Or, considering that he had sex with one person in that story, even really what you're talking about. But don't let the facts get in the way of your own insanity. Honestly, my adult Harry probably has less sex than he should.

Then my real personal favorite theme was while writing VP the amount of reviews that insisted 'oh they must be soul bonded!' when it was never, ever, mentioned in the story and I find the entire concept to be disgusting as all hell. And that consistently called Gabrielle Gabby. Which is never used in the entirety of the text. I have a hard time picturing a French girl ever going by Gabby when Elle is readily available as a diminutive.

*** A lot of fanfic readers have a weird complex about virginity and "purity". I don't know if it's because most readers are American and America does have a notoriously puritanical past, or if it's just a run of the mill obnoxious neckbeardism, but the second you imply that a character (and this happens way more often with birds than lads) is doing anything less than waiting for marriage, you get jumped on by some fundie thinking you've turned them into a slut.

It's pretty bizarre, especially because it's way more likely that English teens in the 90s would have been going at it like rabbits, or, at least, much more than they do in canon.

**** I lean toward more obnoxious neckbeardism because it always seems to be male readers who can't stand the thought of anyone other than the male mc having sex.

***** "Obnoxious neckbeardism" is a great phrase. I need to find a good time to use it, hehe.

#+end_quote

I think what's happening is that this person isn't seeing it as a trope. They're sufficiently aware of general HP fandom to know Daphne "ought" to be an 'Ice Queen', but not enough to remember that she's not canon. So they see a non-Ice-Queen Daphne as genuinely O.O.C., and as weird and bothersome as, I don't know, a non-mean Snape or a non-bookworm Hermione.
