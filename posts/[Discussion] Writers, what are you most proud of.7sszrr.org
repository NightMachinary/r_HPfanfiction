What aspect of your writing are you most proud of?

Is it a specific piece of dialogue, a characterization or just a specific turn of phrase that you think is great. Do you think it got the proper recognition?

An aspect of writing I find interesting is the difference in how much effort you put in to an area versus how much it ends up being important in the grand scheme of things. You can spend ages agonising over a specific word choice, and nobody would ever notice.

As I also think it's interesting to see what it is that writers find important, and how that contrasts with the audience's view on what is important. From reading reviews, most readers crave immediacy, or simplicity, or rather for Harry to behave in a way that simply isn't feasible. I'm curious to see what writers believe to be important.


** A specific characterization, I think. I like my main character. She's a lot of fun to write. And if my reviews are anything to go by, she's a lot of fun to read. I don't really think I've gotten one complaint about her. It's mostly been praise on how she feels real, and is hilarious. So that feels pretty cool.

Also, probably the amount of work I've put into my outline. Thing is like 15k words. I had to add a outline to my outline to make it easier to go through.

#+begin_quote
  She's been called many things --- sarcastic, inquisitive, often unapologetically so; quick-witted and resilient, and almost hopelessly reckless; young, small, but fierce and not easily controlled. Iris Potter doesn't do normal, and her fourth year at Hogwarts is evidence enough. Five unique tasks. Eventual Animagus, morally ambiguous, and reasonably powerful fem!Harry. No bashing.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

** Professionally, I'm most proud of my three articles in /Nature/ and eleven of my twelve in /Physical Review Letters/ (there's a story behind the last one), though I gather this is not what the OP is after.

In fiction writing, I've mainly used fanfiction as a test bed for styles, techniques, voices, and syntaxes. Sometimes what I tried [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/17/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][worked]], most times it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12261743/1/Fade-to-Black][didn't]]. But I did eventually gin up a style and voice that I can write comfortably and that's been mildly successful commercially.

**** So, said bookisms are the, ‘he muttered', ‘she whispered', ‘he sneered' things where you use a synonym for said. They work for emphasis but when every single thing a character says is emphasized it can get painful to read. ‘Said' is practically invisible to the reader but sneered/whispered/muttered are not.

Filtering is stuff like, ‘he noticed it was raining' instead of ‘it was raining' or ‘he thought it was hot' rather than ‘it was hot'. Assuming you're managing to control your POV character and not head hop between several in one scene, we know that it's that character's perceptions we're getting. You don't need to add distance between the reader and the story with the ‘he thought's. (UNLESS his perception is wrong. ‘Harry thought all was lost' works if we, as the reader, know he's wrong.)

Simplistic characterizations: Draco Malfoy is a dick because his father beat him and all his negative attributes can be laid at the feet of that one cause. And love, true love, can save him.

Soap Opera Structure: an endless stream of ‘and then and then and then' where the characters go through a series of adventures but there is no over arcing plot structure or build and resolution of conflict . More stuff just happens. Forever. Until you're bored writing it.

HTH :)

** What I'm most proud of is finding my own voice in my writing instead of mimicking others. My first two stories were extremely short while my third was all over the place and had no sense of direction. (I literally made it up as I went along and came out with 174K words.) When writing my fourth story, I was reading another at the same time and was influenced by it, so much so that I tried to copy the style the author had used into my own work which succeeded in some areas yet failed in the rest. I realized then that each story has a unique voice that needs to be unearthed and using others' work (even as a lick of inspiration) is the wrong way to go about it. Now on my fifth story, I'm happy to say it has found its own voice. All I have to do if finish it.

** I'm still proud of the relatively nonlinear structure I used in one story, because I wasn't at all sure I could pull it off. To my surprise, it turned out to be my most popular fic.

I'm also proud, if you can call it that, when readers tell me the story made them cry. Or laugh, which is rarer, because wit and humor are bloody difficult to write.

I'm also cautiously pleased with the results of writing Snape in different pairings: Harry, Albus, Aberforth, and Minerva (yes, yes, let the downvotes begin). From an authorial standpoint, it's interesting to see how his character arc changes depending on who he's paired with.

And of course I'm proud of certain bits of dialogue, certain moments of characterization, certain endings (beginnings, not so much) - all small but satisfying details, too minor and particular to make great claims for.

** I'm quite happy with the first 5 chapters of my most recent work. I'm still amazed that I completed the first story in the way I intended. There's a certain evil glee I feel, when reminded that I've 'spoiled' the character name for anyone else (other fics using the name often include a disclaimer that their work has nothing to do with mine). 'It seems I've made quite an impression.'

Mostly I'm proud that posting as much as I have has made writing everything easier. I'm not intimidated by larger projects or adding documentation for co-workers, because I know that I've done much more writing with one goal in mind, in the past.

** When people catch things like my referencing gary gygax in darkness ascendant or when this guy sent me a pm saying i made him rethink sttos and his/its attitudes regarding relationships because of my trek to the stars story and how I presented acceptance of poly relationships.
