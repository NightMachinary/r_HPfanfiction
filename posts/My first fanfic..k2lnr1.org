There are more similarities between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle than most people think. The voice in Harry's head only confirms that. A more competent Harry with Voldemort in his head comes to Hogwarts. Smart!Harry, Riddlesque!Harry, NoBashing!, NoSlash.

As you can tell by the summary, Harry pretty much has Voldemort in his head, and gets both advice and sometimes possessed by him. Harry pretty much has an alter ego due to this.

You've probably seen me promoting this in a lot of threads but thanks anyways.


** Amazing! How many times a week will you be able to update it?

** I know you haven't particularly asked but I'd like to give some constructive feedback and criticism here.

I feel like, from what I've read to far, you are capable of slowing the pace - but simply refuse to do so. My theory for why is because, really speaking, the first few chapters of these types of FanFiction can be boring/tedious to write. You have to set up everything, and highlight the differences in his upbringing and show what makes this different to canon and how it leads to the main ‘body' of your story - the part I estimate you can't wait to get round to writing. The first few chapters are, in essence, the boring part (before the Hogwarts fun!).

You seem aware of this and, to avoid spending hours writing a boring section of the story, just sped up the pace and made ‘cuts' that jerk the reader forward.

To be fair, that is one way you can go about it. But to be honest, reading it can be annoying. I can't get swept into the world as too much is happening with too little substance.

I know you may argue that it settles down after a bit, but even then that leaves two key issues.

1.) You have an interesting premise. To simply rush through these first chapters is /wasting/ */good/* material.

And 2.) Readers may give up sooner because of these chapters. Fewer people are going to see you at your best.

To fix this I suggest something drastic.

You see, those first few chapters are (basically) really pivotal moments, with bits of filler between.

Here's an idea you could use: Re-write the story, starting at a point /you/ find interesting. Maybe start midway through Harry's first year. Or maybe just before he meets Sirius. Or maybe just before the Tournament. Choose somewhere in Harry's earlier Hogwarts years that is recognisable to most HP fans. And change something. Make your Harry very clearly divergent from Canon. Continue the story you want to tell from there and use the important parts of the story you are currently rushing through as FLASHBACKS. Work it in as smoothly as possible.

It's a little complicated - you're gonna have to weave Harry's Backstory as deftly as you can into the main story you are trying to tell. But the results will produce a much stronger start.

*** That's actually what my original idea was supposed to be! When I wrote the first chapter, I started immediately in year 3 and skipped year 1 and 2. But the only problem is that the flashbacks I made were so horrible that my beta recommended to not do them. A more experienced author would've probably made it well, but it's my first actual writing and I couldn't do it. Do you recommend me time skipping this year and starting off with year 2 with flashbacks of year 1? I really appreciate the review and I do believe I rushed a bit xD! The plan is to finish his first year by giving him friends and a inner circle and skip to year 3 or 4 where Harry is clearly a different person with 2 years of Toms Influence and include a lot of flashbacks

**** Where in Year Three did you start? And how did you go about incorporating flashbacks into the story? Please give details because I promise you that it will be less the content of the flashbacks that led to them falling flat and more where you put them.

Remember that you can put these bits of information into a wide variety of places in the story. You could do quite a few chapters before actually injecting a flashback. Give yourself time to work it in. Maybe use “Occlumency Training” as a guise for it.

Skipping year one and two sounds like a smart idea. Those years are some of the hardest to write because you have to make an engaging story for teens and adults using incompetent kids.

Also keep in mind that you aren't really changing much about how the world works or the magic (just adding to it) and so most of the exposition in the first two books are unnecessary. So skipping them kinda makes sense! Even if you have something planned for Harry during those two years, simply show the effects of those events and have other characters reference them (this builds interest).

I.e - Let's say you want the meeting between Quirrelmort and Harry do go down differently; just have other characters (including the Voldemort in Harry's head) reference what happened in conversation (try to work it in seamlessly).

You don't have to info dump either! As said before, I imagine you have a story you want to tell. Focus on it and drip these important bits of information in slowly and where they naturally come in to play.

A natural transition makes things more bearable, even if your flashback writing isn't /the best/.

***** Honestly this is the best advice I've received since starting the story, I'm just confused how to incorporate details of the Quirrell interaction and Chmaber of Secrets into my story without just glossing over them

****** Well, I can't give details because you are the author and only you know what you want to happen, haha! But, what I can say is that I would suggest having a strong focus on the main story you want to tell, and try and write it in such a way that it is plausible for other characters to bring up the past.

I.e: Let's just say (probably totally wrong here) that you want to make it so that Harry - during his third year - learns a certain type of magic. Maybe he is caught by a friend, or future love interest, or even by an enemy. Maybe that person asks why he is learning it.

Cue mini-flashback (a droplet of info as opposed to a a whole glass full).

Then Harry can either lie, tell the truth, or say something in between a lie and a truth (a half-truth, if you will).

This serves to drip information into the story that the reader wants to know, and it shows something about who Harry is.

If you chose a “friend” discover him then it could show that Harry is completely willing to lie to a friend without really feeling much remorse (which is different to canon Harry).

If you chose an “enemy” and Harry uses /force/ to ensure their silence, then that shows ruthlessness.

So many possibilities. Just keep a strong focus on your story, and tweak parts ever so slightly to justify a full flashback or mini flashback. Then use the moment after to build Harry's character. If you want to, of course.

I was only trying to suggest how you could strengthen your start.
