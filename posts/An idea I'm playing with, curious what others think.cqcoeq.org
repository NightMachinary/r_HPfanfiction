I've been contemplating writing a pilot (for fun) for a first episode of Harry Potter, but in an alternate universe where we follow 4 main characters 1 for each house.

This isnt in order of how it would go exactly or who it would show first but

It would follow Hermione, show her with her Muggle family, dentist parents and whatnot, show Professor Mcgonagall come to tell her she is a wizard and accepted into Hogwart, show her a spell or two, Hermione would go to Hogwarts and be sorted into Ravenclaw after 5 minutes.

It would follow Ron, show him with his brothers, maybe have all of them home for the summer and show how they are/were all gryffindor and how much it means to the family, have the owls arrive saying hes accepted, maybe have him practice quidditch with his brothers and get beat on by the twins, when he gets to Hogwarts the hat starts to say Gryiff-, but pauses to sort him into Hufflepuff and he sits frozen on the stool, until the teacher finally helps him up and walks him to his table.

I will follow Harry, show a very similar beginning for him, Hagrid brings his letter, the difference I am debating is do I sort him into Slytherin and have him be our Slytherin lead or keep him as Gryffindor, and have him still not befriend the main that is in Slytherin but still befriends Ron and Hermione, using Tunnels Fred and/or George showed them to meet in private?

If I have Harry in Gryffindor I'd follow Draco, show his parents detest to Gryffindor and how Draco better be a slytherin, maybe make them lenient on Ravenclaw, since they are supposedly rivals to Hufflepuff who accept them all. Show Dobby, his father maybe trips him or something and Draco laughs and pushes dobby over when he gets up (showing the mimicry of his father, I may go about it some other way), he'd go to Hogwarts and be sorted into Slytherin. ---------------------------or--------------------------------

If I have Harry is Slytherin I'd follow Neville, show his life with his grandmother, maybe her trying to teach him what she says is a basic spell (have it something they learn year 3) and Nevile fails, she critisizes him harshly comparing him to his parents, after she leaves he keeps practicing, not getting it but not giving up, when he gets to Hogwarts he is sorted into Gryffindor, if I went with the other way with Harry in Gryffindor still and Draco as a main in Slytherin I'd then debate and see who I prefer Nevile being friends with Harry or Ron, and have him as one of their sides when they have a fight together later on.

I'm curious what other think would be a better direction to go? If anyone has any suggestions to add or ideas to this?

I've just been thinking lately the Harry potter books would have been better as a TV show but we already got the story, why not give it a twist and go with the unoriginal idea of having the main 3 in different houses, it would change parts of the story but I'm sure their are creative ways around it, it would also add a lot to be able to see the other houses and more students around the school


** do 5 characters, draco and neville. have harry and draco enemies whether both in slytherin or Harry a Gryff

*** I'm thinking Neville will work best as a side character, trying to follow 5 would be to much especially just the first episode when trying to show Harry and Hermione learn they are wizards, everyone go get their school stuff and then be sorted at Hogwarts.

With just the 4 characters it may feel like it is jumping around too much and it will be difficult to balance

I have been considering having Neville be a hufflepuff like he wants, and be Ron's friend, he would help Ron accept being a hufflepuff aswell as in book 4 when he is fighting with Harry. He would be a side character until then who just has shit happen to him.

***** Neville would just be a side character for the beginning and later on we'd see his grandmother and how she treats him and maybe see flash backs when he tells Ron about his childhood scared hed was a squib
