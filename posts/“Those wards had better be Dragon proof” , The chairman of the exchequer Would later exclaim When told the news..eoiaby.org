Leonard Spencer-Moon, The current Minister of Magic Slumped down in his chair, 6million.... 6 million..: Winston had said. My God Churchill had to have gone mad... It was impossible to kill 6 million men in just a few months ... Grindelwald had killed thousands Magical and Muggles alike, But by God At least the magical war had an end in sight. Winston had told him The Americans refused to give them aid yet again. The French ministry had fallen Just last week, It's Muggle counterpart was hanging by a thread. Merlin, He would have to speak with Seraphina, They could not turn that mad Muggle back alone , He was coming for Britain. Winston and he would need to speak to George, The king was the only man that the goblins listen to these days, Monarchy spoke to Monarchy There wasn't much as he could say, King George would have to convince them To erect wards Along the shore, They would need to guard the beaches ... and the skies ... Oh sweet Merlin! He thought Grindelwald having the dragons was bad. Winston had told him ,the Mad Muggle had bombs Enough to level a city, This just could not stand. He would need to have the statue of secrecy examines once again. The Muggles were at war On a global scale. They had to help them do something, The Nazis were not kind The wizards Not alone with Grindelwald According to reports.

Later that day in the same very room:

Leonard Swore loudly, While Winston just laughed The old bulldog had a talent for gallows humor Leonard would later say. The King has gone rogue before they could even meet. He had torn the goblin treaty in half, In front of King Ragnarok. George had offered to renegotiate, One king to another , The terms were clear, The goblins would ward the kingdom From magical threats But not bombs or reindeer( It took Winston a decade to get George to explain that one). In exchange , The king gave them freedom to travel and trade, He paid The goblin's price To keep Britain safe, King George Negotiating on The behalf of the magical world , deregulated the banks In order to preserve their world. A Muggle the king might be, But he was still the Sovereign, On this matter Leopold and Winston would have to bend the knee.

Leopold would have to inform The head of magical law-enforcement Charlus Potter About the change , And Merlin help him, When Dorea found out , She had to work with the goblin for crying out loud, Witch was his chairman of the exchequer. He would just hide behind Charlus When they broke the news. She wouldn't bombarda He husband Leopold had been sure. Oh how Misplaced his hopes had been.

Dorea Black/Potter Let out a wave of magic that shut the room , Leopold finally got the courage to tell her the news, Charlis and he wisely hidden under a table , when his wife's rage Caught a second wind, Lightning bolt , explosion, his Chandelier would never be the same again.

Dorea Potter new Black , What is a pourable tycoon the size of a witch exclaimed as she calmed down, “ Those wards had better be Dragon proof! ” ,

Edit: Before you don't put me into Oblivion, Here is a bit of historical context. King George was the king of England during World War II, The goblins don't like wizards, So for the purposes of this prompt the reigning sovereign of the UK Has the negotiating power and political authority to negotiate treaties with different species. King Ragnarok distrusts ministers But respects a fellow King. I got the name for the Minister of Magic during World War II off the Wizarding world of Harry Potter website
