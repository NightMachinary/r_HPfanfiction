Sorry, I'm terrible with dates. I want to set a fic the year before Ginny conceived James, but I cant for the life of me figure out what year that would be or how old Harry and Ginny would be. Help


** James was born between 2002 and 2005. So it'd be Harry & Ginny's mid 20s.

**** That's not vague.

We know that Harry is 17 in book 7 and the epilgoue is 19 years later making him 36. James is not in his first year in the Epilogue, so he's older than 11. If he's 12, Harry had him at 24, Ginny 23. If he's 13, 23-22.

We don't know the exact year and a lot of it depends on how much older he is than Albus. Which we do not know. We know that Albus is 11 in 2017, so Albus was born in 2006, when Harry was 25. I think it is a fair assumption that James is somewhere between 1-3 years older than him. Putting him somewhere between 2003-2005.

***** I just figured out why i was getting confused, as James gets older Harry and Ginny get younger for some reason I had that upside-down.

****** Haha I can see that getting strange. It was a bit odd to type out as well. But numbers usually confuse me anyway.

***** Given his childish nature in the Epilogue, I find it extremely doubtful he is older than 13, and probably only 12. If I had to guess James and Albus are 1 year apart in age.

** Albus's birth has be between September 2005 and August 2006, because he's starting his first year in the epilogue. I always figure James was born in sometime after September 2004, Albus after September 2005, Lily after September 2007.

In other words, when Albus is a 6th year, James will be a 7th year and Lily will be a 4th year. The younger that James is, the more time Ginny had to play quidditch before she got pregnant.

If James was born between September 2004 and August 2005, Ginny would stop playing for the Harpies when she was 23-24.
