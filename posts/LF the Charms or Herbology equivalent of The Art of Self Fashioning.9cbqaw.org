I fell in love with the magical theory behind this fic, and the growing mentor ship with Minerva. Mostly, it was interesting seeing the use of obscure characters, as well as what I think was somewhat in character actions for everyone (besides Harry, who lets face it was a sociopath and the Dursleys probably didn't have that much to do with it. Who knew having a peice of a Dark Lord's soul in him made him more compassionate?)

I'd love to see Harry have that kind of mentor ship with Flitwick, or Sprout if you know of any suggestions


** Not to the same degree as Art of Self-Fashioning and not Harry but an OC replacing Hermione, but linkffn(The Brightest Witch in the Darkest House) has Flitwick mentoring Valeria on her casting and has some really great interactions between the two

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.

#+begin_quote
  Harriet Potter's third year masquerading as a pureblood boy promises to be even more complicated than the last two. All she wants is to get through her studies unimpeded, but with pureblood politics, ancient artifacts, and adolescent hormones getting in the way... well, at least she's up to the challenge. Alanna the Lioness take on HP, book three.

  Harriet Potter is back for a fourth year of quietly masquerading as her pureblooded cousin in order to pursue her dream. There are those in the Wizarding World who refuse to see her fade into the background, however, and when the forces she's been ignoring conspire to bring her to the fore, it will take everything she has to see her artifice through. Alanna the Lioness take on HP4.

** The arithmacer had this for arithmancy. Note it was one of the earlier fics I've read, before I had read enough to really accurately judge the quality of fics so I can't really say if it is good or not. I did enjoy reading it at the time. I haven't read the sequel covering years 5-7 yet.
