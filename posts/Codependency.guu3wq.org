None know whom of the siblings is older, even the siblings themselves, for one could not exist without the other. Ages apart, one brought the other into the world yet the opposite also rings true.

Neither know who came first, only that they each brought the other. For without Life, there could not be Death and without Death there is no Life. Ageless beings outside time, they do not know for they have existed since the dawn of Magic. Yet born they were, each to a woman who loved them, orphaned too young and pressed to be what others wanted.

This is the story of the Birth of Life, and the Formation of Death. This is the story of the Great Wars and the Broken Souls.

It is the story of two Brothers in Burden, polar opposites yet dependent on the very existence of the other. Brothers fighting, ages apart, against one another, unknowing of their bond, cursing the other with each breath yet unable to breathe until the Dance is done.

And it is how, though born to different mothers, despite being the very cause of the others demise, two enemies become brothers and Life learns of Death.


** Also known as: I went on a binge of really good fanfics with life/death as themes and my brain refused to let go - not meant to be slash, though I bet some of you could probably write it in a way that would work.

Have fun playing in the Harry Potter Sandbox
