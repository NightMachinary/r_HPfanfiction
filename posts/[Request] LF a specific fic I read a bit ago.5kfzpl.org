It was decently long definitely over 40k. Harry ran away when he was quite young about 10, and had never been introduced to the magical world. He ends up being taken in by a prostitute and becomes one himself when he is older. The story itself starts when he is 16 or 17 and living on his own at that point. He ends up finding Snape near death in an alley because of the Deatheaters and uses wandless magic to heal him. Snape ends up staying with Harry until he is healed and they eventually end up in a relationship. Also all during this time Dumbledore and Co. are trying to find Harry. I don't remember it being explicit, but I do think it was M rated and on ff.net. Thank you all very much for your time! I really appreciate it!
