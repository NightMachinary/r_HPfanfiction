In OotP Harry meets Grawp and really Harry never really interacts with him. Is there a fic out there where Harry actually interacts with him? Or does as Hagrid asks and tries to talk with him?


** For a second I thought this was a pairing request. I try not to judge, but I admit I was judging.

*** This is not a pairing request. I'm just looking for a fic where Harry associates himself with Grawp. Like an in depth look at the giant civilization.

Please for the love of all that is holy don't recommend any slash or weird Harry/Grawp romance.

I really wish there was a way I could edit my title post.

**** Oh I know that it isn't. Just my initial thought when I saw your title before clicking it.

** *The good news:* There probably is at least one fic where Harry actually interacts with Grawp.

*The bad news:* It's probably a Grawry 'ship.

*** That brings up an interesting question. Would Harry have to use a shrinking charm on Grawp or are giants specially equipped to interact with smaller people? Because we only ever hear about unions with female giants.

**** Not judging, or anything, but you find a question about the mechanics of Harry copulating with a giant interesting? o_O

Anyway, there are other options:

1. Harry could be the top in the relationship.
2. Madame Pomfrey might discover that even after all her years treating Hogwarts students, there still exist things that can surprise her.

** There's a next gen fic where they spend more time with grawp, although it's not a major part of the fic. I'm pretty sure it's James potter and the hall of elder's crossing or one of the sequels (google for it), but it honestly may be linkffn(albus potter and the global revelation) or one of those sequels.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.

*** Why would you ever bother reading something like that? The writing must of been terrible, and that isn't even mentioning the pairing.
