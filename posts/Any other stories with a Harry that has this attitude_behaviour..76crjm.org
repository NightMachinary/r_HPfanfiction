Edit: with a comment from Maxxie i'll explain what I want. What i'm looking for is a very laid back Harry who is powerful. I want any sugggested story to be very light, can be cracky, but not one of the serious, dark, edgy stories out there.


** When looking for something similar to a certain story, it's best to provided your own description of what you're looking for. Otherwise only people who have read the story you're referencing know what you're looking for.

Even if if they've read it, they don't know specifically what aspects of it you liked most and what precisely you're looking for.
