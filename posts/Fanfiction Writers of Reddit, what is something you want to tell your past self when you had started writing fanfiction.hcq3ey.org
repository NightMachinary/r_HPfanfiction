“I know you hate outlines with a passion. I do not care. Outline your fics if you ever want them to be finished!

I wrote a fic back in, oh, 2011. I posted most of it, then rediscovered the fic a few months ago. Realized that I had started posting it. Realized that it wasn't finished on FFN... and that I totally had finished it.

So yeah. Post all the things.

(Not a HP fic - was a tidy-up fic for the cliffhangers after Harry Dresden/Ghost Story.)

** People don't get over stuff in 3 days times or less. Just had an "a few weeks later", if you don't want to bother with the immediate effect of a trauma, but don't have your character be fine and cool from things highly traumatics the day after the incident.

Do not start publishing until you have finished your story. I know you're impatient to have reviews and such, but it's better to wait, and be sure you will finish the story than to publish and never finish it. In 13 years, you will have people asking for a continuation. And you won't even remember where you even wanted to go. You won't even remember half of your O.Cs. And each new review asking for more will make you feel guilty.

Speaking of that. try to figure out where your story end before anything else. You've got way too many stories that end awkwardly or continued way past its own story.

One-shot are good and perfect for that little slice-of-life scene you want to write. You don't need to force yourself to create a whole story just to include this slice-of-life.

*** Yeah I'd say even if it's a really loooong fic, get at least half the fic + the end before starting to publish.

In Neil Gaiman's Masterclass teaser, he mentions that /editing/ is the process of making it look like you knew what you were doing from the beginning, and ever since I heard that I've noticed a distinct improvement in my writing, for two big reasons:

- Every chapter is now constructed with the deliberate intent of getting to the next chapter and making some kind of progress toward the end.

- I wait longer to release chapters so that I'm more confident I won't have to go back to fix something that wasn't going to work out.

I've been writing for a long time, but just in the last year that wee bit of advice has really stuck with me and made a difference.

**** I wrote myself in quite a few corners before I learnt this lessons. It's when I started to write for a fandom with no magic, no sci-fi, no supernatural element at all that I finally stopped publishing before having a very good handle on my story, a serious outline and the end.

Since you can't go back to change things around, you had to find a way to get out of that corner, without contradictions. Harry Potter, you can always create new spell, a creature, some wizarding-world weird law, some obscure bit of magic that no one heard about before, to resolve the dead-end you write yourself into. It can be far-fertched, but it's the kind of things readers forgive if your story is good enough otherwise.

When you write a fiction in the real world, you do not have those tools. And it becomes incredibily hard to find a solution that do not contradict everything you wrote before.

And the added bonus to editing a finished story and then publishing it, instead of publishing as-you-go, is adding foreshadowing here and there in the first few chapters for stuff you actually come up on a whim as you wrote chapter 40.

** Chill out with the reading until 2 am. Your 12. Focus on school, while you may hate it. Chill with your friends more and stop being a cocky little shit.

Also you get rejected by multiple girls, and the in time you get one you get cheated on so dint write a sob story where Hermione dumps Ron and he commits suicide...

Dont get into weed either.

Learn to fight better so when you fight certain people you can win without injuries.

Just in general relax, it's not you v the world even though it seems that way and dont forget who you are.

Dont give up on your stories just yet, and make your own account don't share with our cousin.

Oh and stop daydreaming, you eventually start to hate yourself so stop thinking about being another person. Later on you will realise the shit that happens to you makes you a better person, and while it fucking hurts getting past the pain, the pressure is a win. Your not going to get your crush, some of your friends are gonna leave you.

I cant promise it's good right now, m and I cant promise it will get better. But I can promise your creative with your ideas so write for yourself.

Plan your stories, not make the story as you go and dont get into too much trouble.

** "Look, your ideas are solid, but there's no need to introduce clichéd tropes just to subvert them later. You can just defy them from the get go. It's for the better if you do, read, as you won't risk losing viewers for being clichéd."

I learned that lesson quickly, but I still cringe when I read some of my earlier chapters. I'd also probably give my past self some outlines, as I am a chronic nonplanner. I might also take the chance to tell my past self that Windows is gonna try her laptop's graphics card with its May update and she should really switch to Linux before that becomes an issue...
