I've already read Roundabout Destiny[linkffn(8311387)] and Fair fortune[linkffn(11376508)]. I am looking for similar fics, preferably well written. I am planning on writing something similar and hoping that I manage something new,

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.

**** There were some elements of this story i really liked. It had a lot of potential. I just wish it had more focus. The describing every single one of like 49 different phoenix chicks and their coloring and personality, every room of every house that one character built for another, the romances of minor characters, etc. took away from the actual plot.

I also wish that the "present" Harry from the timeline of the canon books bits hadn't been dropped ~1/3 through. That was a really interesting conceit, and I would have liked to see the "present" timeline in flux more. I also would have liked to see Hermione Black's timeline catch up to the timeline of the first chapter.

** Would it be reincarnation if born into a time before she existed? Maybe, preincarnation?

*** well reincarnation just means old soul new body, the presumption is that time will always only move forward. But i suppose a kind of backward-rebirth(?) would still mean reincarnation.

**** I've been thinking about this more, and I think I got it.

So, let's say reincarnation is a thing. The current reincarnation would be the 'incarnation.' The next incarnation would be a reincarnation, and the previous lives would be the preincarnations.

Not technically "reincarnation" but close enough that I think you'll like it. Hermione POV, Hr/Sirius (with Remus thrown in cause why not) extreme mature rating.
