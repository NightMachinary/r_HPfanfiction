Fics where the Knight Bus doesn't come when Harry sees Sirius in his dog form and Sirius gets a chance to clear things up and explain.


** IMO, about 90% of the purpose of Harry Potter fanfiction is to save Sirius Black. I'm literally shocked that I've never seen this and I look forward to the responses.

Remindme! ONE DAY

for anyone that's looking for a fic where Harry lives with Sirius, linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7) is a fic where Sirius escapes from Azkaban early (iirc Harry is eight or nine) and Harry lives with him. It's pretty good, but very long (and the current sequel, which is Harry's third year) is still ongoing.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  The pride of a Slytherin is in his resource and cunning, and in the serpent's discerning gaze. Slytherin!Harry, assorted ships. Heavy violence. No Lord Potter, no creature inheritance, no bashing - AU plots (no Riddle diary, no Department of Mysteries, no manipulative!Dumbledore, no Horcruxes). Character-focused and plot-heavy. Cross-posted to Ao3. POV between HP and SS.

  It was still called the "Noble and Most Ancient House of Black", though it had been years since any of the Blacks that approved of that name had lived there. Sirius Black would be a disappointment to his parents, but Harry Potter - the home's other resident - was a credit to his. Both were proud of that. Sequel to "Innocent", "Initiate" and "Identity".
