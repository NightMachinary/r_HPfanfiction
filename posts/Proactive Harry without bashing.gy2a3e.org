Not Indy Harry. But something like gof and ootp where he actively prepares himself and others for the threat without bashing anyone No fem Harry no hinny no slash(involving Harry, other characters are fine)


** I thing a marauder's plan should kinda maybe fit your bill. Harry isn't being proactive inherently. But it's a good "harry got his head together" fic.

Sirius decides to stay in England after escaping Hogwarts and makes protecting Harry his priority. AU GOF.

​

Another Fic I think would qualify may is Dubledore's Army. There is some dumbledore bashing in the start. But it ends. Personally I loved the fic when I read it. In retrospect it's a little mary sue. But it fits the bill. Its a pretty long fic with a completed sequel.

** I'm not sure whether you'd consider Nightmares of Futures Past to be Indy Harry. He's at arm's length from Dumbledore, but he certainly works closely with his friends to get them ready; that's the biggest focus of the story.

The only character who you could really say is bashed would be Professor Snape, who doesn't have any of his book 7 redemption; he's even willing to use the term "mudblood". Draco is depicted harshly too, but it's also clear that there's more going on with him including someone deliberately drugging him in second year to make him more unstable.

** Fair warning; I'm not a huge fan of this story. In fact, I've never read the entire thing (and tagged it as 'wanky' on pinboard). But I recognize that the reason is that it has a lot of those smaller elements and tropes that I don't like. I don't think there are any pairings, but as I stated I've never gotten to the end of it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry recognized the need for the DA in his first year rather than his fifth. With a group of powerful friends, unexpected allies, and the planning to overcome age old enemies and meddling Headmasters as well, can these students traverse the dangerous halls of Hogwarts and the world outside of them? Can they defeat the Dark Lord and his followers while fighting for communal reform?
