We know he was the first creator of the horcrux and he had at least two (?). However, what if they aren't destroyed? What if Herpo is still around and someone seeks him out like Pettigrew sought out Voldemort? After that Herpo comes back and becomes the main villain of the story. I've only seen it done once and he was almost a side villain.


** Like every self-respecting lich he has sequestered himself in his crypt and gets a tad annoyed if you disturb his research.

Alternatively, he's in Las Vegas, enjoying what the 21st Century has to offer to someone who grew up when high life on a Saturday night was watching two guy hit each other with rusty sticks.

  Herpo the Foul, basilisk breeder of yore, winds up unconscious and nibbled by gnomes behind the Burrow. Ginny really finds Parselmouths in the oddest places, doesn't she?

** Hmm I don't know if really this matches what you're looking for, it's post war and more of a Ron fic, but linkffn(7523798) has Herpo the Foul showing up.
