There's a game of truth or dare involved. Basically Harry, Hermione, Ron and I guess even the twins break into Voldermort's lair. Then they decide to play Truth or Dare for some reasons. Draco was there too.


** is it linkffn(6045275)? But the Weasley twins aren't there in that. Instead, it has Ginny.
