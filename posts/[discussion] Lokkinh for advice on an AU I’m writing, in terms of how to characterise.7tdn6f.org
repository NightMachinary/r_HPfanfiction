So my AU essentially consists of the fact students start Hogwarts at 13 instead of 11 and then continue on for their seven years of education. I haven't really given much thought to a reason behind this change, but either way, that's the concept. My issue is in how to characterise slytherins. Since I placed Harry in Slytherin, because after two more years at the Dursleys, I feel their negative influence would have forced Harry to continue feeding his ambition and self-preservation, I am now struggling in how I should characterise the Slytherins.

They have been separated from muggle-borns for an extra two years, something which is sure to deepen the divide between the two groups and yet, the muggle-borns' having spent two more years in the muggle world will surely increase muggle influence in Wizarding society. I don't want to simply vilify the Slytherins, it is my house after all, but I also want to stay relatively close to their canon personalities. Essentially, I want to at least remain within the realm of the possible instead of treating every Slytherin like some misunderstood bad-boy with heart of gold.

What's your advice? Should the Slytherins act antagonistic towards Harry, will they be upfront in their hatred of muggle-borns, or has an increased understanding of muggle-culture somehow lessened the amount of pure-blood extremism?


** Saying that you haven't really given much thought to why the students start at 13 rather than 11 indicates to me that maybe you should. I think figuring that out and getting a solid rationale behind that will help you with your characterization question.

How are children educated pre-Hogwarts in your AU? Homeschooled? Do they go to regular school? Perhaps the extra two years is to give magical children more contact with the "outside" world and a greater understanding of Muggle society. What do the pureblood families think of that? Is this a recent change or has it always been this way? Also, by making 13 the minimum age, you're going to have a bunch of 20 and 21-year-olds running around Hogwarts. How are you going to handle that? They will be adults, not children. Is the Wizarding age of majority still 17? What's to keep them in school after that?

I think you're doing a little bit of cart before the horse here. Figure out how this seemingly minor change will affect your AU and personalities of the students and then I think you'll have an easier time figuring out your characterizations. Good luck in your writing!

*** I'll admit I haven't thought this out at all, but I've never been one for planning things out, otherwise I never get to them, constantly rethinking everything I've planned. I tend to be fairly decent at writing without a plan so I guess that's why I'm doing it. Though I have thought some things through, so it's not like everything is up in the air.

In terms of education first, magical children are homeschooled as usual prior to their entering Hogwarts. I do not think any pureblood, by this I do mean families which wouldn't be labelled as ‘blood-traitors', would consent to sending their child to muggle school and then, it would create too many risks for the exposure of magic to the rest of the world. So yeah, no greater understanding of the mugglel world.

In terms of age, if they all enter at thirteen, the maximum age they'll be is twenty. The way I see it, the OWLs work as a first phase of exams after which students can choose to leave Hogwarts, since they'll be seventeen at the time. The NEWTs would then be dedicated to more specialised fields of study, making Hogwarts double as a high school and a bit of a university/college since there isn't a centralised system for higher learning in the magical world.

So I guess I've though got these aspects out, it's really only when and why they decided to rule for Hogwarts begging at thirteen that I haven't decided yet. Typical of me not to think of the reasons behind the primary driving point of a plot..I guess when I think that out I'll manage to write more, I'm just feeling particularly stumped today, thanks for the advice though.

**** I like the idea you have about the OWLs and the NEWTs. Regarding max age of 20, keep in mind that Hermione was 12 shortly after the start, so her and others would be 21, but that's more of a minor nitpick.

I'm a seat of the pants writer, too, so I get you about the planning. Just make sure you're concrete on the core idea and you'll be all right.

** I would say that slytherins don't hate muggleborns perse. They just have disdain for them. And that disdain would be about the same.

In canon while there being almost no purebloods left in the wizarding world muggleborns seemed to have next to no influance on society. Why would there be more

*** I'd argue from a different point of view. A lot of the kids who grew up hearing that the muggleborns are ruining everything and support that view, think that without them the magical world would be better off. So they have an ambition, just a genocidal one. And ambitious kids end up in Slytherin.

#+end_quote

Half of them saw nothing wrong with genocide. If you want to stay close to canon characterization you have to accept that half of them are scum, Malfoy and Snape included. Good people do not wish for a mass murdering war criminal to return or join his cause to cleanse an ethnic group from their society.

Rowling is being contradictory when she says that not all Slytherins are evil because the only canon example of a truly good Slytherin we get is Andromeda Tonks.

*** I'll argue against that. I think most of the Slytherins are selfish cowards who have no idea what they're talking about, but that doesn't make them bad people. I mean look at Malfoy, he acts like a dick throughout the entire series. Yes, he's entitled and arrogant, but once the dark Lord comes back, he realises the beliefs he was raised on have been wrong and he realises the dark lord isn't actually all that great. However, it's now too late to back out, he's a death-eater already, if he disobeys or runs away, his family will be killed.

I'm not saying that Malfoy is some saint, I'm saying he's been raised in a certain way and he doesn't make much effort to change his way of thinking. He's close minded and foolish, he's not evil. He's been convinced he's fighting for his way of life, why shouldn't he? He doesn't wish to ‘cleanse an ethnic group', he's been convinced he does, but when he sees what that means, he realises he's in the wrong and that it's not all that it was brought up to be.

Perhaps I'm being too soft, but it's incredibly hard to reject something you've been raised to believe for your entire life. You can't expect every person in the world to give up everything they have just to fight for what's right, that's why the people that do are heroes.

So I don't think Rowling is contradictory in saying not all Slytherins are evil. The whole point is that there isn't a black and white good and evil. Slytherins are cowardly and selfish, but I don't consider that bad in its own right. By the time most of Harry's Slytherin classmates actually realise how horrible Voldemort is, it's much too late for them to back out. You might argue that they shouldn't follow a murdere in the first place, but I'm sure they've been told of the evils of the other side, Aurors were allowed use of the unforgiveables after all, will pureblood fanatics not tell their children of how the aurors and the order destroyed families on the dark side, telling their children the death eaters killed in self defence, seeking vengeance for their fellows?

**** You see him only because you want to. To be honest, I'm an American and I don't see him at all. Rowling is another one who seems obsessed with the Donald. I'm not entirely sure why as she loathes the man but it's rather concerning that she stoops down to his level to do battle with him. For example, how many times is she going to call him out via Twitter? Ignoring the fact that she's leading the social media charge in the downfall of the Millennials, what difference does she think she's making?
