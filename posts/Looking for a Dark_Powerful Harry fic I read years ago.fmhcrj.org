:END:
I posted this on Tip of my Tongue and someone suggested I try here as well. I'll just copy/paste exactly what I put there and hope y'all can help me out:

I read one really good fanfiction around ten-ish years ago, but never got to the ending (I stopped reading while it was still in progress, probably because I got too busy and then ended up just forgetting). It was on fanfiction.net, though I don't know if the author cross-posted to any other sites.

It took place after Order of the Phoenix, iirc (like, the summer immediately after). I seem to remember that the catalyst for the plot was Harry trying to deal with Sirius' death, but I may be mixing that up with any of the other billions of fics about that. I don't remember it including anything about Slughorn, Snape-as-the-Half-Blood-Prince, or Malfoy having to sneak Death Eaters into Hogwarts, so I'm fairly certain is was started before HBP came out (or I suppose the author could have simply decided to go a different direction and just make it non-canon).

The basic premise is that Harry becomes disillusioned with Dumbledore and the whole Order/Light side and ends up finding his way to Knockturn Alley (or maybe rents a room at the Leaky Cauldron and just goes to Knockturn Alley from there every day), where he uses some sort of disguise to alter his appearance (maybe potions, maybe just muggle techniques of hiding the scar and other major feature; it's been a long time, I don't remember) so no one can tell who he is (it /is/ good enough to fool people who actually know Harry, too). He uses a false name, and I'm pretty sure it's something with the same initials but more “Magicy”-sounding, like Hephaestus Peverell or something like that.

He ends up getting a job as an apprentice (or pretending to be an apprentice) to a crotchety old potions master who owns an apothecary/potion shop there (fairly certain he knew immediately who Harry was and either played dumb while secretly helping him for a while or outright admitted he knew and actively helped him hide).

A lot of the details are foggy and/or probably mixed with other Dark/Powerful Harry fics I've read over the years, but there's a few that I definitely know happened in this one:

At one point early into his “apprenticeship” the potions master has Harry put away a new shipment of ingredients in the basement, which ends up helping Harry learn a lot more about potions simply because all the shelves are organized by use/function (as opposed to alphabetical or something else like that), and the potions master refuses to help him figure out where anything goes (and, iirc, hands him a book about potions ingredients or something like that). So, he has to learn what each ingredient is used for so he can figure out where to put it. It takes him pretty much all day, but he does it.

At some point, he ends up socializing with Draco (as his alter-ego, of course; Draco has no idea that he's Harry) and winds up becoming friends with him. When he's invited to Draco's birthday party, he has some trouble figuring out what to get him for a gift at first but remembers back in CoS when he was hiding after first messing up the Floo Powder and overheard Draco's father refusing to get him a Hand of Glory. Harry gets him one and Draco is stoked.

He learns a lot of Dark magic and Dark customs from Draco and his father, which are portrayed by them not so much as the evil that the Light side always views/explains it to be but as more of a natural and free magic (as opposed to the regiment and order of Light magic and customs). He even gets lessons alongside all the other Dark families' children, and develops friendships with several of them as well.

At some point during the summer, Hermione's house is attacked by Voldemort/death eaters. Harry gets her away, but her parents are killed. She stays with him for a while and acts as a go-between for him and Dumbledore/the Order (whom he refuses to see or talk to or even tell where he is). When he becomes worried about his lack of occlumency skills giving away his new Dark leanings to Dumbledore once he returns to school, Hermione comes up with a plan of telling the Order that Harry has become anxious and paranoid about Voldemort gaining access to his dreams and not trusting Occlumency to stop him (or something similar) to get them to come up with a solution he can use. Snape is in the meeting with them that she calls and volunteers to make a potion that works to block Legilimency, but warns that it is Dark magic and uses some sort of blood magic as part of it, and everyone (not realizing that Harry has gone Dark) worry that the precious and innocent Light Harry will refuse to take it if he knows it's Dark and end up exposing himself to Voldemort's mindreading. They agree to have Snape make the potion for Harry and just not tell him what exactly it is (though Hermione does tell him anyway, since she knows he won't care either way anymore).

When Harry has to go back to school, the potions master comes up with the excuse of him becoming a journeyman potion maker and leaving to do that as the reason to give all the regulars and friends as to why he's going to be gone from the store (since he worries that if he vanishes at the same time that school starts, someone might put two and two together and figure out he's a student, and maybe that he's Harry Potter). He helps Harry study for the journeyman's exam, and one piece of advice he gives is to act insulted/angry if asked a question he doesn't know the answer to (something like “X? You're asking me about X?! You think I don't know what X does when put into a potion?!!”).

That's pretty much all I remember for sure. I would love to find this one again and re-read it (and hopefully finish it this time), if anyone can point me in the right direction!


** This sounds very much like "Out of the Night" by Raining Ink.

*** Holy shit that's it! Thank you so much!

(Apparently it's permanently abandoned... that sucks, but at least I can catch up to what they did write)
