:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember this was a fic heavily centered around blood magic. Harry would put drops of blood on his wand to strengthen the power of his spells. It would then consume the drops of blood and Harry would have to put more to continue to utilize the power boost. I believe that there was also the use of blood to draw blood runes.

What I am less sure about:

I'm pretty sure he used blood runes to get into the Triwizard tournament and someone (Moody?) was watching him. I think Harry fainted from the blood loss and Moody only observed to make sure Harry managed to get in.

What I am positive:

Not Cadmean victory (blood magic in that is really a misnomer). It is not a Second Chance at Life.

Thanks for any responses!

  Shortly before dying, Merope Gaunt gave birth to a pair of twins. As an infant, Mary Riddle was adopted by a caring family, leaving Tom alone at the orphanage. Naturally, when the twins reconcile at Hogwarts, they feel a great deal of affection for one another---affection that most would consider abnormal between a brother and a sister.
