*** For whomever downvoted Ithrain, it's fine for you to personally dislike Delenda Est - myself, I loved the first half but was very disappointed by the second half. However, that's [[https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette#wiki_please__don.27t][not an appropriate use of downvoting]]. The recommendation exactly matched the OP's request, and it's quite a popular story despite its shortcomings; it was a perfectly appropriate comment.

(And downvoting me for triggering the bot is just sad.)

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.
