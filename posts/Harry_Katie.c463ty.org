I've just finished reading a cadmean victory and I really like the Harry and Katie dynamic. It can be a one shot or abandoned so long as they are long enough, I would prefer something completed though. No harems either please.


** Good luck. I've posted a request for Harry/Katie suggestions multiple times before on this sub and even on the regular fanfic sub.

I've gotten maybe 2 total suggestions ever that are not 1 shots and even 1 shots are far and few between.

Its a pairing that's underserved in fanfiction and yet despite years of requests, it does not seem to be interesting to the majority of fanfic authors despite a ready-made audience. I had plans to try my hand at writing one but I had to give up writing due to other RL obligations/desires and a cancer diagnosis that took up more of my free time. Doesn't stop me sitting here every day hoping some new great Harry/Katie story will be discovered lol.

This inevitably always gets posted on anything Harry/Katie and while I get why, I still think it's not really true. It feels like this is brought up simply because both like Quidditch, and Katie was underdeveloped as well (although even more so than Ginny).

But in my view, Katie is quite separated from Ginny for a variety of reasons and was possibly a better match early on when both she and Ginny were still underdeveloped. Her being 1 year ahead of Harry would have set her up as a bit of a guide for a Harry in need of someone taking him under their wing a bit. Their shared interest in quidditch would certainly have brought them closer as would the time on the Gryffindor team and her friendship with the other chasers would have only helped provide Harry further structure and support. Ginny only comes along later on with regards to quidditch and does not have the same comradery the flying foxes do with anyone on the team.

The fact Katie was suspected to be a half-blood like him, with knowledge of the Muggle world would have furthered that connection. Personality traits seen later on in periods such as the DA events show she would have been a strong woman willing to stand up for what is right and help Harry. Again these are also seen in Ginny but not until WAY later and feel somewhat forced at times. It doesn't hurt that she does not have a brother who is a close friend of Harry's as that is always awkward.

I like Luna as a pairing for Harry more than Ginny so this is interesting to contemplate.

I don't disagree, as there are quite a few people who fit, especially if you branch to lesser developed characters. Hell, I still think his best pairing would have been with Tonks if she was just a bit younger. Hermione and Luna were both solid options as well, and to this day I feel JK made some massive mistakes with her pairings.

***** I think it's more the fact the authors fall on existing tropes and cliches and make a Ginny 2.0.

Her being older/knowledgeable would be a bit interesting. She does spend the most time in the series with Harry apart from Hermione because of practices.

linkffn(4003405) is pretty much the only one I've ever read.

I disagree that Rowling made massive mistakes. She could have developed Ginny more, but whenever she did show up, she listened to Harry's concerns.

I also have a bit of an issue with Hermione. She felt static over the series and the way she treated Harry in the later books was abysmal. The scene where she attacked Ron with birds also bothered me a bit, as here is a guy having fun with his girlfriend, and she decides to attack him with birds. Harry also seemed to not find her attractive on a regular basis. Her and Harry would inevitably be excessively cold.

Luna is a lovely character, but I feel her and Harry would only work out if she got counselling. Quite a few of the creatures were imaginary and she was a conspiracy theorist.

Ginny ended up being the best option for a pairing in the books because Rowling needed someone stable.

#+end_quote

Well for starters I don't think Ginny is "stable" either by the judgments you passed on both Hermione and Luna. Ginny was possessed by Voldemort at one point and who knows what that did, started off as a slightly crazy fangirl, and has multiple "obsession" personality traits which bleed into her life creating other questionable behavior (like possibly using people to make others jealous).

Hermione definitely had issues, but I would argue shes far more stable than Ginny most of the series and has far more traits that compliment Harry. Luna is the same way but from a completely different angle. Where Hermione is a stabilizing force in Harry's life for the most part, Luna allows him to escape, relax, and have fun.

And let's not forget Harry has his own issues which, in my view, Ginny literally doesn't grasp at any point in the series. Both Luna and Hermione arguably understand those elements of Harry that could be called "issues" far better than Ginny ever could. I am not hating on Ginny necessarily. I still think she was done a massive disservice by JK most of the time and always felt forced. Perhaps if she was better developed earlier on it would have changed things.

******* I disagree. The using others to make him jealous wasn't really what was done. What Hermione told her to do was move on, which I think was actually pretty healthy advice.

She was a fangirl when she was younger, but she grew out of it quickly.

When it comes to having life touched by Voldemort, Ginny is the most empathetic.

****** Didn't Rowling say that she knew the ending she wanted early on and she realized that it wasn't the best but went through with it anyway from what I heard a while back from someone. I think there was a discussion recently about how Rowling's characters were plot devices that acted like characters. Regarding the stable bit though, the story is about a bunch of kids/teens/young adults forced to fight for their lives every year. I don't think any of them are completely stable.

I agree about the characters. Hermione ended up being used for exposition, and I honestly think what could have been a great character went to the crapper because of it. That and being static.

But when Rowling switched over to the young adult genre, I wish she hadn't kept the book for every year formula. I envision something different. Years 1-3 were fine, but then maybe a 5th year book with teen Harry, school drama, and a corrupt ministry, then 7th year, with school, Harry graduating, becoming an adult, then Voldemort rises, 17 years from Godric's Hallow, symbolic of the time to grow into an adult. Then various books as he's a young adult pitted against Voldemort.

I feel this would also help make other characters have time to mature, heck Dumbledore could get over his fear of power and become minister.

Except that there are hardly any fics, so it is hard to describe it as a common pitfall...

I also don't see the connection. The only thing they have in common is the sport. It is like saying a Cho romance would be like Ginny. (If anything, a Katie romance would be like a Cho romance without the Cedric or interhouse drama)

Katie is older, which is a different dynamic.

Katie isn't involved with the main plot, while Ginny and her family is. (This means her getting involved for Harry's sake would have a different meeting.)

She doesn't have the hero worship mess Ginny had. Or the possession.

She can also serve as a 'introduce Harry to the half-blood world', the way Daphne does for purebloods.

And I think she is described as only doing the sport for fun / no interest in it as a career.

It also has the interesting possibilities of starting earlier than most, as you can write mostly Canon compliant interactions for years 1-3 without breaking any plot, and have that build into a romance. With Ginny, any development in year 2-3 has to be based off of hero worship or her rescue

******* Ouch. I'll take the hit for it being uncommon.

I've read a couple of unfinished stories.

Ginny was actually not that badly developed in canon. They were both good at Quidditch and dealt with Voldemort's possession. She listened to Harry and grew out of the fangirl stage. The issue is that when Harry started taking an interest in her, she suddenly is this awesome person out of the blue (Harry is a very unreliable narrator).

Katie did end up having the necklace incident in book 6, but she was on the Quidditch team book 1-6. The lack of a Weasley dynamic is interesting. She has no baggage so to speak. If canon Harry found her attractive then it could work, but you would really have to try to get something deep that isn't romantic garbage. I find the writers for the ones I have read just have a Ginny-Lite.

How do you think Cho would have ended up if Harry asked her out first? She ended up being really insecure about Hermione in book 5 and while Katie has integrity in book 6 (refusing being a chaser without doing a tryout), you don't really see enough of her personality.

That's why I see her as a Ginny copy. We really don't see jealousy from Ginny in book 5 & 6.

Feel free to disagree. If you have dissenting evidence, share it! I didn't reference my ebooks for this.

Well, that was really the only direct criticism, the rest was just describing the potential in the pairing.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I don't think I said she was? If anything, I said it is a reason a writer might avoid Ginny, particularly if they didn't like her earlier character development, as it would be hard to change that without significantly impacting what we know from Canon.

Clearly if you want the same personality as Ginny, you should use her. The problem is if you want a different personality, it can be jarring when fics use Ginny but hard charge her personality precisely because of her existing development

#+begin_quote
  you don't really see enough of her personality.
#+end_quote

I mean, sure. But the same can be said about a lot of potential pairings. (Daphne). The only thing fanon about Daphne is "ice queen", and even that is not set in stone. The only thing we really knew about Tonks was she was kinda "punk". If anything, that freedom is good for a fanfic who wants to build off an established character rather than an OC.

#+begin_quote

Really? I don't think you'd have to try too hard. The 'part of a different friend circle' is a pretty common way for fanfic writers to diverge and introduce new concepts without invalidating all of cannon.

Well, as I said, despite it's potential, there isn't a lot of good out their in this pairing. There isn't a lot of anything in this pairing.

#+begin_quote
  How do you think Cho would have ended up if Harry asked her out first
#+end_quote

In Canon? A rejection. Or perhaps a date of "hey I went on a date with the boy who lived", and the fallout of that. It was clearly set up as a "crush on a girl who didn't even notice him".

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I.... Still don't get it. None of the potentially interesting things about Katie have to do with jealousy?....

Want a prompt that would work with Katie but not Cho or Ginny? "Girl Harry has a slight interest in mans up and asks him to the Yule Ball". Ginny was too young and it really isn't in her personality. And Harry is set up where he really wouldn't say no, especially from one who sees him as Harry and not the Boy Who Lives.

(I think I saw a fic like this with Hermione, but that relationship is a different can of worms entirely).

Edit: also, as much as I like H/Hr, it isn't a good fit for that prompt because of how in tune she is with Harry it is likely to be a 'well I know he is having trouble getting a date'. Which is a whole different set of problems to start a fic off with
