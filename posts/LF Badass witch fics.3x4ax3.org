  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

** Usually, it's Hermione who gets her badass moments. Here's what I have...

Off FF.net,

- [[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] by Diane Castle is a non-magic AU that's nonetheless worth a look; and Hermione isn't the only female character to get badass moments, so that's a plus.
- [[http://grangerenchanted.com/enchant/viewstory.php?sid=1819][Dangerous]] by Black Lotus has an excellent Dark Lady Granger.

On FF.net,

- linkffn(Patron by Starfox5) has many badass witches, and his linkffn(Spy Girl by Starfox5) takes that to a bit of an extreme.
- linkffn(Harry Potter without Harry Potter) has (among other plot threads) Hermione trick her way into Durmstrang, and the way things are going, she and her friends may be hexing some people next chapter.
- linkffn(Reign of the Serpent by AlphaEph19) everyone's more badass and similarly link linkffn(Hogwarts Battle School by Kwan Li), though it's less consistent there.
- linkffn(The Reluctant Lord by SmallBurnyThing) is a harem, but the author makes it work.
- linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin) has Hermione as a paranoid technomage guardian angel.
- In linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthropology, or by jacobk), Hermione kinda-sorta has to beat people up (with magic) to maintain her social status in Slytherin.
- linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) and its sequel aren't as actiony, but Hermione is pretty badass there.
- Ditto linkffn(Kick in the arse of the Wizarding World)
- linkffn(The most gifted witch her age by Bagge) is a oneshot with an ActionGirl!Hermione.
- In linkffn(For the Only Hope by ausland), Hermione gets recruited to be Harry's bodyguard. However, as with many fics by romance-oriented writers (it's an HG/SS 'ship with time-turner abuse used to reduce age difference), her badassitude waxes and wanes as the plot demands. It's also a bit heavy on bad fanon in places.
- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Witch Queen) has OP!Hermione.
- IIRC, linkffn(Harry Potter: Hero of the Wizarding World?)'s Hermione is pretty badass.
- Lastly, there's linkffn(Granger Verse by jeanne.summers), though IMO it's too much of a good thing.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Hermione life suddenly changes, courtesy of an experiment conducted by herself from an alternate, future universe. You'd think messages from the future would have more then vague hints and a headache. Or was that from fighting the troll. CH1-3 Beta-ed.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness.

As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.

** [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/7700][Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire by Coulsdon Eagle]] has a Hermione that is forced to compete in the TWT without any of Harry's luck. I think it's one of the best examples of a story that features a capable protagonist that also suffers from their own poor decisions.

linkffn(Larceny, Lechery, and Luna Lovegood by Rorschach's Blot) has quite capable female characters engaged in a wide variety of hilarious activities. It's about 99% dialogue and 1% narration, though.

*** Seconding HG: GoF, though there are some weak points (ending is too fixficish and a lot of stuff could be cut for length). We need more fics with Hermione in the Triwizard, dammit!

LL&LL ended up being the last Rorschach's Blot fic I'd read. It kind of dragged on and on, and, eventually, the rape humor and the latent homophobia got to me.

***** There's a "running gag" where Dean Thomas, after sleeping with Augusta Longbotom under the influence of a mass-orgy spell, keeps getting raped by old witches. It fails the "switch the genders and check if you still think it's funny" test very, very hard. There are references to prison rape as well.

I'm not sure I'd say there's latent homophobia - the story makes fun of homophobes for the most part, though it delves into "assless chaps are homosexuals preferred wear" cliches.

****** Doesn't a moment arrive when almost all of Voldemort's followers are gay masochists?

Also, pretty early on, IIRC Ron uses his "fertility" family magic to induce a dragon or some other creature to sodomize some Death Eaters (and I think Snape was among them).
