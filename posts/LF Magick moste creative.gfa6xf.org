As above - I would like recs that include creative uses, reinterpretations or expansions on various pieces of magic. Be that House Elves, Wards, Accio For All Occasions, Fantastical Patroni and Where to Find Them, cleaning charms, animation, summoning... In books we mostly saw training exercises (mouse to snuffbox, match to needle), combat situations (Dumbledore's Ministry Performance, Duelling club, various others) and very little of both mundane utility and mundane solution tropes.

Obviously, plot demanded that certain things happen, and not all the fun things could be explored forther, but there are over 818258 HP stories on FFN alone - there has to be something like that somewhere out there!

*So, what do I want?*\\
Any fanfiction where one or more of the following get some Author loving:\\
-household/utility charms being used in new and interesting ways, or at least elaborated on\\
-house elves, and not just to fetch Lord Too Many Names his McGuffin\\
-magic used for improved personal comfort\\
-complex problems, simple solutions

*No explicit M/M slash, please.*


** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12157282/1/Percy-Take-the-Wheel]]) has Percy use many household charms and hedge magic to solve his problems. It's also on ao3 if you google it.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

** I don't know how you feel about AO3, but [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17452775/chapters/41095088]] is a really good fic that's still in progress. Dobby's Deceit: "What if Dobby bound himself to Harry without Harry knowing about it? How would that influence the story?" It goes into a lot of detail about the house elves and goblins and wards!
