We've all read at least one story where Potter was raised somewhere else instead and didn't attend Hogwarts until tri-wiz, 5th year, 6th year etc. Each story has Harry being introduced to the Hogwarts Population in someway.

What is your favourite Introduction of Harry to the students of Hogwarts?


** Linkffn(The Snow Queen by Darklooshkin) Fem!Harry gets teleported into the Great Hall for the TWT and promptly holds Albus Fucking Dumbledore at knifepoint.

Oh, and Hermione's got severe PTSD and paranoia issues from her time at Hogwarts.

**** It's pretty hunger games.

Edit: Let me rephrase. It follows the themes of the hunger games, survival of the fittest, etc. It features some of the characters. And the beginning of the story is set in Panem. But it quickly moves on to the Harry Potter universe.

*** The story has a great premise, however it lost me a few chapters in when the author kept switching between past tense and present tense, along with accumulated spelling and punctuation errors. If those don't bother you, it could be worth your while.

** I understand [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3995826/1/The-Hidden-Hero][The Hidden Hero]] has a scene halfway through where Harry reveals himself right at the final confrontation with Voldemort, dropping a glamour; before that, he was masquerading as Mark Twist, a muggleborn Hogwarts student.
