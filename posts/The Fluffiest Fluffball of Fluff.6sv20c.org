I'm having what constitutes a super crappy day/week/month/year. I need something to take my mind off of life for a bit.

I'd prefer no slash.

Things I can't handle right now: Sickness and death. At this point, if a character gets the sniffles I don't want to read it. If a character dies off page, I don't think I could handle it. So please, no sadness! Just fluffy goodness!
