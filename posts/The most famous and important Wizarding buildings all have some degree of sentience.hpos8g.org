Buildings like Hogwarts, Gringotts, maybe the ministry of magic, etc.

Hogwarts is usually portrayed as having some degree of sentience in most fanfics, so why not other buildings?


** linkffn(Core Threads) adds sentience to Gringotts, but it doesn't start with it.

** oh, I remember in one fic, Harry fixes Grimmauld place the muggle way (or is just talking about it doing it in the future), and Ron is horrified "why would you do that???" because buildings have feelings or something and he tells a story about a window in his room at the burrow. I think it was Drarry though, not sure.

**** Percy Weasley on Angel Dust is a truly terrifying thought. It'd be like the Pyro from Team Fortress, only instead of a Disney movie, his reality is animated paperwork and talking grading rubrics. :D

  Licking the Philosopher's Stone was perhaps not something Harry would have done if he'd known what it was. But that act, along with so many others, started him down his path to building a library with Hermione and Millicent while Tom lurked in the background. So, he was happy with how things turned out.---Editing for grammar in April 2019. My great thanks and respect for Tazzm for their rather phenomenal work.
