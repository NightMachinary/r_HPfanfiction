p0ody accidentally let his host expire, so he moved the downloader.

** Don't worry, I changed the FFNBot code, so the FFNBot should give correct download links soon.

*** Just FYI, FFBot is currently running from the 1.3 branch, not from master. I've already had [[https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/pull/93][my pull request]] merged for that, so the download links should have been working for the last few days.
