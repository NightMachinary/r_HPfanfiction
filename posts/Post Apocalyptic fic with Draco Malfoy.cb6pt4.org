:END:
I think the fic was supposed to be some kind of Fallout inspired one, and Draco was an old old man when the vault was finally opened, and since there wasn't much Wizarding blood in the vault he was in there was some inbredding between some of his kids?

I also remember a lot of him bitching about nuclear stuff being worse than their war
