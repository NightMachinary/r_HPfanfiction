I'll take any existing fics that come close, else consider this a prompt/discussion.

​

HP Magic is of the reality warping variety. This is happening constantly. Nobody knows this because every time reality warps, all the people also warp to the new reality.

Woman summons demon to wish revenge on an ex-lover? Reality warps and Africa is suddenly on the other side of the globe. Kid wishes on a magic star that he can have magic? Suddenly wand magic exists where it did not before. Man finds a magic lamp and wishes for job success? Reality warps into a world where his selling shower curtains is amazingly successful but due to butterflies somehow ants have changed from being massive to being tiny and bovine have replaced them as a primary livestock choice.

​

Having a bad day and cast a spell to cheer yourself up? Congraduations, you've changed how the biochemistry of humans evolved.

​

In this, one of the cannon characters is blessed/cursed with being able to keep their memories/personalities across the warps. And has to deal with the fact that magic is constantly changing the universe around them.

Ideally, at some point the character will get frustrated and look for a way to get rid of their gift so they can go back to being ignoring of the changes and all the stress it causes them.

Some thoughts for different characters:

Hermione: Thinks she is stuck jumping between different realities, but through hard research she finds to her horror it is simply her current universe twisting. Has to explain to Pirate Harry (the current incantation of her best friend) of the horror that is happening because of the magic being done at first year girls sleepover parties and how she cannot stop the madness.

​

Draco: After being stuck in it for a while, Draco eventually finds some and wishes for the reality warping to stop. He gets his wish, and is now stuck in a world without magic.

Ron: At first Ron truly enjoyed the variety. He got to be famous, he spent some time at Hogwarts School for Magical Minks, he got to experience being richer than Malfoy. But he was never quite as happy as the two weeks he spent in a mutually loving relationship with Hermione and Harry. Despite the hundreds of changes since, he has never been in any remotely similar situation. Ron desperately begins working on trying to get that back, but whenever he gets close reality resets again.

Luna: It is all the Humpehornets fault. They are doing this. If she could just catch one, it would stop.


** "But he was never quite as happy as the two weeks he spent in a mutually loving relationship with Hermione and Harry"

He got kinda close once
