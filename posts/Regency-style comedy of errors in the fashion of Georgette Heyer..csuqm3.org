I'd been bingeing on my Georgette Heyer collection for the nth time when the thought came to me that JKR's characters are so very well suited to angst-free comedies of errors, especially those of James and Lily's generation, well, before they all up and died.

So,if there exists such a unicorn as a well written, light-hearted historical romance fic, please send it my way.

Slash or femslash are welcome too.


** This might not be entirely what you're asking for, but the Black Sheep Dog series by izzythehutt mentions the Georgette Heyer books as an inspiration and although it's mostly focused on the Black family, it has a romance in the second part! It's also set during the time of James and Lily's generation. :)
