It doesn't have to be a AU where he is good he can still be evil ( or neither good or evil) but he has to be a protagonist or at least a deuteragonist. I'd like some story that is pretty plot heavy I prefer no shipping with Riddle. But if the plot is interesting i can accept most ships. Also stories with Tom Riddle Jr as MC not Voldemort. Aka not after he's established as the Dark Lord with a crap ton of Horcruxes and looks inhuman.


** You might like /A Riddled Universe/ linkffn(8678567). It's been a very long time since I read it, so I don't recall much how good it was, but the premise was interesting. I believe that there were some strange pairings (I want to say Snape was married to Lily), but I honestly don't recall. I also don't quite recall how prominent Riddle really was (e.g. if he was a deuteragonist; Harry was definitely the protagonist), but his character was critical to the story.

** I'd never heard of the term deuteragonist before. TIL.

For the request:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10311215/1/October][October]] - (148k+ words ; ONGOING) This fic starts with Harry, as Death personified, meeting Tom Riddle on the train to Hogwarts in 1938. Their interactions change the course of the future, ensuring that Tom Riddle will never embark on the path to become Voldemort. The story has some great surreal moments.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11261838/1/The-Unwinding-Golden-Thread][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - (53k+ words ; COMPLETE) Harry gets trapped in the year that Tom Riddle would have opened the Chamber of Secrets, but this isn't one of those "Harry turns Tom good through the power of friendship/love" fics.

** I've been enjoying /Benefits of old laws/ by ulktante: linkffn(11540013)

It's written from alternate points of view. A lot of attention is given to the development of a functional (familial) relationship between Riddle and Harry and their individual character development.

** I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I just want to clarify the post flairs for you, since this is actually a request post.

────────

*Fic Search:*

When you are looking for a *single, specific fic*. There is a story on your mind that you /know/ exists, and you know a list of things about it, but you still need help finding it. Most commonly used because you have forgotten the title of a story you previously read, or because your google-fu can't find a fic the author seems to have removed from FFN/AO3/etc

*Request:*

When you are looking for *any fics that fit within some general guidelines*. You post fits this exactly, listing some requirements ("he has to be a protagonist or at least a deuteragonist", etc) and some preferences ("I prefer no shipping with Riddle", etc). This is by far the most common post type here, used to gain recommendations for new fics the OP expects to enjoy due to the guidelines shared.

────────

After all that, go forth and enjoy the stories shared! I hope your post nets you good new fics to read :)
