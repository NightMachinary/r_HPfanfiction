** No. They came close to it, but Mcgonagall and the other professors were there to ensure that didn't happen.

** Hostages are much more useful when at least mostly intact. If you torture somebody's kid(s) into a coma, you've gone from having massive leverage over that somebody to creating an enemy that may well feel they've got nothing left to lose. For practical considerations then, if for no other reason, they would have refrained from causing any lasting damage to pureblood and halfblood children (the Muggle-borns would have been sent to the camps and/or Azkaban).

** Not to our knowledge, and if anyone ended up like them, I think that's the kind of information Neville would mentioned to Harry when he gave him an overview of the situation.

Even if the Carrows were terrible human beings, they were limited into what they could do for most of the year. The students still present at the school were not "trash" they could play with, but young witches and wizards "of good stock" that had to be raised into good little puppet for their new regimes. Snape was also there to keep them under a fairly short leash.

According to Neville, they only went all out with the punishments after the Easter Holidays, when Harry escaped once again from Voldemort clutch and the situation worsened for the bad guys. And when they went all out, the students in danger managed to escape them and join Neville into the RoR, so even if some of them were hurt, nobody was killed or turned insane.

** The Carrows are cruel,not skilled. They'd probably be unable to do something like that
