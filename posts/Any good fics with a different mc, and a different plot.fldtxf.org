**** Ah, okay. Do you prefer something with someone school-aged (eg. Neville/Draco goes to Durmstrang/has an adventure over the Summer Holidays) or post-schooling adult (eg. Remus travels back in time/Sirius rescues Harry and works to improve his life and fight Voldemort)?

** RÃ¼diger Zweigl and the school in the mountain on ffnet

It is about a school in Austria set in the HP-verse, but other countries are never mentioned. Sadly it is unfinished, but at 80k it is a substantial enough read to make it worthwhile.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Deus Ex Machina)

Harry has a really minor role in this by accidentally causing time traveling karma to start a chain of events back in the first Voldemort war. Then it's all Black Phantom.

  It was a normal day, until newly turned 8 year-old Harry Potter decided to make a wish upon the dog star (even though he'd almost never actually seen it) and set off something in the Unlabeled Room in the Department of Mysteries. Turns out Dumbledore was wrong. Again. It wasn't love that the Unspeakables were studying down there.
