It's one of the craziest evil!Dumbledore fics where he and Snape both had horcruxes. One of them was revived in a cauldron despite being melted in front of everyone in the great hall. Trelawney was a kidnapped dryad and Dumbledore's pet prophet/oracle?/. Dumbledore needed potions because his teeth dropped rotten from an overindulgence with lemon drops.

*** Thanks and I know it was bad. But it had absurd moments and I think it was specifically made so unrealistic. It had imaginative and creative uses of magic that get stuck in your head no matter if it's a crackfic.

**** I'm not sure it was /meant/ to be a crackfick. PerfectLionheart is infamous mainly for two fics, this and Chuunin Exam Day, which is a Naruto timeloop fic in which Naruto discovers his secret kitsune heritage or something and builds a massive harem of basically every female character, making them all into kitsune somehow in the process, while bashing Sakura. In both cases, it's just a massive trainwreck that he can't possibly not actually be that bad at writing.

*** aww.. there are some funny bits in it. the Bella/Moody duel was pretty funny. the KFC Empire of Evil..

I actually liked the dwarves building fortified towns and the twins testing security but the author veered away from that.

***** yeah, there's good stuff but.. it's a slog.

Dumbledore morphing into Snidely Whiplash was pretty fun.
