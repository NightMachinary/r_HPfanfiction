Yeah, here you go people. Starts in the summer after sixth year, and is probably going to go past Harry's school years. Canon shit is going to be changed from this a lot, simply by virtue of Harry deciding to value Delphi's life over hunting Horcruxes and trying to beat Voldemort himself. Lots of butterfly effects will come about later. Not so much immediately, though. xD Hope anybody likes the premise. Will write more if you do. Even if you don't, I still will.

It's not exactly healthy on Harry's part - I think he's jumping at the chance for this to distract from grief and guilt. And it isn't fair and he shouldn't be doing it at his age. But he will anyway, because he's Harry like that. xD Stubborn and savior complex combined to make an unstoppable force. Not to mention the empathy and similarities he sees in her with himself.

  The summer after Sirius's death, a grieving Harry Potter receives an unexpected shock, gift, and burden: the Dark Lord's daughter. Born to die in a ritual for sake of growing her father's power, her never-meant-to-be life is entrusted to Harry. But is Harry up for the task of keeping newborn Delphini Riddle safe, healthy, and happy as he goes into his sixth year at Hogwarts?
