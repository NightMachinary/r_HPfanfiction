linkffn(a wizard's guide to banking by bakuraptor) is a story that merits more attention than it's getting: if you want excitement, adventure, dry humour, and world-building that's virtually seamless with canon, this is the story for you. The premise - which the summary doesn't spoil in any significant way - is /hilarious/.


** Sure, why not, I'll check it out

  The problem: muggleborns are heavily discriminated against, Voldemort has this terrible habit of killing them whenever he gets the chance, and things aren't getting any better. The solution? Well, find safety in numbers - and if the numbers don't exist yet, find a way to make them - and never mind if you knock the wizarding world on its head on the way.
