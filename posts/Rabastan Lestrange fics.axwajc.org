I'm literally looking for any and all Rabastan fics that you would recommend- would love if he was a main character/ a love interest (don't mind if it's been completed or not) Have already enjoyed innocence ensnared (Heeley) and his chapter in Soul Scars which has kind of chucked me on this rollercoaster Thankyou!!


** I really liked his character in linkffn(our mercurial selves), but it is a while until he's featured in the story and he plays a fairly minor role overall.

  In the wake of a tragedy Dumbledore seizes an opportunity to use a mother's plea to his advantage. Unfortunately he did not factor a certain Death Eater into the equation. A Hermione is raised by the Malfoys story. (Not a part of the "Time Heals All Wounds" series)
