I've been reading the Mind Arts, but outside of that story I was hoping that there were some new stories to read!

#+begin_quote
  Wheels Within Wheels is the story of Harry Potter and Daphne Greengrass, who were promised to one another by their parents in the dark days of the First Wizarding War. As they explore their new, sometimes overwhelming mutual feelings, they also discover heretofore unknown facts, and facets, about their parents, close associates, and themselves.

In terms of cliches, it's definitely not the worst. At least it doesn't heavily bash Ginny and Ron.
