** I'm thinking of writing something like this. I'm currently studying history, and am fascinated by how the world of Harry Potter would fit in a more realistic way to the real events (as we know them). How the Pureblood agenda probably would be a product of social darwinism, how the political ideas are influenced by Machiavelli, and the obsession with "old magic" (in fan fiction). The greatest wizard is always Merlin, or there's some old spell that changes the plot. It's like they're stuck in the renaissance, which kinda makes sense since the modern states was largely formed in the late middle ages. The wizard population probably wouldn't have survived on there own before, and considering that the international statue of secrecy wasn't established before 1692, there must have been a shift in the fourteenth or fifteenth that had a major influence on how the wizarding world was shaped.

English is not my first language though, but if there's a real interest I might give it a go.
