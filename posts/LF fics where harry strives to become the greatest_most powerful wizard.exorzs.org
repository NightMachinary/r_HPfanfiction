I'm looking for a harry that actually works hard at trying to become the most powerful/knowledgeable/skilled wizard he can be, where he doesn't just get handed his power,skills or knowledge

He'll probably be in slytherin because of his ambition

He can be light, grey or dark, it doesn't matter so long as he isn't completely insane or evil

Just no Slash,Femslash or huge harems (2-3 girls at most)

** linkffn(What You Leave Behind) has to be the best one. Newcomb writes a Harry that's curious and passionate about magic in an extensive AU but manages to capture JK's original whimsical tone. I honestly think it might be a top 3 fic in the fandom, and definitely the best regarding how HP magic works.

  The Mirror of Erised is supposed to show your heart's desire - so why does Harry Potter see only vague, blurry darkness? Aberforth is Headmaster, Ariana is alive, Albus is in exile, and Harry must uncover his past if he's to survive his future.
