I have recently found a liking to stories that take place during GoF and would be interested in some stories that feature Harry and NOT Ginny or Hermione. Beyond that I am looking for suggestions. I am a huge fan of DG and FD but anyone but HHr and GW

Please and thank you. Rating not a problem.

  Harry has a long and difficult path to overcoming not only Lord Voldemort, but also his trauma from his treatment at the hands of the Dursleys. AU with the story starting at 4th year. Harry/Fleur later on. This story deals seriously with abuse, which can be difficult for some readers. It has been rated accordingly.

******* Awesome, keep it up. I know how it feels to have the writing bug and then lose it and come back to it. I too am in the process of a story.

******** Oh man. There was I think a 10 month break between 8 and 9. I took a creative writing class, so the quality improved, but it was a big ol gap. I camt update super often just cause my schedule is pretty full, so I have to take writing time when I can find it

********* I totally understand, I just had my first kid. So while i still want to continue and I'm on like ch15.... but It's hard to find time to sit down and write more than a paragraph. Keep up the work, world always needs more writers, even if they aren't writing, we are always learning.
