Hey reddit! Whenever i read fanfiction i tend to write down lists whenever i find different situations i find interresting and want to read more about. I havent been lucky using google lately, so i hope you guys can help me out instead!

To avoid mass confusion here i will only post a snippet of the list and hope you guys know some works you can link :) Please link with indication of what part of the list it is about :)

*Hp Learns lots of magic -and uses it

*Dimension travel and abuses his magic -ie he uses magic openly to take care of his problems instead of hiding it, alternative he abuses timeline of new dimension (crossovers included)

*Harry takes care of kid- his own or someone elses doesnt matter. Can be post hogwarts

*Glasses can see through clothing- kinky little sidepart of the usual harry-fixes-eyesight part. Can be smutty or just fluffy humour of harry surrounded by boobies

*Saved by muggles- from the dursleys pre/mid hogwarts, or muggles saves harry during war

*using dobby/other houseelves to spy or steal from the deatheaters.

This is the small part of the list so far, hope you guys have some good stories to link! :) No slash if it can be avoided :)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): a huge portion of this fic is spent on Trio learning magic, and Harry often needed to learn new things on the fly for his mission. Furthermore, I find this exchange between Hermione and Hannah Abbot super hilarious:

#+begin_quote
  Silence. Hannah was the one to speak what most of them were thinking.

  "You made a Dark Lord copy library books for you."

  "Hogwarts library books!"

  "Hogwarts library books," Hannah agreed. "You made a Dark Lord copy Hogwarts library books for you. You're right, that makes all the difference."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/Harry-Potter-and-The-Iron-Lady][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363): Muggles had ulterior motives though. But otherwise, it's a great fic with a few blemishes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11157943/1/I-Still-Haven-t-Found-What-I-m-Looking-For][I still haven't found what I'm looking for]]

It's a star-wars crossover where the force and magic are the same, or at least versions of the same thing. Harry has come to this universe form his own in a way that becomes clear throughout the story. His magic is obviously quite different from the way the force is used and he isn't particularly coy about what he can do with it either. Lots of fun in my opinion.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black commedy]] is also a great example of Harry who travels to a different dimension and has no qualms using his magic.

The only story about Harry taking care of a kid that I can think of is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/Altered-Destinies][Altered Destinies]]. It's be more fun to read it that for me to tell you about it I think.

  Ahsoka Tano left the Jedi Order, walking away after their betrayal. She did not consider the consequences of what her actions might bring, or the danger she might be in. A chance run in with a single irreverent, and possibly crazy, person in a bar changes the course of fate for an entire galaxy.
