There are many types of crossover. My preferred type is Harry Potter ending up in the other universe, ideally with nobody else either through choice or accident. The Harry Potter story and universe is special because no other world or series has magic used as freely nor without cost. The near limitless potential of magic can often lead to a situation where Harry/ A person from the Harry Potter world could curbstop any potential conflict.

How do you feel about the way authors balance this?

For example linkffn(10784770) (Harry Potter: Geth) has a Harry that is basically unstoppable and while only a part of that is magic based the story feels like there is no worth in the actions or choices.

Alternatively some stories nerf the magic of the Harry Potter series, sometimes through the dreaded magical core and its ilk of limiting the available magic and artificially making magic a scarce resource where every act has potential repercussions. Others have ways of rendering magic ineffective either through science in some sci-fi or through the new universe's own resources. Steelbadger's linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar), currently has limited the magic of Harry in another way [[/spoiler][He doesn't have a wand, at least not yet]]

Another approach is to change the nature of the conflict, something seen in several Star Wars story where the conflict isn't Harry vs Villain but rather Harry vs his own demons and having to choose if he wants to involve himself. Harry is as overpowered in a lot of aspects as you'd expect but he's not sure if he should use those powers.

Another version is to have a young and inexperienced Harry travel. This limits what can be done simply because Harry doesn't know how to do it. This can be done well as it can create a journey where Harry tries to learn more but it can feel like it limits the potential of a story and the potential of magic.

What cross-overs do you think do this best, what's your preferred method? Do you ever feel robed by someone being too strong or too weak?


** As someone that is currently writing a crossover, and reads tons of them, it's entirely possible to crossover worlds without overly nerfing the power of the magic style of Harry Potter - or by making the wizards virtual gods. It's all about power leveling in general - something that even happens in the Harry Potter world (for example as far as we know somebody like Sally-Anne Perks would get roflstomped by Voldemort in a fight; trained, powerful wizards (see Sirius, Snape, etc) have difficulty controlling werewolves; and even within the Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix there are almost clear delineation of 'power.').

Power, in the Harry Potter universe at least from what we can gather from the text, is a combination of something innate within you, and your actual intelligence level. Even then, 'dumb' characters can learn 'powerful' magic - even if they're basically glass cannons otherwise. They have limits on how actually powerful they are because they've simply learned powerful spells by rote. Smart characters also are conversely caught down by characters that can simply overpower them. Hermione is an exceptionally intelligent and clever character with a decent amount of magical power and creativity, but she is easily overpowered by other characters that are 'above' her power level. It doesn't take much to become a certain level of dangerous if you have ill intent, but it takes intense study and a certain natural flair/gift to jump to another level.

What we know of how magic works then in the Harry Potter universe is that it's actually very hard to munchkin. Just like reading and obtaining "ALL THE KNOWLEDGE!!!" won't make you the most powerful character, simply attaining [[http://cdn.quotesgram.com/img/85/65/662481600-quote-Jeremy-Clarkson-6.jpg]["ALL THE POWAAAAARRRRRR!"]] won't actually make you the strongest character.

What this means is that simply dropping random Harry Potter characters into other works doesn't mean that they're simply nerfed/Gods just from providence. Look at the X-Men universe for example. Let's take Sally-Anne Perks and put her up against Magneto. Hell, put her up against Nightcrawler and she'd have issues. Similarly, a character like Bellatrix Lestrange would probably be caught upside down and inside out by someone like Legion, but would absolutely have no issue with somebody like Jubilee.

So the proper, and the best, way that authors approach meshing Harry Potter with other worlds is to simply fold the two power leveling structures together. Each world will already have their own, and they're actually quite easy to line up next to each other. Harry could probably banish Samwise Gamgee to the other side of the Shire by the end of the last Harry Potter book, but Saruman would probably fold Harry in on himself for fun. Hermione Granger would probably be teaching at Xavier's Institute, but Wanda Maximoff could leave her drooling on the carpet with a second thought. Voldemort could probably give most of the Endless a run for their money, but Death...? Well, I think the books already answered that.

*** I just realized I never left my examples of good crossovers.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8897431/1/Child-of-the-Storm][*Child of the Storm*]] linkffn(8897431), a crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, asks the question of "what if James Potter was just Thor in a human's body?" and then constructs a world with so many layers and moving parts it's extraordinary. The author has done some painstaking powerleveling as well (from talking with him he has a clearly thought out manner on who is where in terms of power). Do be warned though, it takes a few chapters for the story to fully find its legs.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2857962/1/Browncoat-Green-Eyes][*Browncoat, Green Eyes*]] linkffn(2857962) I feel does a great job in balancing an overpowered Harry against the 'verse. Yes he's overpowered, but that doesn't mean he is a 'god tier sue' by any means. Plus, nonjon did a wonderful job capturing the feel of both universes in a pretty well meshed crossover.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][*The Black Prince*]] linkffn(11098283), a crossover with Game of Thrones, has Harry 'reborn' as sorts (it hasn't quite explained what's going on yet) as the second son of Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister. Some can say that Harry's powers got nerfed for want of a real wand, but as of the latest updates he's slowly coming into pulling his powers in from his 'previous' life - which has also caused Westeros to adapt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10199392/1/Early-Retirement][*Early Retirement*]] linkffn(10199392) and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11510638/1/What-Happened-Between][*What Happened Between*]] linkffn(11510638), crossovers with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, are a play on BOTH a female!Harry, and Master-of-Death!Harry and how that folds into the Marvel universe. Oh, and this Harry has issues resulting from the fact she can't die. Don't read the third story in the trilogy, pretend it ends with 'What Happened Between.' Even though it showed that Harry (and thus wizards) aren't instakills in this world, it's still a dreadful third arc.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8957424/1/][*Illusions of Grandeur*]] linkffn(8957424) where Harry is...something that goes on adventures (against his will at times) with the Winchesters in the Supernatural universe. Harry is massively powerful, it hated by the Angels, feared by most demons, and still isn't the most powerful being in the universe. He's just /one/ of them.

There's probably more, but those are the ones that I can think of off the top of my head that give good examples of meshing universes/power levels well.

** Balancing crossovers is really, I think, something that has requirements that change depending on the universes being crossed over. There is one question I ask myself when I start a new crossover:

How deeply are the crossover worlds connected? Is the crossover a 'world fusion' where both universes must exist side-by side, or are they detached from each-other with the mechanics of both universes being essentially self-contained? In Shadow of Angmar, I tend towards the fusion end of the spectrum though it may not be obvious within the story. Within SoA the Harry Potter world is an aspect of the Lord of the Rings cosmology, and the magic of Harry Potter is just a small part of the larger whole. On the other hand, in 'A New Man' I have largely skirted any ruminations on precisely /how/ the Harry Potter magic works, the worlds are functionally disconnected.

From there you can build up the rest. If your systems are connected, then you have to work out just how they mesh, and work out, within the narratives of both worlds, just how they stack up against each-other. For example, Harry Potter magic is much flashier than Lord of the Rings magic (at least, the magic routinely seen within the primary story), why is it that Harry Potter humans can conjure snakes out of thin air while the residents of Middle-earth can't do anything of the sort? Is it because Harry Potter characters are simply more powerful, or is it something else?

If you decide that they are more powerful, you then need to decide if that is okay, or if they need to be limited in some way. In Shadow of Angmar, Harry has been limited not just because I don't want him roflstomping everything, though that is certainly a desirable consequence. The real reason is that the first arc of the story is entirely focused on Harry's own growth, and the slow realisation and regaining of magic serves as a nice proxy for that. I would definitely recommend you make any 'nerfs' serve the narrative, rather than merely being part of the premise. An example of the latter would be Harry in Star Wars finding that magic doesn't work and he has to use the Force for everything (or maybe the Harry-enters-universe-as-child plot). There's no opportunity for interesting growth, and you've ripped away one of the core components that make Harry Potter... Harry Potter, it's not something I enjoy reading.

The most important thing for me, though, is that both universes are treated with respect, and that each brings something to the table. In Shadow of Angmar I use Lord of the Rings to lend extra depth to Harry Potter, and I use Harry Potter to shine a light on the deeper importance of Magic in Tolkien. Together, they become something greater than either alone. Or, at least, that is the desire. Isn't that what crossovers are about?

** I've come to the conclusion that HP!wizards are basically Batman, wherein they are basically invincible with sufficient prep-time and I'm fine with that; in crossovers there are plenty of opportunities for the unexpected after all and adapting to challenges is what character growth is about. There are also plenty of limitations to HP!magic, but they are often overlooked so YMMV; HP!magic could easily be classified as reality warping, but it only operates on a small scale and becomes exponentially more difficult and time consuming to cast as the scale increases.

Harry has great power, but his limited sphere of influence leaves plenty of opportunities for him to face Superman Dilemma. Even if the opportunities are under utilized by making Harry either antisocial or letting him horde allies under wards.

What I'm trying to say is while HP!magic may be OP, there are plenty of interesting ways to write around that. I have a much bigger issue with magical trunk nonsense where Harry is waltzing around with a kings ransom, a library of plot relevant information, food and shelter, and whatever other doodads the author wants to give Harry.

A big part of why I read crossovers is that I feel that a big part of canon!Harry's character is not only informed, but enforced by his situation. I like to see who he becomes when he's cut off from the Wizarding World where words like Boy-Who-Lived, Dumbledore's Man, and Gryffindor are largely meaningless. Conveniently Harry is often cut off often when crossing over into other settings, probably why I have fewer issues with perceived imbalances as I'm more interested in Harry interacting with the setting than particular characters.

Falling through the Rabbit Hole by Caligraphy linkffn(11482161) Rarer than gold, good crossovers that involve the entire Trio.

** Curb stomps go both ways, and I've seen my share of heroes from other universes squashing HP villains like bugs.

But it's difficult to NOT curb stomp if HP magic faces off medieval Muggles such as in the Land of Ice and Fire. The little bit magic present there wouldn't be able to compete with the high powered HP magic. Similarly, HP magic easily trumped D&D magic because the latter is balanced against medieval Muggles or else a balanced fighter/thief/cleric/wizard party would never make sense.

I personally like a good curb stomp from time to time, especially if it is directed against those filthy Muggles in the GoT world. IMO, everyone there could die and I wouldn't give a damn. Daenery was only marginally better than the rest of the scums. So [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12195136/1/Legend-of-the-Gryphon][Legend of the Gryphon]], linkffn(12195136), although hyping Rhaegar a bit too much, is quite enjoyable to read.

I find LOTR is surprisingly balanced vs HP. Although HP magic would slaughter orc and goblin armies easily (Fiendfyre), I doubt it would be very effective vs non-human bosses such as the Balrog, Smaug, Saruman, and Sauron. The One Ring was basically a different implementation of the Horcrux, and the line between good and evil was very cleanly drawn. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5291694/Steelbadger][Steelbadger]] is IMO by far the best writer for that universe, but he/she prefers the 'loner Harry' approach and which basically leads to Harry being assimilated in that world. I personally prefer more balanced representation of characters from BOTH worlds. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11281891/1/Failsafe][Failsafe]], linkffn(11281891), would have been my favorite HP/LOTR crossover if it was ever finished.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1229909/Darth-Marrs][Darth Marrs]] has written several HP/SW crossovers, and he alternates the balance of power between the two worlds. In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard][Revenge of the Wizard]], linkffn(10912355), HP magic was fully competitive against Force users. But in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7718942/1/Broken-Chains][Broken Chains]], linkffn(7718942), HP magic had no chance against Sith/Jedi in direct combat, as Dumbledore painfully experienced against a Sith Harry. The author had to give Voldemort and Bellatrix a huge power boost to keep the plot challenging. In its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12040341/1/The-Stars-Alone][The Stars Alone]], linkffn(12040341), Goa'ulds' powers and technologies were fully competitive vs HP magic and SW Force powers, and they had numbers and millennia old entrenched power base to fall back on. They were also completely immune to HP mind magic. But as with all Darth Marrs fics, he would often sabotage his own promising stories with outrageous developments.

--------------

Finally, I come to [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]], who is writing several crossover universes, each with their unique powers. [[http://orig02.deviantart.net/1594/f/2017/145/9/6/teraverse_multiverse_by_jcarlhenderson-dbagtkx.png][This image]] best illustrates what she has been working on. The Terawatt world is the one she spent most of her effort building: my favorite [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is set in that universe and chronologically the first in the Series. Although lacking HP magic, this world is nevertheless high powered and in some ways far more scary. The Trio of this world makes up for their lack of magical powers with more cunning, ruthlessness, and training.

The next story in her series is [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436-16/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] that features the Potterverse Hermione as the main character several years after Voldemort's defeat. She had to gather a team of six heroines (Sam Carter from SG1, Buffy and Willow from the Vampire Slayers, Selina Kyle from the Justice League, Jaime from the Bionic Woman, and Alex Mack from the Terawattverse) to defeat an invasion from the hell dimension.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614-2/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]] follows the previous one immediately. Alex Mack, aka the superhero Terawatt, faced great new challenges in her home world. The Trio from this universe would make many appearances.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-27744-76/DianeCastle+Cross+Purposes.htm][Cross Purposes]] is a sequel of "The League of Extraordinary Women" in worlds other than the Terawattverse.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-32071/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Collocation+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Collocation of Alex Mack]] is her latest ongoing story. In this one, Alexes from 7 worlds were congregated in the Dresden File universe, along with their adult helpers (among them Sam, Buffy, Harry Dresden, and the Potterverse Hermione).

** HP: Geth had a bad balance, not in the way of magic, but in the way that the Geth became the 'Helpful Goblin', solving problems along the way. The magic part, sadly, didn't get explored enough.

I don't have a 'prefered' method when it comes to writing crossover (I mostly write crossover), sometimes Harry went to other universe, sometimes the opposite. I nerf or buff the MC's power depend on the setting as well as my interpretion of their personality in that particular story, but most of the time, I respect the "potential" of magic in both universe, as you put it. Harry could be either weak or insanely strong but nothing breaks canon (too much anyway).

In the end a character's power level doesn't rob me of anything, it's how the writer writes the conflict. I only feel robbed if the author write a Godlike Harry without any worthy challenge for him to overcome.

In some of the stories (not crossover) where a MOD Harry came back in time to raise young Harry for example, where the focus wasn't on Voldemort or the war, but instead on how to give young Harry a happy life, how to deal with, and gain the truth of a slightly crazy Sirius, as well as Remus, all the while slowly improving the Wizarding community. Most of those can't be deal with just by using superior magical power, which in turn makes them exciting.

** I think part of what you're missing is that not everything is based around pure magical power. In some instances even Dumbledore wouldn't be considered overpowered such as worlds like Star Wars where individual power means very little compared to combined efforts (Yoda may be unparalleled in his skill, experience and connection to the force but he's still one person).

However, I think that so long as the balance between magical power, intelligence and interactions with others are carefully managed then what the author chooses doesn't matter too much.

*** It's more the potential of magic rather than power. If you were reading the other days' thread on magical cores then you'd see that I believe magical power to be somewhat dependant on the knowledge of the individual. Maybe I worded it poorly but I wanted opinions on the stylistic ways authors mesh the worlds together without one dominating the other.

** Bear with me a sec for this seeming tangent: I used to run an RPG called Nova Praxis, in which there are awesome to the point of OP characters called Praetorians. Originally they were meant to be these near-mythical NPCs that go off and do crazy awesome stuff, and are thought of as top of the line secret agents by the populace.

In an expansion, a new style of campaign was written where the players are a Praetorian team. As opposed to scaling up all of their conflicts, (although this was an option some of the time,) it put the players in charge of large-scale problems which they could definitely solve, but their method of solving would have long-term consequences.

So instead of having Super!Harry just blast his way through his issues, you could instead focus on moral problems or having to deal with the fallout of his actions.
