This is a beautifully crafted fic. It's haunting, poignant and a great dystopia story. It has an amazing ending, too. Really. This isn't my fic, I just stumbled onto it and think it needs some recognition. Just read it!

** I didn't think it really grabbed me - But as it turns out it kept me up two hours past my bedtime so I guess I enjoyed it after all! :)

** It seems like Harry isn't the main character of the fanfic... A turn off for me. Let's how other people like it before I force myself to read it.
