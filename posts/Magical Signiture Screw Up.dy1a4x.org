So this idea is kind if siminlar to Jupiter Rising film but in the HP universe and with a magical signiture and not DNA.

Basically someone (Harry or an OC) have the missfortune of being born with the same magical signiture as a big time criminal from fifty years ago who is thought dead. When this person uses magic in a shop before it is robbed the aurors believe it is this criminal resurfacing and they chase the person across the country as the person tries to stop death eater attacks. When the magical signiture is found at the scene of death eater attacks it is believed that the criminal is plotting to become a dark lord and take over the country. Eventually this person helos defeat Voldemort and becomes an auror where they chase themselves across the globe and find the magical signiture at the scene of every crime they go to. After finally discovering the truth when the person is thought to be the criminal in disguise and is caught does the placement of a magucal signiture no longer hold up in court as evidence.

Firstly, this person cannot be a death eater and must actively work to stop Voldemort.

Secondly, the original criminal is well and truly dead and doesn't make an appearance.

Lastly, make the chase take a long time and show the true incompetence of the ministry and its law enforcement.


** I would greatly like to see what *Rorschach's Blot* could do with this. Make a Wish is still one of my all time favourite fics.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.
