I remember reading a series focused on Lily Moon, her older brother and Lavender Brown. At least one part of the series was about the relationship between Lavender and the brother. Does anyone remember this?


** I cannot help with this one, but if you forgive that Lily Moon is in fact dead (fallen in the Battle of Hogwarts), I can give you [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/107123][Lavender/Moon Tales by Northumbrian]]. And you get flirty werewolf on the top of it for free! Background and prequel of the story is in linkao3(Hunters and Prey by Northumbrian).

  February 2000 Newly Qualified (in record time) Auror Harry Potter remains obsessed with “The List.” The ten people still wanted for their part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Their capture is essential. It will bring closure to the events of the past few years. Harry has set himself a target. He wants to see “The Last Death Eater” and the other nine captured before the second anniversary of the battle. His attempts to meet his target will bring heartbreak, danger, pain, and a lifechanging injury for one former DA member.
