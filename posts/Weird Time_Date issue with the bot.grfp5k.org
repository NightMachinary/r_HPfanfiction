I've noticed this twice now, but for two different fanfictions from FFN, updated and/or published on May 20th, when linked by the ffnbot, show a time of hours, rather than the date.

#+begin_quote
  "Every Potter who died on a Potter's Field always returned to the living." The dead are watching. The dead have always been watching. And when their Master jumps through time back to his fourth year and is promptly killed, they answer his call. Time travel! MoD!Harry

#+begin_quote
  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** That's what FFN itself shows if a fic was published/updated within 24 hours. Also the bot caches stuff so the info might be behind by a few days.

*** So the bot will pull from a cache when linking fics, rather than pulling from the site directly?

**** Unless the fic has never been linked before, yes. You can see the review counts and stuff are usually slightly behind.
