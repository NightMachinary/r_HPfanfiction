I'm curious to see a relationship between him and a female OC where she's not completely head over heels for him. I frequently stumble upon those types of fics that characterize Draco as some kind, perfect, caring, affectionate Slytherin do-gooder which I find really uninteresting. I'd like to see a fic that addresses more complexities of Draco's character and predicaments and how a female character responds to them.

Got any suggestions?
