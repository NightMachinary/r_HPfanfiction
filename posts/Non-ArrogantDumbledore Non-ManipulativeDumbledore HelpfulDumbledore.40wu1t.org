** Canon.

Edit: To avoid being a complete shitpost, here's a good Dumbledore fic. Short and well-written. linkffn(9079271)

Not necessarily what you're asking for, but it's badass Dumbledore. One cannot simply have enough badass Dumbledore.

*** Canon Dumbledore is helpful, to be sure, but non-manipulative? Not a chance. He's a politician and a part-time general, so being able to manipulate well is necessary. You don't get to the positions he holds by just being a kindly, grandfatherly teacher.

And non-arrogant? That's debatable. He admits to making mistakes, but I'm not sure that anyone can hold so tight to so many secrets and so much information without the implicit belief that others can't be trusted with the secrets and/or can't help with the planning/analysis. That's at least a little arrogant, even if correct.

So Dumbledore isn't perfect. That's a good thing. Having some questionable morality and choices makes him a more interesting character.

Also, if you completely remove manipulations, arrogance, and that sort of thing, I'm not sure there's any way to keep him from being completely senile. He's much better off if he really does know more than he lets on and is plotting in the background than if the face he tends to show people is really all there is to him.

I know that people around here hate "Bad Dumbledore" stories, but the mere fact that there's enough in canon to make such a twist possible is one of the reasons he's an interesting character. It's also one of the reasons why so much HP fanfiction is possible - there's far more variability in how the characters can be reinterpreted than in most other franchises.

**** Indeed. Though I think "Manipulative Dumbledore" usually means "manipulates Harry".

***** True, but... doesn't he? The mere fact that he tightly restricts the information Harry gets is itself a means of controlling and influencing a person.

For example, when they went to get Slughorn, why not tell Harry that the professor used to be fond of Lily and that he's hoping that Harry's presence will encourage Slughorn to accept the job... so be polite, because we need him. Probably because he wanted Harry to act "natural," which is reasonable. But it's still manipulative - he manipulated Slughorn by bringing a student who didn't need to be there and he manipulated (influenced, though control of information) Harry into behaving in a manner that was most conducive to Dumbledore's personal goals.

There are so many other times when he withheld information from Harry without very good reasons. He tightly restricted contact with Harry after 4th and 5th years, despite the fact that Death Eaters couldn't be watching muggle post. And with invisible guards there after 5th year, was there really way to pass short notes?! Mad-Eye Moody of all people doesn't know how to pass secure messages?!

He couldn't tell Harry the prophecy lest Voldemort see it in his mind... but what about the first part that Voldemort already knew? Telling Harry that he /can/ stop the Dark Lord might actually have been a little inspiring. Might have made him feel less outmatched or overwhelmed.

Dumbledore arranged it so that Harry couldn't get to the Resurrection Stone until he was walking to his death... at which point the spirits all encouraged him to keep walking to his death. You can interpret it positively (he didn't want Harry to be distracted by its use, but wanted Harry to have comfort at the end) or negatively (the stone was a trap created by Death to bring back shades that would encourage the user to join them), but either way he was still trying to direct and influence Harry's actions.

And these are just cases where you don't need a nasty conspiracy theory to explain them - manipulative, but not necessarily in a very bad way. There are others that are a lot more suspicious, like at the end of Philosopher's Stone where Harry mentions Flamel and Dumbledore says, "Oh, you know about Nicolas? ... â€œYou did do the thing properly, didn't you?"

What "thing?" And in what way was it "properly"? Sounds an awful lot like Harry was /supposed/ to investigate what was going on and chase down a mystery. It's possible that Dumbledore only means to praise Harry for doing his research before charging into danger, but it's a very odd way of putting it.

Anyway, a Dumbledore that isn't manipulating Harry - that is to say, influencing and directing him towards what Dumbledore hopes will be the best way of eliminating Voldemort once and for all - is one that wouldn't really be canon and wouldn't make much sense. It's not really a question of "if."

The real questions are more along the lines of: Just how ruthless is he, really? Who/what/how much is he really willing to sacrifice? How much of his grandfatherly image is still true and how much is a superficial mask? How many events has he actively interfered with and how much has he been relying on luck?

There's a lot of different ways those questions can be answered, leading to lots of different versions of Dumbledore for fanfiction stories.

****** It's not just the actions he took that are often questionable, it's also and even more the actions he didn't take - like protecting Harry when it was needed. That Snape could act as he did is unforgivable, and the way Harry was left to be bullied and hated when Dumbledore didn't set things straight was deplorable. And that doesn't even touch the "does nothing about the Dursleys" thing.

Very true, but I was trying to present an absolute minimal case that as few debatable points as possible. With Slughorn, for example, we know what Dumbledore knows and there's simply no denying that he's being manipulative.

With Snape, in contrast, we could debate how much Dumbledore knows about what Snape is doing. Technically, we don't actually know. I think he should and, if he doesn't (especially given how interested he is in both Snape and Harry!), that's actually a reason to criticize his ability to be a good Headmaster. What's more, given Snape's behavior in front of Dumbledore, it's reasonable to conclude that Dumbledore doesn't really mind it - and one might reasonably speculate that he approves.

But we don't know. It's possible to dispute this and that point in a case built on such examples, no matter how many there are and how strong the case is cumulatively. So instead I wanted to make a case that's less open to dispute. Once we all agree that, yes, Dumbledore is manipulative, then we can discuss how much and what that means. But I wanted to help get people to agree on that first point, if possible.

******** So imo the books are written in such a way that things generally happen because they work thematically rather than because they make sense in terms of the characters motivations and prior actions. So Hogwarts has an "evil" potions professor because of course a magic school would have one "evil" professor that is a complete dick to the main character. Not because Rowling thought through Dumbledore's exact reasoning's for hiring a professor who is terrible at dealing with students. Now looking at all of the characters as being "real people" with real motivations for their actions is a valid way of analyzing the story, and then Dumbedore's actions are best explained with senile, or manipulative. But Rowling didn't write like GRRM, so its also valid to take that into account when analyzing it and not consider the characters other than Harry/Hermione/Ron as necessarily having that level of detail. I'm pretty sure Rowling didn't intend Dumbledore to be overly manipulative or senile, she just didn't consider it necessary to wonder about why Dumbledore didn't do anything about Snape as Snape was just a part of the story she wanted to weave.

This is true of the first couple of books because they are kids books - fairy tales, basically. You don't wonder or ask why the evil stepmother is evil, she just is. She has to be for the story to work.

This is no longer acceptable by books 4 and 5, however, because by that point they have become young adult books. In that genre, things like character motivation are no longer dispensible. They /matter/ because the readers are more demanding than little kids.

What's more, you can't have them matter in books 4 and 5 but pretend that they don't matter in books 1 and 2. Not only would it just not be right in principle, because they are after all the same story, but one of the characters explicitly attempts to justify their actions and explain their motivations! Yes, and it happens to be Dumbledore! He spends more than a little time trying to justify his decisions to Harry - including decisions he made right at the start of book one.

The situation with Snape is no better. As the series ends, we learn a lot about why Dumbledore trusted him, what Snape did, and how Dumbledore treated him. That right there makes Dumbledore's handling of Snape legitimate grounds for critique. Contrast that with, say, Dumbledore's trust of Shacklebolt. We never hear anything about their relationship, so it wouldn't be very fair to critique it.

So, no, I don't think it's valid to ignore character motivation of secondary characters - at least major ones like Dumbledore and Snape. Not when they are sitting there in front of us, explaining their motives as part of trying to justify their actions.

This is one of the most fundamental tensions in JKR's books - the shift from kids books to young adult books introduces a bunch of problems. Problems which make a lot more fanfiction possible, so it's not as if I'm complaining, but we have to acknowledge that the problems not only exist, but were probably unavoidable. Even if she had written all the books in advance, there would still be problems because the expectations of the genres are too different.

*** I'm sorry, but even in canon, Dumbledore is generally mysterious, melodramatic, and manipulative. He may be well intentioned, brilliant, and entirely in the right in many of his decisions, but I would not go so far as to call him likeable.

Granted, this is subjective. But I never really thought he was someone I would find a good friend as much as someone I would want to be on the same side as.

** I've got a helpful Dumbledore in "Patron" and "Uncle Quentin's Spy", though while he's not manipulating Harry and co., he does his best to manipulate Death Eaters, the Ministry etc. in order to fight Voldemort, so I'm not sure if they fit your request. He's also quite ruthless when it comes to protecting the innocent.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.
