** "House Elves need to be bonded to a Witch or Wizard and therefore treating them like shit is ok" absurd on multiple levels. Dobby is doing fine as a free elf.

"Dumbledore had no choice to leave Harry miserable at the Dursleys and just wanted the best for Harry" Even if he has to live there... not even a single letter? Maybe visit once or twice? Send over some friends of his parents to tell him stories? Invite him to Hogwarts for a week each summer? No, none of those. Either negligence or purpose is at play here. Just leave the black kid with the KKK members and certainly don't offer him any hope for the future.

Idk. Canon Dumbledore doesn't seem like the guy to plan for some child's life to be miserable. I think JKR just didn't really realize the full impact of Dumbledore's statement when he said he knew all along what was going to happen to Harry at the Dursleys.

***** Even aside from the fact that the level of Harry abuse shown in fics is far, far beyond what is shown in the books (seriously, practically the first time we see Harry he's sassing the Dursleys "Make Dudley get it [the mail]". That's not the behavior of a beaten down child), I think the best explanation is the Dumbledore didn't know that Harry's childhood wasn't going to be a happy one.

Just that Harry's childhood wasn't going to be a /magical/ one. For someone who's always had magic and grew up with magic, I could see how living in the mundane world could be considered a dark and unhappy time compared to living in a magical household..

*** Snape is by far one of my favorite characters in Harry Potter and, in my opinion, making him a “good bloke” does a disservice to his character.

I think he was a net positive in the war, I think he did his best to protect students when they were truly in danger (Harry Potter's cursed broom, detention with Hagrid in the forest while headmaster, etc) but none of that means he was a great person. He was a complete asshole with very little to no compassion for anyone other than Lily Evans or, perhaps, Dumbledore. His obsession with Lily Evans is borderline insanity, clearly the product of a broken psychy only barely held together with duct tape and occlumency.

But, on the whole, I think the role he played in the war was extremely important, he truly and cunningly convinced Voldemort of his loyalties, and he was, without a doubt, one of the bravest characters in the entire series, perhaps only outshined by Sirius Black and Harry Potter.

I'm not sure I'd go so far as to name my kid after him, though.

My point is that he's a complex character and I love him.

(Regardless of how you feel about HPMOR, you should probably read Eliezer Yudkowsky's short, HP-based [[http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/realistic-viewpoints][essay]] on the matter of writing villains who could genuinely think they're right and yet not be idiots.)

For instance, I like [[/u/Starfox5]]'s idea that Grindelwald's solely magic-based ideology meant a lot of Muggle-born wizards and witches flocked to his cause, which fed back into the purebloods' prejudice by painting them, with evidence in hand, that Muggle-borns are supposedly unstable and yearning to destroy the Wizarding World as we know it just whenever.

**** In canon it's not a strawman. JKR has pointed out the obvious connection between the blood supremacy ideology and Nazis. Neither is rational, and it's hard to see how one could even have a rational argument in favor of this. Maybe you'd prefer to stick to what makes a good villain, but, well, that ideology is really suitable for that goal.

The Grindlewald thing doesn't make sense to me. Why would Muggleborns, who are from the non-magical world, flock to Grindlewald's movement (which didn't really have anything to do with blood supremacy, a movement which at least had its roots as far back as Slytherin himself)? If anything, the purebloods would be more inclined to join since they see themselves are the betters of Muggles by birth, and many of them hated Muggleborns long before Grindlewald was around.

And while Hermione turned out fine, I don't know if all Muggle-borns (especially in less accepting countries than Britain) would identify that much with their Muggle roots. Personal values aside, wouldn't a Harry who was genuinely born to the Dursleys (and that was totally a possibility) be just the type to turn Grindelwaldian? Consider Snape, who essentially had a Muggle upbringing, but with an anti-magic Muggle for a father, which must have played a big part in him becoming a DE.

Malfoy did have alibies with the help of polyjuice and imperius. It's not unreasonable for Dumbledore to think that Voldemort ordered more people to try to assassinate him.

Ofc Dumbledore did know that Malfoy needed to kill him and other students might become collateral. I think Dumbledore could have found some other way to suicide without endangering the rest of the students for Malfoys sake.

As for the unforgivables, they can't exactly prove Draco used the Imperius because Rosmerta didn't know who did it, and priori incantatem can probably be dealt with. the only thing they can prove, is that Draco attempted to cast a spell that started with Cru at Harry. I'm sure a lawyer could say that Draco only wanted to transfigure Harry into a crustacean as a prank, before Potter mutilated him with a dark cutting spell.

Well maybe Veritaserum since that supposedly can't be resisted, although pretty easy to bypass if you bribed whoever administers the potion. Same with mind-reading, corrupt legilimancer.

As far as questioning Draco about the necklace or wine, keep in mind that when people think they know the answer they rarely ask the question, and Dumbledore in canon has shown plenty times that hes not above that.

So if Dumbledore assumed there was a second assassin, he probably wouldn't even think to question the first one especially since he needed Draco for his suicide plot.
