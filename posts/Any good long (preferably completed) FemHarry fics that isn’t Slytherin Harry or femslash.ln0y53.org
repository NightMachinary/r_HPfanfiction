Pretty much just as the title says! I'm new to fem!harry so I'm not familiar with what the fics are like I just know I don't like reading Harry in Slytherin and I prefer het stories!

(Is it too much to ask for her name not to be Harriet? üò¨ Jk lol, if it's a good fic rec it anyway!)


** K this first one in ginna rec has lesbian harry but considering it's not a major thing in the plot it would imo be stupid to skip it to avoid femslash [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11517506/1/The-odds-were-never-in-my-favour]]

My next one has no official pairing and the chances of femslash are insanely low it however is slytherin harry not the I'm so cunning and I'm lord black potter etc. But for the nature of the plot she's not exactly a gryffindor [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense]]

This next fic is one of my favorite type of fics but there is a sadly little amount [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13510736/1/Spells-in-Silence]] not slytherin harry harry just chills tf and explores

** [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/cepls-introduction-to-femharrys.html][Which fem!Harry]] you want: always-girl or turned-to-be-girl (or returned-*)? If the former, ‚ÄúVideus Charm‚Äù linkffn(13197260) is one of the best (except, I am not totally sure, why she is a female). ‚ÄúPranking the Tournament‚Äù linkffn(13132217) is from the other group.

  Some may consider him useless, but Ludo Bagman has been absolutely inspired by muggle sports channels. As a result, a camera charm has been created. It is ready to catch all the action of the Triwizard Tournament and broadcast it into every home over Wizarding Europe. Now Harriet is on the big screen, and the crowd is going to see a lot more than they bargained for. FEM/Harry.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects. COMPLETE! Edited as of 11/13/19!

  When a fragment of a darkest soul takes refuge in the body of an innocent baby, life is not one lived unscathed - nor unaffected. 11 year old Sadie Potter has lived her whole life knowing this as truth. Now, the time comes for the rest of the world around her to know the same. But will she find help, acceptance and comfort from those around her, or adversity and hate born of fear?
