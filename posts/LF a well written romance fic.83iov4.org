Hey, Just looking for a romance fiction. Perhaps that is the wrong word choice: I prefer a good plot, with romance secondary. This might be as scarce as hens teeth, but worth a shot ;)

I do not mind smut, so long as it is not over the top. It ahould not be a centrepoint of the plot (kill Voldemort using some mysterious power of love while doing it like bunnies) by any means.

I do not enjoy fictions where the so called "love" is shallow and undefined. I do not enjoy fictions where you have "Hi I'm X and I'm 11, I love you so much, so we're going to get married and kill Voldemort by the end of the first term"

I apologize for being so picky, but I was wondering what you might suggest for this aspect of fiction - with good plot, with COMPLEMENTARY pairings / romance which ADDS to the story without being superficial, "fake", and cringe-worthy.

As for exclamation marks? I tend to avoid evil! and !bashing, but I'm willing to give it a try. I have no strong feelings over the Weasleys or Dumbledore (I particularly enjoy it when he is portrayed as a good man who makes mistakes, but ultimately with good motives... in short a realistic character). Pairings? No Draco, Cho or Voldemort. Otherwise anything goes.

And in return I hope to answer a few other requests... :)

Thanks!

  There's nobody like her. She's smart, beautiful, and witty. Unfortunately for Harry, she's also engaged. When Fleur Delacour returns to Hogwarts to help prepare for the war against Voldemort, Harry has to manage an uneasy balance between the demands of the war and the demands of the heart. Harry/Fleur during HBP.

** Linkffn(3561592)

My all time favorite fic. It's Lily and James with lots of action. It doesn't get romantic till a few chapters in, but it's very well written.

  Although Harry and Ginny both survived the war, each bears scars from their year apart. The end of a war and the death of a brother don't make for an easy romance, but as long as there is the faintest, slimmest, wildest chance... The Weasleys gained and lost a member in one night. Will they ever be whole again? Best Romance and Best Drama/Angst in the 2014 HP Fanfic Fan Poll Awards
