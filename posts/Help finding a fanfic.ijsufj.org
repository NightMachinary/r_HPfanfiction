I have been looking for this fanfiction for over a month now. It's and TUA fic, where Luther locks Klaus in a closet to teach him a lesson. Klaus keeps stealing his siblings clothes so Luther locks him in a closet for a hour or two. When Luther and the rest of his siblings go to check on him, klaus acts normal at first. When they tease Klaus, by telling him that they were planning on leaving him in the closet for longer, Klaus lost it. Turns out Klaus was having flashbacks, causing a panic attack. When they let him out he tried to run away, ending with Klaus falling down the stairs and passing out. If anyone could find the fanfic based on the horrible description I gave, i would be forever grateful!!


** Since I don't recognize those character names I think you posted to the wrong community.

** I think I've read it - is it [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/24407737][this]]? In future you'd be better posting to [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] or [[/r/theumbrellaacademy][r/theumbrellaacademy]] though!
