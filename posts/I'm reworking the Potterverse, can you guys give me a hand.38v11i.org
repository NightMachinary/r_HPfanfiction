I moved most of my information to a google doc [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cF4aN_8awuLslvG-isHPG6pyGe49-Ynv96GrwRm7e7Q/edit][here]].

Basically I am adding a bunch of ideas and aspects from American Gods, the "Supernatural" television show, and typical mythologies from various cultures.

My most major changes are that titans/gods are the origin of everything magical, I've altered Voldemort's goals, ambitions, and introduced some changes to the events surrounding WWII.

I'd love to answer any questions you can think of for me, as having questions to answer will help me smooth out any issues in my lore.


** Funny you mention that, I'm in the on again off again process of writing a fic but i wanted to have a solid back story i could refer to, so i started writing a history book that harry is reading in in my fiction. Perhaps a bit unnecessary but hey i got side-tracked because it was intriguing to me to create this history.

I go into some magic basics, the origins, focii, the difference between dark and light magic. Admittedly i took some ideas from Raining Ink, but i messaged her and she gave me full permission to cannibalize her universe for the creation of my own. If you want I can PM you the file or i can upload it to GoogleDrive and share it

** This looks like it could be a book series. If you DID make it into a book series, I'd def. buy it.

*** My goal is to write at least one short novel on some of Voldemort's early followers who break off and start fighting against him once they realize where he is taking his 'movement'. Maybe write a little about characters from Harry's parents generation. (preferably not the big wigs though)
