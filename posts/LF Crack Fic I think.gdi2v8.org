Hello.

I am looking for a Fic that I barely remember, but that I enjoyed.

The only real big part I remember was that the Weasleys eventually move to Egypt and Ron has such massive damage done to his testicles that he has to live as a girl.

Any ideas?


** Yeoch, I wonder why they'd do that to poor Ron? What did his OOC alter evil twin do this time?

**** Well that's messed up. Evil twins are the worst. Especially when the weasleys couldn't afford to get a name for the both of them. :(

***** Don't worry, it's okay.

Dumpster fires are made of some of the worst shit in the world yet we can't help but gawk at the fuckery of it. It's a normal human response to be attracted to one. I mean, how else would SAO get any fans?

****** The big thing that drew me into a lot of RobSt's fics was the originality of some of the ideas he used, though said ideas were often more minor elements of the story. As for this one, the heroes' actions are often questionable at best, but the scene with the beater bats will always be hilarious.

******* Yes that's so sad. There's always a shard of originality at the start but it turns out every single story's like a copy of the next, with little variation. Harry/hermione with lord op harry and underage stuff.

It's so hard to find originality in fanfics, especially when you've been reading for a long time. You know what, we could share the rare gems we've found over the years to eachother! Then we would both be able to benefit because we'd both find completely new ideas!

Do you want to do that? If we do, though, then make sure to not rec popular fics AT ALL.

  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.

**** It gets resolved fairly early on, then turns into a typical Gamer fic. Bit disappointed because I was expecting more conflicts with harry
