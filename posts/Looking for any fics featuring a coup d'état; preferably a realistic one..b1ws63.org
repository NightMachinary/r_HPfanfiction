Any crossovers are fine, as is the universe the coup takes place in. I'd prefer if politics played an important part while not turning into a classic "Lord Harry" fic with him controlling 75 percent of the Wizengamot seats right off the bat. The more realistic, the better!

​

Thanks to anyone who recommends.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Memento Mori linkffn(3669186) is a long canon-compliant fic which presents the story of HP from the perspective of the Malfoys. Among others, it shows an inside view of Voldemort's coup in DH.

Btw, don't worry about it being unfinished, you can stop reading at Voldemort's defeat and skip all next-gen stuff.

** Divided and Entwined linkffn(11910994) features a coup started by muggleborns because of Voldemort's rise, influence, and the negative culture it thrived in and is very realistic. I enjoyed it a lot because it goes into military tactics and the worldbuilding is amazing.

The Resistance of Azkaban linkffn(2980054) is almost the same except it features older Harry being a military leader for the “good” side in a world where Voldemort won, so it's about them trying to fight and design a coup.
