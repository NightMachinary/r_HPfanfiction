What's really annoying is that I could have sworn this fic was listed in TV Tropes--Harry Potter fanfic recs but now I can't find it.

I don't remember a great deal of it.

It was set during Sorcerer's Stone, and something, I'm not sure what, made Harry decide to write letters to Dudley.

He also started being nicer to Neville.

Dudley eventually starts writing back, at first somewhat sarcastically, but later begins urging Harry to be careful with the sneaking around business, eventually urging him to go to a teacher with his suspicions rather than try anything himself.

Dudley actually came to visit Hogwarts at the end of the Stone snafu, and when Malfoy insulted them, Dudley punched him in the face.

For the life of me, I can't remember what it was.
