Exactly as it says. Looking for stories where Neville is Boy-Who-Lived, not Harry. Don't care how it's done.

Any rating is fine. Don't like Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione as a pairing, but if written well I suppose it's fine.

Would rather have it be completed, but if it has a lot of episodes it's fine if it's not completed I suppose.

Thanks for the help.


** linkffn(Stages of Hope By: kayly silverstorm) is half an answer. Harry and co travel to a parallel dimension where Neville was the BWL (along with other changes) rather than Harry. Harry is still the BWL in his own dimension so I guess that doesn't resolve all your requirements (technically) but it's a good read.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** linkffn(8541055) Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry has to work his way up from absolutely nothing, and the only people who don't underestimate him are Neville and Daphne, who witnessed his power at the end of second year.

Second year Harry > The entire student body of Hogwarts.

  In a world where Neville Longbottom was marked as Voldemorts equal, Harry Potter is determined not to be his Inferior, and that leaves only one option... Not Slash.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

  Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter just another orphan. Without the scar on his forehead Harry is free to choose his own path. His Slytherin sorting is only the first surprise to his parents' old friends. Darkish themes. Dark!Harry. Rating could go up to M later.
