** Argh i remember reading fanfic 2 but I can't recall the title either. If it's the same one, Harry creates a long game plan after realizing how attached he is to the Elite and Voldie that he keeps secret. He kills Voldie, and after peace comes, ends up as Minister. He receives word some years later that Dumbledore is on death's door from old age (finally) and using his minister power goes to azkaban, manages to convince the Elite he isn't a traitor, frees them secretly and revives Voldemort. Then he slips them all in to meet Dumbledore on his death bed so they can gloat about the coming future and he can't do anything to stop them because he is dying. I do hope the extra info I gave helps you find it

*** That's definitely it! If I remembered how the beginning started I could probably find it easier. Unfortunately, none of the combinations of these keywords "Harry, Revive, Voldemort, Minister Harry" pull anything up.
