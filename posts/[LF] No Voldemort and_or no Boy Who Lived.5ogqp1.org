#+begin_quote
  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

  Being the recipient of the Order of Merlin and also having his picture on the Chocolate Frog Cards was not a big feat for Healer Tom Riddle. As Head Healer at St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, nothing much surprised him. Little did he know, his life was about to be turned upside down by the arrival of a bespectacled boy with messy hair through the Veil.

** linkffn(10210053), "The Untitled Tome", which is absolutely fantastic.

linkffn(7613196), "The Pureblood Pretense", which has a Riddle - but not quite a Voldemort - and no boy-who-lived.

I'm pretty sure [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]["Prince of the Dark Kingdom"]] doesn't have a boy-who-lived.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

  Suppose Tom Riddle never bothers to show mercy, and Harry Potter dies with his parents? What would that mean for the world, to have no Boy-Who-Lived to save them? ("A couple of stubborn kids" just doesn't have the same ring to it.)
