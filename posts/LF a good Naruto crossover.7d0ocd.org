Other than "Itachi, is that a baby?", and somewhat more serious than that one.

And no slash please.


** I personally liked linkffn(Auryn by Araceil). It's sad that most crossovers tend to be on very long hiatus/abandoned.

Anyway, is there a way to download it from there? FFD doesn't work on in there.

****** While I don't condone harassment, it probably would have stopped if she'd had the courage to actually say it was abandoned and turned off review alerting. Deleting the story is just petty in my opinion.

I don't know how you'd download the archive copy, sorry. Maybe see if there's an existing file somewhere? Surely someone has it...

******* Supposedly people called her "bitch", "whore" and other nasties, and she was even getting death threats. All this for slow updates. So I'm not surprised she did that because while being annoying is bearable, being a fucking shitstain on humanity is not.

** linkffn(8525251) has Hermione reincarnated as Sakura, resulting in a very different Team 7 dynamic.

linkffn(7251431) has Hiruzen and Orochimaru teleported to Potterverse, interacting with characters there.

Both are quite serious.

  Harry was never the only person with a penchant for tripping into the most absurd of situations. Reincarnated!Hermione. Somewhat darker than the usual take on Naruto. Political machinations. Character progression. Strong friendship, no romance.

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
