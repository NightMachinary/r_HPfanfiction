It was a weird fic, but I kinda liked it and would like to read it again if you could help me find it. He wakes up from his dead body lying in a crystal coffin in diagon alley, then proceeds to go to gringotts. He claims a bunch of money and heirlooms from other families, including a goblin made tiara that was supposedly owned by Molly's Prewitt family.


** This almost fits, but no heirlooms: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6590860/1/The-death-of-Harry-Potter][The Death of Harry Potter.]]

Any idea on the length of the fic or whether it was in progress, completed, or abandoned when you last read it?

*** That's the one I was thinking of. I mixed two stories together it seems, with regards to the heirlooms and such.

****** Nah, it's always easier to search for phrases that appear in the text - especially something like a crystal coffin which doesn't appear all that often - than for ideas relating to a specific fic.
