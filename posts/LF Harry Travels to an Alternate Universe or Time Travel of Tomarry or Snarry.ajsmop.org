Hello! :)

So I'm looking for that Harry travels to an alternate universe through an object, deity, anything really. Preferred that Harry is smart but also kind and cunning but not necessary. :)

Or Harry time travels to Tom's time or Maruders time. I'd like either to be a Tomarry or Snarry and either can be combined of time travel and Alternate Universe. I'd appreciate it very much. I'm an avid reader. Haha. :D

  History of Magic has something to teach after all, and two resourceful students decide that the key to having any future at all lies in the past, and in Tom Riddle's heart. Assuming he has one.

** I have both these bookmarked but didn't reread in a while. Maybe you've read them already.

Wear Me Like A Locket Around Your Throat linkao3(7189349)

I know I liked this one a lot or at least somewhat.

Harry Potter And The Shadowed Light linkao3(10404927)

This one can't recall how I liked it. I'm working on arranging my bookmarks better.

  “This is Mr Riddle, one of our Slytherin prefects. I'm sure he'll make you feel right at home. Mr Riddle, this is Harrison Peters. He's just been sorted into Slytherin and will be joining you in sixth year,” Dumbledore announced jovially, though Tom could see that sliver of constant suspicion in his gaze that had never quite faded.“Harry,” the boy hurried to correct. “Just Harry.”And then he stuck his hand out. How... plebeian, Tom noticed with delight. Walburga would probably faint.

  Unsatisfied with his post-war life, Harry decides to get to the root of all of his problems when that root was still working at Borgin and Burkes shop in the late 40s. He's the Master of Death, damn it, he can do what he wants for once in his life.Tom Riddle isn't particularly happy about working at a small, dingy shop for magical artifacts, no matter how interesting those artifacts are. He's even less happy when an insufferable stranger sets up the most obnoxious flower shop right across the street.What follows would be a romantic comedy, if it weren't for politics.
