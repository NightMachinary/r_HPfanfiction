** NoodleHammers For the Love of Magic has a veela race that's all about sex, not caring in the slightest for social norms since they aren't human. Fleur is a big part of that, and she gets with harry. I guess she kind of cheats on him, since she sleeps with other girls, but Harry's not bothered. Warning though, the later chapters are pretty dark and for a lot of people insulting. linkffn(11669575)

**** It's the first one that I have found that makes sense, is explained well, and isnt just full of people claiming veela are just humans with allure and should be treated exactly as humans. He acknowledges that a different race will have different morals, different laws and makes us accept that very well. Fleur is actually an enjoyable character, not the sweetest woman to ever exist with no sexual needs nor the bitchy better than thou whore that is always portrayed.

  Fleur Delacour is much more than her portrayal in canon. From the snotty, self-centered child in GoF to a strong fighter, loyal Order member, and Bill Weasley's love in DH, she grew a lot. This story explores that growth and how Bill came to love her. Follows canon with many details of my own. This is a repost - more coming soon!

** Depends on your definition of cheating, I suppose. If you want to get technical she cheats on her fiancée with Harry in linkffn(Dagger and Rose), but the fiancée is both arranged, a scumbag, and (as I recall, it's been a while) someone Fleur never loved in the first place.

'Course, DaR has plenty of other stuff you might find objectionable. Like the fact that it's written in third-person present, or some of said fiancée's actions in the second half of the story w.r.t. Fleur.

Also, what wallflower means is basically "a shy and awkward person who doesnt like crowds". I havent read most of these fics but I'm so used to seeing it in Harry/Fleur that I'm sure its there.

  Harry had no idea why the boys in the Great Hall drooled over themselves as the students from Beuxbatons made their entrance, but he knew better than to let an opportunity slip. He hurriedly stole Ron's sandwich. It tasted gloriously.
