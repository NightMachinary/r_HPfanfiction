I recall Harry calling Hermione my 'wand'. He accepted his titles early so he could become Hermione's sponsor over Lucius Malfoy. I remember that the older students wore very provocative clothing as it got closer to graduation.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
