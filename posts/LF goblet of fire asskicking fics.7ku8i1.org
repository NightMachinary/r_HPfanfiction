Im interrested in fics that doesnt follow cannon at all. Specially im looking for fics where: *he gets out of the gof contract as he didnt put it in/enter himself/is underage/because its against his will *refuses to compete. *kills the dragon/speaks Parseltounge to the dragon/doesnt show for first task and doesnt lose magic *kills all the merpeople/saves hermione and leaves Ron behind. *Flies over the hedges in 3rd task/camps out and lets someone else win. *everyone thinks harry cheated, harry goes "fuck you all" and changes school/doesn't forgive anyone/becomes an annoying little shit and pisses everone off

Crackfics are welcome too, as long as 4'th year cannon plot goes out the window.

Please no slash :)

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
