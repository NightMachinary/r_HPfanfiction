Any fics where Harry concentrates on either rebuilding or building Potter fortune after the war or during it?

No "I'll use it to fight Voldemort", just naked self-interest and greed. No crack and no slash.


** The only book that the evil Dursleys ever let Harry read is [[https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Ferengi-Rules-Acquisition-guidelines/dp/153357295X][The Complete Ferengi Rules Of Acquisition: Aphorisms, guidelines, and principles to life in Ferengi Culture]].

Take a minute to [[https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition][look through them]] and imagine how Harry's adherence to the Rules would change canon, especially Numbers 6, 17, 21, 74, 168, 190, 208, & 285.

** I mean, truth be told, there's abosultly nothing to rebuild. He is probably one of the richest people in Wizarding Britain. One Galleon is worth *extreme* amounts of money in Wizarding Economy. How much can a Galleon buy? Well, Molly Weasley, in book 2, used at max two Galleons to buy school supplies for 5 of her children. All of school supplies. Including Lockhart's books. And Harry has a vault full of galleons. I could go more in depth into Wizarding economy, but I'm already rambling. In any way, don't take my rambling as me saying your wish is stupid. God no. I just wanted to share my two cents on the topic.

*** The problem is, we don't know if it's true or not. The economy in Harry Potter is not fleshed at all, and, beyond the 1 Galleons = 5 £ (don't even remember where we get this), we only have a few elements to compare :

- The newspaper costs around 2 Knuts (Harry gives this to an Owl to get the prophet in PS)
- A Wand cost around 7 Galleons (price Harry paid to Ollivander, we don't know if the price is fixed or can vary depending of the wand)
- 1 000 Galleons are enough to finance a joke shop, premise included.

For the rest, nothing. And because it's a magical world, we can't even make a comparison with the Muggle World. Like the Weasleys are poor, yet neither had any problem to feed their children, and even managed to get brooms good enough to play in House Team for at least 5 of their children.

Harry's vault (described as containing mountains of gold) seem to be enough for him to finish his education, yet Harry is conscious that it would only be the case if he doesn't squander it (by buying gold cauldron for example).

​

I know Fanon loves to make Harry extremely rich (and forget about it after making Harry buy a 15 bedroom trunk and Acromentula' silk robes), but in my opinion, the Potter were just a "Wealthy" family (above the Upper Middle Class, but not by much), and were a far cry from families like the Malfoy when it came to money.

Rowling, I believe. She claims it is about 5 pounds. This is super inacurate tho, since the purchasing power is vastly different.

#+end_quote

Like I said. I can go very more in depth into the economy. This makes sense. They are only poor in the sense that they have little money. But the money, unlike with muggles, is relativly worthless. They can use magic to get pretty much everything. Again, I can go in depth on this. Why does it exist then? For convience sake. You could learn how to make a badass looking table, or you can give someone 5 knuts or so to do it for you. That's pretty much it. The only things of real big value(therefore costing a lot of galleons) would be things like supergood and new brooms, and magical items with complex enchantments like Omniculars which cost 10 galleons.

#+begin_quote
  "Omnioculars," said the saleswizard eagerly. "You can replay action ... slow everything down ... and they flash up a play-by- play breakdown if you need it. Bargain - ten Galleons each."

  A Wand cost around 7 Galleons (price Harry paid to Ollivander, we don't know if the price is fixed or can vary depending of the wand)
#+end_quote

The price makes sense if you think about it. It is literally the only think you need to be able to live comfortably. 7 galleons is a lot, but quite small for what it offers. That and unless you are from a pureblood family, this is funded for you. Remember Tom Riddle? He got enough money to buy Supplies and a wand from the Hogwarts Orphan Fund. Purebloods can use family wands. Not as good, but good enough.

#+begin_quote
  And because it's a magical world, we can't even make a comparison with the Muggle World
#+end_quote

I'd say its fundemeny massivly different. Muggle economy opperates on Supply and Demand. Wizarding Economy doesn't have to. They have infinite supply.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Education is free. And, yes, mountain of gold is enough to survive until the end of education amd more.

You need to remember that one, Harry never had any money in his life, Two, he doesn't know anything about Wizarding economy.

With how much Money Harry has he is likely the Richest Person in Wizarding Britain. Maybe Malfoys could compete, but no other family. Why Malfoys tho? Well, they are seen spending huge amounts of money, so it kinda makes sense.

***** But how can you know that Harry is the richest person around? I mean yeah he has a lot of gold in his vault so it's impressive but once again, it's not like we have a lot to make comparison.

If we ignore the one used to hide the Philosopher stone (which was empty without it), we only see 3 vaults in all the serie. So the Weasley are poorer than Harry ok (and a lot of other people), but I believe that the Lestrange are richer for exemple. In my opinion, a Vault full of artifacts such as goblin forged items has more monetary value than another vault just full of gold.

The potter may be wealthy, but they were new money (Pottermore does say that Harry's grandfather quadrupled the family fortune thanks to his hair care potion), they lived confortably but I doubt they could compete with the truly old family like the Black or the Lestrange. And after Sirius death, Harry does get a lot of money (sum not indicated), they imply it is equivalent (or not much inferior), to what he already has, and this is after the 1st blood war and the family was in disaray for 15 years.

As for the Malfoy, Harry didn't buy himself a firebolt because it would make a pretty big dent in his vault. The Malfoys bought 7 Numbus 2001 to make Draco part of the team, and while one Nimbus may cost less than a firebolt, the 7 together were probably a lot more expensive.

PS : As for the price of a wand, my only problem with it is that I do not know how Ollivander can make a living with it,since it seem to be inferior to the price of raw material, not to mention the manufacturing price. Licorn's hair cost 10 galleons each (as said by Slughorn in HBP), a wand with a Licorn core use several twined together. And it doesn't include the price of the wood, or the fact that other core seem more expensive (like the Phoenix's ones).

#+end_quote

We can compare him to the Lestranges at the very least whom from what we saw in the seventh book are about as rich as Harry. Considering that its likely that there are more non-pureblood families than pureblood, Harry automatically gets pushed to the "top 1%". Harry, Malfoys, Lestranges, are probably three of the richest families in Wizarding Britain.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

They don't have any artifacts. Just armor and creatures.

#+begin_quote
  The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures --- some with long spines, others with drooping wings --- potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown.
#+end_quote

The only artifact inside was the Horcrux.

#+end_quote

Why not? If you note, People Like Malfoys don't actually have jobs. They are very influencial, but they live off the inherited money. Potters always worked for their money. Meaning Potters always so an increase in funds, while the Malfoys saw a massive decrease. And Lucius has been spending a lot of money

#+begin_quote
  *Malfoy's been giving generously* to all sorts of things for years... Gets him in with the right people... then he can ask for favours... delay laws he doesn't want passed... Oh, he's very well connected, Lucius Malfoy....

  Lucius lived a rather good life with his family. Independently wealthy and therefore without any need to work, 

  Gaining respect and the good will of high-ranking individuals, through his fortune and family name

  Lucius' constant donations to important establishments were little more than bribing Fudge for classified information, delaying laws, and receiving undeserved rewards and recognitions.

  Harry does get a lot of money (sum not indicated), they imply it is equivalent (or not much inferior), to what he already has,

  “This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went on. “You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius's personal possessions.

  “Our problem,” he continued to Harry, as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”
#+end_quote

That is all that is said about his inhertence. "Reasonable amount of gold" could mean anything from 5 to a 1000 galleons.

#+begin_quote
  and this is after the 1st blood war and the family was in disaray for 15 years.
#+end_quote

And how is this relavant? Fighting wars in Wizarding World is cheap, and the gold doesn't dissapear if you don't use it.

#+begin_quote
  As for the Malfoy, Harry didn't buy himself a firebolt because it would make a pretty big dent in his vault.
#+end_quote

Not true. He didn't know the price, so he thought it *might* put a big dent in his vault.

#+begin_quote
  A large witch in front of Harry moved, and he was able to read the sign next to the broom: ** THE FIREBOLT ** THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM-LINED, SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH, TREATED WITH A DIAMOND-HARD POLISH AND HANDNUMBERED WITH ITS OWN REGISTRATION NUMBER. EACH INDIVIDUALLY SELECTED BIRCH TWIG IN THE BROOMTAIL HAS BEEN HONED TO AERODYNAMIC PERFECTION, GIVING THE FIREBOLT UNSURPASSABLE BALANCE AND PINPOINT PRECISION. THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. *PRICE ON REQUEST.*

  Price on request... Harry didn't like to think how much gold the Firebolt would cost.

  The Malfoys bought 7 Numbus 2001 to make Draco part of the team, and while one Nimbus may cost less than a firebolt, the 7 together were probably a lot more expensive.

He doesn't need to make a living with it. A wand pretty much gives you absolutely anything and everything you want. Muggles have to make a living because we need to buy food and stuff. A wizard doesn't need to. He can use magic.

***** Well, in terms of the value of money for living a relatively mundane life, money is pretty useless. But money in becomes pretty important the moment you start to want magical things.

Not really. There's nothing to say that you can make a super potion that you want. It's just tedious process. A wizard could most likely be completely self-sufficiant if he wanted to. But it is simply easier to buy it, yeah.

Anyway, my point is, that if a economic crash somehow happened in the Wizarding World, they wouldn't give a shit. It would barely affect them at all.

Just saying there could be, I don't think we know much about the financial situation of anyone except Harry, the Weasleys, the Malfoys and the Lestranges. There must be a few hundred families in Wizarding Britain, and I doubt many of them are as poor as the Weasleys.

Possibly. I don't think we ever got any canon confirmation for that. It is possible that Sirius did not actually inherit much of the money. We just don't know.
