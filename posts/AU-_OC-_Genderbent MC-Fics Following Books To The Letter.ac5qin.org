So, I've recently read some stories of the categories mentioned in the title. I enjoyed them, some more than others. BUT a lot of them had this one thing that bothered me to no end: they were basically just retelling the books. So my question is: Why? Why create an OC if they don't change anything? Why make Harry female if all that changes is his sex? Why make major changes to the HP universe when it doesn't impact the plot at all? I really, honestly am curious about this because why change major elements if they don't affect the main plot in any way whatsoever?


** [[/u/More_Cortisol]] is partially right, but I think another reason is that when first thinking up the OC/genderbent-character/whatever, the author really wants to see how that character would do in certain canon situations. They want to see their reaction at Voldemort's Resurrection, or in the Triwizard, or to discovering Pettigrew. And so they have to keep the canon events the same most of the time so that the timeline will still lead to those events they've been looking forward to.

*** Agreed. I know I've steered myself toward canon stations out of a want to see my character handle it. It's kind of like watching someone run an obstacle course. Sure, a new one for you would be cool, but at the same time, you want to see how you'd fare against the same one.

** Well, they wanted to. As for the reasons why they wanted to, who can say? My guess is at least some of them simply want to practice writing without the need for devising compelling plot/characters.

*** That is quite possible and don't get me wrong. As I said, I did enjoy some of those stories but I can't deny the disappointment I felt when the plot was basically identical to the books.

So, my post is less me ranting/criticizing and more me being honestly curious about the thought process behind such fics.

**** I understand. I think practice is part of it, as I said. It's daunting to formulate your own ideas and post them for anyone to see and pick apart. This way, they change just a little, put a bit of themselves into it, while also rewriting canon in their own developing style. There are plenty of people who are happy for these stories, obviously. Any new writer is almost guaranteed positive and constructive feedback going this route, I think.

** The best gender bending fic i've read is Weasley Girl by Hyaroo. Not only is it brilliantly characterised, it also uses the small(ish) change of Ron being born a girl (Veronica), to twist and distort canon like a butterfly effect. It starts with relatively small changes, which compound, leading to really great twists and surprises throughout the story, and its sequel.

  AU: The first wizarding friend Harry made wasn't Ronald Weasley... it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter in the Weasley clan for generations. And suddenly the future of the wizarding world, not to mention Harry's first year at Hogwarts, looked very different. Not a canon rehash, not a romance. STORY COMPLETE, SEQUEL POSTED

** Because the pple who write those kind of stories aren't the most creatives? Sure, I'm pretty biased towards gender bending in general but if you do it at least make something original.

From the few I've read and hated, the most common thing about them was how they bended the world so it stayed the same no matter what the gender bended MC did. Or just gender bending the MC so the author can pair it with some dude, to me that's just slash with extra steps :B

â€‹

There's also authors that in a way, want to explore writing a diferent gender and I get that, gotta learn some way or another but most of the time it's just annoying to read, specially if the MC remembers being whatever original gender it was and somehow turning gay because they changed gender. Like, I'm a dude, if somehow I woke up as a girl I wouldn't start liking dudes. Quote GB!Harry suddenly notices Draco and/or snape has a nice butt, no dude, just no.
