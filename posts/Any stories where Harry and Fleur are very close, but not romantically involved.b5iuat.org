** I think they flirt a lot here, but in the end it's FleurxBill and HxHr. Fair warning, I read it some time ago, so I can't remember it properly, but I think it includes heavy Weasley bashing, as well as a /lot/ of sexual themes. linkffn(6624958)

  Extreme measures are taken to distract Molly long enough for Bill to both neutralize a love potion and ask Harry to help make his engagement to Fleur possible. A kinder, smuttier alternative to Book Six's "An Excess of Phlegm" chapter. H/Hr, Bill/Fleur.

** There's linkffn(10752276) where Harry is raised by the Flamels, goes to Beauxbatons, and is best friends with Fleur (who he's the same age as) but is dating someone else. Unfortunately, it hasn't been updated in almost a year.

  What to do when your parents are immortal and your best friend is a fireball throwing Veela? Henry has no idea. But when the Triwizard Tournament comes to Beauxbatons, the young Flamel has to survive both his former family and the trouble of his own fame.

This part is complete, not sure if the second part is though, can't quite remember! If you like Harry/Rabastan though there's another doc called The Dark Roses, also on ao3 which I love!

***** I loved it! I normally hate mpreg more than anything, but here it was somewhat acceptable. The second part isn't complete, which as always is heartbreaking.

The better a story is, the worse it feels to reach this point where I'm about to click on next chapter, only to fall into this well of disappointment and despair when I can't find the button
