** They do in canon. They know when to fall in line behind someone more powerful than them, and they know when to stab them in the back in pursuit of power and esteem (or at least Vincent does). Those are the most important Slytherin traits. IQ is only a requisite for Ravenclaw.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.
