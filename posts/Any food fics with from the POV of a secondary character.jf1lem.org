I'm fed up reading about Harry... or Hermione or Snape sometimes... or Vold, very rarely.

Give me a fic starring Ron, or Pansy, or any of the Death Eaters, or even Argus Filch ffs! Novel-length, pls.


** Well Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce has Ron as a primary character while Harry is in the background for most the story and it is focused mostly on food and cooking for a while at least.

  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** I was trying to write a food fic with Padma as the protag, but I don't think it will ever see the light of day as I just can't seem to gain any momentum on it

Food fics are so rare in this fandom at all, and I don't think I have any recs, sorry

It's no surprise that I didn't get many recommendations, lol...

**** oooh! yeah that sucks because food fics are totally a genre or trope, though as I said I haven't seen heaps in this fandom. Let me check out your post again and see if I can give you recs!

***** actually I'm in a bunch of pain and can't trawl for ones without the trio in there, so if you don't mind I'm going to just leave a link to my bookmarks [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/gladheonsleeps/bookmarks][page]] address on ao3 because I do try to read ones without the trio. Admittedly most in there are Hermione or Regulus Black. You can use the filters to try and get something you're interested in

I do find a lot of gold from using the filters in the main HP tag on both ao3 and ffnet. You can put in the name of someone you're interested in ie:Regulus Black and you'll get fics with them tagged in them, though it's still a lot of searching. of maybe you could just make another post on here that says ‘good' instead of ‘food' because that changed the post so much!

good luck! sorry I can't be more helpful!
