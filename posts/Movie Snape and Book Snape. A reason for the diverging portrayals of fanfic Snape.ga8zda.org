A great discussion on the differences between movie and book Snape.

I noticed there is a great deal of discussion about the redeem of Snape in the end. This could explain the reason why there are so differing opinions about that.


** I don't think the movies are the cause of people changing their mind about Snape - not entirely, at least (it's possible that the movies influenced JKR when moving forward with the books).

What I think was more important to book readers is the way that Snape gets characterized in the later books - and the narrative /does/ portray him as a hero/favorably. Yes, his love for Lily and guilt, and his subsequent actions, can be seen in a negative light - but... in the book itself, it's shown to be this big redeeming moment and that we're /supposed/ to like him, despite all the bad stuff he's done. There's also the reveal of him having been bullied by the Marauders & his rather tragic backstory - which will also predispose some people to like him.

So when re-reading, with that version of Snape in mind, a lot of the earlier stuff just doesn't seem as consequential to some readers as before - in comparison to purely the version that the books project.

It'd be hard to prove either way, though - the books that made Snape more likable as a character/revealed his motivations and actual side came after the movies started being released, after all.

** It is even more complicated, because since at least HBP the book Snape IS the film Snape.

*** Indeed, his first HBP DADA lesson is a lot like his Movie-PoA one and very much unlike his Book-PoA one.

**** Note that PS film was released 2001, and even OotP was published in 2003, so all those terrible tropes (like good Snape, super!Hermione, stupid!Ron, etc.) coming from the films (and Steve Kloves) were already present in JKR's head while struggling with writing OotP and certainly when she was writing HBP.

******* Probably you're a newer fan (not younger, though, I see you were born in 1971)

I first read Harry Potter in late 2001, a month before the first movie

******** Right, I read PS sometimes around the first film was out, and I caught up so I bought the seventh volume six hours after it has been published (I was at the conference for work at Birmingham, UK; and no I wasn't willing to wait in the queue at midnight) and read the book whole day and night (last day of conference I was a bit inattentive ;)).

********* I was willing to get it at midnight, which was 2 o'clock local time (I'm Romanian), and I managed to snatch it quick since I was second in the queue. Started the book at 3, finished at 7 and then went to sleep :)

** I think it has a LOT to do with the sex appeal of the actor who portrayed Snape. Alan Rickman's voice has always given me the shivers in the best possible way. The way he delivered that introductory potions monologue.... /wow/.

*** I never quite understood the sex appeal thing, but that speach was awesome. There is no monologue as memorable as his. It's one of those pictures don't have a sound memes.

*** Alan Rickman was the wrong choice for Snape. He put way too much charisma into the character.

**** Snape is awful, but Alan Rickman is a different story. He was a good person and not in the least creepy. I'm saying I think that's the problem and the main reason for all the cringey Snape slashfics.
