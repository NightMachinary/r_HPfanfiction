I'm in that mood where you just want to read something, find a nice long story preferably complete to binge read, but you can't find anything that catches your attention.

I hope you guys can advice me something , maybe about time/dimension travel where Harry isn't a jerk? Or a triwizard tournament AU? A post war fic that has Harry and Teddy bonding? I don't know. Work your magic, surprise me.

Please no bashing or Harry/Tom, Harry/death eater pairings. Thanks

Edit: Thanks to everyone for your wonderful suggestions! Many of the fics here sound really promising and I'm sure that also other people reading this will appreciate them. I'm going to save this post for future inspiration. Just keep adding!


** I just binged Dobby's Deceit ! 10/10 a very satisfying fic. Long WIP, very well fleshed out characters and plot lines. It's an AU after 2nd year, with Harry/Hermione pairing

**** Okay so Dobby wants to be Harry's elf rather than a free elf, which leads to many positive things within Harry's life. I don't want to spoil anything but I'll go by the tags available and say that Harry becomes a goblin friend. A bit cliched at points in the beginning with the world building but is overall so cute and greatly improves. Sirius is an important factor in Harry's life, and he gets a therapist. Ugh I loved it.

** It's not complete, but might I suggest my fic, Loose Cannon? It's a postwar story in which Harry deals with celebrity and growing up (categories are Humor and Hurt/Comfort). It's also hella long (750K+ words, with weekly updates) and highly bingeable.

My writing improves over time, but the first chapter should be enough for you to decide whether you like it.

Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened.

It's a really enjoyable story and slice of life stuff is really hard to come by. Especially stuff that is well written like this is. It's just...hard to take in all at once because the story has felt the exact same throughout.

*** I also recommend this. It's a lovely fic and even if some say the plot points are recycled, this fic is a good post-war story that actually conveys the kind of life Harry would lead, as opposed to the endless rehashing of Voldemort we've all read, or the variety of pairings of established canon/fanon characters.

The world building is very good and the OC character cast is by far the best out of all the fics I've read.

For example, I had almost no notes on Lucinda (Ryan's mother) except that she was a witch who married a Muggle. But in her first scene (chapter 26) she arrived with a huge personality, and she still surprises me at every turn.

*** The OCs are interesting and the writing is technically sound but I just can't get over a few points. (I've only read about maybe 15 chapters)

1. Hogwarts as some backwards ass school. I can buy the existence of other magical schools in Britain but I just can't read fics where Hogwarts isn't the best magical school in Britain if not the world.
2. Hermione as a supremely powerful witch. I prefer fics where Hermione is smart but not once in a generation type deal. If in your fic magical knowledge = magical power then my headcanon is Hermione is a tier below people like Snape, James, Bellatrix etc. If magical power is separate from magical knowledge then my headcanon is Hermione is probably just a slightly above average witch (I don't remember her doing super powerful stuff in the books).

**** Honestly, it's been long enough since I read the original fic (and I've both slept since then /and/ read a zillion other things in between) that I don't remember a ton about it. But it's one of those ones that's stuck with me, where pieces of it come floating back and make me want to re-read it (so I'm glad I was able to track it down, because I think I'm going to do just that, and then read the additional stories that have been added since).

I've always been a sucker for a get-another-chance fic, and I'm a true sucker for all things time travel. There was a lot of really unique and creative stuff in here, and I really appreciate that it's not just a rehashing of canon. I also appreciate that there's not much bashing to be had. Also, it's long, and easy to just get swept up into the story without having to stop any time soon, but also without it dragging on and getting dull and repetitive.

  Harry Potter dies a second time of, of all things, quite surprising and unanticipated old age. Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine. Part One recommended for context.

** Time/dimension travel - Inquisitor Carrow series by littlewhitecat - during second year summer Harry gets sent to 41st (?) millenium, lives there for couple hundred years, becomes space marine inquisitor in the process (not as cringy as it may sound, author pulls it off /really/ well), and gets thrown back to Hogwarts. Book 1 starts with him arriving /back/ in Hogwarts. It gets very different very quick. Very enjoyable, in my opinion. Knowledge of wh40k lore is not required, important things are explained. First book - linkffn(Inquisitor Carrow and the GodEmperorless Heathens)

Fix It - linkffn(Ghost Of Privet Drive by AndrewWolfe) - random guy gets isekai'd into a ghost-like entity, tries to help Harry have a functioning family. I think it may have had a rocky start but otherwise good read.

  Harry Potter is a dragon. He's been a dragon for several years, and frankly he's quite used to the idea - after all, in his experience nobody ever comments about it, so presumably it's just what happens sometimes. Magic, though, THAT is something entirely new. Comedy fic, leading on from the consequences of one... admittedly quite large... change. Cover art by amalgamzaku.

Friendship with Ron wavers in and out depending on how he acts during each time loop but no bashing.

It thrashes in his grip, but is no longer able to bite anyone. “This is a poisonous snake, and I doubt anyone brought a bezoar with them.” Harry glares. He opens his mouth, and feels the beginning the snake's language pass his lips, and this isn't what he wants, what's the point of insulting Malfoy if he can't understand him -- Malfoy's eyes widen. He slaps his hand over Harry's mouth, “Potter, what the hell--”~(Now with a TV Tropes page!)

  A “stray” obliviate from a dissenting blood purist hits Hermione as she's debating on the Wizengamot floor for House Elf rights. As a result, she loses the last 5 years of her life. Her most recent memory is Fred coming back to life in the Battle of Hogwarts. She doesn't remember marrying or falling in love with her husband. In fact, when the healer asks her if she'd like to see her husband, she thought Ron would walk through the door. Instead, it was George. This story follows two, parallel timelines. In the first, Hermione struggles to find her place a world built by a different version of herself. In the other, George traverses before, during, and after the Wizarding War, finding himself more and more drawn to the most dedicated witch he knows. Too bad she's in love with his brother.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7405516/1/We-are-the-Golden-Trio][We Are the Golden Trio]] It's not really that long and in some parts the writing made me cringe a little but I enjoyed the plot. Accidental Time Travel fic. The Golden trio gets sent back in time with baby rose. What are three 11 year olds to do? Well, turn the world into a better place.

I thought it was a fun read, and enjoyed their interactions with one another and the past.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1780819][Hydrus Black]]

From what I can remember this 2 part series is well written. Harry becomes haunted by the mistakes he made in the war and what the public wants/sees him as. He shuts almost everyone out and works on figuring out how to Time Travel so he can avoid all of this mess to begin with.

This series includes 2 fics, over 200k words, and from I remember it does justice the the characters.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4701869/chapters/10736366][Oh God, Not Again!]]

Accidental time travel. Harry gets sent back in time after falling through the veil. He has his memory intact and is determined to change everything.

I don't recall the writing being amazing, but this story made me laugh.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8850352/chapters/20295151][Storm of Yesterday]]

This fic is by the wonderful person who brought us Debt of Time, definitely not as long. It is well written, and I enjoyed reading it. The pairing threw me off at first, but I actually grew to like them being together.

Hermione is sent back in time during a battle. She thought she was saving Harry but ended up saving the wrong Potter. Or did she? Lily dies as she did in canon, but baby Harry still has his father and Sirius is never sent to prison. Hermione is determined to fix the future by fixing the past.

I love time travel fics where Harry gets a normal life at the end.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.

** I cant recommend The Debt of Time by ShayaLonnie enough! Its an epic. 153 chapters. Complete. Includes time travel, no bashing, and no pairings with order members and death eaters. There's 2 versions. Fanfiction has a cleaner version without the most of the smut. AO3 has very detailed sex scenes and they are graphic!!! I would absolutely recommend both. I literally laughed and cried along with the characters. Its kind of a mystery at first but its all completely explained. The ending is perfection and so satisfying! I could talk about this fic forever! It follows the canon story very well but with a twist. I swear its better than the books themselves!

** Aurelian by Bitty Blue Eyes linkffn(6590337) is an interesting time travel ish fanfic that I discovered during quarantine. It's Dramione, but Harry is also a main character imo.

I would also recommend anything that olivieblake has written. She is hilarious and I love her portrayal of Harry. How To Win Friends and Influence People is a good one to start with linkffn(12531992).
