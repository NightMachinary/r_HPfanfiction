Yesterday we had a big argument over H/Hr vs R/Hr, people giving reasons why this ship won't work or why that ship won't work, but we forget that humans for the most part aren't logical beings, we can like things that don't make sense. So today instead of arguing why it can or can't work, let's discuss why we like or dislike certain ships and the things they make us feel.

Now this is a discussion not a competition so if someone says something you don't like, remember that emotional opinions are not easily changed.


** My take: Shipping wars are dull. Write interesting stuff. Read stuff that surprises you.

** - *Harmony* is a Cadbury Creme Egg. Sugary-sweet the whole way through, no variety or texture. You're slightly concerned at how they managed to make it in the first place.

- *Harry-Ginny* is the Harrison Ford of fics. Seems to crop up everywhere, it's practically the default. Hard to form strong feelings one way or the other; it was quite good in that one story you remember from ages back. But why does everyone like and defend it so much?

- *Drarry* is leftism. Surprisingly popular, but never mainstream --- some people get /really/ angry about it. Like its fandom, full of constant drama. It seems pretty plausible, so you check it out for a bit --- there are some good ideas there, as well as some absolute shockers. You're too ashamed to mention it to your friends, but post about it a lot online.

- *Harry-Fleur* is like Call of Duty. High on action, straight to business, you know what you're getting. But after a while it feels a bit repetitive. Why is everything the same shade of grey? Serious moments start to feel like parody. Press F to pay respects.

- *Haphne* is like Panic! at the Disco. For those who are too edgy and grown-up for Call of Duty. There's a bit more variety and it's actually pretty original. But after a while you realise there's only one proper character in it.

- *Harry-Ron* is the New Zealand of fics. Friendly and inoffensive. It sounds nice enough in concept, but you'll probably never make the effort of going there. You're not entirely sure it exists.

- *Snarry* is like 4chan. Never mentioned in polite conversation. (When it is, only as a joke.) There's probably /some/ good content down there, but no-one wants to wade through the muck to check it out. Or risk getting put on the FBI watchlist.

** I love R/Hr

They have a fantastic dynamic - she's Type A and he's Type B. They balance each other out.

She wants to save the world and he wants to lounge around, running a joke shop.

I think Ron really gets a raw deal in most FFN. In canon, he's reasonably bright and quick witted. He's loyal and cares about his friends and family. Of course he can be jealous (the Yule ball) but he's human and a teenager

. In FF, he's reduced to a mindless oafish idiot with binge eating disorder with a pathological hatred for Slytherins.

** I don't like Harry/Hermione or Harry/Ginny, because both just feel wrong to me. Hermione is the overbearing sister/mother who Harry would never be able to deal with as a long term partner, and I just never really felt that Ginny developed as a character except to be Harry's girlfriend, so I think the relationship would be a boring, likely short lived one, as they'd eventually run out of common interests.

Ron/Hermione could work, but both would need to change. Hermione would need to lighten up and Ron would need to become more serious, if they hope of going a day in married life without a shouting match. I won't read something purely based on it, but I'd be interested to see it done well. Most people don't write it at all, let alone well.

Personally, I like the Harry/blank-slate-character ideas, because it allows the author to build a character who is actually suited to him. This is usually Daphne or Susan.

My favourite, however, is Harry/Luna. I can always see Harry, as a bullying victim in the past, wanting to protect the victim of bullying (stealing someone's possessions and calling someone Loony is definitely bullying). I feel like it could work much better than either Hermione or Ginny, as long as Luna has some moments of sanity interspersed with her insanity.

** H/Hr

I personally like it because I like the idea of Harry getting together with the person always by his side, his partner in most of his adventures. I like the idea that after everything they have done together they share a bond or connection forged in the fires of war. I like the idea that they are partners in life, Harry's magical prowess mixed with Hermione as the brains. I like the idea that they bond over lonely childhoods, Hermione driving people off with her smarts and attitude and Harry living a sad life at the dursleys.

** I don't particularly /like/ the Hermione/Ron pairing (though in my mind's eye I can see it /working out/; it just doesn't hold much appeal for me), and really I don't like any fic /for/ its shipping, whatever that may be. But I've got a bad instinctive reaction to H/Hr because it's too perfect. It feels like one Mary Sue character shipped with another --- the two handsome clever and talented ones getting together because in stories, such characters always get together, not because there's any real in-story reason for them to do so.

But really, and again with the caveat that I'd really rather avoid ships altogether, the only intra-Trio ship that really feels right to me is Ron with Harry.

*** Yes! I can't believe someone said it before me. I don't even know that I shared that opinion with someone.

Hermione/Ron works great. I can see their appeal as friends to lovers and their flirting in bickering, but I just find them boring. Maybe because most of their teenage dynamics has been done in canon. I see them on the same boat as James/Lily, Harry/Daphne, or Harry/Fleur; they could work, but I won't read them only because of the romance. It's a bit interesting because friends to lovers is my favorite romance trope.

However, Hermione/Ron has a really interesting marriage dynamics. This is one relationship where the woman could wear pants and the man stays at home raising children and no one would complain. I'm surprised that tumblr doesn't use Hermione/Ron as an icon to support gender equality.

For all of JKR fault with romance, I'm glad she didn't fail this one. Almost all of children stories fall into this trope just because the writer want their main Hero and Heroine paired off. */Looking at you ATLA and LOK:S1/**.* The only Hero/Heroine I know that work well is Percy/Annabeth.

I won't say that Harry/Hermione won't work. They are equal, they could be a power couple and wreak havocs in the wizarding world.

I just get turned off because I found most Hermione/Harry fanfiction disappointing. I hate that most of them discard the Weasleys, make Harry Hermione's bitch (or the opposite), or make their attraction comes from nowhere. Any canon compliant Harry/Hermione Post-HBP won't work. Any Post-PoA won't work without a proper build up, and I'm not talking '/shit she suddenly become hot over the summer'/.

I only read them if it's a total AU from the 1st year, or at least only canon until third year. Honestly GoF could be a great start for Hermione/Harry, if only the author could reinstate Ron into their friendship properly after the triwizard incident.

That would be because tumblr is as quick to find something problematic as wholesome, and they decided there was something unhealthy about two people without much in the way of common interests and hobbies, who spent most of her childhood fighting with, arguing with, and insulting each other, to still end up together because Teenage Hormones and for this to be displayed as a happy ending rather than a recipe for divorce at best and domestic abuse at worst.

He's finally learned that he doesn't need to stand out to make a difference for the people he cares about.

And he's a war hero, one of the "Golden Trio", whose actions directly led to Voldemort's defeat. He "stands out" pretty well after canon events.

** I dislike both H/Hr and Hr/R for the following reasons:

1. I feel bad for any member of the trio getting left out. I would have vastly preferred that all three have romantic partners outside their friendship. Or I would have been fine with a plural marriage, but I don't see JKR being willing to go there.
2. I found the romantic subplots in the books grating. I think romance is where JKR is at her weakest. Give me the world building, the platonic friendships, the mysteries, the adventures, the laughter, the families.
3. The fandom is at its worst every time the topic comes up. I don't want to read an H/Hr fic that starts with a nasty rant about how even JKR admitted that Hr/R would have ended up in marriage counseling. (Dude, all of these characters could have done with ALL THE COUNSELING after their youth spent as child soldiers.) I don't want to read an Hr/R fic that starts with a nasty rant about how great it is that the epilogue proved how delusional anyone who shipped Hermione with someone else is, and how now their dreams are ruined and they can no longer fantasize about a different ending.

All was well after the war, nevermind that Death Squads had roamed the countryside while most people did nothing but fiddle their thumbs. Malfoy committed enough war crimes to warrant trial and execution by his attack on Katie Bell alone (by allied standards), but he gets off Scots free.

The problem with finding food and staying in the open is they don't know how Dolohov and Rowle found them in Tottingham Road after the wedding. They assume that the DE somehow tracked Harry. So, it's not really worth it to risk going to town every time they run out of food. I think Hermione went to get something under the invisibility cloak once, but it's not something worth risking about. By the time they found out about taboo the plot already move fast; Luna's house, Malfoy Manor, and Shell Cottage. They don't really have to hide anymore.

I agree they could be better prepared and involve some adults. But we know how Harry have a problem with trusting adults.

The fact that such a powerful weapon was not effective proves utter incompetence for the defenders. That the Death Eaters made a frontal, uphill assault against a fortified hilltop proves utter incompetence on their part. We are talking about 1914 French incompetence, where they believed that elan wins against machine guns and tossed away up to 40000 soldiers per day in the battle of the frontiers each day (that's more than 3/4s of the entire US losses in Vietnam in one day).

Did the books stated that DE make a frontal attack, I only remember that Harry was running around searching the diadem when the battle begin. Once they exit the RoR, the DE is already in the castle. Also, the DE can use brooms, it's not as simple as a frontal attack in the 1900s.

Sorry, I don't get this. If you have earmuff why woud you need to hit the mandrakes? Just let them hit the ground and then kill them.

I don't understand why you assume that the defenders could run away while you can't assume that the attacker is unable to dodge from the defender's barrage.

You know, we could argue about this forever. Why don't we just agree that we have a different interpretation of the books? I prefer to make the books stay interesting with some creative interpretation that makes almost everyone creative and competent instead of some idiots that didn't know what they're doing, clearly you're not on the same page.

That defeats the purpose of hearing protection against the mandrakes. You have to wear them or you die to mandrakes but you cannot if you want to communicate more advanced orders than "onwards!"

The defenders have a fortified position, which ought to protect them against casual spellfire. You know, the entire purpose of fortifications like castles or trenches. Presumably, Hogwarts is enchanted to withstand some damage, so you can hide behind battlements and the like. Meanwhile, the attacker is exposed and can not offer targeted fire because he is moving (takes attention away and makes it harder to hold your hand steady).

I would like to do that as well, but canon is pretty clear that the Battle of Hogwarts was tactically stupid from both sides.

I mean, the charge which broke the Death Eaters were archers and house elves with kitchen knives (imagine what would have happened if Hermione remembered guns and transfiguration). But the defenders had managed to squander a massive advantage beforehand since they should have been able to turn the grounds around the castle into a killing field.

Hermione brings out the best in Harry, we actually see it throughout the books rather than it be mentioned as a hypothetical for Ron and Hermione. We see Hermione actually help Harry study, be there when he's feeling isolated and downcast, encouraging him to be his best. The same can't be said for Ron and Hermione.

Then at the near end, Harry's yelling and she's unafraid of him unlike both Ron and Hermione stepping back while asking him to teach them.

Hermione fought with him before leaving for the DoM to check if Sirius was at Grimauld place and held her ground, Harry even was so moved by her offer to come with him and recognized her “solidarity” in his blind rage.

Hermione tempered his anger a couple other times in the book too. One instance is when Hermione tells him some girls in her dormitory didn't believe his story. Harry's about to start shit and then she tells him “cooly” she defended him, asking him to stop attacking her and Ron. He apologizes.

He also cools off in a moment when her and Ron are convincing him to teach DA and he's about to lose it, but she says Voldemort's name out loud.

So at the end of the book when they have that massive fight about whether to go to the DoM immediately or not, she's dealt with him enough and holds her own quite well.

I think at least in OotP, there's quite a lot to show Hermione suites to Harry. He's the passion and strength and she's the brains and operations. They both have the same goals but differ in their methods, that conflict is more interesting to me.

And I focused on the things Hermione does for Harry because I was replying to your argument that you can't read OOTP and say she's a good partner for Harry.

If you want some of what Harry does for Hermione, we have actual instances in which he is there for her, such as routinely visiting her when she's petrified in second year and keeping her company after Ron kisses Lavender. We have actual instances where he studies with her and doesn't grumble about it even if he does find it taxing. He immediately leaves his date with Cho when he hears that Hermione needs to talk to him.

You'll note that I have the words “actual instances” repeated a few times in there because they're tangible examples of the vague assurances of how RHr could work in a relationship despite a lack of canon excerpts to back them up and a good amount evidence to the contrary.

I suppose I'd agree Ginny is probably the best “suited” for Harry if you go off of their shared interests but I feel like it's cheapened by the virtue of that being by design. Rowling tailor-made Ginny to be Harry's perfect girl until that's all her character became.

You're choosing to view the relationship in familial terms. There's absolutely nothing that mandates it to be a sibling-like. There isn't anything that mandates it be romantic, either, but at least be honest about it. It's a glass house to begin with. You can say HHr is familial for their positive interactions while I could point to Ron and Hermione's constant bickering despite having each other's back in the end and state how much it reminds me of sibling rivalries.

People take canon way too seriously. Whenever fanfiction is written, you're automatically leaving the realm of canon and writing AU, that's by definition.

Harry/Ginny is the ship that I would read if I'm on the mood for romance or some fluffy Adult!Harry. Most of the fanfiction I've read is done well without making them overly OOC. My only complaint is that canon make it clear that Ginny is the girl for Harry even before HBP, but other than one single scene in HBP we don't see why Harry could be the boy for Ginny. I feel like the only reason Ginny exist at all in the books is as a love interest, I really feel bad for her.

Harry/Ron could be a perfect Friends to Lovers romance, I simply haven't found a 50k+ fanfiction that's good enough. The only good Harry/Ron I know is the one by LullabyKneel.

I don't really have any feelings for other pairings. I've found some excellent Harry/Parvati, Harry/Cedric, Harry/George, Hermione/George, Hermione/Cedric, Harry/OC, even Harry/Tom. I would read any pairing as long as it doesn't throw away their characterization under the bus.

** So neither ship is otp for me but I do prefer Harry/ Hermione over Ron/ Hermione

It has a bit to do with canon and alot to do with fanon.

I partly blame the movies for this but the movies took alot of Ron's good qualities and gave them to Hermione while toning down Hermione's more negative qualities and playing up her moments with Harry.

Fanfiction didnt necessarily stray from this depiction. And I did like Harry's relationship with Hermione in the movies even if its not quite the same as in the books.

On top of that there was a specific type of HP fic i liked to read when i started getting into HP fics. That was independent Harry or Dark Harry. Hermione was a pretty popular ship with Harry in stories like those. I liked the ones especially when Harry got more interested in a subjected and he and Hermione could nerd out about the same topics. I liked that dynamic for them.

Ron/Hermione on the other hand... As far as canon went when the romance thing became more of a thing they were both pretty petty with each other Ron by ruining her date with Viktor cuz he was jealous and didnt realize it and Hermione by realizing her feelings for Ron and getting jealous over Lavender and sending birds after him. But as opposed to the Yule ball where Ron comes off like a dick by lashing out and Hermione being heartbroken is focused on, when Hermione lashes out its still her heart break thats focused on not her pettyness thats called out. Things like that kinda rubbed me the wrong way.

But id get over that if fics did things differently. Unfortunately alot of the fics i read with Romione still gave Hermione alot of Rons positive traits. So Hermione is smart competent and always righr while Ron is kinda more dumb and a dork and means well.

Hermione is smart but not the most empathetic and can come off as cold. Rons fights with his friends stand out the most but apart from with Hermione they arent really common. And he has alot of friends he can be pretty charming and is just insecure about his skills because he has talented siblings. Hermione on the other hand has fewer friends can be accidentally insensitive and rub people the wrong way( like Luna about the quibbler or talking about how Trawleny was just a hoax when Lavender crying over her dead rabbit). So thet do actually balance each other out in a cute way.

But thats not the depiction i usually see in fic and the kind i usually see turns me off from the ship.

Its kinda the way it works for most ships i dislike or like less. Its not that I can never see anyone make Dramione work in any fic. But the kinda depiction i usually see with them is one i dont like. If i actively shipped them in canon that could make me like it despite fanon depictions ( potentially) but i didnt like their canon dynamic or see the potential in it by concept. So all i had to make me like it was usual fanon depiction. And since I dont like that i dont like the ship.

If JKR didn't repeatedly tell us that Hermione was a best friend of Harry's I wouldn't even think she was. A friend or acquaintance he was being kind to? Sure. Best friend? Nah.

He doesn't appear to /like/ her company all that much. Now, I'm sure she did it, but I cannot recall a time she laughed in the books. I can recall laughter in the movies, though. He avoids arguments with her by humoring or lying to her then does what he wants/needs behind her back. Oddly enough, he will argue/express himself to Ron.

Hermione would do things for Harry's own good. The latter would say nothing and stew in his anger until he explodes. With their temperaments that ends in a rather vicious duel.

In fan fiction, Harry's turned into bitch that acquiesces at the merest huff from Hermione. Hermione is a great goddess who even Daphne Greengrass admires (you know which stories I speak of).

I also despise Harry, Lily, and Hermione with the Death Eaters and their leader. For all their insecurities, I think those three would have enough dignity not to do that. Also, the great majority of those stories exclude the redemption part.

Last but not least, Remus and Tonks. She's perky and bubbly and he's a loser.

However, I have to agree that Harry is not shown to really give two shits about Hermione in the books when it comes to his PoV. Except for being told by JKR that they are best friends, almost siblings, there isn't a lot that demonstrates it on Harry's side unless her life is danger. Was JKR trying to show that Harry and Hermione's connection to each other is solely based on necessity to fight evil? Maybe. That's kind of sad though.

Anyway that last bit was besides the point. I do agree with you about Harry's view of Hermione in the books. As a fanfic writer of H/Hr, it's a huge hurdle to overcome because I try to keep it as close to canon as possible. What would be the most realistic catalyst that makes Harry see Hermione in a different light? It's tough to do.

** H/Hr - Strong dislike

Now I've actually read AU fics where Harry and Hermione make a beautiful couple. My problem with H/Hr comes from when they're shipped in a cannon, or at least canon through the 7 books, sense. In canon they have such an amazing friendship and it feels, to me, that people are missing the point when they look at that and see romantic love. Friendship/sibling love is awe inspiring in its own right and I resent the implication that it isn't enough.

By contrast I ship Sirius/Lupin pretty hard (though in my headcannon they date, break up, and remain friends while James pretends not to know and Peter sincerely doesn't) despite their relationship being overtly brother-like in the books. Clearly I am inconsistent.

One possibility, it seems to me, is that male/female childhood friendships often grow up to be romantically paired in canon, and male/male childhood friendships almost never do (I struggle to think of a single example outside the gay romance genre, in fact), so it feels fresher and more interesting to have two childhood friends who are both guys grow up and fall in love than the same story with a man and a woman.

**** That is a really good point. That said, I also don't like Harry/Ron so I don't think that is it for me. Still, I hadn't thought about that before and it's super true. People seem to forget that men/women can have meaningful friendships that last outside of childhood.

*** Honestly, Sirius/Remus in canon aren't brother-like at all. The subtext in their interactions via prose is so clear that people were convinced they were gay for each other when book three came out.

** Down with all the Harmony and Romione ships! Best ship will always be Haphne!

But on a serious note, Harmony is more realistic. I mean, spending several months alone against the world... It would be extremely unlikely to not develop any feelings. Yet at the same time, Hermione has always been the overbearing older sister/ mother to Harry. Such a dynamic wouldn't work out well in the long run.

On the other hand, Ron walking out in DH should be a huge red flag for any prospective partners. The biggest quest in the history of Magical Britain and man calls it quits.

As for Haphne.... marriage contracts are cheap and cliche tools that are used to draw these two characters together. Days to Come and Daphne Greengrass and the Importance of Intent are great fics that avoid this cheap plot device.

Ships, in some cases, add flavour to a fic. However, the main selling point of a fic shouldn't be the ship. It should be good writing, character development, prose etc.
