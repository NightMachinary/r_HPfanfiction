Tell me why it's good AND then tell me what you hate about it.

Cause let's be honest. It can't be perfect.

Edit: A little disappointed with half of the answers being "slow updates" but hey, to each his own I suppose.


** I've got lots of favorites (favorites as in I enjoyed them). But very few have made me feel anything deeper for the characters themselves.

Of those few, my favorite is linkffn(Grow Young With Me by Taliesin19). New update soon-ish! It's amazing at breathing life into the post-canon characters and the dialogue is some of the best I've seen anywhere. Nothing to hate since it's perfect for me.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh)

This story is wonderful but not flawless. The first chapter suffers from shifting perspectives and a few too many uncertain pronouns. Most of the modern-era activity is a frustratingly drama-less mystery where the mystery is already solved, which makes all the scenes feel like self-congratulations.

What makes the story a delight are the flashback tales. Despite knowing that the protagonist will survive it all without significant physical damage, the story breathes deep with characterization, making us care for characters long dead but still significant to the main character.

The other large flaw I have with the story is the artificiality of ancient era spellcraft still using Roman base phraseology. I get that Jasmine is the source of it all, but that still purports that those words in and of themselves have power when said by a witch or wizard.

But that's my problem. Many won't care that much about it.

*** I like the idea, but I felt that the story has the same shortcomings of most characterizations of Harry - he's either overly arrogant and in control, or a complete downward spiral of angst and frequent foolishness. It felt like they practically made Harry into a young Ron - brave and determined when it matters, but generally insensitive, lazy, and a pain in the ass.

Granted, the story is from Neville's perspective and I ordinarily only read stories from Harry's perspective, but it still felt rather OOC for him.

** linkffn(Against the Moon by Stoplight Delight)

This fic is incredible. It chronicles the Marauders through their years at Hogwarts. The characterisations are tender, and complex, the progression of events, and the looming threat of war are logical, and well spaced, and the tone in spot on. It captures the quaint joy of the earliest HP books, is genuinely funny, and engaging, and captures the retro feel of the 60s/70s.

Each of the boys is absolutely lovely. Peter included.

Seen through Remus' eyes, it's by far my favourite. And it's epic. 155 chapters and counting. Huge breaks between updates, but the author is still very active, and promises to return.

** linkffn(The Observer Effect)

Adorable Fem!Harry/Tony Stark fic, one of the few I actually like. Pro, they have good chemistry. Con, fem!Harry knows all the magic under the sun /except/ healing. Not really everything, but she knows a lot, and she doesn't even know rudimentary healing. Why is that always something people make their characters useless at? I understand it can take away some of the tension out of the story if the character just heals themselves up all the time, but you can make it work, damnit. Also it hasn't updated in a while, but the author has stated on their profile that they're looking to complete the story before they post the rest of it. Alas.

For something that IS perfect - linkffn(On a Pale Horse) is fucking hilarious if you don't mind a bit of crackish dumbledore bashing, although I suppose you could call that the con. It also hasn't updated for a while, but apparently the author has been busy, so at least it's not abandoned.

I swear all the authors of every story I actually /want/ to read have gone awol in the last half year...

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) great story and fun to read but it did go through a real slow patch. Now the author has pushed back from a regular update schedule to updating regularly starting on 1 Sep (with good reason) so I've got a whole summer without this fic to look forward to.

  Harry Potter was sent away to the Dursleys by his parents who were raising Jim Potter, the Boy Who Lived. Think you know this story? You have no idea. AU, Slytherin!Harry, WBWL. Currently in Year Two (Harry Potter and the Secret Enemy). NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Hopefully no bashing.

** Linkffn(blood of the Phoenix)

For me the character development is really good with hermione and ginny who are usually very linearly done. However, the problems with it for me are that ron is made out to be a major strategist because of chess and that harry goes ragemode and almost kills a guy for calling his girlfriend a slut

** For me, the best-written series there is has to be Alexandra Quick. It's not really AU precisely, it's well-written, it fits the model and it's generally enjoyable to read. I've read quite a bit of fanfic and some of it was definitely guilty-fun but this one could be a published series with a little more polish (very little).

I wish the author would come back and write a few more books, but I certainly have no right to demand it.

** Most recently I've been enjoying linkffn(The Arithmancer).

The prose is about 90% of the way there. Better than most, not good enough to fade into the background all the time.

It's focused on Hermione more than Harry, which is a welcome change. I'm coming to hate Harry Potter as a character, no matter what authors do to him. I swear, another year and I'm going to hate him more than Ron Weasley.

Speaking of Ron, the story gives a good compromise between the Ron that fanon tends to hate and the Ron that canon wishes it had shown. Poor first impression, good second impression, character flaws that reveal themselves, and finally character growth.

Also on the Weasley topic, I appreciate the George/Fred portrayal.

One of the problems is that it feels like everything is motivated by Hermione. Hermione fixes almost all the troubles in the story. Hermione's the motivation for most of the non-canon troubles. Not much butterfly effect, not much divergence from canon besides the obvious.

At least her power levels, while extraordinary in themselves, often provide only a small advantage. Instead of being a spell gadgeteer, capable of crafting an instant victory spell for every occasion, she creates spells of varying utility, and only a few of them are of particular use. It's a fine line between "your ability is useless" and "your ability makes everyone else useless", and The Arithmancer walks it adroitly.

But now that I actually read it I'm amazed at how good it is. The writing itself is marvelous, which is no surprise considering Sushi is a professional writer, but also the characterizations are spot on and the universe she built is extremely compelling despite how grim it is. I like it so much that I'm postponing reading the last story just because I don't want it to end. I'm sure it's not perfect but I have a hard time finding any imperfections at this hour.

** This is one of my favorites because of its rereadability: Pride of Time linkffn(Pride of Time) and its companion Divide of Time linkffn(Divide of Time) by Anubis Ankh. It's HGSS but I like it because the premise is fairly realistic, Snape is characterized properly, the smut is good, and it's a completed time travel fic.

A negative is that the main story is pretty much a canon rehash (until a certain point in the books). The companion piece makes up for this by becoming more action-filled and becoming completely AU.

** Wow I'm surprised murkybluematter's The Pureblood Pretense has not been suggested yet. It seems to be one of the few Fem!Harry's that is really well written and I especially like how there are barely any characters that are ooc. Every character is complicated and fleshed out well and there is no bashing that I can recall. I also like that it is regularly updated and is into the 4th year now.

The best part is probably how Harry is not a super mary sue, but still someone we can all love and root on. The last thing that makes this fic so amazing is the antagonists behind it. A politically acute Lord Riddle who is one of the most respected politicians in this particular universe is slowly taking over the magical world. This is really one of the most interesting, confusing, thrilling, daring, and highly entertaining fics I've ever seen.

It was hard to find negatives for this story but I guess the clandestineness of Harry can get frustrating at times. She is not supposed to go to Hogwarts, but she swapped places with her cousin so tries to keep attention away from herself (it obviously is a futile attempt) and also doesn't let her friends in too close.

The huge chapter lengths also get annoying if you're reading on an ipad, because the chapters get up to 30k words long and one tap can lose your spot on the page which takes a while to find again so i almost exclusively have to read this fic on my phone or computer. That's all I can think of for now, but feel free to add on to my comments guys, the link is linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense by murkybluematter).

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

** Linkffn(one hundred and sixty nine).

Hermione goes back 169 days before the potter's death to save them. She falls in love with Sirius black.

What I don't like about it. The ending. Not to spoil iy but it left kind of a bad taste in my mouth. Also, there are dozens of polyjuice questions from the marauders ("hey prongs, remember that time we turned all the doorknobs in Hogwarts into portkey?" "We nothing prongs! That was a passport classic!") And they are hilarious and a great source of world and character building. But they are everywhere and they get in the way of the story sometimes.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**
