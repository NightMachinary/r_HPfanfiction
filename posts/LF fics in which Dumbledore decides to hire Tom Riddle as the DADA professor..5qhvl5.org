For obvious reasons, Dumbledore didn't offer him the position, but I'm curious to see if anyone has written fics with this premise. Maybe Dumbledore wanted to keep a closer eye on him. With the job, TMR would seek power through his influence on children. It can include the "adults of HP" in their school years. Any related rec is good too!


** linkffn(Rectifier) The main character is Tom Riddle from a universe where he teaches defense against the dark arts, (although he ends up teaching it in main universe too)
