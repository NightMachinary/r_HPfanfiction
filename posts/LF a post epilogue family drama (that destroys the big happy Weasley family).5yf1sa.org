The epilogue setups up a very idyllic picture; I want fics that destroy that, but in a realistic (ie non-bashy manner). For example, a lot of post-7 fics that have H/Hr, kinda bash the hell out of Ginny or Ron. That is not something I'm looking for.

Example: smutty_claus' A Life So Very Much Less Than Ordinary deals with infidelity, but despite that, Ginny (the cheating partner) never seems to bashed by the author, even though she is hated for a while by many of the people in-story. Despite the fact that smut is very much in the foreground, the author deals with the situation in a nuanced manner, and that's what I'm looking for.

The reason for the destruction of the idyllic picture doesn't need to be infidelity: would love something that explores PTSD, etc.

The ideal focus would be Harry. Honestly, I haven't really read anything that focuses on Harry dealing with the fact that to Dumbledore he was basically little more than a pig being fattened up for slaughter.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10728064/1/Days-to-Come][*Days to Come*]] linkffn(10728064) deals with this. Looking into how Harry simply did NOT deal with his issues post-war, Ginny didn't deal with those issues either, and then...drama. It allows the characters to reshape slightly, and grow from there. The Weasley family drama is really resolved in by the end of the first half of the story.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** I find myself struggling with these fics where the whole Harry and Weasley dynamic gets shattered. Harry had such an awful childhood up until he defeated Voldemort that a story where everything goes to hell between him and, for example, Ginny and by proxy the Weasleys just seems to cruel.

I can't get behind stories where the family falls apart because of infidelity because it just seems too out of character. Especially if its Ginny cheating on Harry. I mean, how awful can one be cheating on the guy who willingly sacrificed his life to save everyone else?

But you're correct that the trauma inflicted on Harry would lead to some very troubling times ahead. That's the real world version of the events after the war, not the "all is well" story from the books. Though, ironically, him being with Ginny through it all actually makes complete sense since canonically she is a tremendous source of comfort for Harry. If anyone could get him through his PTSD, it's her.

*** Doesn't need to be infidelity; that just provides an easier proxy for all the stuff Rowling effaced to give us an idyllic epilogue.

Problem, as I see it, is that Harry did not have a normal childhood at all. That has a significant effect upon the psyche. Couple that with the Dumbledore revelation in book 7, which is pretty fucked up in a fringe horror sort of way, it should have impacted his life post hogwarts.

There are be many ways to show that: ptsd, difficult to get right and exceedingly sensitive; Harry becoming a bit of an ass due to his fame; Ginny & Harry finding that their perfunctory young love doesn't translate into an adult relationship; Harry/Ginny/Ron/Hermione falling for people on the other side of the divide, and so on.

Of the last there are plenty of examples, but they mostly suffer from the fact that while their authors are perfectly willing to convey the 'bad boy' charm of Draco or, say, Pansy, they more or less gloss over the fact that these people fought on the other side of the war. Which makes these stores mostly a vehicle for a ship (or smut), rather than an interesting exploration of a problematic relationship.

**** I'm not sure the Epilogue was all that idyllic. Maybe in the eyes of the public.

If these people could thrive in that cesspool known as magical Britain or the Ministry of Magic, they gotta be brilliant and ruthless politicians who would eat Frank Underwood (House of Cards) for breakfast.

I imagine that after the War, traumatized people of magical Britain demanded massive changes and reforms in the Ministry. One of its major shortcoming during both wars was the lack of effectiveness of its police/military force. JKR herself mentioned "revolutionary changes" in the DMLE. That could mean vast expansion of police powers and significant improvements in investigative techniques. Furthermore, Kingsley worked on the staff of Muggle prime minister and should be highly familiar with Muggle government organizations. He would now be in a position to create a magical equivalent of MI6/SIS.

So in a sense, the people of magical Britain traded an inefficient corrupt oligarchy for an efficient police/surveillance state.

Harry and his friends, in their zeal to prevent the rise of another Voldemort, might have created a much more controlling government as a result. Harry apparently was very successful in his job, since he became the youngest police chief ever in 2007. He seemed to often fight on the front lines himself, and would have earned the loyalty of his troops. It would not be too far fetched to consider Aurors to be his private army.

If you look at what the main 4 were doing 20 years later, you should identify a pattern: Hermione set the policies, Harry led the police/military, Ron made the money, and Ginny controlled the media. In case of Ginny, her job as Senior Quidditch Reporter was most likely a ruse. Do you really believe Daily Prophet would dare to ignore the 'wishes' of police chief's wife and Minister's sister-in-law? Do you really think anyone there dared to oppose her who put another senior reporter in hospital just because that person made fun of them?

I think there was a very good reason why JKR jumped 19 years into the future. She wanted them to succeed, but she didn't want to show all the necessary evils they had to commit as politicians in magical Britain. It would make her heroes highly unlikable.

--------------

If you bother to follow JKR on Twitter, you will fully realize how dirty politics is. And politics in Muggle UK is nowhere as bad as in magical Britain.

**** Completely agree that all these examples are realistic. I mean, the main ship couples are all young so that, in and of itself could be an issue. Then you add on the post-war stresses and such. And Harry in general is a tough guy to be around when he is depressed and also doesn't open up much. In a weird way, though, this actually solidifies Ginny as his partner, even given their young age and given the realistic spin on the story. Ginny provides comfort to Harry, making him open up more and more easily get over things. She is also strong enough to deal with his issues and not bail on him. Finally, she seems to enjoy taking on the role of Harry comforter.

There are a hundred reasons why the couple wouldn't last, yet to Rowling's credit, she made them a believable couple even with all the baggage.
