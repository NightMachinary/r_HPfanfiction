I'm looking for stories where Harry is a good student and good with magic and maybe actually uses it outside of class. In the books Harry is a mediocre student and rarely uses magic in his daily life or to solve any problems not directly combat related. In fics he is either the same as in the books or he is the best wizard ever. Something like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9939304/1/Si-Vis-Pacem-Para-Bellum][Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum]] is pretty close to what I am looking for. Though Harry is a bit OP even in that.


** [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Apprentice_Potter/index/][Apprentice Potter]]

Harry gets expelled from Hogwarts, gets apprenticed to a strong wizard, fucks up all kinds of people. Creative use of magic; Harry is pretty inventive and resourceful. Harry/Hermione/Blaise(female) later. Pretty entertaining, two sequels (though the second sequel is abandonded).

** You might want to try Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin linkffn(11191235). Both Harry and James Jr. (Harry's twin brother) are competent there, without crossing over reasonable skill level. Of course we are still at the holidays between second and third year, so many things can change yet, but considering that author focus on trickery and clever use of skills as a way of solving problems, we probably shouldn't worry.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand, the incentive to survive. And thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

** linkffn(9720211)

I'll never get sick of recommending that. One of my all time favorite fics and it actually got an update last month after a year long hiatus.

Harry is working hard for his progress and he doesn't just turn into Voldemort's equal over night. There's one specific scene that was very well written and shows what kind of fic this is perfectly.

Very Minor Spoiler: [[/spoiler][Harry duels Bella in the Ministry atrium scene while Dumbledore fights Tom. Harry can go up against Bella after months of training but watching Dumbledore and Voldemort fight is still on a whole other level.]]

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains unanswered as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. In the face of his fate, what can he do but keep moving forwards?
