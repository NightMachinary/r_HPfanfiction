This is something of a headcanon/speculation, I suppose.

According to the current understanding, you're either a magical person - a wizard or witch - or you're not. Squibs don't even really count as a separate category; they might be /born/ to magical parents, but they don't actually have any magic.

But what if things were more complicated, and people were split into /wand-users/ and Muggles, with a small but significant middle ground of people who have /just/ a touch of magic? So little that no wand would ever choose them or react to them, but /there/? And it might manifest in different ways - some might always be just on the verge of seeing some strange creature or other out of the corner of their eye, some might occasionally get strange but real premonitions, some might find themselves with an inexplicable interest in runes and other old alphabets, some might find that herbal remedies from old wives' tales just /work/ every time they make/use them. People on the farthest edges of magic, so to speak.

I really like this headcanon because it feels a lot more natural/organic than a sharp divide between "magic" and "not magic". This was and still is my headcanon about Muggleborns - basically that vaguely magical people tend to be drawn to each other by that shared life experience, and any child they have together has a decent (not very high, but significant) chance of being a "full" magical. It still sounds better to me than just tying it all to genetics/some distant Wizarding ancestor, and rather neatly explains how so many parents of Muggleborns are so accepting of their children being magical - they've always /known/ deep inside that there are things out there that can't be explained.

(If anyone's curious, this headcanon takes a lot of inspiration from Bleach. In that show there's a divide between supernaturally/spiritually powerful people and "Muggles" as well, but some otherwise normal humans can perceive ghosts simply due to growing up in an area with a lot of spiritual shenanigans going on. Even more, coming in very close contact with spiritual power (like getting attacked by a ghost and surviving) can cause one to have children who have powers themselves.)


** That's what a Squib is though. Squibs can see magical things like Hogwarts and Dementors but Muggles can't. Squibs can make and take potions and even grow magical plants. They can see and care for magical creatures. Squibs don't have enough magic to wield a wand but they have enough to stick around.

*** Squibs /can't/ see Dementors, it's literally a plot point that they can't (or Harry would have had a much stronger defence at his trial).

In fact, the only thing on the list that's clear canon for Squibs is being able to see Hogwarts. And even that is difficult to call "magical" - places like Hogwarts aren't inherently invisible to non-magical folk, they have explicitly spelled to be so, and /that/ implies that non-magical people can see or be allowed to see them if one wishes. This is backed up by Hermione's parents visiting Diagon Alley with her (and they can obviously see the things that are there, it's highly unlikely that she brought them along to just stand awkwardly staring at an empty street and buildings).

Besides that, even if all of this /was/ true for Squibs, that still wouldn't make them what I'm describing. Squibs are first and foremost the direct children of magical parents and implied to be quite rare - what I'm describing/headcanoning is a much larger, /entirely random/ population of barely magical people.

**** it's somewhat unclear whether squibs can or can't see dementors. Mrs. Figg claims to be able to,

#+begin_quote
  “Incidentally, can Squibs see dementors?” he added, looking left and right along the bench where he sat. “Yes, we can!” said Mrs. Figg indignantly.”
#+end_quote

but Harry questions whether she really can after her description.

#+begin_quote
  “Harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach. Whatever Mrs. Figg said to the contrary, it sounded to him as though the most she had ever seen was a picture of a dementor, and a picture could never convey the truth of what these beings were like...”
#+end_quote

So it seems like Mrs. Figg is probably lying. If she's this bad of a liar, though, her indignant response earlier is confusing. If we look back to the incident itself, we can find an alternate explanation: she only arrived after they had already been driven off.

#+begin_quote
  “Mrs. Figg, their batty old neighbor, came panting into sight. Her grizzled gray hair was escaping from its hairnet, a clanking string shopping bag was swinging from her wrist, and her feet were halfway out of her tartan carpet slippers.”
#+end_quote

So I think it's likely that they /can/ see them, but Mrs. Figg didn't. She felt their effects, arrived after they had gone, and felt that she needed to embellish her story for court.

***** The "she simply got there too late to see one" explanation is one I haven't actually heard before, thanks! My first thought was that she's so elderly that /surely/ she must have gotten to see one at some point, but IIRC the Dementors never actually defect from Azkaban until the second war's gotten into gear.

My personal explanation is that she can't actually see them and her indignation is a reaction to the implied/perceived bigotry of the question.

*** Mrs Figg couldn't see the dementors though, that's actually an important plot point in book 5.

** In canon, magic is like an on/off switch - you either have it, or you don't.

When you decide to have a gradient to it, it'll also open up the question towards those that have magic - if you're above the threshhold to be 'magical', is that gradient still there? IE - is there some substance to the Pureblood take?

I think it's certainly a logical version to take magic in - but it does open up some cans of worms, and it's good to be aware of it.

*** In canon, pureblood supremacy is as much about literal blood supremacy (as in physical breeding/pedigree) as it is about magical power. It doesn't matter how good you actually are at magic, to some people your blood is filthy and that's the only thing they will base their judgment on.

Even beyond that, I do think that whether magic exists on a gradient or magic is purely binary is rather irrelevant to whether pureblood supremacists have a point or not. Like, if someone tells you that smart people are inherently better than average/stupid people and the latter should be segregated from the former (or worse should actually be crushed under foot), that is not the time for an impassioned debate about the nature of intelligence and whether everyone is equally smart or not - that would be missing the forest for the trees. That is the time to tell them "have you gone mental? You can't just go around being an asshole to people - or worse, enslaving and killing them - whether you're actually better than them or not".
