*** I thought about that for like 3 seconds, then glanced at the utter chaos that is The Salem Settlement Chapter 4 and buried that thought.

** Well, I'm still game for next month. I look at it this way: More time to polish up the story (which I really need to do since it has a few typos which I spotted while reading through it recently) and more time ahead to remind my readers of it, I suppose.

Now, onto the reading!

** Also still game for next month (which gives me time to actually update the story lol)! I can't wait for the AMA -- time to start thinking up questions!

*** You're /allowed/ to ask pretty much anything so long as it doesn't invade the authors' privacy, but the authors are free not to answer if they feel uncomfortable with the question or don't want to share their reasons.

I personally wouldn't encourage it as well, especially since I want the AMA to be a fun experience for /everyone/ involved, and that wouldn't be possible if the authors are flooded with a bunch update requests.

However, if you do choose to ask update questions, be considerate. That's all I ask.
