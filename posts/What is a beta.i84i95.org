I see thank you notes on AN(s) all the time, but I'm not really sure what they are. Like do they proof read it or what?


** A beta is someone that would read the story before it gets published to give feedback, point out spelling and grammatical mistakes. stuff like that. Like a proof reader.

** They're the first person to read it after you write something. They usually do SPAG fixes at minimum, but really invested ones will find plot holes, character development issues, story arc progression/digression, fix sentence structure, point out contradictions in character speech & actions, keep the narrative consistant, and a lot more.
