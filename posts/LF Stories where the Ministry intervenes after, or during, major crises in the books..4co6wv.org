I've read one story like this that was incomplete (and likely abandoned), which involved Dumbledore reporting the presence of a basilisk in the school to the Ministry after the events of /Chamber of Secrets/. Far-reaching consequences ensue. I'm interested in reading more fanfictions like this, and would like to request recommendations.

Some of the scenarios I'd like to read about:

- Ginny being tried by the Ministry for "crimes" in the Chamber incident.

- Hermione facing the Ministry for charges against her by Dolores Umbridge, or relating to the Umbridge incident.

- The Ministry getting involved by investigating Lockhart, the Philosopher's Stone, or the "troll incident" where Hermione was endangered.

- Harry, Ron, or another character facing similar scenarios (or situations) with the Ministry of Magic deciding to "step in" or interfere.

- The Ministry generally having a larger presence in, or concerning, Hogwarts earlier on in the canon timeline, and the effects it has.

What I'm /not/ looking for:

- The Ministry intervenes by taking Harry away from the Dursleys. There's probably hundreds of these kinds of stories online.

I'm looking for these events to be well-written and well-explained, with consequences that change the outcome of how events occurred in the books.


** "Petrification Proliferation": Basilisks are Magical WMDs. The School and the Ministry treat reports of them accordingly.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.

** I think the problem with a story like this is that there would be either a ton of a) "Ministry incompetence" or b) political shenanigans that would make the story so un-compelling as to close it. In order to be a good story, we'd have to see a minimum of both, which isn't exactly evidenced in canon.

That said, I like "Petrification Proliferation" and it updated on Feb. 6 so it's not exactly abandoned, is it? (He asks hopefully.)

** Our protagonists had it bad enough in the Books, having the Ministry going after them additionally would make their lives total hell. How could they possibly defeat Voldemort then?

**** I think authors will get death threats and very nasty insults if they dare to go after Hermione for her incident with Umbridge.

There was one fic set in AU that has Ginny chucked into Azkaban for opening the chamber. But that world was vastly different than the canon universe, and the basilisk actually killed students. *[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]]* is the name of the story.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
