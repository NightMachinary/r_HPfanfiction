:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I am looking for a fanfiction that was Fred Weasley x OC. The plot was that he had died in the war and had a child with OC. After some years she found that she could bring him back through the veil, and there was something about how they had to be soulmates for it to work. Anyways, he comes back to life, meets his daughter (who I think is named Amelia, or it was the OC's name) and they live happily ever after. If there is anyone who has a copy or even the name and author I would really appreciate it. Have a great day!


** i have literally searched for this same fanfic for the past 3 years and can't find it :(

the OC worked for the department of mysteries, right? and had to research and all of that to get him back
