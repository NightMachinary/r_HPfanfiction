Just curious about your thoughts to these 8 questions:

1. What are the limits of "inanimate to animate" transfiguration. If I turn a rock into a pig, can the pig a) be eaten or b) reproduce?

2. Does turning edible food into rocks result in them being in stasis?

3. Can I turn edible food into other edible food (turn a turkey sandwich into a burger)?

4. What is alchemy and how is it different than transfiguration

5. Can you transfigure charms or abstract things like space, time, magic, etc?

6. What's the difference between conjuring using transfiguration and conjuring using charms (Aguamenti and Avis)

7. Question removed since it was based on misunderstanding

8. Is there a way to unvanish an object?


** Good questions.

*1(a)*

Yes. Or rather, if you have the ability to butcher the pig, then you can eat the products. The rule is that you can't make "good food", but a pig is not food. Bacon is food, pork chops are food. A pig is something that can become food if you do more things to it.

If you re-read the scene in DH where they discuss Gamp's law, you will see that they already have fish and mushrooms. The problem is that they can't use magic to turn it into something nice. The discussion turns to whether, when Molly creates a delicious feast, she has conjured it up from nothing - Hermione tells Ron you can't make good food out of nothing. The context of the discussion is Molly's delicious cooking - in that context, I think Hermione's statement must mean that you can't directly conjure up/transfigure a finished meal, i.e. "good food", food like Molly creates.

But they're /not/ talking about an inability to obtain *ingredients* with magic. We know that it's possible to create pigs and dogs with transfiguration, and we know that the products of transfiguration are permanent, genuine physical changes.

*1(b)*

Yes, the pig can reproduce. Transfiguration is a permanent physical change which is physically identical to a naturally occurring object. There's no physical difference between a transfigured rabbit and a natural one. So they can reproduce as well as natural pigs can. See also: Quintapeds.

*2*

The food isn't there "under" the rock, in statis. The food is gone. The object is just a rock now. To turn it back into food you will need to Untransfigure it.

When you Untransfigure a thing, it doesn't turn it into what it used to be, but rather into what it used to be + the experiences it underwent while transfigured. For example, Draco Malfoy, when transfigured back into a human, is still experiencing the pain of being bounced around as a ferret, and his hair is messy from the experience.

So when you turn the rock back into food, it will be the food as it would be had it experienced everything the rock experienced.

*3*

Yes, Hermione says you can transfigure food into other food.

*4*

Alchemy is about the perfection of both physical and spiritual substance in parallel. What the alchemist does externally is mirrored internally; external perfection (transformation into gold) is mirrored by internal perfection (eternal life).

*5*

No, simply because the definition of transfiguration is magic which alters a thing's physical nature. You can cast magic on space, time, other magic etc. but it's not transfiguration because those things aren't physical. Except maybe space.

*6*

Conjuring in transfiguration, being the opposite of vanishing (per McGonagall) takes objects out of non-being and their essence remains non-being.

It's unknown how Charms conjuration works, but it's noteworthy that water created by Aguamenti can be drunk, implying that it's real physical stuff not just some kind of illusion.

It seems to be that, somewhat ironically, objects conjured by Charms have more reality than objects conjured by transfiguration. Or, potentially, Aguamenti is an exception because it's not really an "object" being conjured but rather an element.

*8*

Yes, Montague was unvanished in OotP (having spent several months in that state) and the HBP vanishing cabinets depend on the mechanism of unvanishing (aka conjuration).

*** I think the issue with the reproduction of the pig is that I don't think transfiguration can give animals (transfigured from inanimate objects) souls, which seem to exist given the existence of animal ghosts. Souls seem to be a pre-requisite for the imprints left on earth of former living beings that ghosts are. The difference between quintapeds and the pig transfigured from rock is that the quintapeds are transfigured from people.

I suppose the issue then becomes whether you can reproduce without a soul. If you can, what happens with the offspring's soul?

Where'd you find the definition of alchemy? And where does McGonagall state that conjuration is the opposite of vanishment? I don't doubt that she does, because I vaguely remember it, but I can't quite find it going through the books.

**** The definition of alchemy isn't from HP, it's just what alchemy refers to in real life, which we know JKR researched substantially.

As regards the vanishing quote, you're right to ask - I misremembered it. McGonagall simply contrasts vanishing and conjuring, but she doesn't specify that they are opposites:

#+begin_quote
  “Yes, you too, Longbottom,” said Professor McGonagall. “There's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence. So... today we are starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not usually attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL.”

*** Montague was in a broken Vanishing cabinet which acts more like a teleporter than a Vanishing spell, so we don't know exactly what state he was in.

** I think when transfiguring a pig it'd mostly be something that looks like a pig but requires magic to move around because the transfiguring wizard probably didn't get all the details in the internal organs right. So it's more like an animated statue. If someone created an actual pig with every organ and every bit of DNA correct, it might be edible after a while when enough of the transfigured inedible matter has been replaced with organics.

Alchemy is about creating more real things than other magic, for example while transfiguration might produce something that looks like gold and if the wizard is skilled also has the density, electric conductivity and reactivity as gold, Alchemy produces true gold that's completely indistinguishable from mined gold on the nuclear level. Or while anti aging potions reverse the symptoms of aging, Alchemy can actually repair the causes like DNA damage. Alchemy probably requires a ton more knowledge of how things work than other magic, so chemistry would be quite closely related. But that's just my headcanon. I wouldn't be surprised if Flamel had a particle accelerator in his lab, to experiment on magical properties of elements that don't naturally exist.

** 1. No to a and b.
2. I do not know, but I am not against the idea.
3. Possibly.
4. Alchemy seems to be a mix of Potions and Transfiguration and together they form something incredibly powerful. Alchemy can bypass some of Gamp's laws on Transfiguration. While you can change something into gold, the goblins and wizards would be able to detect that it is, in fact, not real gold and it is actually worthless. We know the Philosopher's Stone bypass this.
5. What is transfiguring a charm or time? Transfiguration is changing something into something else as well as vanishing/conjuring. Perhaps a charm/spell would be theoretically feasible, but it would be the most different kind of Transfiguration. I don't think you can transfigure concepts because they aren't tangible of part of what I like to call 'void'. Time, unlike a horse, is an intangible idea that cannot take actual physical form or image.
6. Both Aguamenti and Avis are defined as Transfiguration and Conjuration respectively. Conjuration is part of Transfiguration. Therefore, Avis is a Transfiguration spell and not a charm unlike what Rowling mistakenly called it.
7. I have no idea.
8. I assume you can unvanish objects you vanished yourself. After all, what is the difference between conjuring an object from nothing which you had no idea where you could find it and conjuring an object you yourself vanished?

*** Though I agree with you on avis being a transfiguration spell, aguamenti is a charm.

#+begin_quote
  “We've got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. “And we're supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject?”

Conjuration via transfiguration differs from its analogue in charms.

** 1. No to both. No soul and the exception of Gamp's law.
2. Yes, until one untransfigures them. I think this would be the most thematically fitting with canon, but it is not a position directly supported by canon (so far as I am aware).
3. Yes, but you cannot increase the value of the food (though you can the taste).
4. Alchemy is a separate subject. All we really know is that it can provide eternal life and transmute gold at its highest level. This is all we really know from canon. I don't really have a preference about it in fics.
5. Yes, you can cast spells on other spells (unbreakable braking charm is on the firebolt in PoA). I'd say yes to space and magic. No real canonical support for time but I'd say it's fitting with the theme of canon where magic is conceptual and treats concepts as essential (secrets for example).
6. 6. Conjuring via transfiguration is not permanent. Conjuring via charms is permanent. You can drink the water from aguamenti. However, the bird conjuring is taught in transfiguration so it is not a charm. The name from the Sony book is likely incorrect.
7. Yes, look at quintapeds. Quintapeds have a magical nature and arose from a blood curse/transfiguration. Draconifors is from a video game though, so take a block of salt with it.
8. Possibly. If vanishing makes objects go into non-being which is to say everything, it may be possible to conjure them again (the mead scene in HBP, Neville's desk in CoS). However, I am not convinced of this and believe that both theories have adequate support.

** Explicitly personal opinions, informed by book canon. My headcanon of transfiguration is that items have a natural state, and magical transfiguration out of said state requires a finite amount of magic, which can be continuously supplied from a wizard at close range, or applied once, in which case the imbued magic will decay exponentially. An "untransfiguration" is therefore not a spell, it is a release of magic.

1) You can definitely turn a rock into a pig. If you and another wizard both kept the imbuing for an inordinately long amount of time and mated two transfigured pigs, you could theoretically produce a third under the magical imbuing of both transfigurations. Releasing the magic on this monstrosity would probably cause the two rocks to fuse permanently.

You can't eat the pig (or its offspring). That's a violation of Gamp's law.

2) Theoretically, yes, but the amount of magic needed to do so would be impractically high and less efficient than storing food properly.

3) Yes, but you wouldn't be able to increase the stored energy of the sandwich, so it would be a rather small burger.

4) Alchemy is the intersection of Muggle hard sciences and magic. It is the study of the effects of magical imbuing of solutions in physically transformative or reactive states and the sometimes surprising results this can produce.

5) Theoretically, this is what a charm is.

6) Transfiguration is magic performed on an object of focus, whereas conjuring draws elements from a surrounding environment in proportion to the amount of magic imbued.

8) No. Vanishing disperses the elements of an object evenly through all space. No wizard has the power to conjure something from the breadth of the universe.

This is in contrast to Banishing, which is in its most simplistic terms the opposite of conjuration.

** 1) transfigured animals aren't really alive, and can be consumed but provide no nutritional value, per Gamp's Law. The accuracy of their form is mostly based on how familiar one is with their anatomy, so if you were to dissect one, its parts probably wouldn't be in the right place etc unless you were a butcher. They can reproduce, but the spawn are also not alive. (I assume one of the exceptions to Gamp's Law is that you can't conjure true life, only simulacrums --- this gets around the rather pressing ethical issues of turning hedgehogs into pin cushions and the like).

2) either yes it would remain in stasis or just mostly, only decaying at the speed the rock decays at. The biological processes for rotting couldn't take place in a rock, but it could have bits break off, be ground down, etc.

3) yes, you can transfigure it into another kind of food, but it would carry the same nutritional content as the original. This matches what Hermione says about it in DH while still obeying Gamp's Law.

4) speculative, but alchemy would alter the magical properties of materials, while transfiguration wouldn't. You never hear about someone just conjuring potions ingredients, for example, and I imagine it'd be quite the disruption to the economy if you could. Thus, I tend to think that transfiguring magic itself is another one of the exceptions to Gamp's Law, though they likely study this in the DoM. I believe in canon it states it's impossible to steal magic, so I think it has some basis there as well.

E: alchemy is a different field than transfiguration so Gamp's Law wouldn't necessarily apply; breaking these rules is what makes it especially difficult, since in my head canon, though they technically apply strictly only to transfiguration, many of them are applicable to other fields as well, so potions can break the one about nutrition/food, but not the one about love, for example; alchemy is the only field that lacks an arithmantic proof stating that at least one of those applies, though only food, water, and magic have produced an example.

5) space and time you can transfigure (distort at least), but not magic (see above). The former are likely difficult, but we have apparition/Portkeys and time turners, so that seems pretty settled.

6) this is just a fun headcanon, but I think it's hilarious to imagine that potable water is another exception to Gamp's Law. Aguamenti is a charm, not a transfiguration --- instead of conjuring it, it condenses it from the air/pulls from nearby sources. No basis in the books except that Aguamentj is indeed a charm, and we don't see them ever explicitly learning to conjure water in transfiguration, which I assume would be one of the most useful things to learn if you could. Avis is a standard conjuring of something animate, so it doesn't create true life, but again, just a simulacrum.

7) I tend to think so. You could, for example, vanish a tankard of mead and unvanish it elsewhere. Those things would remain in stasis when vanished. This explains how on occasion we see professors “conjure” sandwiches, barring some house elf interference that they have going to send it from the kitchens, so it just looks like they're super powerful but the wand movement is actually just a signal to the elves, which is also a fun thought.

These theories leave the five exceptions to Gamp's Law as: food, water, life, magic, and, since this is HP, the fifth is love (supported by Slughorn's statement that amortentia doesn't create true love). If you needed to modify this to add more, you could combine food and water under the umbrella of life, since those two are necessary components for life.
