So like the title says fanfics where a Harry has some loyal and or fanatic supporters kind of like Death Eaters.

Similar To the following which I've already read

Rise of a Dark Lord by Little.Miss.Xanda

Jaded Eyes of a Prodigy by Wickedlfairy17

Harry Potter: Lord of Darkness by AngelSlayer135

An Ace In The Hole by aadixon


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux; The Sum of Their Parts). The former has Harry leading what is essentially a smaller precursor to the DA, and the latter is about him becoming a full on dark lord in order to give Teddy a better life.

*** Just a warning accidental horcrux is part one of a two part story and the "sequel" is nowhere near completed and last updated in March after a long hiatus when he said he would update in november

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
