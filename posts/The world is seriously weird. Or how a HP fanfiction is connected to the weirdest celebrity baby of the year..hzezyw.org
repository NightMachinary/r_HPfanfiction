You know the infamous HPMoR fic?

Apparently it was intended to get more people interested in the author's views on consciousness and AI, getting more people on his forums about these topics.

On those forums, a few months after HPMoR started, one user came up with Roko's Basilisk, a theoretical piece of knowledge dangerous to whoever learns of it (provided that that person has certain views on consciousness). It involves AIs and brain simulations but the name is probably inspired by the HP fanfiction discussions on the same forums.

The concept became a popular thought experiment for people involved with AI safety and eventually Elon Musk used it as a pickup line for dating Grimes aka /c/.

So there you have it. Without Harry Potter fanfiction, there's a good chance that X AE A-XII Musk wouldn't have been born. Probably the most dafuq thing you've read today.

Wat.

I'm sorry, but I don't think I can take reading 90 chapters of that in order to get to the payoff.

I am incredibly passionate about science. Someone who isn't interested in it would probably not even notice the many faux pases and the utter non-sense that is passed on as fact. But for me? It's a constant blow to my heart and my suspension of disbelief. Because no self-respecting scientist would ever teach their children the way Harry's step-father apparently did.

The author appears to have a flawed interpretation of the scientific method and the way science works. And that flawed interpretation is presented in the story universe as fact. Add on top of that the character of Harry (at least in the first chapters that I read through). Harry's character is not only built upon the flawed science, it's also a character I find incredibly unlikable. I just want to take him and smack some sense onto him.

And it tries /so much/ to sound /rational/ and /scientific/ but it just comes out condescending and /wrong/. Harry is supposed to be this genius but his actions do not match that, at least in my opinion.

********* And if you hate it that much then obviously you don't have to read it, but it may interest you to know that the story literally does smack some sense into him. One of the main themes in the story is Harry coming to realize how much of an idiot he's been.

I'm a mathematician and like to think that I'm reasonably scientifically literate. It's obvious that the author isn't an expert in what he's writing about, but I don't see why I should let that get in the way of what is to me an otherwise enjoyable story.

**** he profited of emerald mines and apartheid in South Africa (his parents), the US overthrew a government in Bolivia so he could get cobalt easily (cobalt mines have child labour and underpay workers), he stops Tesla workers from unionising so they can get better pay, he pretends to be a anti government free market capitalist but got 5 billion in government subsidies.

He is the Kim kardashin to people who watch rick and morty, just because he's a billionaire who can meme doesn't make him a funny and relatable person.
