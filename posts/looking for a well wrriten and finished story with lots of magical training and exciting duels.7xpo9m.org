Also, thank you for coming by to insult everyone. I'm particularly impressed with the sloppy spelling, incomplete sentences, and inconsistent capitalization. We'll be sure to take your carefully written comments for their full value.

  MoR is on a par with published works by professional authors, so I was just curious how it can be considered 'not good' when taking into acount the competition.
#+end_quote

As a whole, no. It isn't. At least works not self-published on Amazon. I mean, I'm not one to nitpick grammar because I'm a fairly lazy editor myself. But, I would have no issue calling myself a much better technical writer than Less Wrong. I can pull up just about any paragraph of MoR and find multiple issues with sentence structure. And that's without getting into the contradictory jargon and false principles.

I have not read more than excerpts of the fic, and I never will. But as someone who does professionally write and edit, I can tell you that I would have given it two pages and then rejected it.

Granted, I don't read fanfiction. But there are very few that I've seen, MoR included, that would pass the 'professional' level of grammar.

Hell, I'd likely reject my own. Granted, if I was trying to get them 'published' I'd also spend more time editing them. This doesn't really contribute to the topic at hand all that much. But you're vastly overselling the technical aspects of MoR. The author likes run-ons more than I do. Which is not a good thing.

** I feel like these have a bit of it, but it isn't exactly the main focus. linkffn(The Legacy by storytellerspw; Honour Thy Blood) HTB has a lot more training and duels than The Legacy, but imo The Legacy feels a bit more "canon" and probable.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
