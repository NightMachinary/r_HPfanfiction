I am just tired to see fanfics that scorpious ended up in Gryffindor just because he isn't bad,or fanfics that still show slytherins as evil

Saying that story X is better than CC is damning with faint praise, just like “person X is a better person than Hitler/Stalin/Pol Pot/etc”

** Have you read linkffn(Hogwarts houses divided)? It features Teddy Lupin and his friends, who each get sorted into a different house. It features each house in a positive light and if I recall correctly there are some Slytherin characters that are really cool. There is a slight Gryffindor focus though. OR linkffn(put your guns away, it's tea time) is a really nice Albus/Scorpius fic with sequels that take place at Hogwarts where treatment of Slytherins and the Slytherin characters themselves take a prominent role.

**** Yea! The sequels are actually what came to mind for this request, since the first story is mostly (wonderful and awwww inducing) family stuff. The sequels really get into life at Hogwarts. Though I haven't read the one where they're adults yet! If you have and you think it's good, please let me know!

***** I've read... maybe 2/3s of the adult one? I don't think I like it as much as the first two, but that's because I prefer fics that focus on characters we actually get to know in canon, and this fic is really mostly about James, Albus, and Lily. But the writing is still solid, and I'm definitely going to keep reading it (as soon as I stop being distracted by other fics :p).

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

** I can thoroughly recommend linkffn(Albus Potter and the Global Revelation) and all its sequels. It's basically an entire new 7-book series, completely planned out in advance (so with plenty of foreshadowing, overarching villains, and all that good stuff). It doesn't specifically focus on Slytherin, but there are plenty of Slytherins with significant roles in the plot.

** You know I actually liked that albus ended on Slytherin but they messed up in developing a familiar trama that shouldn't exist because harry is okay with the House by the end of the franchise so the problem here is not showing the prejudice that the other houses have to Slytherin they could show James and rose bullying some Slytherin students for example

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!

** Thanks for the recs. This is my favorite era and it's sparse at best. Even the good ones seem to focus on the original trio too much. I just want a new series about kids going to Hogwarts.

​

I will shamelessly promote my own work: Two full novels, covering the first two years of Teddy Lupin's time at Hogwarts. (Apologies, it's Hufflepuff PoV)
