During the exam, there is an obstacle course. Harry transfigures wings during an air part, turns himself into metal to avoid being crushed by 2 stone walls, transfigures wooden footsteps as he runs across water, and turns himself into liquid as he passes through a fence.

I think Madam Marchbanks was the one monitoring his exam
