Hi! I'm curious to see if anyone here has ever read a longish/completed FanFiction involving Harry either being born a member of the Royal Family or being adopted/raised by them. I did a classic google search but wasn't having to much luck unfortunately. Any help would be appreciated!

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen, an event which causes Vernon to die of a heart attack. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry's 9th birthday and several years before Prince Charles and Princess Diana divorced. Warnings may change as the story progresses.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] has the Royal Family as Harrys Blood Family. But it doesnt really focus on that. It is also Dark!Harry and Haphne as far as I remember.

  The Tower of London has a dark and bloody past both in the muggle and wizarding worlds. Besides being a prison, it also served as a sanctuary in times past, what if it became one yet again? -AU
