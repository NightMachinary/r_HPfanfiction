When you are permanently stuck with scars that spell SNEAK, it kinda fucks up your whole future. You're less likely to be trusted for your whole life.

Imagine if we branded every single criminal this way, "THIEF" right on the forehead. It kinda messes up their chances to ever have a normal life, doesn't it? Shouldn't punishment be more about rehabilitation? If you permanently brand someone on the face, it's not rehabilitation, it just destroys their life forever.

This is a really bad comparison. There is legal recourse against thievery.

We are talking about opposing a terrorist organization and a oppressive/corrupt regime here. There's no legal recourse at all. You are not creating a constitution - vigilante justice is the only thing you have at your disposal.

** No, I don't think she did. At the same time I also don't see it as justice being enacted, but rather as Hermione trying to be both efficient and ruthless. After all, it is her education and her best friends she is trying to protect. With danger in the air and behind every door, the DA wasn't something she wanted to take lightly. I understand Hermione's motivations but I also see where Cho was coming from when she defended Marietta.

**** Of course not, but what [[/u/Karinta]] was saying is that said ruthless and vindictive streak makes Hermione a flawed character. It makes Hermione realistic, because it shows that she's not 'perfect', by any means. On top of that, she can seem quite swotty, bossy, and condescending at times, which put a lot of her classmates off from her in the beginning. For much of PS/SS, Harry and Ron even didn't even seem to like her much until the troll incident.

******** Yes. As I pointed out in my reply above, there are major examples even in SS/PS. Hermione is certainly not a saint, which Rowling herself said in an interview. Hermione is an "exaggerated" version of Rowling, with Rowling saying that she's "more intelligent", and far more dedicated in academics, than she was herself.

#+begin_quote
  *Q:* So you're writing these three characters over an extended period of time -- how much of you ends up in all three of them?

  *J.K. Rowling:* I envision a good argument that says that an author is in every single character they write. They have to be. You have to understand from the inside what someone's going through, which means that you have to put yourself in a lot of different heads. But Harry, Ron and Hermione, I am absolutely in all three of them. Harry is a curious character. He's not the most popular character in the book for a good reason, because he has to be this questing person.

  *Often that person is slightly less easy to love because their flaws tend not to be run-of-the-mill flaws.* But Harry is often the by-stander -- the eyes onto the world -- and that gives him a particular power. He is slightly detached, which isn't a very lovable quality. But often people who have that detachment are rather unusual and are able to do things. And most writers have a degree of detachment, so if I stand right back from those three characters, I can say that is the part of me that maybe is in Harry. Hermione is easy.

  *Hermione is an exaggerated version of myself at that age. She's not exactly like me, but I was certainly a very bookish girl and I was the girl who would've gone to the library to look it up.* That's how I would've reacted to the challenges of Hogwarts. I would've gone to find a book. And there's a lot of me in Ron. A lot of Ron's most base humor would make me laugh. I'm not saying that's the only stuff that makes me laugh, but I love Ron's humor -- and obviously that comes from me. I'm making up the jokes.

For example, one of Rowling's college professors regarded her as "unremarkable" in terms of grades, and she was certainly much more like Harry or Ron in the classroom. Hermione may be "more intelligent", but that doesn't mean that it wasn't treated as a flaw. Lack of a direct "calling out" also doesn't necessarily mean that Hermione /doesn't/ face negative repercussions for her choices.

For example, even later on in the series, Hermione's attitude, behavior, and lack of social finesse continues to create negative consequences for her. A large example is her creating the D.A., but needing Harry to lead it, basically /for/ her, which is covered in /Order of the Phoenix/.

The reason for this? Harry is more "likeable", "charismatic", and "personable" than Hermione is, by Hermione's own admission. She acknowledges that, with her at the helmship, people would be unwilling to accept her as their leader.

Likewise, earlier on, there's the infamous S.P.E.W. incident, whereas Hermione doggedly pursued "freedom for all house elves", at the cost of her friends' and classmates' irritation, laughter, and annoyance. In /Half-Blood Prince/, after /Order of the Phoenix/, we see the consequences of Hermione being unable to admit to herself her feelings for Ron, or muster the proper social skills to initiate a relationship with him. This results in a far more socially competent peer, Lavender Brown, starting a relationship with Ron instead, leaving Hermione annoyed and aggravated.

And we see that this flaw of hers, meaning her haughtiness and tendency to go overboard, is something that had caused difficulties for her. This is the very thing that made her too bossy and so hard to make friends at the beginning of the story, for example.

To answer you're question, and not make THIS a shitpost, Marrieta very much deserved the punishment. She had a contract that she signed and she should have damn well stuck to it.

For the punishment in question being extremely vicious, you're right about that, it was vicious, but goddamn was it efficient. As for the vindictive nature of the punishment, Marrieta sold them out to Umbridge, and what does Umbridge do, or well, attempt to Crucio the leader.

Which of the two is more vicious, the one that leaves scars that correctly reflect your personality or a curse that can send you to fucking La La land?

** I want to talk about the curse itself, I think that will help me discern if the punishment is to severe and how it fits into the morality of the larger universe.

1.) Marietta willing signed her name to a contract which /was/ explained although in vague terms.

#+begin_quote
  *“I-I think everybody should write their name down, just so we know who was here. But I also think,” she took a deep breath, “that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we're doing. So if you sign, you're agreeing not to tell Umbridge --- or anybody else --- what we're up to.”*
#+end_quote

2.) Any action performed in the Harry Potter universe has a power too it. The best example I can find of JK outright tell us this is in book 5, chapter 37:

#+begin_quote
  *...delivered you to her sister, her only remaining relative... She may have taken you grudgingly, furiously, unwillingly, bitterly, yet still she took you, and in doing so, she sealed the charm I placed upon you. Your mother's sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield I could give you.*
#+end_quote

Here we see the power of making a choice of your own free will. It protects Harry and as we learn five books later, damns Marietta.

3.) This is further reinforced by Harry in book 7

#+begin_quote
  *Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts.*
#+end_quote

4.) The terminology in HP is confusing when dealing with Curses. We see clear evidence that they come in at least two forms. One form acts like a projectile shot from a wand, ie: The Killing Curse. The other type of Curse doesn't require a wand or seemingly any wizard to sustain it at all. I'm talking about the curse on the DADA position. It had been in effect for 20~ years by the time Voldemort dies, and we can assume that he broke the curse so that the Carrows would be safe while working at Hogwarts, or that the simple act of replacing the DADA class with Dark Arts was what broke the curse.

I believe that Hermione's curse worked in much the same way. It was given power by the Signatory consent. I also assume that it works in much the same way that the Fidelius Charm worked(Hid a secret in a soul), by taking the Trust everyone placed in each other and placing it within the document.

So Merietta breaks the trust of the group by betraying them to Umbridge and activates the cruse and is *"disfigured by a series of close-set purple pustules that had spread across her nose and cheeks to form the word “SNEAK.”*

Now the curse fades overtime but never completely as a number of users have mentioned. I think this has great parallels to the notion of trust. Whilst those betrayed feel particularly aggrieved the curse is in full force, but over time the other members of the DA move on with their lives and get over it. But the trust is broken, none of them can ever see Marietta in the same way after what she did, and now, neither can the rest of the world.

*** Scars are still quite permanent. Even if it fades with time, it's still there. If someone looked closely, or got close to Marietta's face, chances are, they would still see said scars. Case in point, acne scars, stretch marks, birthmarks, burn scars, and other forms of scars, are still visible and sometimes obvious, even years after the event.

I myself have a scar on my head from when I was born, thought to be from a fetal monitor, which resulted in a large and permanent bald patch I usually cover with the hair around it. Two acquaintances also both have large burn scars on their hands and elbows, respectively.

She could have wound up with a few very faint marks that no one would notice unless she pointed them out.

Could be wishful thinking on my part, though. She did sign a contract and she should have known how high the stakes were (fighting against Umbridge /and/ Voldemort), so Hermione's punishment wouldn't bother me if it lasted for only a few years, but I like to hope she didn't have to deal with it her whole life.

Funny you should ask that. Years ago (before the first harry Potter book was published), I was thinking about burglars. Coincidentally, at the same time, I considered getting a beginner's tattoo kit. I also wondered about how difficult it would be to incorporate iron rings into the cement floor in the basement.

No, it's not as if I planned to tie the fuckers down and tattoo "THIEF" onto their foreheads. Or testing my Taser.
