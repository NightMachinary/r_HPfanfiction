So, lately I've had a real craving for a certain kinda of story in a HP fanfic, but I've been unable to find anything that quite hits the spot, so I've decided to take up the task of writing it myself.

I've hit a snag, though - I haven't actually read the books in, like, 7 years, and I'm not sure how much fanon is coloring my memory. I, unfortunately, no longer own the books, and I'm flat broke so I can't justify dropping money on a new set. I also don't have a library card at the moment, so I can't check them out either. Is there an alternative way for me to reacquaint myself with the books?


** For free? hp-lexicon.org

It's better than the wiki as it has sources and only takes from the books and some rare unpublished tie-ins.

At this point I would just torrent the ebooks or Stephan Fry's audiobook. Harry Potter's already made more money than god can count.

Also Cursed Child.

**** What's your premise? If I like the sound of it I'll keep an ear to the ground for it.

***** A Half-Blood who was pretty much hidden away from the wizarding world and raised as a Muggle ends up becoming a family friend of the Weasleys when she's hired by Arthur to fix his car. During this time, she's accidentally exposed to magic in a way that indicates she's a witch, and the story follows her attempts to catch up and integrate into wizarding society with the perspective of a person who grew up as a Muggle.

****** I would focus on "an /adult/ who grew up as a muggle" - otherwise it's rather close to the canon series since Harry was raised a muggle.

Also, you need to decide how wizarding society looks to an adult muggle, instead of an impressionable young kid who wants to leave his relatives. Not a lot of that has been defined in canon.

Is it a democracy? Is the Wizengamot elected, or are the members chosen like those of the House of Lords? If there is a democracy, is there "one man one vote", or are votes weighed, or is there a minimum income or land ownership you need to be allowed to vote? Or some minimum proficiency in magic? Or some "Magic culture" tests? What's the stance on human rights? (In canon, the use of dementors pretty much proves that they don't care about the prohibition of torture.) How does the economy work? What kind of jobs are there in the magical world? How do people live and pay rent if they work in the muggle world and have a magical house? What about culture?

It's rather hard to decide if your character actually wants to integrate in a society much less how if those fundamental questions are not covered. And canon doesn't help there at all.

****** I can see why you'd have to write that yourself. I've not come across something like that before. Good luck!

*** The libraries near me require you to give them your address, which they then mail you a card at that you have to bring back to them to prove you're contactable before they let you check out books. Considerably longer than a minute.

**** Well then it'll take a few days. Reading the books is going to take awhile anyway, and writing takes much more time than that. If you lack the patience to get a library card you're never going to write a fic.

** Google "read harry potter books online for free" there are a number of websites that act as an online library. Most of them have the option of reading online or downloading. I have read a bunch of books this way, so long as they aren't brand new you are in good shape.
