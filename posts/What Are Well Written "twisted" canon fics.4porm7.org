By "twisted canon" I mean fanfics that are canon-compliant but completely alter the meaning of certain events in canon. This is deliberate reading against JKR's intent. Some examples that come to mind are The Golden Age linkffn(3682339) and Overdose linkffn(9554445). Lately I've been finding these types of fics to be an amusing read.


** These are crack, but technically canon-compliant? linkffn(7480987; 4539146)

Thanks for the two fics, they look promising!

** I can't think of many off the top of my head, but will come back to this. Just to clarify, canon where nothing is hugely different, but events are taken differently or the author picks up on something JKR missed?

The Strange Disappearance of Sally-Anne Perks linkffn(6243892) would qualify I think, and also Promotion by Endgames linkffn(11029663), particularly the chapter with the basilisk. Sadly that one is on hiatus it seems.

** These are my favorite types of fics and I have a few to recommend - all different types of pairings. The thing is, that a lot of times the best of these will be canon compliant up until the epilogue. It is really hard to write an interesting fic imo that lays on top of hogwarts era canon that also complies with the epilogue. There are also a few fics that start after the epilogue that are good - but I am not sure that is exactly what you're looking for? I will recommend both though.

*Twist of Fate - Oakstone730* - Linkao3(473335)

This is my favorite of the "twisted-canon" genre and is pretty much exactly what you are asking for in your request. It is EWE, but it pretty seamlessly maps onto canon otherwise (if you assume that canon is based on Harry's altered memories). In this fic, Harry and Draco have a beautiful, albeit young love, relationship 4th and 5th year at Hogwarts that they have to keep secret. Then for Harry's protection in the war, Snape forces Draco to erase all of Harry's memories of them being together. The story pics up after the war at the trials when Harry finds out. It is so heartbreaking and beautiful. This story is expertly woven into the fabric of canon so much so that part of me wants to imagine that this IS canon, but it is also pretty heartbreaking...

If you're not big on slash, this fic is very angsty with the slash, but it's T so not really graphic at all. I would say even het shippers should give it a shot just because of how well it fits in canon - it is really really well done.

*Choices by Abbe* - linkffn(5846417)

The basic premise is that Lily Luna Potter accidentally time travels back 47 years and meets Sirius and James in 1980. She finds out she cant change the past and has a brief romance with Sirius and then travels back into 2028. But THEN Sirius time travels forward 47 years and a bunch of the other next gen characters time travel too and exciting adventures happen. This fic, although totally different from canon, actually maps perfectly onto canon - it is a great example of what you are asking for as it uses the events from canon but changes our perception of them to tell a different story.

*TURN by Saras_Girl* - linkao3(879852)

A DM/HP slash fic that begins after the Epilogue from DH. This is incredibly well written and is usually on top of any list of the best DM/HP fics. The premise is that due to some "it's a wonderful life" type magic, Harry gets to live for awhile in the AU he would have had if he had apologized to Draco after the sectumsempra incident. After that glimpse, he has to go back to his regular life with Ginny and make some hard decisions about his marriage and his career. And, maybe try to cultivate a relationship with Draco. In typing it all out, this fic doesn't sound as good as it really is. It is GREAT.

*Eye of the Beholder by pir8fancier* - linkao3(639538) This is also HP/DM slash -post epilogue, but that part doesnt come until the very end so you can skip it and still really enjoy this fic. This fic was really unusual and well done - it reads like a portrait of Draco Malfoy. It is written in the first person (Draco's) and is an introspective and detailed account of Draco's whole life - his motivations, his thoughts and opinions, his participation in the war, his relationship with his son and wife and how he came to discover he was gay. The relationship between Draco and Harry is well done, although it felt pretty secondary to the rest of the story - which was also somewhat a breath of fresh air for H/D slash. This fic is also totally epilogue compliant and reads like a well done version of the author's head canon on who Draco is/was and how he turned out within the confines of canon.

*The Boy Who Died a Lot by starcrossedgirl* - linkao3(670548)

This fic is really really creative and a great read! If you're not a Snarry fan (as I'm not really) then just skip the coda which is the only part with any graphic Snarry. The rest is a really cool fic that takes Snape saving Harry all the time to the next level.

The basic premise is that during Harry's first year, he dies during the detention in the forbidden forest with Draco. Because Dumbledore knows the Prophecy, and knows Harry can't die (yet...) he gives Snape a time turner and puts him in charge of saving Harry. There's a Final Destination twist where fate keeps trying to kill Harry (I think he dies 20 times from Rons broken wand in second year for example) and Snape just keeps saving him. It has cool time travel and interesting time loop things with multiple Snapes. It's also canon-compliant EWE (which is rare for most Hogwarts era slash - especially Snarry) because Snape's use of the time-turner creates the events of the book as we read them.

*Casting Moonshadows by Moonsign* - linkffn(3378356)

I don't think this is exactly what you mean by twisted canon, but as far as I can tell, this is could be canon compliant, but part of why people love writing MWPP is that canon for them is not as well-developed as for Harry's gen so there is SO MUCH that could be canon-compliant.

This is one of my favorite marauder fics and it is RL/SB slash. This spans from first year until the end of 6th year (although it is still being updated occasionally) and is one of the most detailed and beautifully written MWPP fics in fandom.

The downsides are that it is really dark (especially Remus' and Sirius' back stories) and assuming it sticks with canon going forward, knowing what happens to the Marauders (especially Remus and Sirius), makes parts especially heartbreaking.

The pranks in this fic are amazing. The friendships are heartwarming. It will make you laugh and cry. There's a reason why this fic has 7k comments and is such a favorite almost 10 years after it was started. The author is also a published author in her own right, so you know the writing is great.

*Grey Skye Mourning - KneazleGriff* - linkffn(8315797)

Okay so this is the fluffiest Snarry ever and only for committed SS/HP shippers or people wiling to read any pairing. That said, this is such a great time travel fic! Many other I've read have been "fix-it" fics - time travel fics where time is a straight line (like Back to the Future), where when you go back, if you make changes, it changes the future. In this fic, as with canon, time is an unchanging loop - where everything that happened will still happen.

In this fic, Harry goes back in time to save Snape right after the battle at Hogwarts. He meets his parents and Dumbledore in the past and they all know he is from the future, but they do not ALL know who he is. He falls in love with Snape in the past and has to try to save him in the future from dying in the shrieking shack. He cannot try to save his parents or anyone else who died though because everything that has happened will still happen, even when he is in the past.

Anyway, the coolest thing about this story is how Harry back in the past MADE the things that happened in the future happen. For example, Sirius knowing James and Lily would die convinced Peter to be the secret keeper thinking that he was going to change the future. It was a really cool plot device and fits into the "twisted-canon" genre well.

*** Thanks for all the recs! I've come across The Boy Who Died A Lot and I just read Eye of the Beholder - it was fantastic! I honestly think I'm a closet Drarry fan (I like to read about tension/romance between the two, but can't deal with smut)

**** If that is the case, you HAVE to read Twist of Fate. It isn't smutty and is the best "twisted canon" I've ever read. It miiiight be my favorite fic of all time, but that is just because the story has really stayed with me long after reading it and the plot is really well done. The writing itself is also good, but it is the plot that is the best.

  One-shot. In times of war, desperate measures must often be taken -- "for the greater good", some would say. But all things have side effects, as Minerva McGonagall discovered once all was said and done. No pairings; deliberate reading against authorial intent (as always).

** The Diggory Papers - linkffn(2846963) I've reced this one before - OK I do like it.

GoF from Cedric's PoV which portrays him as a cheat, a scoundrel and a liar, but possessing a winning way with people. Completely compliant with canon except for one big detail.

  Cedric Diggory tells the story of his last year at Hogwarts, the Triwizard Tournament and an unlikely survival. Because Cedric Diggory did not die in Little Hangleton. Nor was he anyone's hero. Coward, lecher and cheat, but never hero. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  There is legend. And then there is truth. In 9th century England, three wizards band together, not to found a school, but to concoct one of the greatest lies ever told.

  And thus began the history of Hogwarts.
