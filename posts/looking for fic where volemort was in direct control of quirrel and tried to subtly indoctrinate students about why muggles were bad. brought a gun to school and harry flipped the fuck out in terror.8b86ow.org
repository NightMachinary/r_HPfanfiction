went of on this rant about how dangerous guns are, how much worse they were than wands, etc. and everybody in setting treats this as perfectly rational and normal.

this specific harry had also been depicted as abnormally mature and levelheaded in all other respects.


** The rant was less about the gun and more about the face that he was waving it in the direction of the students.

*** I've read this concept somewhere before, but I haven't read this story.

Edit: This also happens in Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. Though Harry's freakout isn't about the gun in particular. Also, not exactly indoctrination.
