Where Harry does what he must because he can for the good of all of us. except for the ones who are dead. but seriously are there any fics where harry is a true chaotic neutral and does shit because he feels like it or it seems interesting rather than some evil plot(chaos does not plan chaos does) or because it's the right thing to do(chaos has no morals, chaos does not listen to the petty restrictions of society.)


** I prefer my chaos organized.

** I think these three would fit your request the most, from the stories I'm currently aware of.

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11669575/1/For-Love-of-Magic][For Love of Magic]]/ --- Harry's two main priorities are to learn magic in its multifaceted forms and to protect his in-group (mostly his lovers). After learning about the prophecy, he grudgingly comes to accept that he'll also have to uproot and kill VD.

  - Pros: worldbuilding, magical lore, some deconstruction of canon's magic and experimentation with magic, derailing from canon stations and travelling;
  - Cons: at least some wishful thinking and cracky elements, (IIRC) intellectually nerfed Dumbledore, unrealistically quickly OPed Harry;
  - Warnings: WiP, smut scenes, harem-ish poly, magical tattoos and rituals, ruthless!Harry.

- /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3793741/1/Harry-Potter-Unchampion][Unchampion]]/ and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11610805/1/Muggle-Raised-Champion][Muggle-Raised Champion]]/ --- harvested from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4yqea0/any_stories_in_which_harry_deliberately_flanks/][this thread]]

I'm really bad at keeping track of fics, but there is one where he spent eons simply f'ing with the timeline in various different ways just to see what would happen. I mean thousands of years, and then something happens where he meets someone(super vague yes, but I cannot recall the details).
