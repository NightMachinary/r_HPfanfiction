That is all.


** WASSA this would be so cute!!! :) Like all the Harry can talk to snakes or lions or dragons ideas - but all wrapped up in one! :) :) Please someone write this okay?

Yes Harry could use strategics warfare like this against voldemort. :) He could like shrink a potion and then have bees fly them to the death eaters and fly over their heads and then they would all fall asleep or something. :)

*** Or have the bees coat their stingers with a concentrated version if a potion, and then stab the Munchers to a sleep reminiscent of death
