This is my first time posting, but I have desperately tried to find this fic. It's a tom riddle/harry potter story but more complicated. Harry gets the memories of tom riddles love interest. The ending was that he had the memory of (Hadrian Peverall?) Finding out he's pregnant and he went to the doctor with a death eater because he wanted to surprise tom/voldemort but tom saw them and thought he was cheating. When Hadrian told tom he was pregnant he went crazy and killed Hadrian and the baby making two horcruxes with them. We then read of harry waking up not knowing what to do with the information he gaind with the memories of Hadrian. During this whole fic we see harry start to act like Hadrian (more Slytherin/dark). I really hope someone can find this fanfiction because I have been scouring every cite I can trying to locate it. I don't remember if it was completed but I'm almost 90 percent sure, of it's not it was very close to being completed.


** I remember reading this! But I can't remember where or when it was but the story summary sounds similar. Good luck! I would definitely read this again.
