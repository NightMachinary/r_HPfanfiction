I don't remember much but he was taught by Nicholas Flamel and I think there was some sort of time travel used and harry used alchemy to make a weighted vest to work out with. Any help is appreciated!


** Don't remember a vest, but he does work out, knows the Flamels, and is a time traveler in linkffn(I'm Still Here)

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

** There's one called linkffn(8670912) Gift of Memories, its a series, but so far the writer has only written 3 parts. He said he's waiting to finish his Naruto book before starting the 4th installment. He's trained by Nicholas, uses a time turner to double his day and if i'm not mistaken he actually has a vest that he created himself. But honestly, i could be wrong, its been a while since i've read that.

  Eidetic Memory, the ability to remember everything you have ever done, seen, smelled, tasted, and touched. To some it is a gift, to others a curse. For Harry Potter, it's both.
