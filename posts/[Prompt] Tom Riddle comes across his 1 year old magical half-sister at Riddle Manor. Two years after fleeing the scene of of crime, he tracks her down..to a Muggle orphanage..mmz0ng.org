What would he do with this little girl who shares his surname and could be mistaken for his daughter? 20 Year old single parent Riddle..


** Make a horcrux out of her murder. Tom Riddle hated his family and the fact that he rotted in an orphanage while his half-sister lived in a manor would infuriate him.

*** I believe that teenage Riddle had enough humanity in him to not murder an year old infant related to him, especially when she is visibly magical. Her then spending 2 years in an muggle orphanage should bring further resonance between them. Add some visible similarities in appearance and you could see him adopting her.

**** It's plausible enough that he might decide to keep her. I doubt it would be a happy relationship though. Riddle had no good parental examples, a budding psychopathy and followers, who enjoy torturing other people because of who their parents were, to ask for advice.

If it isn't a horribly abusive relationship, he fobs the kid off on some other poor follower and ruins the story concept of riddle trying (and failing in amusing ways with slightly horrifying implications) to raise a child. He wouldn't have the heart to raise the kid, but if he did the child would be much worse for it.

You have to change the majority of the evil faction's characters to make this anything other than a traumatic introduction to your actual story. That being said, riddle going off to explore new magics across the world with a baby strapped to his back /would/ be hilarious.

****** If we're talking crack fic, Voldemort trying to decide which of his followers would make the best babysitter would be entertaining. You'd have the obvious suck ups like Malfoy and then you get the ones like Amycus and Alecto Carrow, whose volunteering raises eyebrows. “What? We're great with kids!”

***** One of the best fics I read in a long while: Voldemort raises himself.

You can see how hard it is for him to "raise" a child. There's no much raising involved- shelter, food, money. But he gets more involved once new Tom is growing older.

**** Considering he murdered his own family and framed his uncle, /after/ murdering a random classmate (and trying to murder several others), I don't think he would balk at killing a kid, family or no.

** Maybe it would go like this: he's juuuuuust about to murder her. And then he remembers the existence of all of these dark rituals that involve babies and people related to you by blood. He decides not to murder her (yet), trying to figure out how he can use this to his advantage. When he finds her again, it's for the purpose of using her in one of these rituals, but something goes wrong this month and he'll have to wait until next month to try the ritual again. This continues a la Dread Pirate Roberts (Goodnight, sleep well, I'll most likely kill you in the morning).

** He would definitely use it to his advantage. Oh, can you keep an eye on my daughter while I (+commit murder)+ go get a haircut? That sort of thing.
