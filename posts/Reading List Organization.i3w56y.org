I've been in this reddit for about a month now and in that time I have seen loads of people talking about their Reading list. How do You make a reading list. When I go to read I just open new tabs and pick out like 5 stories that I'm feeling then I start reading the shortest one; but that not very productive because I always stop reading like half way through.

By the time I'm ready to start reading again I'm no longer interested in the stories I chose. What does your reading lists look like, I want to make one but I'm completely clueless.


** I bookmark them in folders on my browser, organised by length and just read whichever interests me that day. Sometimes they only interest me for a chapter or 2 before they end up in my "Maybe one day" folder (for stuff that I want to read, but not necessarily interesting for me at that point in time (usually trope binges that I go through)) or my "Maybe one day but actually good" folder (for stuff that I want to read eventually but am not in the right mood for (fics that maybe I want to start, but have not really decided on yet. Eg. HPMoR or Victoria Potter)). That said, I have over 200 bookmarks across all my folders right now, 121 of which are in my "maybe one day" folders. But in my defence, exams are coming up soon so I do not have much time right now.

** At some point in like 2010 I made a Dropbox and a master list of fics I was interested in and updated them with rating and reviews. Now I have a mix of open tabs on my phone and reddit posts bookmarked. I only bookmark fics on AO3 or FF.net when I've read them and enjoyed them, so at least that part of my fic reading is well-organized.

But I feel you!

*** Sorting through is such a task. I've been reading for 6 years. I've read a lot of books and I'm trying to read more but I'm lazy and keep losing really good ones because my organization is CRAP!

** This is starting to be a problem for me. I'm through 47 books so far, and it is tough to remember which story was which. Worser is the fact that I can't recall which weren't complete, so I'm not sure I'll ever think to go back and see if they were updated. There needs to be a cool fanfic app made for iOS that handles this. Someone get on that. Thanks!
