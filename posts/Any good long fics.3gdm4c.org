** A Year Like None Other by AspenInTheSunlight.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=5036]]

This is a pretty popular story, so you may already be familiar with it. It's quite long, and is part 1 of a trilogy. I am unsure if the final story is complete. It's been a very long time since I have read it. It's about a relationship between Harry and Snape that grows from teacher/student to more of a father/son. There aren't any romantic pairings involved IIRC.

I have a few Snape/Hermione long fics I can recommend, if you would be interested in those as well.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son-Book-I-of-the-Firebird-Trilogy][The Firebird Trilogy]] is probably just about the only really good Harry/harem fic out there. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind][What You Leave Behind]] is a fantastic Harry/Fleur fic. It takes it slow, though, so there isn't very much romance, yet. Uncomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9215879/1/The-Prince-That-Was-Promised][The Prince That Was Promised]] and it's updated version, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11098283/1/The-Black-Prince][The Black Prince]] is probably my favorite HP fic. It's Harry/OC and ASoIaF crossover set in Westeros. Uncomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of the Dark Kingdom]] is an AU fic with a focus on a Harry/Voldemort non-romantic relationship. No firm pairing, but several romantic interests. Uncomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] is a Harry/OC in which the Potters fled the magical world and he grows up among muggles. Uncomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]] is a fem!Harry/Snape fic. It's awesome and takes a realistic approach to the romance. Uncomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3384712/1/The-Lie-I-ve-Lived][The Lie I've Lived]] is a Harry/Fleur story. Complete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11111990/1/Grow-Young-With-Me][Grow Young With Me]] is a Harry/OC in which Ginny had died a few years post-epilogue. Uncomplete.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10610076/1/Time-to-Put-Your-Galleons-Where-Your-Mouth-Is][Time to Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth Is]] is a reincarntion, MoD!Harry. No pairing that I remember. Complete.

** Pretty much all I've read since starting on HP fanfics a couple months ago are the long ones. How long do you want them to be at least? 100k words or more?

** Generic title is generic. Please be more specific in your request; barring that, please look at previous threads, or at places like the DarkLordPotter Forums.

That said, I'd recommend the Denarian trilogy (first - linkffn(The Denarian Renegade), no knowledge of the Dresden Files needed) and the Wastelands of Time duology (first - linkffn(Wastelands of Time)).

** A Stranger in an Unholy Land by serpant-sorcerer

The plot is very intriguing and the fic features a competent Voldemort. There are no ships in the story. This story is complete but it has a sequel which is not complete.

** Lord Silvere - Delenda Est

That's really the only one I got. I thought this would be easy but to my surprise I've only got one long fic that isn't H/Hr. Funny, that.

I could probably find others which are decent that I've read but they wouldn't be as good since this is the only one on my favorites list.
