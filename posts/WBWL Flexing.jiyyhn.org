Harry grows up in the shadow of his twin, the one who did/allegedly thwarted Voldemort when they were babies.

Though his parents weren't exactly abusive, they had a lot more time and attention to spare on them (as did practically everyone else), leaving Harry feeling left out of everything and wary of strangers trying to get to them through befriending him.

All of that culminating in a quieter Harry with a bit of a chip on his shoulder.

A Harry who eventually found the trashy, fairytale-esque books written about the adventures of his celebrity siblings.

A Harry who looked at those ridiculous tales (duelling dragons, taming manticores, rescuing Veela) that he knew they had never done and never could...

And made a list, planning on doing them himself...

▪︎▪︎▪︎

Would be best if he WASN'T some magical savant who could do everything super easy. Obviously the things he is trying to do are insane (and border on impossible) but ragged determination and spite are what gets him through, rather than incredible power and skill.

He goes off into the world with something to prove and starts out on his "heroic quest" for all the wrong reasons. On his adventures he will slowly learn to open up to others and grow beyond his petty anger and come to terms with his families mistreatment of him.

Additionally, have Harry learning magic on the road (rather than at Hogwarts) which opens up a lot for OC's and any kind of stuff you want.

Subplot where, after Harry runs away, his family and the press are initially thinking it's attention seeking but they slowly open up to how poorly they've been treating him and earnestly look to help and support him.


** Ooh! That sounds so interesting! Someone please tell me if there is one like that!!

*** I know there's one or two stories where Harry decides to do all of the stuff he did in the childrens books, but I don't think there is one quite like this

** I'm writing a fanfic just like that!

​

Harry has a brother named 'Ethan' who really is the boy who survived, Ethan grows up being spoiled by parents and friends, but slowly under the influence of his older brother, Ethan starts to change and become more humble, Harry sees that his parents don't love him and care like they do Ethan, so Harry decides to leave! He decides to go to the Tonks' house, (will have Nymphadora as an older sister, always helping Harry, Andromeda and Ted will raise Harry as his son)

​

So in the meantime, until Harry goes to Hogwarts he'll swing between two characters, Harry and Ethan, show Harry's life with the Tonks, how he's adapting to the new family, Harry also learns a lot about etiquette and wizarding history from Andromeda. (There is a four-year difference between Harry and Nymphadora.)

​

And will it also show the life of the Potters, how they will react when they realize they neglected Harry? Ethan is going to be in a personal dilemma, can he forgive his parents for doing this to his brother? Lily and James turn to Dumbledore for help (Dumbledore good), Dumbledore is irritated at first by the negligence, but after a conversation with Snape, he sees that there is something wrong with the Potters, Lily and James that he knew would never favor a son for another, then Dumbledore decides to investigate closely, and calling the Potters in his office Dumbledore realizes that they were under a compulsion spell, for them to purposely neglect Harry and favor Ethan, Dumbledore removes the compulsion spell.

​

Realizing what Lily and James did, they despair and return home heartbroken, and then Ethan explains to them that Harry, before leaving, spoke to him and explained that he simply would not be able to continue living in a place where he was not welcome, and that Harry had written a letter to them and Sirius, so Ethan explains that Harry asked him to give the letter to his parents and Sirius together, James and Lily call Sirius to their house, and then Ethan shows them the letter that Harry wrote .

​

The three adults start to cry for what made Harry go through, James is furious with himself and decides to go look for Harry, notify the newspapers, the press, everything he had at his disposal to find his son, and prove to him that he was loved, much loved by his parents and his godfather.

​

Andromeda seeing that they would not stop until they found Harry, she decided that she would move to a property of the Black family in the countryside of England, there she raised Harry and Nymphadora (Nymphadora is already in 3rd year at Hogwarts).

​

(And yes, Harry will be reunited with his parents at Hogwarts, if he'll forgive, we'll see! The Potters will never give up on Harry again and will do their utmost to get Harry to forgive them, Harry doesn't hate his parents, he's just confused and asks for time to think about everything that happened.)

​

*** Looking forward to this! I'm a huge sucker for WBWL, especially ones that take a deeper look into the Potter family dynamic instead of a very one directional “blah I was neglected now I will always hate you!”.

Two of my favorite fits handle it really great, Negligentia, which is more of a series of one-shots that I absolutely love! And the other is Harry Potter, Rise from Dust, where it is a bit more stereotypical super Harry with his harem, but there's a fun-to-read side story of Lily and James coming to realize that they missed out on Harry's life after she sees Harry get along well with the Greengrass family.

So I'm really looking forward to this!
