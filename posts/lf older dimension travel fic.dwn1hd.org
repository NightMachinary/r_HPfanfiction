i dont remember how old this fic but harry gets transported to another dimension/time line where his parents are alive but only sirius is on his side initially

i cant remeber a lot of details other than that most of it takes place at hogwarts as that where they are fighting the war from


** Could this be it?

linkffn(The World As We Knew It by Lady Alinor)

They fight the war from Hogwarts, Harry also has a little sister in this timeline.

  Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH.
