Just few that I've read and enjoyed are "Paid in Blood" "Dementor's Stigma" "The Mind Arts" "Unatoned" "The Lies that Bind" "Honour thy Blood" "Defiance" "Ragnarok" "Ressurgence" to name a few that I remember of the top of my head.

I'm looking for mostly romance with either a hint of realism or adult situations and issues (Not smut, i mean drama and serious stuff) not that bullshit of "10 Lordships + Dumbles + super powerful with no reason Harry + unecessary Bashing)

I think I've read most of Daphne fics with that sort of premise, but maybe I can be surprised, Also, if anyone knows a good romance with Astoria besides "Finding a place to call Home" "Motivations" and "Heterochromic(and the sequel/alternate version)" I'd be forever grateful, the setting doesn't really matter, as long it isn't stupid or with really shitty grammar.

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

*** Really liked Days to come, along with "Marry you" and "From southHampton to New York and Beyond" is my favourite post-war fic with Daph/Harry.

I really enjoyed Contractual Invalidation, especially because Daphne is quite unique in it, at least the perceived fanon-personality she has. I'm not a fan of OS, but since its from the same universe as Contract Invalidation, I'll give it a try, thank you very much for the suggestion.

**** Look into the rest of R-dude's work. He's really talented at developing and writing relationships. Even his How To Train Your Dragon/Frozen crossover is great as well as finished (also lol Daphne = Elsa = Ice queen).

  A series of one-shots, each a standalone but in line with and potentially set in the Contractual Invalidation universe, in no particular chronological order.

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.
