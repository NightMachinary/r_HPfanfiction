I read this fic a few months ago and i loved it but I forgot to save it and i can't remember the name of it. I do know the plot line though. and Im hoping someone can help me out.

Hermione feels like she doesn't belong so while under lockdown in the order headquarters with the other women, she casts a paternity spell. she finds out that she's the daughter of Tom Riddle and Lily Evans Potter. She also finds out that she was kidnapped by Arthur Weasley and another guy on Dumledore's orders. the women confront him on this and come out seriously injured. They escape to the Malfoy's and Voldemort with a few of the Weasley's and the rest of the women. From there they try to get Harry out of Dumbledores clutches. In addition to this stuff hermione is a very powerful telepath who along with Susan Bones, Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and Pansy Parkinson complete a pentagram of power. they return to hogwarts and use their powers to defeat the order from the inside.

dumbledore bashing was a warning

Im pretty sure it was completed

The relationships that I remember are

Hermione/ Draco

Ginny Weasley/ Blaise Zabini

Luna Lovegood/ Harry Potter

I hope that this helps find the story. I would really like to read it again.


** Oh my... I might read this just for the popcorn.
