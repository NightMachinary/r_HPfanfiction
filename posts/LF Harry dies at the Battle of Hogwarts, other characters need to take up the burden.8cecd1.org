Don't think I've ever read a fic like this, but it seems like a natural divergence point for an interesting story. More specifically, I mean Harry dying before he takes out Riddle.


** For that matter, Harry dies /at the same time as/ he takes out Riddle also sets up an interesting situation: both sides have lost their uberwizards (not that Harry was one, but enough people believed in him to affect morale), so it's up to the remaining DEs, Order, and DA to fight it out.

*** Well in canon, the good guys fought on despite believing Harry was dead.

As the first war already demonstrated, Death Eaters with Voldemort would fall apart instantly.

**** After the first war, there was Dumbledore but not Voldemort. The side with the uberwizard wins.

People present at the Battle of Hogwarts weren't the only ones that mattered. Sure, the Order would fight on either way, but with Harry dead, would the Ministry workers give up so easily? I see them being more inclined to let the two sides fight it out before deciding what to do.
