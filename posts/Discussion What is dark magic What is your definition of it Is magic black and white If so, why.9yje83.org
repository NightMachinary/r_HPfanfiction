Hello everyone,

I don't mind if you ignore my ramblings and just answer the questions in the title.

I would like to discuss the questions in the title, since I am sure a lot of people have found better and less frustrating definitions of dark magic for themselves than I have.

It often annoys me to see something like "He was into dark magic" or "She was becoming a dark witch" in a fic with absolutely no further thought about what that even means. For me, it is all about intent and consent, but if that would be true there would be no dark magic and it apparantly is a huge part of the HP world.

The most obvious dark curses in canon are the Unforgiveables, but I really wonder why.

The one I think we can all agree on to be always intended to harm and could therefore be seen as dark is the Cruciatus. Okay, fine.

But what about the others? Avada Kedavra - a completely painless sudden death. As someone working in healthcare, there are about one thousand scenarios I can think of in which this is much more a blessing than a curse.

And then the Imperius. I would pay someone a pretty nice sum to put me under the Imperius for two hours a day to exercise and to the chores, as would a shitload of other people. If the caster means well, there is about nothing that would make life easier. The Imperius curse could also be interesting for therapy and a whole lot of other things.

Okay, so those are our three typical dark curses, let's have a look at some not-dark spells, that I think are more than just a little problematic:

The body bind, petrificus totalus - when exactly could that one be well intended? It surely is perfect for all kinds of (sexual) harassment and sooo much more.

Stupefy - same as the body bind.

The jelly legs jinx - Is there any use for this except bullying and making fun of others? This could be deadly in the wrong situation.

The one that takes the cake: Obliviate. I mean.. this is obvious, what an absolutely horrible spell this is, especially in the wrong hands, but honestly, stealing memories is always a horrible thing to do. I do not want to get too deep into this, since I think most people would agree anyway.

I am curious to hear your own personal opinions about dark magic and what makes it oh so dark.

Does dark magic corrupt the one who uses it? Why and how and why doesn't "light" magic do that?

Thank you for your thoughts!


** At least the canon considers the intention to be far more important than the mean. For example, it's ok to euthanize someone with Avada Kedavra, but confunding a House-Elf to poison his master is cold-blooded murder.

Similarly, the first year entry-level spell Wingadium Leviosa can be used to levitate a big troll club and bash someone's head in.

Lethal means are always going to be used in wars. Letting some sadistic genocidal maniacs win is not really an option.

Now, things will become more complicated in following situations:

- An inner circle Death Eater has been spotted in a particular location with his family. Harry has to decide whether to take him out by blowing up the whole area, thus killing potential innocents; or risking the lives of his own people by ordering a direct assault. How should Harry choose?
- An alternative way to kill Voldemort exists, but requires sacrificing innocent children in a horrible ritual. It's guaranteed to work. Because Voldemort created Horcruxes and greatly weakened his soul, it's possible to reduce the cost of this ritual as not to involve any human sacrifices. However, the modified ritual is not guaranteed to work. Which option should Harry and his friends choose?
- A decade after the War, it was found that in addition to the Longbottoms, up to several hundreds of potential Cruciatus victims might lay around in Muggle hospitals. A potential cure is in development at DoM, but requires testing on live humans. Several Unspeakables propose to use Death Eaters convicted of murders and torture as test subjects. Some vindictive DA members also support this proposal, saying it's just fair turnaround, but they want the Trio and Neville to have the final word. How should they decide?
- After a major engagement, the DA and Order lost several people due to other's side use of the Killing Curse. Some members suggest to retaliate in kind, since Avada Kedavra bypasses the shield charm and offers significant tactical advantages. On the other hand, Avada Kedavra is still very much a taboo among the populace and its use means losing certain popular support. The leadership also worries that liberal use of this curse has adverse psychological consequences. How should they decide?

***** We have no idea how the killing curse works. I've always had the assumption you had to hate and channel that rage and hate to power the curse. You had to want to murder the person... This is why fake!Moody says he doubted anyone could power one in fourth year.

That makes the argument that it can be used for people who want to die problematic because you are relying on dark feelings.

And Dumbledore was saying was that murder is what hurts the soul, not just the killing curse and because Dumbledore is asking, it's not murder.

Snape, being a pretty dark person with few morals probably could easily bring those emotions to the surface and use all his dislikes of Dumbledore over the years to power the curse.

Long story short... Dumbledore and Snape are very much the extreme exception... Not the norm.

With the Imperius you need to want to control, to dominate, to have absolute power over your intended victim. With the Cruciatus you need to want to make them suffer, to feel absolute agony. And with the Killing Curse, you need to want them dead, to rob them of any future happiness in their life.

You could probably replicate the level of control the Imperius gives with judicious use of Confundus Charms, Compulsion Charms, and the like; and a well aimed Severing Charm to the neck will leave someone just as dead as someone hit by the Killing Curse.

** I think the best way to look at "dark magic" is as an item of language which is used in a number of different ways (as language often is). It is a mistake to ask "What is Dark Magic?" because there is no single answer. Context is what distinguishes between the different meanings, only one of which relates to a "natural kind".

"Dark magic" can mean:

- Magic which is inherently dangerous (in which practice of dark magic might be compared with the ownership of firearms).

- Magic which can only be used for evil ends, or is apt to immoral use.

- Magic which is gruesome.

- Magic which is cast by a Dark wizard.

- Magic which has a special magical property which makes it impossible to reverse without knowledge of the specific counter (the "natural kind" meaning).

There is overlap between the categories but they are not coextensive.

*** Your first point is valid, but I think it would be apt to split it into two categories:

First, there is magic that is deleterious to the target. That is, magic that is always dangerous to be hit by (i.e. your gun example). You might be able to use this for moral good, like a gun in self defense or for hunting food, but these are spells that you cannot fire without /something/ breaking.

And second, magic that is deleterious to the /caster./ We know that magic can turn against it's user; obscurials are a prime example of this (or, if you count /Wonderbook: Book of Spells/ as canon, the Patronus if cast by someone impure of heart). While that is an extreme example, it is /possible/ that there are spells that extract a (possibly metaphysical or metaphorical) toll from the user to cast. How much is fanon-vs-canon is up for debate, but the affect of Horcruxes on Voldemort's mind may be one such example; the whole "splitting the soul" thing is definitely another.

To continue on the Horcrux example, if you removed the necessary murder, soul mutilation, and (possible) sanity drain, what do you have? The ultimate preventative medicine! Why die when you can just tell Death /no?/ But instead, you have a drain on morality (murder), spirituality (soul mutilation) and sanity that makes the spell almost entirely too costly for all but the most insane and despirate of dark wizards.

** I agree with you - most spells that we see can be used to harm people. In fact, most jinxes are meant to cause harm to the person they are being cast at. However, I think Dark Magic refers to powerful magic with grave malicious intent.

Looking at the curses we know:

- Cruciatus Curse: As mentioned by OP, there is no good that can come out of it. The caster intends to torture the victim by this curse
- Imperious Curse: I don't see how being controlled by someone else can be good, regardless of the purpose. It is similar to the argument that can be made for Obliviate.
- Killing Curse: This is an unbeatable weapon - while putting people out of their medical misery might be a postive use, it would be a very small percentage of usage should this curse be allowed openly. I would argue that it would be better to use controlled poisons for that purpose instead. Additionally, just like crucio, I don't believe the killing curse would work for everyone because of the state of mind it would require for someone to /want/ to kill another human being willingly.
- Sectumsempra: Again, a torture/killing method where no positive intent can be assumed.
- Creation of Horcruxes: Requires killing multiple people to split one's soul into two

Dark Magic provides means of hurting others, usually irreparably. Hence the witch or wizard casting it must have the intent /and/ will to cast it properly. Imagine the state of mind of a person who is willing to cause such harm without the premise of a war.\\
In my head, I think of the jinxes and spells like stupefy as common criminals like robbery/aggravated assault while Dark Magic is comparable to a serial killer or violating Geneva Conventions.

*** Actually, concerning the Cruciatus Curse. There is IMHO quite valid point in chapter 20 of linkffn(4236594). Cruciatus might originated as a medical spell. If you know something about the research of human pain, then there are situations that for some radical piece of surgery doctors so overwhelm patient's body with pain, it is insensitive to the specific pain caused by the surgery (patient being under anaesthesia or something).

The same goes for Imperius (and Obliviate). It could be theoretically valid method of mental healing for extreme situations, e.g. I have in my fanfiction small girl who has developed Obscurial. Memories of torture are so traumatic, she needs to have them medically removed (by something like Obliviate) so that she may develop enough personality to be able to deal with them afterwards, and to prevent possible suicide attempts. Kind of equivalent of extreme psychopharmaca used by the muggle psychiatrists in such situations.

And of course, Sectumsempra could probably be used for medical amputations.

** My favorite definition was in linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) where Dark Magic is just magic kept secret within a family. Any magic where the counter is either unknown or secret would fall in this category. /Petrificus Totalus/ and /Stupify/ are all basic spells now, but imagine how terrifying and evil they must have seemed when no one knew how to reverse them.

Of course, I would consider /Obliviate/ to be dark magic under this definition because the only known counter is extensive torture (Bertha Jorkins) or possibly many years of therapy (Gilderoy Lockhart).

** NOTE: Typing out "Wizards and Witches" every time is anoyying, so rather than being exclusive by using just one I'm going to use Magi

In my mind we really don't know enough about the HP magic system to make educated judgments. You hypothesize that AK is an instantaneous, completely painless death. It's possible, however it's equally possible that it rips the soul asunder and compresses all the agony a being is capable of feeling into one indescribable instant of pain. (My head cannon for the Unforgivables has always been that they directly manipulate the victims soul in some way)

As for the body bind curse...I'm amazed you can't think of any medical or law enforcement uses for this. Patient is injured and needs to be immobilized for transport? Body bind. Law enforcement officers need a less than lethal spell to subdue perps? Body Bind. Hell, for all the kinky Magi out there I'm sure it has a completely consensual role in the bedroom. As you said, it has it's more nefarious uses, but any tool can be misused

Similar things can be said for jelly legs and stupefy. Both are good less than lethal options to subdue someone for whatever reason. Hell even Obliviate has ethical uses (IMHO). It certainly wouldn't be for everyone, but if someone with PTSD wanted specific memories removed, as long as everything was well explained and consensual I think it would be completely ethical.

Now, for the dark vs light magic in general, I believe that this is mainly fanon. Certain spells like the Unforgivables, Fiend Fire, and those...zombie things...that Voldy made and certainly Horcruxes are mentioned as being "dark" but IIRC "Light" magic is never mentioned in the 7 main books. To me this implies that rather than being soul corrupting or innately evil or some such "dark" is merely a descriptor, much like We'd use "Barbaric".

Now if you're asking what I think would make something Dark Magik with a capital D. That would be the stuff that corrupts your soul. Where you sell a little bit of yourself for power and it gets replaced be something /other/. The types of things that consumes souls to fuel themselves and unwilling ones are actually better. All that jazz.

** Common fanon interpretation often describe opposing forces of 'dark' and 'light' magic, one based in negative intentions or emotions and one based in positive. I have a few problems with that. For one, 'light' magic simply does not exist in canon beyond /lumos/, no matter how well the Patronus charm seems to fit into fanon interpretations. Secondly, these distinctions between positive and negative emotions always seem rather hazy for the clear dichotomy fanon describes. Love may be a 'light' emotion, but what about lust? If lust is 'dark,' where is the boundary between them? What about justice and vengeance, another common 'light' and 'dark' pair?

Instead, I like to think of the term 'dark magic' as being used in two ways. It has a technical definition, used by scholars and traditionalists, referring to magic which is not fully understood or controlled, rooted in the same linguistic development that led to the term "the Dark Ages" (Latin /obscurus/). This includes old-style ritual magic like that used by Voldemort in his resurrection as well as the far more common emotion-based magic, such as the Cruciatus and Patronus spells. Secondly, however, it simply refers to 'bad' magic, much in the way that "Dark Wizards" is often taken to simply mean criminals in canon.

The best analog of this sort of terminology I can think of is the term 'drugs.' In common parlance, we all have a general sort of knowledge of what the term refers to, although some borderline cases exist in things like marijuana and alcohol. In many contexts, we would not interpret the term to mean medicine like ibuprofen, no matter that they fit the technical definition. Similarly, outside of a scholarly context, very few people will ever refer to the Patronus as dark magic.

edit: oh, I just realized Sacrifices is wildly popular and well-known too. Sorry, I'm new to the community, before starting to get back into reddit a bit I just hunted down fanfics myself to very, very mixed results. hopefully I'll think of something more unique worth reading but for now I'm drawing a blank.

It makes total sense that from her point of view the most powerful and effective spells require total devotion to evil and hate. This kind of mindset is part of her total devotion to her way of life. I bet when she practices any kind of combat spell she would try to enhance it by using as much malice as possible.

** In my opinion Dark Magic is magic that needs strong emotions to cast. The Cruciatus requires you to feel joy at causing pain, you need to /love/ it, not just desire it, that's why when Harry cast it on Bellatrix after she killed Sirius it only caused her mild discomfort because he was fueled by a desire for revenge, that's why Voldemort said "You've got to mean it Harry."

Similarly the Avada Kedavra needs you to feel an intense, burning hatred for the target, and a strong desire to see them die, it's a powerful spell because it drains you emotionally, you can't just cast them like a machine gun which is where certain fics get it wrong, it's meant to be a spell that takes a lot out of you, which is why Voldemort was so terrifying because he could cast it almost effortlessly.

Contrary to popular belief, spells like the entrail expelling curse, or similar "horrific and brutal spells" aren't Dark in nature because they were created to be used by butchers in the preparation of animals for slaughter. Just because Dark Wizards use them on humans doesn't make the spells Dark, blame the shooter not the gun sort of mentality.

** A common fanon explanation, and my personal headcanon, is that Dark magic depends on malicious intent and Light magic on benevolent intent. Thus, Crucio or Sectumsempra is Dark magic (hate), Expecto Patronum or Vulnera Sanentur is Light magic (love), Episkey or Levicorpus is neither (requires no particular intent beyond the normal "make this spell work" focus) despite being healing/incapacitation spells. This also explains Avada Kedavra being an Unforgiveable -- while in theory you can use it to mercy kill, it requires invoking hate to facilitate. Mercy killings could be done with less problematic spells by a combination of putting someone to sleep (I forgot the exact spell) and then kill using some other spell. Obliviate might not actually require any intent in either direction, which would explain why it's not considered Dark Magic.

Obliviate is arguably HP's most "broken" spell -- its potential for abuse is ridiculous, and even worse than the Imperius or AK -- it boosts your abilities to socially engineer people's behaviour towards your benefit to the extreme; carefully placing Obliviates on people whenever something goes wrong makes it far easier to manipulate them into following you, loving you or whatever you want them to do: Hermione used it to /remove herself from existence/ from her parents. Also, Obliviate is restricted by the Ministry to the Obliviation Squad as far as I understand it -- so while it isn't Dark Magic, it /is/ covered by the law.

The way I figure, it's not that hate is required, but that it's the easiest method. The Avada Kedavra requires an unrestricted intent to kill. When you cast this spell, you want your target to cease its existence in the most permanent manner possible, and there can be no doubt in your feeling. This is possible to do without emotion, but it's easiest to do with pure hatred.

** This is mostly my GM'ing experience talking.

Dark magic is mostly a handy term for magic-aware cultures to label illegal spells restrict the use or knowledge of certain magics. most commonly reanimating the dead, dominating minds and consorting with evil outsiders. Two ethical, one practical.

The label is used sensibly in HP in regards to spells and artefacts, most of the time. If a spell exclusively or mostly has uses that facilitate breaking the law, it's dark magic. A cutting curse is arguably a flexible tool, but no one will believe you were using the entrail-expelling curse to make sausages. /Avada Kedavra/ is illegal by necessity due to the extremely limited population, despite its' potential use for defence against magical creatures. /Imperio/ is too useful for corrupting officials to be legal, whilst /Obliviate/ is crucial to maintaining the masquerade.

Now, does dark magic corrupt? Absolutely!

Most of the time, these magics are used for things that will traumatize the average person. Murder, torture, brainwashing and brutal violence are horribly illegal things that human beings are completely capable of doing /without/ magic. A practitioner can absolutely become inured to acts of dark magic, just like a government spook can get used to torturing prisoners.

I would argue that the wizarding worlds' views on the /Obliviate/ spell is symptomatic of a wider problem. The wizarding world has zero respect for the human minds' sanctity. There are mind affecting spells everywhere. Glamour spells are common fare. Suggestions are /everywhere/ and love potions are just a naughty thing teenagers do. None of these are considered even close to dark magic, and thus it's ethically okay.

** In Harry Potter, there is some moral ambiguity to it and anything the government doesn't want the populace to know about / be taught. At least in most canon compliant fics.

I think of "Dark Magic" as having a component that requires unwilling sacrifice or intent to harm / control. I'd say without further research that most spells are probably neither light nor dark on their own, but intent matters. Painless death or slaughtering animals, controlling animals (herding, etc) or prisoners or mental patients, unless the ONLY purpose of the Cruciatus is to cause pain.... if it causes pain by lighting up nerve endings there could be theraputic uses in short spurts. I've seen it used in fics to restart a stopped heart by causing muscle cramps.

Without further information beyond "you have to mean it" then I will assume intent is what makes actions dark or light. The "dark arts" are more "unknown" or "hard to perform" or "require deep study to perform" than being "evil".

Dark Arts is like Dark Ages.

** I see it as being intent based. Really, I see all magic as being intent based.

The unforgiveables have a primary intent of killing, causing pain, or subverting will, and cannot be blocked with magic (short of conjuring a physical object to shield). It's canon that at least the cruciatus requires malicious intent to cast, but the other two /can/ have non-malicious uses, so that's where intent falls in.They wouldn't be inherently dark, but they're probably /easier/ to cast with malice than benevolence. (I don't recall off hand whether the killing curse required actual hate to fuel it)

But a different interpretation that I see happen is that the spell, ritual, or potion itself leaves like a magical residue. Much like how murder via killing curse can split the soul, actual 'dark magic' can leave an imprint, something that lingers in the psyche or on the soul. I've seen this done in a fic where it was almost like a drug - you feel power or control, or an urge to use the 'dark' method instead of other means because of the feeling it gives, and the more you use it, the more you *want* to use it. Or it makes whatever spells are classed as 'light' (like the Patronus, maybe even certain healing spells) more difficult to cast over time.

A hybrid of the two is that magic cast with 'evil' intent makes that magic dark. A healing spell used to harm someone (like removing someone's entire skull via a spell meant for removing a shattered bone) could count.

** There is nothing in canon to suggest killing curse is painless. On the contrary, the description of the victims leads me to believe a lot of pain is involved. The victims faces are described as frozen in horror and pain so... No, killing curse has no up side.

The way I see it, magic is a part of a magical. When a wizard casts a spell, he is affected as well, not just the target. So, by that theory dark magic has detrimental efrects on the user.

Then there is the psychological aftereffects. Let's say Harry used the killing curse on Bella after she killed Sirius, and succeeded. That night, he learns the Prophecy and when he gets a chance to go over the days events, he begins to realise just how much pain he and those on his side could have avoided if he had just used the killing curse from the beginning. And now, with the impossible task of killing Voldemort hanging over his head, the same curse that gave him a scar looks like his only option. The next time he's in a fight is with Malfoy jr. Malfoy casts the torture curse. Harry, now rationalizing the usage of such a magic, casts the killing curse. Then does it again against Snape when the man kills Harry's mentor.

It's a slippery slope, the ability to cause such a devastation with only a few words and I doubt most could stop themselves.

So, no dark magic.

While there could be some potential good uses for AK, what it does to your state of mind and how you have to behave corrupts you. In canon, people who use the unforgivables are seen as crazed and evil. Using them exacerbates your descent into darkness.

** So first of all there are two ideas tangled up together. So called Dark Witches and the like is mostly propaganda or an insult implying that the individual is evil, debased, or regularly uses dark magic. The other is the question of what is actually dark magic.

Dark Magic is magic that invariably causes harm, not like a how a fire spell can burn, but for example a dismembering spell that thwarts attempts to reattach or heal what has been severed. This harm is not necessarily to the target, but also the user. The unforgivables almost certainly damage the souls of the caster when used to Murder (not simply 'kill'), Torture (beyond mere 'pain'), and enslave or subjugate (rather than merely control).

Magic in seems to be inherently whimsical in HP and using it to cause harm might very well be some sort of sin.

Light magic is rarer and is wholly benevolent. A patronis would never herd dementors towards a victim and the spell would simply fail if the caster attempted to do so.

Most magic is neutral used to create effects rather than pursuing an outcome, again fire might burn but it isn't meant to burn someone which ties into why magical are so resistant to harm.

As understood by magical theorists and practitioners of the dark arts, dark magic is any magic that requires a specific emotion from the caster (/brewer/ritualist/etc.). This includes the Cruciatus curse, the Patronus charm, possibly the Fidelius, and others.

Dark magic is corrupting because in order to use it reliably, you either have to walk around stewing in $emotion all the time, or you have to condition yourself to feel whatever emotion you need on command.
