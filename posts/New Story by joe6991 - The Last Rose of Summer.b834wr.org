I just finished reading it. It's a 14.5k-word one-shot about old-man Harry as he tries to solve a couple of problems. No one writes deep, old magic like joe6991 in my humble opinion. I thought it was well worth reading. Give it a shot if you're looking for something to do.

** Worth noting that this was his entry for the most recent DLP writing contest, and it won. It's a very Joe feeling story.
