:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hey, I'm looking for a specific fic where two different SI's end up in the same HP 'verse without the other realising it at the start. 99% sure it's on FFN. There's a chance it's been deleted due to the fact I can't find it. Below is what I can remember from it.

Story is completely/mainly from 1st or 3rd person (not sure which but definitely not 2nd).

It was/is ongoing and not too huge, only 70% sure it's under 10 chapters though.

First/Main SI (which the story's POV is from) is a OC/background character (only 70% sure it's a girl and that she's in Ravenclaw). She's stayed in the background mainly and acted like Fanon!Luna a bit (so she's seen as a bit wierd but kind of harmless {and as a seer?}).

Second SI is in Harry's place/body and acts pompous and all-knowing (acts like a young teen who's read too much fanfiction and essentially believes himself better because he knows all the fanon cliches/loop holes stories have made {like right from their first year he believes himself to be awsome because he essentially knows wand movements/words/spells don't matter and he can will/visualise whatever he wants} but it doesn't work out because it is fanon).

Starts from the start on a new school year, the Main SI's 3rd to 5th year (? I believe it's her 3rd, 4th, or 5th but only about 90%) and Harry's 1st.

Right from the moment she see's 'Harry' in the first ch. at the Sorting Feast, Main knows it's not him and believes (correctly) that it's another SI like herself. She says/muses to herself (or others near her) that 'That's not Harry Potter' or 'Harry Potter's been replaced by a slider' (one of the two and she repeats it/them multiple times throughout the story) though no one believes she's speaking the truth.

Last part I remember (maybe latest ch. it had?) Main is helping Snape as a kind-of assistant and repeats her 'not HP/slider' comment and Snape might start to believe her/realises she's telling the truth and it's not actually HP.


** Didn't you already post this the other day? I mean, still interested in seeing if anyone finds the story as well, because I've never heard of it and it sounds interesting, but you really shouldn't double post so close to the original post date imo.

*** Yeah I did but I wanted to change the title a bit to something a bit more specific. Also I thought I messed up using the flair (it was set to 'Request') and thought you had to set it when you first posted (I'm using a tablet and didn't see the 'set flair' option until I specifically changed to 'desktop site' when I couldn't find it after I deleted the old post).

**** All good, at first I thought I was having some crazy Deja Vu moment, so it was also for clarification that I'm only mostly crazy.
