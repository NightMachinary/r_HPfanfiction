Question is in the title. I have yet to see a fic that actually explains how Bludgers move in a game of Quidditch. Do they bounce off the boundary of the field like billiard balls? Do they specifically arc after passing a player to head back to the beater? Just random motion?

What are your thoughts on how Bludgers ACTUALLY work?


** I imagine idle Bludgers make wanton arcs around the field, speeding along until it decides to change direction, with some enchantments to make it somewhat homing toward players. Enough to keep it interesting and keep it away from the audience, especially when it's struck by a bat.

I once wrote a story that shows Quidditch equipment being sentient (because the game can't get that much sillier), so there's also that.

** I think that Bludgers are commanded by enchantments to travel in random arcs, no matter what is in their path. The stands would have "bludger repelling" charms on them, to keep them in the field. This would explain why there are two bludgers in a game. The Snitch most likely has a similar enchantment except instead of random movement, it is enchanted to constantly evade capture. I also bet that the Hoops in Quidditch also are enchanted. Probably with a barrier charm to prevent bludger damage. Just my personal thoughts on the matter.

** Enchanted items are never really explained, so there's really no way to speculate on how they actually work /according to canon/, but it does seem that wizards can impart a sort of limited sentience to objects; mirrors that can comment on your appearance, portraits with the personality and some of the memories of their subject, flying cars that can go feral and rescue children from Acromantulas, etc. It's only full, human-level intelligence that arouses suspicion (like Riddle's diary) and seems to require Dark magic - but even /that/ is possible.

I see no reason why a ball couldn't be enchanted to have an understanding of Quidditch and a basic mission - the Snitch flies around avoiding capture, much like the flying keys from the first book, while the Bludgers try to disrupt play by striking players with non-lethal blows. The enchanted chess set shows that enchanted items can have operational understanding of complex games, probably the witch or wizard's own understanding 'embedded' in the object by the enchantment.

As far as a fun, imaginative explanation: Bludgers are made of a Whomping Willow wood outer shell, a magically active wood of an aggressive nature, around a lead core (for weight) wrapped in a dragon-wing sinew netting (a core material that contains the essence of flight). They are crafted using a proprietary process, a Fidelius-protected trade secret of the International Quidditch Association since 1123 AD, combining elements of Broom and Wand-crafting to impart flight and basic magical sentience to the Bludgers, and then are enchanted to be aware of the rules of Quidditch and their role in the game.
