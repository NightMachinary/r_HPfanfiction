I wish that other types of magic would be explored more. Wand magic is only one type of magic other races and cultured have their own unique crafts.


** "Warding" in the canon style. I'd like to see a whole host of protective charms, plants, dark creatures, and objects being used to protect something by Harry and his friends for once. There are a lot of fics where Harry wards something with runes and a charm, and they're nice explorations of the direct shield charms in canon.

I'd like to see more of the type like Voldemort used in the cave, however. A wall that requires a sacrifice, a lake enchanted so you can only cross on a singular boat, and something that harms you so you can get the objective.

**** That's a really good point!

in that stealing witches fic they had some good warding world building where the magical protections were somehow fuelled by having magical plants growing on the property, which I found super intriguing, but what you're saying about those protections is so true. We've just sort of veered off with fanon warding when in canon there is some stuff we've been ignoring as far as protective Magics

*** Agreed. Especially as even in canon, Hogwarts was definitely NOT the 'best school in the world'. Three core classes (DADA, History, Potions) with shit teachers and two electives (Divination, Muggle Studies).

**** Going by the classes harry was taking from first to fifth year at least, you're forgetting transfiguration, Astronomy, charms, and Herbology. That's 7 core courses. For third years and up the electives are Arithmancy, Divination, care of magical creatures, Muggle Studies, and study of ancient runes. And for 6th/7th years we have alchemy and Advanced Arithmancy. That's 7 mainline electives which don't include work shops like the Apparition course.

**** We see the teachers through Harry's eyes. Snape seems to have known his shit but was being so nasty that students couldn't focus due to stress (according to Harry in OotP at least). Binns also appears to know his stuff but if most people don't listen to him then it's their fault too. DADA was cursed but it had at least some competent professors during Harry's time (Lupin, Crouch, Snape). Trelawney was partially a fraud but she seemed decent. We don't know anything about Muggle Studies (at least prior to Voldemort taking over) since Harry never takes it.

***** One can be a great person at doing their job and be a shit teacher. Don't excuse/whitewash Snape. Binns doesn't 'know his stuff', he just reads the book. That's not teaching. DADA had a 50% loss rate at best and no continuity between classes. Divination was an 'easy course', and all Trelawney did was predict peoples' deaths. Hermione said outright - and she took it - that Muggle Studies was fifty years out of date.

Don't make excuses. The courses were shit.

****** I am not a school inspector so I wouldn't know. Nor do we see the teachers' teaching style other than small glimpses through Harry's perspective which is really subjective. Also I am not whitewashing Snape because saying that there was a possibility of him being a decent teacher when not terrorizing students does not mean i think he was a nice person. I think that even in his hate for Snape, Harry admits he is good enough that he doesn't restart the DA and no one bothers to check the fake galleon except for Neville and Luna who mostly held on to it because they had no friends. And it's unreliable to take the perspective of someone who had to cheat his way through potions under a different professor who was very biased in Harry's favor. Also if Trelawney's class was so easy, how come Harry failed it? It's another class through which Harry cheated his way by relying on the professor's predisposition of predicting death (which was a surefire prediction since everyone dies).

Some settings have a different power level than others.

But I recall one fic had Harry learning magic with a different focus than a wand, used in another country, and it was just better in every way. Harder to steal as it was a ring or bracelet or such, worked just as well and provided as much precision, and let you modify spells better.

Funny thing is one anime crossover I know did it well. Eastern magic was different, not better. They had more elemental charms but not as much direct hexes, and had some benefits and penalties.

Now, /other/ magic in that setting was more powerful, but I'm willing to give a pass to various angels, devils, and such having more powerful magic than humans when mythically, humans summon those for 'powerful magic'. :)

** I'd like to see some post-grad magic research institutions for people to keep studying deeper and more advanced magic after graduating Hogwarts. 17 is very young and there are still so much more to explore. In those institutions they could focus on one area of studying.

I wrote a fic of a very mysterious Astrologer/Divination Tower somewhere in the deep mists in the mountains. Dumbledore was friends with the headmaster over there and they don't see eye to eye with each other. Although they have different agendas, eventually they have to work together to take care of Voldy.

Sadly I abandoned it becuse I had too many original characters/families/backgrounds. People are generally more interested in reading pairing centred fics. And I didn't have that much time to invest in such a long and complicated fic at that time.

** I just want to see more short or medium length mystery and horror stories. Too many people focus on epic-length, ultimately unfinished canon rewrites, power fantasies and romance for my taste.

I wanna see stuff like Riddle going to Innsmouth to learn their type of magicks, or Auror!Harry and Ron try to unravel some really fucked up time-related crime.

*** You might enjoy linkffn(Renegade Cause)

Ghosts of old legends and the dark side of Hogwarts coming out in a time-locked Hogwarts. It's a rather gritty fic with a decent focus on horror in the middle part of the fic. Basically, all the more malevolent spirits of Hogwarts are locked away far beneath the school, and a ritual, on Voldemort's orders, releases the spirits from their prison, causing them to wreak havoc on Hogwarts, without a way for the students to escape

**** The magic dance compells the challenged person to dance untill the challenger says the dispute is finished and it is time to judge.

So Harry makes Voldemort dance for hours untill they pass out exausted and someone in the crowd kill the unconscious Voldemort.

Dumbledore teached Harry about it after the headmaster witnessed the devastating effect Harry's dance had on the poor Patil's feet, at the Yule Ball, after only one song, and without even a conscious effort from the boy.

The power the dark lord knows not is the power of russian kozatchok. Very ancient magic.

I would also love to see stories that have absolutely nothing to do with Hogwarts, any of the canon characters, or the main plot.

**** I like that Ron's jealousy is a consistent flaw he has to overcome (with varying degrees of sucess). His timing is awful, but having worked with teenagers for several years I can confirm the psychological realism of making it all about him because he's feeling hurt - even though his mate's in serious danger. (Again).

I don't think that it's right that Draco "Magical Hitler Youth" Malfoy gets a pass in most fics when Ron very often doesn't.

Many of the Charlie/Hermione stories I've come across are smut, and while there's nothing wrong with smut (I enjoy such stories every now and then), I feel like authors cheat Charlie out what could, potentially, be a good story otherwise.

** I really enjoy stories where there is a certain focus on world building. JK did an amazing job creating the Harry Potter world, with all the creatures and magic that accompanies it. However, with so much potential outside of England I really like stories that place a certain amount of focus on developing the magical world beyond. Different magic styles from different countries. Magic who's incantations originate from different ancient languages, different forms of magic usage beyond what is charms, curses and transfiguration - or a fresh outlook on how these are applied. If anyone has stories like this, I would really appreciate to know about them!
