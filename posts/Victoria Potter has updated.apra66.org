And I'd just finished it yesterday. Great timing.

It's only just started second year, but it definitely has to be one of my favourite fics. The world-building is detailed but subtly woven in to the story. (A particular favourite of mine is the wizarding politics and law. A very under-explored area in fanfiction and the author clearly knows his stuff.) The dialogue and pacing are on point, reminiscent of Rowling herself. I can honestly think of no real criticism thus far.

*** Looks like he was tokin' on a spliff but they edited it out.

edit: though I suppose your reaction to this chapter could be lighting up a doober

** I'm curious how Lockhart will develop. I like the direction DADA is taking (different then how I have paced the class but in a way that makes a lot of sense).

** Reading this fic fills me with a joy that I can't quite describe, something similar to "Joie de vivre". Only disappointment with this chapter is that I will now have to wait an unkown time for the next chapter.

*** I don't think the wait time will be as long as it was between this chapter and the last. I recall Taure mentioning that he had some sort of hand injury that prevented him from writing.

Before that happened it updated pretty regularly so I believe it'll get back on that quicker schedule.
