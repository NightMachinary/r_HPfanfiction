Found this peice of information on the internet-

In Book 4, when Barty Crouch (posed as Mad-Eye Moody) used the controlling spell “Imperio” on Harry during Defense Against the Dark Arts class.

Another voice in the back of Harry's brain is against the idea, resisting the Imperio curse, which is almost impossible, for a fourth-year student. Everybody thought it was Harry's doing, but it was Voldemort's soul all along that did the resisting, not Harry.

Original link is [[https://qr.ae/pNwV9U][here]].


** I don't really buy it as in that same book Harry also resisted Voldemort's Imperius curse.

I mean, trying to Imperio someone who has a part of your own soul in them would seem like a fast track way of making that someone /really susceptible/ to your Imperius.
