Curiosity is the stem of this question.


** If we were to take after the fact that Sirius turned into a dog because Sirius is also called the Dog Star, then I would presume that Bellatrix would turn into a piranha since Bellatrix is also called the Amazon Star.

**** Harley Quinn is a Batman character, formerly the Joker's girlfriend/sidekick, now generally an independent anti-hero.

And Harley is honestly a better person than (canon) Bellatrix. Even when she was the Joker's girlfriend.

******** Right, I forgot the part where wealthy aristocrat Harley Quinn joined the KKK and then died fighting at Joker's side.

Their motives, values, backstories, and the ultimate trajectory of their character arcs are radically different. But you just ignore all that, because "crazy women" are all just interchangeable.

Let's break this down. Bellatrix is from wealth and privilege. She believes in pure blood supremacy and was likely raised to "do her duty" and enter into a respectable pure-blood marriage. She was drawn to Voldemort likely because he was the standard bearer for pure-blood supremacist ideology, and because his power and cruelty appealed to her sadism. And she remains blindly loyal to him to the end.

Harley... this being the sprawling mess of continuities that is DC, it varies somewhat from version to version, but generally she's not from wealth or privilege, and doesn't give a damn about ideas of racial supremacy. She is drawn to Joker because he represents a kind of freedom, and she mistakenly believes that he loves her. In most versions, she eventually moves past that attachment, striking out on her own-and while often violent, is at least sometimes capable of acting heroically.

So yeah, treating them as interchangeable because they're both "crazy women" is fucking sexist, and if my saying so makes you uncomfortable, I'll be over here playing the world's smallest violin.

Now go ahead and downvoting me for making insecure boys feel threatened by pointing out facts.

************ You're conflating two separate questions here- who is worse, and whether they're the same. My point about Harley's motives is that she and Bellatrix are not interchangeable characters.

Also, you're bogging the conversation down by twisting my words and forcing me to defend irrelevant tangents, and I know from experience that the only way to win that game is not to play. Bye now.

** Probably something that kills for fun. For some reason I'm getting ocean vibes maybe because there is a lot of large predators in the ocean and a lot of them do like to kill for the thrill of it. Animals that surplus kill include wolves, jaguars, orcas, red foxes, leopards, lions, spotted hyenas, spiders, brown bears, American black bears, polar bears, coyotes, lynx, mink, raccoons, dogs, and humans ([[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surplus_killing]]). A spider would be super interesting especially the spying aspect doubly so if she's a magical one that's way more venomous than normal spiders. Hyena too, would fit her, probably no bear... very interesting question all the same! I think a spider fan fiction of Bella would be so interesting.
