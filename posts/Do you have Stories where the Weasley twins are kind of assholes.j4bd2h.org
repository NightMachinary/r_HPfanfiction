As an example, Ron is sorted into Slytherin (or any other house than Gryffindor) and they start pranking mainly him and who he becomes friends with? Or making 'jokes' about how he is going to the dark side and another of the slimy snakes.

An ff that shows that what they think are funny pranks is actually pretty hurtful and humiliating to others. That they are rather bullying the other students (especially Slytherin) and that it is not funny in the slightest bit anyone than them.


** It's a bit of a side plot in Prince of Slytherin, IIRC.
