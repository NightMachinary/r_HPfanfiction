I've read a lot of fanfics, and while plenty of times authors go the route of creating a good deal of OC, they usually stick to the main plot of killing Voldemort and then that's the end.

I've only come across two stories that have an actual villain that is not Voldemort, Bellatrix, or another death eater. Jbern's Bungle in the Jungle is one. The other was a time travel story whose name I can't remember, Harry went back to the past to kill Voldemort's horcruxes easy peasy and with that whole ripple in time stuff causes a "new" dark lord to arrive. But it didn't really hold a candle to Voldemort.

Does anyone know of anything that can help me out?


** If it counts- (and I'd say it comes close seeing as we see very little about him in canon), Harry Potter, Wizarding Savior? linkffn(7419421) has the additional antagonist, Grindelwald, done in a pretty interesting way.

Really, that might be a direction to look for OC villain fics. All we know about Grins is that he fought a war to try to take over the world, wanted to make muggles slaves, a little bit about two duels, and that he was quite possibly Dumble's ex, just an overview about his past.

*** Few years ago I'd have supported your suggestion to use Grindelwald. But now that he's going to take a starring role in the canon /Fantastic Beasts/ movie, it's not exactly the right time to start expanding him in different ways only for it all to end up as Jossed as "Snape is a pureblood" stories from before /Half-Blood Prince/ in just a few short years.

**** Uh, hello, OC universes and all that. Besides, the new movies might as well be fanfiction considering the lack of accompanying books- a fake text book does not count.

Besides, for whatever reason the first fantastic beasts didn't inspire all that much fanfiction up my usual haunts at least, no reason to assume the second will.

I think you mean "AU universes". At any rate, in theory the same reasoning can of course be used to justify Horcrux-less, Hallows-less, or Half-Blood-Snape-less stories... it's just that, well, who reads pureblood-Snape stories anymore? Or writes them? Especially when it's not the /focus/ but an obviously uninentional departure from canon, and, while not damning on its own, it will always be distracting.

Have you missed the fact that Rowling herself wrote the screenplay? That makes it pretty damn canon.

** Murder Most Horrid linkffn(10099028) is an AU story featuring Bellatrix as a magical homicide detective. The villains are mostly OCs, Voldemort doesn't exist, and the writing's really good for fanfiction. It's Bellamione though, so that might not be your cup of tea.

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.

Actually, a random idea I fantasied ages and ages ago, was one with Voldemort being possessed by a demon of some sort, who made him create the horcruxes (splitting his soul and fusing the parts with dark magic) to more thoroughly corrupt him.

It basically boiled down to 'Voldemort turns good and goes back to being Tom Riddle once his horcruxes are destroyed' and 'the dark magic within the horcruxes is in reality its own evil entity with its own designs on the world'.

...There's a thought. Be right back, prompting.
