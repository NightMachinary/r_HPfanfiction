I can't recommend this enough! Four people go back in time, but not all at once. At first, it's Harry, Ron, and Ginny but then later in the story, it is someone else. I won't spoil who ;) But seriously, this is all I ever want in a fanfiction. I have read this countless times, and every time I do, I get very engrossed. All around 10/10 fanfiction.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love. This story is now complete! Stay tuned for the sequel!

** I think [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6728900/1/Far-Too-Many-Time-Travelers][Far Too Many Time Travelers]] (W: 53,398; WiP) was supposed to be like that, though I haven't read it myself and (AFAIR) it was a humorous \ cracky story.

  Someone has a daring plan to go back in time and fix everything. No wait, not him, I meant the other... how many people have time traveled anyway? Poor Harry seems to be the only normal one left.

**** Er, just realized this is a dimension travel fic, not time travel. I tried to delete but can't. Maybe you'd still like to give it a look?

***** Most time travel fic is dimension travel as you wouldn't be able to change anything if it was the same dimension.
