Criteria is unique I think in that harry educates or exposes the ancients as their ancestors. Every FF I have seen so far is where harry leaves magical Britain for some adventures and doesn't stay apart of magical society.

Preferred would be a Harry/Hermione pairing or at-least as a main pairing in a multi-pairing.

I only remember 1 story that was like this but forgot the name (and want new ones if they exist).

Only interested in completed works.

Thanks!


** I think Stars Alone linkffn(Stars Alone by Darth Marrs) is a crossover with SG. The pairing is H/G/L, but you should read its predecessor Broken Chains first.

  Sequel to Broken Chains. Every choice has a consequence. Every action has a price. Their financial empire lost, their allies turned against them for crimes they actually did commit, Harry, Hermione and Luna are exiled from Earth. The Goa'uld have no idea what is about to hit them, because the stars alone know how far they will go.

  This is an AU cross-over from Harry Potter with Stargate SG1. Harry meets Seth/Setesh, Harry wins. This is Harry's story of what he would do after assimilating the knowledge of Setesh and Voldemort. I take plenty of AU liberties with canon so don't complain about what the tech or science does or does not do. Pairings: Harry/Hermione.
