The balls of some of these readers are gargantuan. The blatant insults, aggressive all caps, extreme misspellings, flagrant queerphobia... ‚Äúkewl‚Äù and self-promotion... some very, uh, direct suggestions on how to improve...

I also ran into a surprising number of song fics (all terribly formatted) and Eminem name drops in summaries.

This was all motivated by my curiosity as to how writers thought the series might develop before all the books were published; most interesting thing I found was Lily in Slytherin, since apparently canon didn't clarify that until after GoF. The writer was thoroughly yelled at for this blasphemy.


** You still get pretty much all of those, just not as often as you mentioned. But in general, it feels as if reviews lost some depth. I remember two years ago I got a lot of quite invested reviews and people who were willing to debate their views upon characters and plot-points. Nowadays, most are just one sentence variations of "nice work, when's the next update?".

I also did not experience many of the deep discussions, neither as reviewer nor as author. Two to be exact, one who is now my beta and the other I haven't heard from in a while. Two out of ~950 reviews I got and ~300 I've written. I've heard people swear on Ao3 for that reason, but no luck there either.

**** Frankly, I don't care. I don't mind reviews which criticise what I've wrote and even if I don't agree with their point of view or interpretation, there's usually a grain of truth in there.

And I am familiar with pissy authors, some who even defend their stupid rape plots with arguments which make no sense. I even got a few PMs asking me to take a review down because it was not positive enough. In polite words, I told those authors to go fuck themselves, the review function is as much for potential readers as for the author, and endorsing something you don't like is just bad taste.

And if someone feels like ranting about H/Hr and how much better Ginny is in a fic where I made Hermione fall for Padma Patil and Harry for Lisa Turpin, well it's their time they waste writing that rant.

The only reviews I ever moderated away were those guest comments which were nothing more than insults. Like the one in French where I had to Google translate what turned out to be a complaint that an M rated fic is not family friendly and that I was a whore for only writing 20 chapters of it.

*** I've started making a point of leaving feedback, but FFN doesn't let you copy text any more which makes it hard to cite specific examples so it's difficult to be as detailed as I'd like to be.

As others have mentioned if you are constructive a lot of authors will just flame you or block you from leaving reviews and it is super demoralizing to get blocked or flamed for putting effort into feedback.

That said I love a lot of your work and apologize for not leaving better feedback.

**** I'm glad that you enjoyed what I've written. As for specific feedback, honestly, even one sentence which says which half of the chapter was better and why would be a great help. Authors want to tell a story, but unlike in person, you cannot tell which parts are better received and which ones were not so great.

** Just to add my own two cents, I definitely try to leave longer reviews on stories that I come across and like. The only problem is that most stories I do happen to cross nowadays are stories that I'm not very interested in. Part of that is my fault in that I've developed a very distinct taste with what I want out of a story. And most stories just don't meet that distinct taste of mine. Hence, I choose not to leave a review on that particular story.

Work is a time-killer for me because it's been very busy lately. Also, I'm combing through Stephen Kong's catalogue on top of writing my own FanFiction stories. To make a long story short, I don't have much spare time to hunt for the specific stories I want to read. And I've noticed that I'm reading a lot less FanFiction than I was a couple of years ago.

There's also the issue in that many Harmony shippers (of which I'm proud to be part of) always seem to recommend the same stories over and over again on Reddit, Discord, and Facebook. The true crime in that is that those recommended stories just aren't that good to begin with (such stories include bad writing, OOC characters, power fantasies, lordships, and other nauseating tropes). It's like Harmony shippers are afraid to venture past long-established borders to try new, more interesting stories than the same old tired ones that I can't even read a paragraph of before saying, ‚ÄúUgh...this again?‚Äù

*** Hmm. I wouldn't call myself a Harmony shipper, really. I enjoy a select few of them, but I'm a bit allergic to the "it is you I have loved all along" approach that the vast majority of them seem to have. And I quite like Harry/Ginny.

I did leave a longer review today, though, on Hermione Granger and the Paradigm Shift. That one really hit all my main points for a Harmony fic: plausible divergence, realistic development of their relationship, in-character reactions from Ron and Ginny without bashing anyone. It's even giving Ron/Lavender a serious attempt. So I thought the author deserved a pat on the back.

** Lily sorted into Slytherin would make a pretty interesting fanfic I think... because canonically her personality is Gryffindor to the highest degree. But maybe she chooses to be with Severus and she has a whole lot of crap to deal with. Probably becomes kind of bitter about the magical world. She becomes harsh too. And when Voldemort was destroyed on Halloween night you can bet she MEANT to do that.

*** I thought so too! Unfortunately it was just a background thing, but the author used it to explain why Voldemort didn't want to kill her. It was an interesting take I'd never seen before.

Reviewers tore it apart for being improbable. I noticed that they seems much more loyal to canon or what could be canon. Probably because canon wasn't actually established yet.

I'm curious about how "direct" these suggestions where? Was it something among the lines of "Your story feel a bit packed and it could be interesting to change the passing a bit" or "This suck, Harry need to seduce Fleur and Daphne to get his harem" ?

** The last time I left legitimate criticism, the author hounded me in my PMs - they began sending me messages about how /I dare/ to write what I did, how they were inconvenienced by the pandemic, how I had no right to write anything anymore.

It was a crossover, MCU, with a Fem!Harry as the daughter of Loki. The whole premise was that Voldemort was resurrected by this blood and changed into a very weird "worshipper", mentally. It went on for a while, with Mindfucked!Voldy pretending to be her cousin from america and such without her knowing. Then he started fucking around with her dreams and her Sight.

I dropped the story on the chapter after he was "killed", and was telling her about all the people he'd assasinated since then because they were inconvenient (and not, like, death eaters. Just random innocent people), and she just accepted it.

The whole story evoked memories from me - it had /major/ stalker vibes, and reminded me of a dude who pretended to be other people and follow me in the past.

** I've seen authors quit ffn because of the toxicity of some of the reviewers, and considered myself to have "made it" as an author myself when I got my first (and only) anonymous troll review. When I review, I generally try to include at least some deserved praise for a fic even when I'm picking at something I find problematic, and never say "this is bad" or "I don't like this" without offering suggestions for possible improvement. Some of my reviews are shallower, mostly just commenting on one aspect of a chapter, making a joke based on the chapter, or speculating about events to come.
