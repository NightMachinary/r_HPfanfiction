All those family lines, pure of blood with much power and tradition, gone.


** “That's fine. I have no opposition to any of these women. However, you should know, I'm asexual.”

“You're only attracted to acromantulae?”

“No. I have no interest in sexual activity whatsoever. In fact, it violently repulses me.”

They stared at Harry. Harry stared at them.

“You. . . what?”

“No. Sex. Not going to happen. No matter who, what, or how.”

“Umm. . . Excuse me please, one moment.”

Harry smiled politely and waited. They would look over the contracts and stipulations meted upon him, and find the same thing he had. He was required to marry. Certain houses required him to marry with certain other houses. There were rituals for the bindings, and there were stipulations for which children could inherit.

There was no rule saying he had to *have* children. It was a social expectation, something everyone knew and no one bothered to put into law.

After all, with a beautiful pureblood witch soulbound to you, what man could resist? What man would /want/ to?

And it was just the magical world's misfortune that they wasted all that potential on him. So many bloodlines, so many hopes and desires, stupidly thrust upon the one man who wanted nothing to do with it.

He would live well and long, he would act in the best interests of the families for whom he was responsible, but he refused to change who he was. He refused to pretend otherwise. If they wanted to give him power, he would use it as he saw fit. And if they sought to manipulate him with the ties of loyalty he'd accepted, they were welcome to try.

Harry Potter-Black-Peverell-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Selwyn-Ravenclaw-Monroe-Hufflepuff was far too important, too powerful, and too well-connected. They would eventually come to the same conclusion, though they fought and blustered every step of the way. No attempt at revising the laws would go through. No creative re-interpretation of the contracts would suffice.

He would do what he wanted, and they couldn't do a thing about it. And what Harry wanted was far deeper than the mundane and the physical. Heirs would be a distraction. He may be married on paper to more heiresses than any reasonable man could want, but in the end the ties themselves mattered to him more than the women.

His bloodline mattered little when weighed against his knowledge. Magic was a far greater responsibility than any societal contract, any unspoken law.

His heirs would not be his descendants, but his students.

And if half the pure-blood families in Great Britain were truly stupid enough to have tied their entire future to his whims, then they deserved to watch as they lost everything.

** "The contract says you have to."

"I didn't sign it."

"You'll lose your magic!"

"I didn't. Sign. The contract!" The new lord snapped at the sputtering Auror Captain, "I'm not beholden to something I didn't sign up for."

The Captains partner blinked and hummed in thought, wondering why he'd never thought of that. Kingsley Shacklebolt would later go home and cancel his families contract with the Ogden's. His audacious move copied by the Greengrass daughters (the eldest of which inspired her best friend from the Davies family to cancel hers with the Goyle's).

Century old contracts, awaiting their completion as a result of bargains and aide given by ancient ancestors... gone.

Thus began the Pureblood Civil War. Those who felt they should not be beholden to those who'd dictated their lives centuries in advance against the forces who thought otherwise.

The Muggleborns scooped up what was left when they were done...

***** Same here, that was fun. If you ever wanted to expand that into a full story, I'd certainly enjoy reading it. Solicitor-mandated war over clauses and legalese could be quite funny. For some reason, my brain pictures a lot of frantic spell-battles with all the banter over their contractual disagreements and tort debate being voiced by the actors from Frasier.

** The goblin sighed as he looked at his insanely large bloodline charts ever since that potter brat decided to not have children it was his Job to find an heir. but the question everyone is asking should he be searching for the heir to the potter line and that person get every title or should he track down each title seperately to hand it to closet heir of each family name. if it was the second he already had a headstart as the black name and fortune would go to lady malfoy and then to her son draco

He sighed to himself as he looked at another long chart curse us goblins and great costumer service

*** I personally think it'd be funnier with all those fortunes going down the proverbial drain.

Griphook's face paled along with the two other Griphooks in the opulent conference room lined with gold.

"You're donating your fortune to St. Mungos?" whispered Griphook (3?), his face pale.

"You're what?" screamed Malfoy, hand flying to his robes.

"Yep, I'm donating my fortune to the hospital upon my death. Fleur, Daphne, Susuan, Tonks, and I don't want to have children so we're donating my billions of galleons and magical artifacts to St. Mungos." lazily replied Harry.

Malfoy and two Griphooks fainted as the third Griphook reached into a pocket and pulled out a flask labeled Blood of Enemies - 60% Alcohol.

** ... and he adopts adults to be his heirs, choosing carefully who to adopt into which family for maximum annoyance.

There's historical precedent for adult adoption eg in Rome - if you ignore violent coups d'etat, imperial succession by adult adoption was the most common way in which power was handed on for the relatively stable first 200 years of the Empire, more common than succession from father to son. I understand that something similar is still practiced in modern Japan.

*** Yeah.. I remember Julius Ceasar adopted Octavian. Octavian became known as Augustus after Senate stabbed Julius on the accounts of "trying to be emperor". So Augustus, in retaliation, removed the Triumvirate and literally became an Emperor/Emperator. (remembered it due to Calendar) Another on top of my head, the sister of Caligula convinced the reigning emperor to adopt her son from her first marriage thus giving him a new name, Nero .

Now it would be interesting if Harry Adopted an Heir and none of the Purebloods know about it. They ended up assasinating Harry and his adopted heir ends up leading a revolution removing the ministry(Republic) and instilling an absolute Monarchy. Harry became a Martyr against the corrupt system which caused a riot to the common populace. In the end, Harry's death, instead of preserving the status quo, had caused the absolute destruction of it. Even in death, Harry has the last laugh and didn't lose.

Furthermore since Harry's heir meant to be heirs of the Pureblood beauties foisted on him. That Single Heir took most of the power of the Pureblood, the remaining oneswere swiftly deposed. After Harry by himself able to hold them at bay, what more would the additional lordship do to Harry's chosen heir. Since Harry fullfilled all outstanding contracts, his heir has a clean slate to stand on. He just had to earn the crown and keep it.

If they really wanna live like Lords and Ladies then Serve an actual king/Emperor. The ministry is so corrupt that the people just went along with a new powee in charge.

im pretty sure this thing can also be explained away as what made King Arthur so powerful. The previous Lord-Many-Names made pulling the sword in stone a trial(like mjolnir's worthy spell). Arthur passed and made Heir of Lord-Many-Names thus becoming a provebial king to consolidate names to be just 'king Arthur'. If you want to throw in Lord emrys or heir of Merlin to Harry's title then he has a precedent of such thing happening.

** The crowd hushed as the ancient solicitor took center stage. The only noise were the clicks and poofs of the cameras as she unrolled Harry Potter's will. The enigmatic Lord Potter-Black-Perevell-Gryffindor-Slytherin had married and loved five beautiful women over the course of his long lifetime, but none of them had ever had children. The question on everyone's mind: Who would he leave his vast fortune to?

The solicitor cleared her throat. "To my Loving (still living) Veela wife, I leave our home, our primary bank account, and my share of Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. May it continue to bring her joy and comfort.

To my Godson, Theodore Lupin, I leave Sleek Easy's, as well as the Potter lands, titles, and fortunes. May they do him more good than they did me.

To St. Mungo's Hospital, I leave the Perevell trust fund, for use in patient care and medical research.

To Hogwarts, I leave the Gryffindor and Slytherin artifacts found in vault 713.

To the ghost of Sir Nicholas, who haunts Gryffindor tower, I leave the title Gryffindor, Lord of Godric's Hollow.

To the Giant Squid of Hogwarts Lake, I leave the title Slytherin, Lord of Fenland.

To whomever may find it, I leave the Marauder's Map.

To the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare, I leave the contents of my sock drawer.

To Kreacher the House Elf, I leave number 12 Grimmold Place and all the mess therein, including artifacts, monies, deeds, and titles.

To the Goblins of Gringotts, I leave one knut. Please split it evenly."

There silence stretched as the ancient solicitor rolled up the will. Then the crowd roared.

​

AN: While Harry has married five women in this story, I don't think he married them all simultaneously.

** I know this isn't exactly what you asked for, but this snippet popped into my head.

#+begin_example
                 .............................................. 
#+end_example

The head goblin blinked, staring over his desk with an expression akin to bemusement at the Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Ravenclaw-Peverell heir, Lordship ring sitting innocently on the desk between them.

"Come again?"

"I believe you heard me just fine, Axebourne. I won't accept the ring." Harry tapped his fingers lightly against the dark wood of the desk, leaning forward slightly in his rather comfy chair.

Axebourne blinked again. Harry took this time to continue.

"I never signed any documents, my consent was never asked for nor will it be given and, most importantly, I don't want children." Axebourne was beginning to think it might've been a better idea to give the Lordship to a brick wall. It would certainly be less difficult than dealing with the stubborn man in front of him.

"You would condemn centuries worth of bloodlines and wealth to a fate worse than death all because you don't want children, Mr. Potter?" The goblin head asked, a tiny bit of indignation peeking through his voice.

"Do you have ANY idea how bad the paperwork will be?! It would take MONTHS for me to finish!!!" Axebourne stood on his chair, "No, Mr. Potter. I'm afraid you WILL be taking this ring, you WILL be marrying multiple women and you WILL have heirs for your bloodlines!" It was Harry's turn to look bemused.

"Bu-"

"Nope!"

"Mr. Axebourne I-"

"Not today, Satan!"

"Please le-"

"Zip it!" Harry shut his mouth with an audible click, sitting back in his chair. Axebourne's features were contorted with what Harry could only assume was anger. Axebourne set the contract and a blood quill in front of Harry.

"Sign at the dotted line, Mr. Potter and I'll get you all set up."

All Harry could do was obey. He really needed to stop angering the goblins.
