  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has spent two years carefully cultivating a persona of unremarkable mediocrity, melting seamlessly into the background. Now in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he tries to maintain that facade, and for good reason. Unfortunately, a certain bushy haired girl has taken notice and proceeds to question his every move.

  AU third year. I must have a sign on my back that says psycho paths please attack me. I would not put it beyond Dudley to afix such a sign to me, but I doubt he could spell it accurately enough for a psycho to understand.

  Turned into a werewolf at fifteen, Harry, afraid of what he now is and the lack of control he has, runs from the wizarding world, right into the territory of unmated alpha werewolf Fenrir Greyback, who is overly eager to find the submissive wolf in the heart of his territory. Fenrir/Harry. Mpreg.
