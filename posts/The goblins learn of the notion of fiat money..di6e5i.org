On the off chance that someone here might be unfamiliar with the term, here is the wikipedia link to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money][fiat money]].


** Harry Eliezer Potter was a proud boy. Only eleven, yet the smartest not only of his class, his school, or even his generation: no, he was the smartest person in the entire wizarding world.\\
No one else had a grasp as tight on the concepts governing magic, the nuances of science, and the particulars of human interaction as he did. And just imagine, he was only eleven, what would the future look like? Well, he was excited, that's for sure.

And here he was, advising the Goblins how to secure their vaults better. They desperately needed the advice, after all the had been robbed only days ago!

"...and anyway, why do you even keep all this gold around? Have you never heard of fiat money?"

"What...?" the Goblin asked, clearly confused.

"Fiat money. It's money that doesn't really exist. See, you just say something has value, and then it's valuable. You, of course, need to regulate it, but just put in a few rules, and it should be easy!"

The Goblin still looked confused but didn't ask a question. Harry was getting bored by it.

"Anyway, I have to go, kill all your enemies and stuff! May your enemies blood fill your children's bottles!" Harry said, turned around, and left Gringotts.

The Goblin, Bertric, turned to his stunned colleague next to him. "Do you think he's aware that you can duplicate anything but metals rather easily, and pretty much permanently?"

His colleague, Nukgrook, shrugged. "Not sure, but I'm not sure we should tell him..."

"Why not, it might be fun: see him flounder a bit, and come up with some stupid alternatives..."

"Do you really want to hear another idiot lecture about the benefits of Blockchain...?"
