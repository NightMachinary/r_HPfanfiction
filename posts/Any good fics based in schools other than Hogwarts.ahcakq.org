The longer the better and preferably no slash. Doesnt matter if its based around Harry or a whole new OC. And I am talking about canon schools, not original ones.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived).

One of the best non-BWL Harry fics there is, it has Harry study at Durmstrang. The fic has only 12 chapters posted on ff.net, but the current length is nearly double that. I read about 20-22 chapters on a Russian site.

**** I did some digging after reaching the end of what's on FF.net, and there is more posted on DLP if you register. But it is incomplete, and I thought I remembered hearing that the author had passed away (but that's one of those things you always hear about authors of popular stories that aren't finished.)

**** Not sure - it looks like the entirety of the fic was uploaded on the Russian site either on 10 February or 2 October in 2017. It might still be live, since I don't think the user who made the upload is The Santi.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** linkffn(12046790)

harry and hermione finish their last year at mahoutokoro after the war.

personally I am not a huge fan of the harem styled summer before schooltime, but the worldbuilding in japan is amazing.

mahoutokoro itself, the banzai bazar, the train, everything gave me that feeling of wonder that I first had when learning about the british magical world.
