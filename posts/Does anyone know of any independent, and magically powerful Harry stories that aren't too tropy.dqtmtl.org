I don't mind some tropes, manipulative Dumbledore trope for example does have some merit, and as long as it only focuses on stuff that Dumbledore did in canon, that's fine. Having him being someone who loved seeing Harry suffer while having Harry bethrothed against his will, and stealing from his accounts put me off. Him raising Harry "like a pig for slaughter" is canon though, so that's free game. As long as it also at least alludes to it being a difficult decision on him. Blast away still, because I would have handled that better, but you get what i'm going for.

The magical power is mostly, because for a Harry to be independent when Voldemort is still around, he has to at least be a competent threat.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the International Triwizard Tournament)

There are some tropes, like learning from a library inside the Chamber, the possibility of multiple marriages based on bloodlines (Black and Potter), Dobby being BFF. There's a bit of Ron bashing in the first few chapters, but he's completely a non-factor after that, so is Hermione, for that matter.

Honestly, its really different from the usual, with interesting character development for Harry, he starts as a whiny brat (imo) and he just keeps maturing and maturing, to the point you wouldn't believe he's the same kid. And it happens naturally and genuinely. There's a few good OC, mainly Madame Lacroix and Natalia, the Delacours are interesting, Slughorn is phenomenal, he has such a depth that is only skimmed in canon. Dumbledore is, well, he isn't evil, nor he is GG manipulative old-goat, but he isn't the omniscient god as he seems in canon, he's flawed, and he's fairly shaded.

Harry is independent without being that annoying kind of fic, he's actively working to become free of any control over him, be it from the Ministry, Dumbledore, and the world in general, with his being the BWL.

Overal, its a great read, if you haven't yet. But I might be a bit biased. I hope not, I don't think I've misled anything with my comments.

If you've read A Cadmean Victory, its that but much better, with no edgy 'I do not forgive, I do not forget' Harry, great OCs, Fleur is adorable, good battle scenes (though there's been only 1 major so far) and my favourite part, the intricate system of how magic works, guided by a journal.

  A disillusioned Harry Potter gets ready to take on a Triwizard Tournament that captures international attention. He finds a new home, mentor, friends, allies and works to become his own man. Follow Harry as he dives into international waters and finds out if he is a shark or a minnow. Rated M in case something rated M is added in the future.

** I'd recommend linkffn(Blindness by AngelaStarCat) - I don't think it hits any major tropes other than Harry being overpowered and it expands Canon's understanding of magic quite a bit. Also finished, which is a pleasant rarity with these types of stories.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

** Concerning the “pig for slaughter” comment, I really liked unfortunately unfulfilled plot bunny in the chapter 8 of linkao3(Scribble Pad by White_Squirrel) “Ferte in Noctem Animam Meam”: Dumbledore knows Harry has a Horcrux in his head, but there is nothing to do with it, and so he treats him as a child with the terminal disease and tries not to ruin his childhood prematurely. The similar theme is the core of linkffn(The Horcrux Within by althor42) and in somewhat oblique way linkao3(Tea Cures All Ills by delizabethl22).

  There was a more sinister reason for Hero's short temper in fifth year than adolescence and excess stress. When she has a seizure while gardening outside no. 4 Privet Drive, in full view of the neighbors, the Dursleys have no choice but to take her to a doctor. The devastating news will affect all that is to come.Sorry, this isn't a great summary. And I know this sounds really depressing, but just go with me, alright?

** I think linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) would fit the description of 'not too tropey', and either way, if you haven't read it, it's an enjoyable read.

There's also linkffn(To Fight the Coming Darkness), which, if you can look past the occasional spelling mistakes, is a decent story, written before DH, and possibly even before HBP.
