** One of the biggest complaints in the fandom is how the houses put the kids in a box, which is a funny take because the only people who place the kids in a box are fans. Almost every character we met could've been in at least one other house.

I do understand why dark, genius, indy, and/or powerful Harry is usually a Slytherin. The fandom likes the Tom Riddle comparison, in theory the story should deviate from canon earlier than with a Gryffindor Harry, and Slytherin provides canon baggage, angst, and drama.

Slytherin being full of cool, debonair, charismatic people is bullshit, though. That's, as far as we know, only TMR and, to an extent, Slughorn. The fandom's idea of a quintessential Gryffindor's negative traits can all be lobbed at Snape, Draco, and Bellatrix.

SN: I disagree a little with your assessment of Peter. He wasn't ambitious. He was scared. He'd be a great Slytherin because of the self-preservation and his resourcefulness.

I disagree. Pettigrew didn't just want to survive. If he did, he would have just escape to Australia or something like that. He assumed he would be revered above all for everything he did to help Voldemort.

This is Snape. Not Peter. Peter allied himself with the strongest because he was weak. He did it with James and Sirius then he did it with Voldemort.

Peter switched sides simply because Voldemort was winning. There was no other motive other than being safely on the winning side.
