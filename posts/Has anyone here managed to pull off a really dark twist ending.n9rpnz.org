** I'm trying to remember the name of the fic, but it was Harry/Voldemort (time travel, Harry came back) and Harry teamed up with the Dark Lord to overthrow the ministry, kill Dumbledore, and take control of Wizarding Britain. The reason he agreed to team up with Voldemort was to get equal rights for creatures, including dark ones like Werewolves and Vampires, and he needed the man power and reputation that Voldemort had in his organization make it happen.

At the height of the battle when they had won everything and Voldemort turned to celebrate with him, Harry killed him. He knew that no one would follow the new regime with Voldemort as its leader. Voldemort truly did come to love Harry in the fic, so it was quite the betrayal. Up until that point it seemed like they would get their...happy?...ending, but the author wrote it really well so that it was a reasonable twist.

  Harry's breath caught in his throat as his wand automatically lit up. “Lumos,” a familiar female voice lightly whispered in his ear and then giggled, making Harry shut his eyes tightly. It was a dream, it was just a dream. It wasn't real, it couldn't be. He was just having a nightmare, just imagining things that were happening inside his own head. “Of course it's happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it's not real?”

** Remember one pre-HBP as it was still Harry/Cho where they had a kid. At some point the kid is abducted and the Golden Trio goes searching for him. Turns out it was Voldemort (who was believed to be dead). He kills Hermione and forces Harry to kill Ron (under the threat of killing his son) so that they could use different wands in order to avoid Priori Incantatem. The story ends with a fair duel in which Voldemort says "third time's a charm" and kills Harry, proceeds to kill his son and then the story ends on a cliffhanger implying a third war is about to start.
