Im currently watching the Story of Mortal Kombat 11 and its interactions with Past and Future Characters (meaning also possible alternations) is really funny. There are other Media with such Theme, but MK is the up-to-date one.

And it gave me the idea if something as that might happen in the HP Universe. Of course it would be far greater than just using a Time-turner and without any Paradox consequences. So, as in MK, the characters can interact with each other and dont have to fear about consequences (or maybe atleast for an amount of time). I think i will crosspost this to the Harmony subbreddit as well, as i would like to reach as many Users as possible and because im interested in Canon and H/Hr Timelines.

â€‹

I wouldnt want to have the same cause as in the Videogame put into the HP Univserse, but something, that could reach just as far.

Well, i would also be open for non-canon pairs, like Harry/Daphne for just an example or an OFC (no pairs are also fine). But to avoid any confusing mixes, i would keep it to 2 timelines/Alternations per Fic

  Fifth year: After the Dementor attack, Harry is not returning to Hogwarts -- is he? ! Instead of Harry, a snake moves into the lions' den. People won't know what hit them when Dumbledore's chess pawn Harry is lost in time... Manipulative Dumbledore, 'Slytherin!Harry', Time Travel!

  Our choices define us. When Harry and his closest friends are transported to an alternate dimension, thirty years after the war's end, and forced to face the results of what would have been if only they had chosen differently, he will discover just how true this is. Features H/G, H/Hr, H/DG. Not multi.
