Looking for any well written and believable Hermione/Ron stories set after the war, would like it to focus on the affects the war had on both of them, Harry and the others could be there but I'd rather the story mainly focus more on Hermione and Ron.

No character bashing, no harems, any rating is fine. For side pairings I am okay with het/slash/femslash as well. Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine.

Yeah would just like a Ron and Hermione centered story, with Harry not as the main character, just something different for me.
