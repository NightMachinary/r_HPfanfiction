:END:
I've been looking for a fic I read a while ago. It was a marauders era jily fic on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]], and this is all I remember about it: The marauders were hosting a talent show and they put out a list of girls or something, and it was kind of like a beauty pageant thing, and one thing I remember from it is that Marlene had bipolar disorder. I'm fairly certain it was called Hogwarts' Got Talent or something similar.
