I started reading a fic a few weeks back where Harry became alienated from his friends and started training with Dumbledore in fourth year. All good... up until using pain-based curses was just kinda brushed off as 'haha, it's ok, because we're classy'. Same for 99% of Slytherin!Harry fics, where the purebloods are just poor misunderstood rich bigots.


** We see the book through Harry's eyes -- so we're bound to miss out on a lot of how the wizarding world works. He doesn't have to worry about blood purity (as Hermione said in book 6), and for most of the books he's too young anyway to see the effects of blood purity on wizarding society.

Now, the comparison I often make in my mind is "pureblood vs muggleborn" to "citizen vs immigrant". Imagine wizarding society as its own country with very strict citizenship rules -- you're either grandfathered in, or your family has to spend several generations as productive members in wizarding society and/or marry purebloods to become a proper citizen. Much of the blood purity stuff has explanations then:

High level Ministry posts are restricted to 'citizens', much like the law requires in the UK and most countries in the world. The Wizengamot, comparable to the House of Lords, is either hereditary or appointed, so naturally its members are mostly purebloods. There may even be laws favoring purebloods for employment, like most countries in the world, that prioritises employing ‘citizens' over ‘immigrants'.

Voldemort and the Death Eaters are akin to a fascist movement that seeks to restore power to the citizens of the wizarding world (which may exclude House Elves and other sentient magical creatures) and enact far harsher immigration laws. They may also fear losing their traditional values to a new wave of immigrant culture due to, perhaps, a surge of muggleborns following WWII?

There is no canonical evidence for difference in magical ability due to blood purity, but neither is there empirical evidence for the contrary (i.e. blood purity doesn't affect magical power at all). So the question of blood purity is reduced to an arbitrary definition of ‘citizenship' defined by the citizens, which would naturally be exclusive, as the wizarding equivalent of the Enlightenment hasn't seemed to have happened.

So why hasn't it? Why haven't the muggleborns risen up demanding more rights? It is possible that they have and were repressed, but it is also possible that there was never an opportunity. After all, it is far easier to leave Wizarding Britain than any physical country. Perhaps a wave of disillusioned muggleborns returning to their old lives leads to purebloods condemning all muggleborns as ‘unable to fit in with wizarding culture' and so began a vicious cycle.

*** This is probably the best comparison I have read, and also fits frighteningly well with certain attitudes in our very own Muggle Britain. Magical Britain is an interesting and horrifying little microcosm of a very British style of xenophobia, right down to otherwise nice people like the Weasleys being casually ignorant and dismissive.

***** They aren't born into the magical society though; they are born into muggle society and raised there, insiders to Muggle culture. They are basically randomly selected and given the choice of joining this secret magical world when they're eleven, and very little seems to be done to ease them through any culture shock or help them integrate. They are told that what they grew up with is inferior and their familes are looked down on, thought of as subhuman and inferior. They are pushed to leave their own world behind. People move countries for a variety of reasons, but usually to improve their life. Muggleborns join the magical society to improve their lives and learn to use a gift that has just appeared for no apparent reason, and most of them join with optimism, hoping for acceptance and to feel at home among other magic users. I don't know if you have ever been treated like a stupid foreigner in a country you've lived in, but it kind of sucks.

You could force them to integrate at an earlier age because then you've violated the parents' rights, and the muggleborn child's right to their muggle culture. You could make it a choice for parents, but then you've got parents who will refuse and muggleborn kids still end up basically immigrating at 11. Not to mention the potential secrecy violations from having little kids running around sharing with their muggle friends. Magic doesn't simplify social problems. It just changes them.

The real or perceived elimination of ones own culture by an (seemingly) powerful authority or movement is the cause of conflict of all kinds throughout the world.

If we assume that Dumbledore and his buddies are this perceived authority, the people who would rather celebrate Yule than Christmas would probably rally towards a countermovement. The inherent injustice, corruption, or lip service of this countermovement's ideals is then often secondary, as long as it counters the perceived threat to one's own culture.

The Death Eaters are only the peak of this countermovement that (and I'm adding worldbuilding here for the sake of argument) arose from a wide-spread fear of loosing magical customs and identity to a movement that endorses muggle festivities. They are like the KKK in that they're building on a foundation of culturally accepted, but by far not as volatile and violent racism. Understandable? I think so. Excusable? Of course not.

Its a simple thing to accept that humans never do anything without a reason. That reason can be profoundly philosophic in nature, or instinctual. Its also well understood that this reason does not need to make objective sense, but only needs to be subjectively sound - at the very least.

**** because there is even less base for the racism in the books than their should be.

realistically speaking there should be a difference between muggleborns and purebloods, because they are basically foreigners introduced to a new country and they should at least do worse in school in the first couple of years.and people like the malfoys would most definitely make sure their child is taught some magic before they are accepted into hogwarts and during the holidays.

but in the books there is literally no difference between people of magical and muggle families except minor cultural ones. there is no difference in accents, nothing in terms of education, they even look the same and seem to have the same customs. And even what we know of the history of the founders suggest that muggle born were merely considered not trustworthy. And if you consider pottermore canon than we know that until the statue of secrecy 300 years ago even the malfoys intermarried with muggleborns and muggles if they were rich enough.

It makes no sense that blood purity exist in circumstances like they are shown in the books.

and the diffrence between white supremacy and blood purity is that the former at least attempts to prove that they are better by using flawed logic and statistics that show a difference( which normally can be explained by other reasons than ethnicity)

** The worst is when people somehow make out that muggles/muggleborns/halfbloods/whoever else the raving, racist terrorist brigade despise are the actual bad guys, that fear of nuclear annihilation (for example) is enough reason for Voldemort to murder a whole bunch of people and take over the Ministry, /for the protection of wizardkind./

The Death Eaters and Voldemort have parallels in their ideology with the Nazis (particularly the SS), and it really bothers me that so many authors don't seem to see that. Political conservatism isn't wrong. Preserving tradition and tempering reform isn't wrong. Classifying people by their quality of blood, and treating anyone who's not in your special inbred corner as second class, murdering or throwing them in prison when you have the power, and otherwise causing murder and mayhem /is definitely wrong./

On top of that, class is a boring and overdone trope not just in HP fanfiction, but in literature in general, since everyone just looks at Marx and Engels' work and loses their minds, demanding that everyone seize the means of production and free the proletariat, and more often than not end up sounding just like Robbespierre with how much they want to put one group or other to death.

In Harry Potter, the pureblood faction is mostly a bunch of violent, sadistic, racist scumbags, and short of a full AU (which is fine to do, by the way) should never be apologised for.

By doing so, some authors (depending on the angle from which they present their apologia from), end up /indirectly apologising for the fucking Nazis, just like people who do the House-Elf bond trope do for slavery./

Eeh... I wouldn't go that far. The fact that they're an entirely different species gives some leeway. I'm completely on your side when it goes into "OMG Hermione, you so dumb, you're trying to murder them" territory. Any muggleborn would not be comfortable with treating any sentient, emphatic and intelligent species like the house-elves the way wizards do. Therefore its understandable and admirable that Hermione goes in the field of activism against this perceived wrong.

But I'll accept any good explanation by an author that makes the elves out to be symbiotic or parasitic by nature. I myself have a fic in which house-elves are merely those that get their magic from humans. I described woodelves as hanging around Centaurs, Fauns and Nymphs. Rock-elves gather their magic from giants and trolls. Imps get it from vampires and Lich. They're a different species. I don't see why they can't be symbiotic in nature.

We know for a fact that every house-elf we see outside of Hogwarts (Dobby, Winky) is at least kinda unhappy, one going as far as hurting himself just to disobey, and literally dying for the one who freed him.

***** But the only one who has ever called it slavery was a muggleborn - Hermione. Given what elves she meets in her lifetime, that's probably the right thing to call it, too, from her perspective. If we assume that house-elves are symbionts or parasites, the wish of Dobby to be free is almost like he's suicidal. Crouch banishing Winky would be to deliberately ask her to go and die.

But as far as we know, there are also quite a few elves who are perfectly happy with and defensive about their life, because their symbiotic bond (or whatever you want to call it) isn't corrupted by an unequal power-balance. As is the case of Hogwarts house-elves.

My explanation in my own fic, is that the human - elf bond corruption is a relatively new problem arising through an influential, but due to his own upbringing rather ignorant Dark Lord. As I stated before, muggleborn and muggleraised could easily mistake a symbiotic bond for enslavement and act according to their own principles and values. People like Hermione would then go against the perceived wrong and try to free the elves. Voldemort would thrive on it and misuse the power he has over the symbionts. Both paths don't end well for the elves.

I'll completely agree that we're walking a fine line between mutual agreement, with one side being in command, and enslavement with one side being in power. Its also a fantastical - imaginary line. Its impossible to compare a sentient-sentient symbiotic relationship with a real one. We humans live in plenty of symbiotic relationships with other species - most noticeable dogs, who over time have learned to read our expressions and moods. However, there is (obviously) no symbiotic relationship with any other sentient species we could compare the house-elve to humans one to. Its only assumptions I make on "What if,..." questions that lead me to think that calling this relationship slavery is just not correct. So I personally call the systematic abuse of house-elves a bond-corruption.

Being dependent on someone doesn't give them any right to enslave you. Hermione trying to free the elves is completely in the right - as Dobby proves, they can work for others out of their own free will, without dying or needing to be enslaved.

*** Why is the only correct interpretation "Death Eaters are Nazis, so they must be the bad guys in the fic". If I portray a sympathetic DE, does that make me a Nazi apologist? Can't it just be a story I wanted to write? Does everything I write reflect my own views? Am I not allowed to explore other points of view? Say I just want to make DEs the heroes and write a story where the view presented is that they're right. I can't do that?

**** Well, technically it's not the only 'correct' interpretation, but authors seem to forget that it's the canon interpretation. DEs /are/ parallel to the Nazis, just like Harry has his mother's eyes or Snape's hair is greasy.

But anyway, my first comment was rather angry, as this issue has irritated me in the past, but as a result I never actually got across my main point.

I'm not advocating censorship, although it absolutely sounds like I am. What you write doesn't have to reflect your real opinion, and it's absolutely your right to write whatever you want. If you decided to defend the Purebloods, it wouldn't make you a Nazi apologist straightaway, and any interpretation of your work would depend on how you approached defending them. If you just went out there and said, "I think they were correct, I think all mudbloods should be killed, go Voldemort!" then by openly supporting their racist views - and crucially - /trying to convince the reader that that racism is somehow correct/ then I can see immediately why people would interpret those arguments badly.

What I'm hoping for in voicing my perspective on how apologism for the Purebloods /can/ sound is for more authors to consider their words, and the way in which they present obviously evil characters like the DEs as sympathetic, the protagonists, or like you said, even heroes. Taking HP canon as-is, not changing a thing but then somehow insinuating that the DEs are the good-guys is just poor writing, to me, and it takes considerable effort (in my reading experience anyhow, as I'm not a great writer) for an author to present such a blatantly antagonistic character/faction as something the reader should be supporting.

For Pureblood apologism to truly work, I believe that the author would have to build an AU around that premise, where they both construct and then explore the reasoning behind them joining Voldemort's little weekend murder-club, and construct a narrative where it would truly be the best decision to preserve their way of life/kill all the mudbloods/take over the world, etc.

Readers would need to /understand/ the characters and their motivations like in any other story, and I feel that much of the Pureblood apologism that takes place right now makes no effort to actually attempt that.

And all of that said, I'd never actually call you a Nazi apologist unless you actually started defending their ideology/actions, in the same way that everyone condemned that one weird guy on here who kept trying to use rape in stories and justify it.

****** It's alright, I suppose I /am/ being very absolutist here. I've looked into it, and Rowling flip-flops a little on this issue, but she does say she drew (and in some ways inadvertently) a lot of inspiration from Nazi Germany, among other totalitarian and racist ideologies.

[On ethnic cleansing in /Deathly Hallows/]

#+begin_quote
  "Well, it is a political metaphor. But... I didn't sit down and think, 'I want to recreate Nazi Germany', in the---in the wizarding world. Because---although there are---quite consciously overtones of Nazi Germany, there are also associations with other political situations. So I can't really single one out."
#+end_quote

Rowling based Voldemort on Hitler and Stalin (interview with a Dutch magazine in 2007).

[On the inclusion of the 'blood' system, independently devised before she was aware of its parallels with Nazism]

#+begin_quote
  "...some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood. I saw one in the Holocaust Museum in Washington when I had already devised the 'pure-blood', 'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' definitions, and was chilled to notice the similarity."
#+end_quote

Harry Potter is full of political messages, overtones and undertones, but in blunt analysis of the Death Eaters and Voldemort's ideology, I choose to interpret it as a parallel of Nazism. Of course, there are other arguments to be made that it more closely mirrors 'traditional' racism or the arguments put forward by intellectuals to justify the slave trade.

So, I'll admit now that I was wrong in saying it is the canon interpretation of the Death Eaters, because Rowling doesn't commit to clearly saying so. However, with the way that the Voldemort Ministry force genealogy tests on the population to determine the amount of non-wizarding blood in them, coupled with the way they represent muggles in the pamphlets Harry sees when he's heading to Umbridge's Office, I feel that the blood purists lend themselves most strongly to Nazism.

Hope that gave you some food for thought, and sorry again for being quite so blunt and aggressive in my arguing.

**** There's often some root cause or underlying conflict behind racism or prejudice. Humans need to have some rationale for what they're doing. It might not even be true (often it isnt) but we dont even get that in canon.

Evidently there's a large majority that, while not death eaters, are slightly prejudiced against Muggleborns. And that's certainly true of Modern society as well (in the Us for example there is a lot of institutional/subconcious bias against minorities, even when outright racism is looked down upon).

Hermione and co. were ruthless, and brutal, but not by far to the extent of the atrocities committed by the Death Eaters. And as the story shows, the radical changes end up being tempered, and Harry/Hermione realise just where they are headed, and step down, before they start killing innocents for convenience or out of paranoia.

******** Kingsley accepted a Marriage Law and let it be enforced by the Ministry's Aurors. That's pretty much legalising and enforcing rape.

The fic shows each scene through the biased viewpoint of a character, with many of them being teenagers with PTSD blaming everyone they can for whatever bad happened to them. Draco thinks that Harry and co. had been abusing Felix Felicis all the time. Harry and Hermione blame Dumbledore (and rant at a stupid portrait) for all that went wrong in the war against Voldemort. The Tsar thinks that he has the sacred duty to preserve the pureblood way of life, and keep the filthy mudbloods oppressed. Augusta Longbottom thinks that should she try to preserve her own way of life she'll be killed. The Prime Minister thinks he can take control of the "rebellious province" now that they have been weakened. Percy thinks that the current "muggle culture good, wizard culture bad" view will soon change once the muggle laws meet magical reality and will be judged wanting because you can't simply transport muggle laws to Wizarding Britain.

Does't mean any of them is correct. Doesn't mean that all of them are wrong either. Other than those who think that muggleborns are worth less than purebloods and should be oppressed. Those are wrong.

And it's not muggleborns vs. purebloods - it's muggleborns, half-bloods and purebloods versus pureblood bigots. Krum is dragged into his own revolution in Bulgaria, which is not really split along the muggleborn/pureblood lines. The Prussians have a three-way civil war. Poles fight against Russians. The French have their own revolution, with the Delacours outmaneuvering the muggleborn leaders. Ron, Ginny, Neville and co. distinguish themselves in the war in Europe, with Ron arguably becoming the most famous war hero, outshining Harry and Hermione.

Even the pureblood aristocrats fighting for their right to oppress muggleborns have their good sides, with the Tsar making a difficult but ultimately noble choice at the end - in line with his views.

Draco hasn't any redeeming features, though.

** It would be very strange if all purebloods were the same, and had the same ideology. I like fics that make the difference between a traditional ideology and the blood purity ideology.\\
There's a good chance that those will overlap to a point since it stands to reason that purebloods are more likely to be traditionalists and also more likely to be blood purists.\\
Muggleborns, coming from a different culture, are more likely to be progressists.\\
It is only logical that you would find different factions between the purebloods and also between the muggleborns.\\
Actually, a political faction that promotes a traditionalist lifestyle and political stance while being willing to include the muggleborns to society makes a lot of sense. It seems like a classic moderate right political stance to me.
