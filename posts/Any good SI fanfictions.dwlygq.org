  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Gen/Friendship. First Year Complete.

** Linkffn(I Am Lord Voldemort?) SI in the character of LV. Set in the first wizarding war, the new Voldemort decides that trying to kill the child with mysterious prophecy powers seems like a stupid thing to do without knowing the specifics of the prophecy first so the miracle of Halloween 1981 doesn't happen and the war continues, with Lilly and Harry captured prisoners and drastic improvements in the effectiveness of the Death Eaters.

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  This started as a short story about how nerd weaponizes light. Now it is 'how quickly can we cover the entire Harry Potter series while adding progressively more technology and research into the mix.' Still a stupid story for the sake of stupid stories, though. Enjoy

But I would say it's a semi-Overpowered story... ^{I like OP stuff} you might still like it.

MC gets struck by lightning, ends up in front of Dumbledore in his office... his body becomes young, and he starts living in Hogwarts...set before the Marauders turn 11.
