Um, in many fanfictions of powerful Harry, Voldemort completely ignores the threat of Dumbledore and says that he is just an old fool and with his no-kill philosophy the Order of the Phoenix were never going to win.

I would safely like to disagree. Just look at the difference between the war in sixth year and seventh year and how decisive the latter was. All was just because of the presence of one man- Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. His mere presence made Voldemort afraid to take on the Ministry Or attack Hogwarts.


** Is this a prompt or a rant? You might be using the wrong flair, in any case.

** Ok, I know that this is unrelated, but your title immediately had me picturing Farnsworth!Dumbledore "Good news, everyone! I've been cursed by a horcrux. Soon I'll finally die!"

** I'm allways confused by the "no-kill rule". I distinctly remember Harry being lectured by Order members about how he should really be using more lethal tactics.

*** I have also been confused. The no-kill rule is completely fanon.

Dumbledore's view of giving Draco Malfoy and Snape a second chance to redeem themselves is often mistaken as him refusing to use lethal means on Death Eaters in homes of redeeming them.

**** True enough, but it can be interpreted as such because there is no balance, no counterweight. No quote and no action where either Dumbledore or one of his allies actually played for keeps. I'm not even talking about killing here, but a few broken or vanished bones would do wonders.

In fanfiction, anything can happen. In non-AU fanfiction, anything not disproved by canon can happen. Since there is not a trace of anyone on "Dumbledore's side" being proactive or effective before the Battle of Hogwarts (or at least nothing noteworthy enough to be remembered - I might have forgotten something) then deriving the no-kill rule is perfectly valid response given what IS shown.

Add in the emphasis and condemnation of murder by Dumbledore during horcrux discussion, and the no-kill conclusion seems almost reasonable. (Nvm that killing=/=murder). It's by no means THE ONE AND ONLY TRUTH, but it didn't come from nothing.

***** But there is an explicit point where one of Dumbledore's allies advocates playing for keeps, when they tell Harry off for using expeliamus and not a lethal spells at the death eaters during the broomstick chase

****** After he's dead.

It's almost a plot point. "Dumbledore trusted Snape" the quote goes. It's the first time in the books his actions - or their lack - come under scurtiny.

** Dumbledore's precence, yes...

Unfortunately, this only extended to overt actions. If HP was a card game, then Dumbledore's special effect would have been "While this card is in play, the game can not be concluded. If any card were to be removed from play, you may sacrifice an ally card in its stead."

Sure, Dumbledore was a powerful wizard - he has feats for it.

Sure, he was pretty moral - though his opponts would have a lot to say about that.

Sure he made contributions to magic as a whole - uses of dragon blood amongst them.

But by the time canon rolls around, from a purely pragmatic point of view, he's a waste. He's an old man, holding at least 3 positions, and can't truly give them the attention they deserve, because there is simply too much to do. His work at Hogwarts, at the Ministry, in the international community... He's badly overextended at the best of times. And then canon starts and with it comes a crisis after a crisis.

In Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone) he can be called away from the castle, being absent from place where he is suddenly needed.

In Chamber of Secrets, he falls behind on his work in the Ministry, allowing Lucius Malfoy's plans to progress and Hagrid, unquestionably one of Dumbledore's, who trusts him, is whisked away to Azkaban.

Third year is pretty much the same - instead of aurors or protective enchantments, Hogwarts plays host to Dementors,soul-sucking monsters the very presence of which is a threat to students in his care. And yet, even when they prove uncontrollable and thus an active threat, all Dumbledore can manage is restricting their patrol routes slightly... And even that can't be enforced.

In Goblet of Fire, once again there are issues, but there are so many essays and stories exploring those, I do not feel a pressing need to elaborate. It does however provide a critical point - Cornelious Fudge, the Minister, being outright hostile to Dumbledore and not even listening to his words.

Fifth year brings about the consequences of those events - the ministry all but usurping Hogwarts and sending Dumbledore running. Blood quills being used on students he was supposed to be protecting. Finally, the lack of communication and the Department of Mysteries fiasco.

Sixth year is comparatively tame in comparison, with just the Death Eater invasion of Hogwarts, but it's the one that proves my point the best. After all, that is the moment Dumbledore dies... And it all goes down the crapper.

â€‹

Why is that so significant? Was it malice? Arrogance? Incompetence? It's all irrelevant. Albus Dumbledore was a great wizard, an accomplished scholar and a good conversationist, but he was not Atlas the Titan. He ws not meant to hold the weight of the world on his aged shoulders.

He had almost 17 years, counting from Godric's Hollow Miracle to his death to fix the situation. He knew, without a doubt, that he would be needed. Thus, he had years to cultivate successors for at least a few of his positions. He had decades to vet and train someone to lead the Order of the Phoenix. He had years to arrange for someone to fill his spot in case of an emergency. Being a Headmaster of Hogwarts allowed him an unique opportunity to network and find young talented people who could benefit from his guidance and mentorship and help ease his strain in turn.

He didn't. Albus Dumbledore, deservedly beloved by all, continued to hold onto his burdens and respnsibilities until the day he died. He dies as he lived, a Messiah of Wizarding Britain. And in his passing, he left a black, gaping, ravenous hole that sucked up all the morale. Without their pillars, all the mighty edifices he had raised crumbled. His passing became the crack in the dam which, left un-repaired, caused the dam to fail.

Was he senile? I do not know. But in the depths of his sacrifice, he was certainly a fool.

**** It was supposed to be. If I wanted to bash him, I'd have taken a different approach. Here, however, I wanted to avoid the knee-jerk reaction of defending a bashed character, so I pointed out what I thought significant and let people make their minds :D
