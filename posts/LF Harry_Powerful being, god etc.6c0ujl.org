Not sure why I enjoy this so much but I need more.

Some good examples are linkffn(Awaken Sleeper), linkffn(Hell Eyes) this one is iffy cause it's not actually the main pairing but it's hinted at and linkffn(Fair Lady)

  A strange child has become interested in an even stranger lady. She comes and goes as she pleases, but his fondness for her always stays the same. He may be scrawny, but he would get her attention.

  For years Harrison Potter has been in a mental institution living dreams of magic, wizards, and dark lords. Eventually the dreamer has to awaken. His reality has to be accepted as fantasy. Although some things stay the same... Dresden Files xover.

** All stories are either completed or the sequels are WIPs. They all have Harry as a Powerful Godlike being by the end of the story.

linkffn(Child of the Storm) has Harry as the child of Thor from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's finished and the sequel is in progress. Crossovers with the MCU, Marvel Comics in general, DC Comics (The big three mostly), Dresden Files, Constantine, (minor) Stargate etc.

linkffn(Stories of the Lone Traveler) is the first book in a very long series where Harry visits other realities, not just HP realities either. He steadily becomes more powerful. Crossovers with The West Wing, Joan of Arcadia, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, NCIS, maybe a few more I've forgotten about.

linkffn(Potter's Protector) is the first book in a 4 book series. Xander from Buffy the Vampire Slayer is summoned to Hogwarts and begins to mentor Harry. Harry eventually becomes Godlike. Crossovers with Buffy, X-Men/Marvel Comics (in the second book), Smallville/DC Comics (in the third book), and Buffy in the fourth book.

  The spirit of Hogwarts believes that Harry has suffered enough in his eleven years of life and calls in a protector to guide and care for him. Not slash, rating for violence in later chapters.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

*** Perhaps you misinterpreted my request. I'm looking for stories with romance between Harry and a powerful female being or god.
