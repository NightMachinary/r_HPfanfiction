I've been lurking in the crossover section of ff.net and the search option for some new fics. I haven't found fics that tickled my fancy. Therefore, I thought that maybe there are crossovers that were not tagged or properly categorized.

So, what are some crossovers that weren't properly tagged or categorized as crossovers?


** The Denarian Trilogy is marked as just HP, despite it being an obvious HP/Dresden Crossover.

*** Ah the Denarian series. Too bad it hasn't updated the last installment. I've read that a couple of years ago. It was a fun read, but the way Shezza characterized Potter gets old really fast. I've read Surranin's Abjuration and I loved that. I've also read Linkffn(Magician by Wisetomato). I liked how Potter was characterized there, and I think his animagus transformation in Magician was unique for me ala I haven't seen that non-magical animal in any fic.
