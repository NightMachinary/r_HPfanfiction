  He didn't know what was worse. That he'd been shot and was bleeding out or that he had been shot and was bleeding out as a result of a toilet paper raid. Shot for a roll of single-ply bog roll.

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

#+begin_quote
  Seven years after defeating Voldemort, Harry Potter has been raising his godson, Teddy Lupin with the help of Teddy's grandmother, Andromeda Tonks. What will happen when Fawkes the Phoenix pulls this happy, war-weary family back in time for a chance at a better future. Set before the breakout from Azkaban in OOTP. No paradox.*What We Lost* is the sister fic without time-travel.

  Harry Potter realized from a young age that he was different. He could make things move without touching them, he could make his hair grow back when his aunt cut it too short, and he could talk to snakes. The Dursleys would always hurt Harry whenever he made strange things happen. Until one day, when everything changed.BOOK ONE - COMPLETECURRENTLY BEING EDITED
