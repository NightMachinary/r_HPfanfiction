I always thought hat Grindelwald was, dare I say it, more dangerous than Voldemort. Not more powerful, mind you, but more /dangerous./

Over 100k+ words, no romance.


** I definitely agree when saying Grindelwald was more dangerous.

While Voldemort might have been an awesome public speaker before he went snake face and a certified badass, looking like your daddy fucked a snake won't win you points in the political arena. And the stereotypical "I'm the biggest badass on the block" syndrome (BBB Syndrome) seems to be rather evident as well. Voldemort couldn't take over Britain in a decade, while Grindelwald (probably) took over a majority of Europe during his war(1920s? or 1930s? to 1945). Rowling stated that he was the wizarding equivalent to Hitler, so we can infer that he likely made similar territorial conquests during the height of his power.

Grindelwald seems like a saner and more logical person whose goals included more than just forwarding himself(The Greater Good).

*** Grindelwald was much more dangerous. We are talking about a dude it took Dumbledore in his prime, after at least a decade at the top of the ladder, to even defeat. Dumbledore couldn't kill Grindelwald. Sure people claim oh he couldn't due to love, but that's not clear. It is clear that their duel is stated in multiple sources as the most magnificent duel of all time.

Let us look at Voldemort. Not only did he never conquer Britain, he couldn't kill a group of four fresh out of school kids who didn't understand war, until a traitor let him into their home at the dead of night. I can't help but thing that Grindelwald would have said fuck it, fiendfyre the whole fucking village, and AK anyone who runs out.

Comparing Grindelwald and Voldemort is like comparing Hitler, to the leader of the IRS.

Sure Voldemort could do some massive damage... but he never shaped the world of wizardry. He may have been the "Darkest Wizard of the age" but that was because Grindelwald never stepped foot onto british soil after leaving.

***** Hell no. Fidelius doesnt STOP magic. it stops knowledge of precise location. Its like building a secret room in your home. Its safe because people dont know it exists. However, if you burn the house down, the room isnt gonna be there later. And If the world is burning around you, as Fiendfyre assumes, are you going to stick inside or nah? Keep in mind how dangerous Fiendfyre is, and tell me with a straight face that you will stay inside your house, knowing that it destroys anything it touches.

I honestly don't think Voldemort would use it in this situation because he would "want to be sure" that the Potters were dead. Never mind the fact that it was a guaranteed way of getting the job done anyway.

** I can only vaguely remember a few, and they were either abandoned, complete shit, or abandoned and complete shit.

I also vaguely remember a story where Harry had a grand-uncle on the Evans' side of the family who was a Grindelwald supporter and trained Harry pre-Hogwarts. Don't remember if it was abandoned or if I got bored of it, though.

Push comes to shove, put your parameters into the HP Fanfiction.net section and further sort it by favourites and/or reviews. They most likely won't be the best on the site, but it's a start.

  Harry rather complicates his life and unwittingly gets revenge on his relatives when he sends out a letter addressed to "A Blood Relative Who Isn't Petunia or Dudley" and a former follower of Grindelwald who'd just gotten out of prison and was looking for a place to stay receives it.

  The war is much larger, far longer, and much deeper than they could have imagined: fought on a scale that baffles the limits of human understanding. In such a world, perhaps it isn't surprising when Hermione Granger is sent back in time to rescue Tom Riddle's very soul before he has the chance to destroy it. Rated M

#+begin_quote
  In the village of Godric's Hollow, the Dumbledore family is falling apart. Kendra Dumbledore is dead, and Albus is the unwilling guardian to his wayward brother Aberforth, and Ariana, their mad sister in the attic. But everything changes with the arrival of Gellert Grindelwald, violently charming juvenile delinquent with an obsession for the fabled Deathly Hallows.
#+end_quote

I sadly haven't run across anything that fits your conditions perfectly (100,000 words and no romance). Let Perpetual Light has only the barest hint of 'romance' however and though technically not Grindelwald focused he does feature heavily. It's definitely worth reading, I personally love the way the author characterised Grindelwald. Hopefully as more Fantastic Beasts movies come out there will be more Grindelwald focused fics.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
