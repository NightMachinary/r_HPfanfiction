First off, it's not tumblr or anything like that. This was it's own independent website dedicated to Hermione Granger stories found from around the web. I don't remember a whole lot about it, but at the top there was a cartoon drawing of her reading a book and holding her wand, and i think the primary color of site was a yellow background. Sound familiar to anyone?
