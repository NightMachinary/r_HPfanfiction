Looking for a fic where Harry has kids and is married, but joins Voldemort to protect them.


** He isn't married or has kids but Double Agent (on mobile so no link) has him joining Voldemort to protect his family.

** I'm currently working on a 'Harry joins voldemort to protect his friends' fic.

The old incomplete version is under my name on fanfiction.net if you want to see if you'd be interested in it.

It may be awhile as I'm writing the entire fic before posting it. I'm on chapter 8 of 18 (but writing like two chapters a month woo motivation).
