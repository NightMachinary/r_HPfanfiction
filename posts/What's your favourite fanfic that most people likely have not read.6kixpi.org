What's your favourite fanfic that's not well-known, or at least, not as well known as the Book of Albus, Harry Crow, The Meaning of One etc?


** Linkao3(mischief revived). I just like the writing, I love time travel fics, it's an unusual pairing that I really enjoyed, and I don't mind Weasley and Dumbledore bashing. Ok, warnings delivered.

Linkao3(future's past by darkseraphina). Again, time travel, unusual (actually, unheard of) pairing, good writing.

Linkao3(you're a wizard harry by shedoc). post-series, Harry lost his magic and was exiled to the muggle world. EWE

Linkao3(it might be magic by ProfessorFrankly). Harry Potter/James Bond (Skyfall era) crossover. Slash

Linkao3(When September Comes by auntbijou) Short outsider POV at King's Cross

Linkffn(seeing ghosts by story please) Post-war story. Also somewhat outsider POV (at the beginning, at least)

  Her godfather is dead. So is Tom Riddle, which appears to be the only thing anyone else cares about. Oh, and getting ahold of her, her money, and her titles. Fuck that noise. Ianthe learned how to Maraud from the best, and she doesn't intend to take this lying down.She intends to change a single moment in time - and change the life of her godfather, herself, and the whole of Magical Britain. That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder. Especially when the lives she changed to save the future collide with the one she now lives, thirty years in the past.

** How may people stopped reading at 'favourite fanfic'? I think thread has /more/ popular fics than the average.

Anyway, going down my favourites list, and taking fics with less than 1000 faves:

- linkffn(Blood Crest) - the only canon-compliant portrayal of necromancy I've found

- linkffn(Just Another Orphan) - excellent Slytherin!Harry.

- linkffn(The White Pawn)

- linkffn(Tamblin Demosthene and the Harlequin Accord)

- linkffn(Proud by Summer Leigh Wind)

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1]]

Oh, and if you're talking about shorter stories, there's a fair few that are a bit more obscure.

linkffn(The Wendell That Wasn't)

That one is ludicrous but hilarious. And Ginny is a terrible name-giver to innocent babies.

linkffn(11152139)

I love this one--it is a rare author who is able to capture Luna's quirkiness so precisely.

** Not sure what my favourites are, but I'll share a few recs. Linkffn(10129276) its clever and turns canon on its head. Linkffn(12157282) Not sure what to say except I found it recently and ended up reading what was written twice. It's an interesting story.

Linkffn(7287278) Okay this one is actually fairly well known but it's also quite a unique story and well worth the read if you've skipped over it before.

#+begin_quote
  Long ago the Forests of Valbonë were closed to wizards and all were forbidden to set foot within them. So when, at the end of his second year, Harry becomes disenchanted with his life at Hogwarts, where else could he and his unlikely band of cohorts want to go? Join Harry on a trip into the unknown, where the only certainty is that he has absolutely no idea what he's doing.

Unaware of this, and eager to learn to use two wands, Albus enters third year. But if he suddenly can't use even the simplest spells, how will he fight the Sandblood Rising? COMPLETE!

** Hmm ... well, I'm not sure about this but I think I haven't seen the “Simplicity is Good” (linkffn(9742684)) series recommended much. By the way, all the works in it begin with “Simplicity is” so the rest can easily be found on the author's profile; as such I am not linking all of them.

Then, I don't see “Hell Eyes” (linkffn(2686394)) recommended a lot either; I've seen it once or twice and linked it a few times which is kind of not much.

The next is “Six Years, Six Applicants” (linkffn(4772789)) with some delicious Snape humour.

Since we are doing random weird humour stuff now, the next one is “Dolores' Angels” (linkffn(5911225)), and it describes ... hmm, an alternate showdown between DA and Dolores Umbridge, I guess is a fine way of putting it.

For something more adventurey, I give you “Portus” (linkffn(6120841)). For all its faults it's a fairly enjoyable one-shot, I think.

I'll end with “The Elite” (linkffn(5190766)), a story about ... hmm, acquaintanceship of Harry and Draco, I guess. It's fairly enjoyable, I say.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome)

Hands down one of my favorite AU's /ever/ in fanfiction. I normally hate OCs with a passion, but I genuinely liked Hollygalleon (the sassy personification of Harry's phoenix-feather wand).

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret. In the meantime, Chief-wizard Malfoy has his eyes set on Hogwarts, and only Sir Albus stands in his way.

#+begin_quote
  Transcribed from back cover of book:  Professor Cuthbert Binns (living: 1865-1963, haunting: 1963- ) is the leading Magical Historian of his day. He has published widely on topics ranging from, 'The origins of magic in native rock art,' to 'Wizard-Muggle relations through the ages', and was awarded an Order of Merlin (second class) in 1936, when his seminal work, 'A History of the magical world in 100,000 pages' became the best-selling Historical text on record.  This volume, however, is - for the first time - autobiographical in nature. It is thus also somewhat experimental in nature, but serves to remind both the author and the reader that we each build the fabric of History, in our own ways, however small.  Author: C. Binns. Dictation: Gluey the House elf.Production: A.P.W.B. Dumbledore, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,Published, 1964; Revised, 1991.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

Harry is a proper assassin of war, similar to a Deadpool-type personality. Ends up traveling to an alternate universe accidentally with Bellatrix where his parents are alive but he's married to Bellatrix and he's a Death Eater.

Only 60k written, and really sporadic updates, but it's a true gem.

  The War ended when Harry finally killed the Dark Lord. His reward? A cosy cell in Azkaban next to Bellatrix Lestrange. But a pact is made & during an escape, an accident puts them in another universe. Realising violence is the modus of survival, Harry fights to find his way in a world where enemies lurk in the shadows, trust is a scarce commodity & Death is just a heartbeat away...

** linkao3(The Many Faces of Harry Potter) is so funny and felt like an original way for Harry to become invested in himself. Harry attends an interdimensional meeting with other versions of himself and finds himself learning and growing through their interactions. The tags are a little silly and it is a WIP, but what's there is like nothing I've come across before.

linkffn(The Roots of This Tree) is so fucked up. It's currently updating and the story is tagged as a romance, but so far there hasn't been any romance. Fics that are genuinely scary are far and few between, but this fic captures the essence and tension of horror so well.

  “Welcome to the first Interdimensional Harry Potter Meeting!” Harry wakes to find himself surrounded by seven other, very different Harry Potters. He's about to learn more about himself than he ever wanted to know. Premise: I've read many stories in which Harry's life takes a turn at some point along the way and he becomes a completely different kind of person. This story explores several of those while focusing on Harry as he was in canon at the culmination of the 1st book. What if JK's Harry Potter were to discover prior to 2nd year exactly what his own potential could truly be? What if he had found unconditional acceptance and support to guide him on paths he'd never imagined? What if, at the tender age of 12, he had discovered unrestricted access to a deep well of information Dumbledore had never meant for him to have? I give you The Harry Potter Self-Help Group...WARNING: This is a Work In Progress. It is not finished, nor may it ever be finished. It is presently at around 35,000 words. I will post what I have written and add more if/when I write it. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.

First two,are Sherlock crossovers with Harry/Mycroft (you won't know how much you need it, until you read it). Magnificent has a very interesting take on the "minor government position".

The last one is a one-shot, that has a Harry as a Morriarty of the wizarding world. Not a crossover.

  This is a sequel for Magnificent by Esama (which has sadly disappeared from the internet due to reasons (but I suspect tolls and flamers and copycats, however recently I learned that she is trying to publish her stories and that is so cool).

After a devastating accident that took his parents away from him, young Scorpius took Harry Potter's offer and became the successor. However, it wasnt as smooth or as happy as he was expecting.

** linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10384704/1/Black-Serendipity]])

Stephen King's novella "Apt Pupil" rewritten with HP characters. One of the most unlikely, but also one of the most brilliant, mash-ups I've ever seen. A lot of "Apt Pupil" scenes are re-written almost word for word, which some readers may consider lazy, but make no mistake - this one is extremely original, well thought-out, and chock-full of great references.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10049798/1/Pardon-My-French]])

If you're looking for something lighter, it doesn't get much zanier than this one. Harry makes a bit of a mistake with Fleur... and his problems only get worse from there. This one is worth it for the author's depiction of Percy alone, but the whole thing is great. Sadly, the author never finished it and doesn't intend to do so.

**** Well, if Stephen King were to discover the existence of this particular fic, he might take umbrage. Or he might be impressed and flattered. I like it, personally, but then again, it's not based off of anything I wrote.

Ever since I discovered the fic, part of me's half-expected it to vanish from the site any day now. But it's still there after three years... if it were more popular than it is, things might be different, but I think it's largely flown under the radar...

** I personally really enjoyed linkffn(7452425) as everyone on the sub Reddit probably already knows since I link this story all the time, but it's under 400 favorites, so I figure that counts as not well known, or everyone else didn't like it as much as I did, but it's a wonderful Harry/Luna pairing with an interesting take on polyjuice potion.

** I'm a huge fan of non-slash Severus/Harry stories where Severus becomes a guardian or father figure for Harry.

linkffn(Moment of Impact by Suite Sambo)

My absolute favourite is a 5 parter called Moment of Impact by Suite Sambo. Starts from after Harry's 5th year. There's 4 sequels to it (hence the 5-parter), each one almost as long as a book. It's one of those AUs where they try to keep to canon as much as possible. The writing is amazing, sometimes I feel like JK could have written it. It's made me laugh and its made me cry plenty of times. Will always be my favourite HP fanfic (or any kind of fanfic) of all <3

Another one that I enjoyed is linkffn(Reading the Signs by goldencompass). It has a sequel to called Filling The Void.

Another one that I've read is linkffn(Somewhere I Belong by shadowarwen). Has a sequel as well. Been awhile since I've read it but having read it and the sequel too I believe I enjoyed it too :)
