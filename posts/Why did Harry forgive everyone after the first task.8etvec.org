** What on earth are you talking about? His house loved that he was champion, and supported him to death. They threw a party in the common room after he was selected. The creevey brothers tried to make their own badges supporting Harry. Fred and George nicked food to throw another party after the first task. Gryffindor had Harry's back, even if the rest of the school didn't. The idea that Gryffindor voted to almost "expel him from the tower" is purely fanon.

The only person Harry forgave was Ron, his best friend. A best friend that just 6 months prior, put himself between Harry, and what he thought to be a mass murderer, and said, "You'll have to go through me." Oh and yeah, his leg was shattered at the time.

Don't fall for fanon. Take some time, re-read the books.
