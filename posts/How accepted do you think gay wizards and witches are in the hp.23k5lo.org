Ive had an idea for a story in my head all day, and then i hit a wall with it. My problem is that i dont really know what the attitudes towards gay people in hp universe are and would like to get some opinions from readers and writers.

My thought points for wizarding society are:

- hp is set in the 90s Britain
- religion doesn't play a big part in wizard morality, thus no 'god hates fags' rhetoric
- harry was brought up in the Muggle world with the Dursley who are traditional if not right wing
- there are no out characters in the books
- the majority of character are teenagers and in thoery could be open to experimenting
- the ministrys main concern politically is protecting the secret of magic

I'm also interested In how you would perceive certain characters reactions when confronted with a gay character.

Also in my story Ron is targeted by a particularly aggressive and political adept OC looking for a way into Harrys friendship circle. how in canon would this affect Harrys and hermoines relationship to Ron, if Ron was seduced. But this is secondary to my other questions.

Fics where these issues are dealt with in depth are very welcome!

(Its very late here so I hope that made sense)


** I think that it wouldn't be accepted solely for the purpose that the pure blood lords have to continue their line or if the are muggle born, start their line towards becoming pure bloods. Homosexuality just would not fly because of the prejudice. If the magical world is as prejudiced as they are against half bloods (for example werewolves) and muggle borns, they would be equally as prejudiced against homosexuals

*** But that's assuming they have the same moral guidelines as the Muggle world. The main complaint against homosexuality is that religion has declared it a sin against the sacred act of marriage. In the wizarding world, Purebloods put more emphasis on blood line rather than the concept of family (see Gaunts and Blacks). Marriage isn't based on love, it's a political game. I could see them arranging marriages for the sole reason of producing the desired offspring. I highly doubt the Malfoys actually "love" each other, and the Lestranges also seemed to have a loveless marriage as well. What they do with their extra time is unimportant. They probably turn a blind eye to any sort of affair (including homosexuality) as long as they still bear proper children. I guess they technically wouldn't like it as much, but it would be a lesser crime in comparison to breeding (producing children) with "unclean" individuals...which would be the bigger problem in such a tiny community.

Also, those people are the "extremists" of their world, and they hardly make up for the majority of the wizarding population. For the most part, I always got the impression that other wizards were pretty lax. The only things that most people seemed to agree on was the statute of secrecy.

I think the reason werewolves are hated so much is that they are no longer purebloods (aka "not worthy), but they also have the terrifying ability to give another person that dreaded status.

**** I see. My understanding was that the homosexuality would be a more public affair rather than something that only occurred in the background. I could see that actually happening especially since JKR has stated that she always saw Dumbledore as a gay man. I just can't see homosexuality being public in the wizarding world.

** Oh wow, this is a really interesting discussion! I can't provide anything better than opinions, but I felt like jumping in anyway. There's certainly a lot of hints to people possibly being gay, but nothing outright in the story. Also, we don't hear much about Harry's everyday life, and it's likely that drama over minor characters got sacrificed for plot (we all knew that random kid who came out in high school - excellent gossip for a total of like three hours, but mostly insignificant unless it was more personal). Overall, I think the wizarding world would be pretty accepting, but extremist purebloods would probably hate it because it could endanger the bloodlines (although a lesser evil compared to marrying Muggles).

I personally feel like the trio would be very accepting. The only person I could see having a few issues is Ron (who is generally sensitive and might be afraid of uncomfortable confrontations). However, since your character IS Ron, this probably isn't an issue. Harry would be okay to an extent, but if Ron was seduced, Harry would probably catch on and try to stop it from happening. The big question is how would Ron act? He'd probably be very defensive and irrational that his friends are questioning his new choice of companion (even though they just don't like the person, not the fact that it's a guy). Ron might see Harry and Hermione's actions as a personal attack...once again, because he's sensitive.

If Ron and Hermione were in a romantic relationship, she would of course be crushed by his betrayal. I'm going to guess that they are just friends in your story, so I would say that Hermione would take it in much the same fashion that Harry would...although she would be more apt to "giving in" out of frustration. She would accept that the new person is part of the group, but I can see her making excuses to avoid being in the same company as this new person.

I'm of course assuming that Harry and Hermione don't like this person because you used the word 'seduced'.

Not part of your discussion, but my personal headcanon is that Albus Severus is gay...although I can't make up my mind whether I want to put him with Scorpius Malfoy or not. It's not that I'm against it, I just LOVE the idea of Scorpius and Rose Weasley together. The drama would be hilarious.

***** I think I read that JK Rowling said he wasn't gay in an interview. There's so little information on him in the books that he could easily be homosexual, but he could just as easily be heterosexual or asexual. I don't know if I would make a case for him as an example of sexual diversity with the lack of information and the interview stating otherwise.

** I love this question!

Alright, so I basically just have assumptions, and I also love what [[/u/silver_fire_lizard]] said, so I'm going to try to keep this a bit short (ha....yeah right).

Overall, I think that homosexuality would, generally, be accepted or at least acknowledged. I think t.hat most families would be accepting of gay children/loved ones, like the Weasleys, but there would be problems with Pureblood families. Either they could despise homosexuality, or they may take a Spartan approach. "Have your fun same-sex relationships as much as you want, but you better marry the opposite sex and procreate". So they may be accepting of homosexual relationships, but only if the individual still "does their duty", marries the opposite sex, and procreates.

This leads to, what I think could be, the larger problem. Gay marriage. Pre-war, I think gay marriage would be a huge no-no. You have these Pureblood families basically running the Ministry and they want Pureblood babies. Can't have Pureblood babies between two men or women. So they would never let pro-gay marriage bills pass. Post-war, however, is a different story. Voldemort is gone, people feel freer, but the wizarding population has been hit. I think gay marriage would be much more possible, especially since Kingsley seems quite awesome, but I think there may be restrictions or rules, such as obliging the partners to adopt orphans who lost their parents in the war. At least, I'm writing it that way in my marriage-law fic. So, basically, gay marriage would be more accepting post-war.

So, I think gay relationships would be accepted, but the couples would face the same problems as Muggles. Ron would definitely be worried about his family. Will his parents be disappointed? Will Fred and George make fun of him? (I think they would be very accepting). Will Percy be disgusted? Will Ginny be ashamed? All of these thoughts will fill his mind and he will have to confront these fears at some point.

I feel that Harry and Hermione would be very accepting. Harry is a very open individual who even managed to develop a slightly positive relationship with Draco at the end. Hermione is very loving and I think she would say "Oh Ron, we still love you no matter what." She would hug him and wish him the best. Unless they were in a relationship, then she might feel some pain and maybe even anger/guilt/self-hate depending on HOW he told her. I think that even the other Gryffindors would be accepting. Neville would be kind and open. Dean would probably be quite open. But Seamus may have difficulties. We've seen him have difficulties adapting to unique situations before, so he would definitely be taken aback and feel awkward. He might need some time to think about it.

On a side note: Luna would freakin' love it.

I think that Harry would have a tough time trying to protect Ron from the seducer. Ron may think Harry isn't accepting of his sexuality, so that could cause a major confrontation. Harry would have to find a way to protect Ron without offending or insulting him. And they are also very bull-headed. Hermione may have to play the neutral party or as a balancer, trying to explain to Ron that they don't care about his sexuality but they do care that he's being used.

I think that it would be fantastic to have a scene where Dumbledore provides lovely advice to Ron about his sexuality. He wouldn't come right out and say he's gay, but it would be hidden within the conversation.

Alright, I wasn't brief. I apologize. So, in general, the community might be quite accepting save Purebloods. Hermione and Harry will love Ron no matter what. And Ron will face the same problems as any other gay teenager, Wizard or Muggle: self-doubt, bullying, coming out, family reactions, etc. But he would be loved dearly regardless of his sexual preferences.

Sorry for the wall of text. I got excited. Tl; dr: I wrote it out, just please read it. Thanks.

** In terms of magical society? I'd say probably not that accepted at all. Think about it. The magical community is fucking /tiny/, and doesn't seem to be expanding anytime soon. One of the most reliable ways to produce more magical people is to have /already/ magical people reproduce. While it's never mentioned in the books, I just can't see a society actively accepting homosexuality, when they're already an incredibly tiny part of the general population, and in doing so would make it harder to increase that number.

For the trio? Meh, it's pretty hard to guess at. I can't see Hermione being hateful about it, and even Harry to some degree probably wouldn't care all that much. Ron? Eh, I dunno. I could see him having a problem with it. He's from a traditional family, from a society where (at least in my mind) homosexuality wouldn't be openly accepted. I can't see him taking it well.

It's an interesting idea since, although bigotry is a very central part of the plot and the key issue of the entire war, regular forms of discrimination are almost nonexistent.

The wizarding world is extremely gender-neutral, with many witches in high positions as well as wizards. As well as all sports teams being mixed gender.

Even racism is practically unheard of, With Blaise being a black kid in Slytherin house and Malfoy doesn't care as long as his mom is a pureblood.

So we don't know how they feel about sexuality nor can we really deduct that since their racism is more [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism][fantastic]].

Then again, it would be hilarious if all the purebloods found it perfectly normal while the muggleborns were the ones making a big deal out of it... Switch things around for once.

** This ended up /way/ longer than I intended, so *tl;dr*: write reactions to homosexuality in whatever way is best for your story. Sometimes homophobia is relevant to the plot, and sometimes it's not.

Because homosexuality isn't covered in the books, you've got the freedom to approach it in whatever manner you prefer--or rather, whichever manner works best for your story. I've written fic where I wrote the wizarding world as accepting because the gay relations of the characters weren't the main issue, and I had enough in the story without adding subplots of characters dealing with homophobia and the various difficulties associated with a teenager accepting their sexuality. But in a different story I have included homophobia because the characters dealing with their sexuality is a major theme, so I wrote things similiar to how I've experienced real world homophobia.

But overall? I tend to lean towards the idea of, as several others have mentioned, homosexuality being something that's acceptable only as an aside to marriage and producing children. That said, I do think it'd be a little more complicated than that and different among the various political sides. Families like the Blacks and Malfoy, I think, would take the view of: "You can bugger other men all you like, just do it behind closed doors, don't talk about it, and don't let anyone find out." I think that in the case of an arranged marriage where affairs are practically expected, having one with someone of the same sex would be less acceptable than having one with someone of the opposite sex.

With people like the Weasleys, I actually think it'd be more complex because I can't see them as the type to do arranged marriages. They're obviously very big on True Love^{TM} so the idea of having an affair, with anyone, would be frowned upon. I think they would be accepting of someone being queer, but within the family I do think they might react to a child's coming out with "Are you /sure/ you like the same sex? Maybe you just haven't found the right person yet" or "Perhaps it's just a phase" and similar type things. (Which, make no mistake, can be just as damaging as "You're not gay, I won't have any gay children in /my/ house!" type reactions.) I don't think there would be any outright nastiness or intended homophobia, but I do think the Weasleys, Molly in particular, might take some time accepting that one of them is gay, and possibly only do so after the gay person has snapped at them.

All of this, of course, is about the purebloods. Things are likely to be different for the Muggleborns (and half-bloods from more Muggle orientated backgrounds). I was only a kid in the 90s (and a particularly unperceptive one) so I don't recall general attitudes towards gay people then, only that it was never an issue in my own family. If you're aiming for realism, you may want to do some research into it and base Muggleborn attitudes on whatever your research reveals. Otherwise I would say just write them with the kind of attitudes that are prevalent today.

That said, I do think it'd be safe to say the Dursleys aren't going to be accepting. They hate everything that doesn't fit their tiny little world view and homosexuality is definitely going to be outside. With regards to how this affects Harry's opinions, specifically in reaction to Ron, I think it'd be kind of simple to be honest. Dursley=bad, Ron=good; Dursley=anti-gay, Ron=gay; thus gay=good.

Hermione could go either way, I think. She's clearly open minded about most things, but homosexuality can often be one of those things that seemingly rational people have issues with. It wouldn't be completely implausible to write her family as generally homophobic. Probably not "gays are evil and must die" type thing, but the kind that pretend it doesn't exist and if it happens in the family is a shameful secret to be hidden/ignored. With that attitude in reaction to Ron, I think it'd be along the lines of: "You're gay? Oh... I need to go think very long and hard about this and decide if what my parents taught me is right or should be ignored because homosexuality is no longer an abstract that I've never come face to face with." With her, I'd say write her reaction in whatever way is best for your story, and as other people have said her reaction will be influenced by whether there's any romance between her and Ron.

As to reactions within Hogwarts, that's again more complex because, as you said, teenagers can be more open to experimenting. Unfortunately they can also be more cruel. Those who come from unaccepting families are going to react with the same bullying you get in Muggle kids. Whatever route you take, there is always going to be at least one person who's homophobic, but whether that person shows up in your story to hassle the gay character depends on whether you want to write about the issue of homophobic bullying. Also keep in mind that homophobia doesn't always come in extreme terms of "you filthy faggot" and "I'm going to +beat you up+ hex you because you're gay"; sometimes it's just "I'm not changing in the same room as a gay person" and "I don't care if you're gay, just don't snog your boyfriend in front of me" (meanwhile the speaker ignores a straight couple snogging in the middle of the common room, so their issue clearly isn't public displays of affection).

On the teacher side of things, obviously there's going to be a rule somewhere that they're not supposed to judge students but that's also obviously not going to necessarily hold up. I'm pretty sure most of them won't react openly in anyway beyond, perhaps, some surprised blinking and mouth-gaping when they stumble across Ron snogging a boy in an abandoned classroom, but would then get a hold of themselves and take points and send them on their way as they would for a straight couple. (Then probably run off to the staff room to gossip, because I believe that's what teachers do.)

Exceptions to this rule will be Dumbledore--who probably already knows and smiles benignly, but comes down hard on anyone he catches bullying people for their sexuality--and Snape, if you write him as homophobic. While I don't think he would outright call a student faggot or anything, I do think he'd step up his general nastiness towards them. (If you disagree, consider that he never explicitly mentioned anything about Hermione's parentage, as far as I recall, but was generally horrible to her. Same goes for Neville; Snape probably knows about what happened to the Longbottoms, but he's never used it against Neville in class, despite the fact that he could be unbelievably cruel by saying something about Neville's intelligence being "as good as your brain-dead parents".)

As for the seduction issue... if the OC wants into Harry's circle of friends then (if he's competent) he's going to seduce Ron in a way that makes him seem friendly and great. He's going to endear himself to Harry and Hermione while doing the seduction, because his overall goal won't be achieved if he treats Ron (openly at least) in a way that Harry and Hermione don't like. Difficulties will come when Harry and Hermione realise that the OC is only using Ron and they try to convince him of it. Also consider whether Ron's relationship cuts into hanging out time with his mates, which may make them (Harry in particular) feel abandoned. In such an instance, when they try convincing Ron that the OC is using him, Ron's likely to react with "You're just jealous because I'm spending time with him instead of you!" and then there might be a falling out of GoF proportions, which may affect the OC's plan--he can't get close to Harry if Ron and Harry are no longer speaking.

Similar thing could happen if Hermione has feelings for Ron, falling out occurs, only this time based on "You're just jealous because you fancy me!" but such a falling out would be between Ron and Hermione, which wouldn't affect the OC's plan as much.
