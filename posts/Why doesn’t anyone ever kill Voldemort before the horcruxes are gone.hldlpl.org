I get that he would come back, but the ritual is complicated and would take time to plan again, especially if the Order took steps to prevent it from happening. It would be a lot easier to deal with incorporeal Voldemort or weak possession Voldemort than fully restored Voldemort, and would give them time to hunt down his followers and destroy the remaining horcruxes. IIRC, it took him a long time in canon to gain the strength to possess animals after he died, and he needed his human vessel to be willing (that could be fanon). It would also likely be demoralizing to his followers. Yeah, they know he'll return, but seeing Moody AK their boss would be a blow. Plus, most Death Eaters seem to serve out of fear, not true loyalty (as shown by the fact that many of them plead innocent and get in with their lives instead of continuing the cause after he dies the first time).

Just kill the dude whenever he returns and hunt the horcruxes while he's not a direct threat. Harry's connection to him will let him know when Voldemort is back and with Snape or imperioused death eater spies, they can just track him down and kill him again.

******** I could imagine him being stupid enough to not put a killswitch into his artificial body, but if he's captured he'd probably be creative enough to find a way out after a while.

My current idea I'm thinking about to trap him without detectable magic would be an airtight sealable room with a giant fuelless enchanted rocket engine strapped to the bottom. Once he's in, ignite the candle and accelerate up at 20 times normal gravity, pinning him to the floor. Escape velocity is reached in less than a minute, solar escape after five. After that, cut thrust and activate the self destruct on the engine. Now he's disoriented in zero gravity, probably nauseated and with some organ damage from the temporary high g. Already out of apparition range of any location on Earth, with no detectable anti apparition jinx. His flight trick seems to be limited to peak broomstick speed around 150 mph, so that won't bring him back. Engine is destroyed, so he can't use that either. Two options: Suicide and try to float back but risk having to haunt the void for eternity, or stay alive and try to find a way to turn the capsule around, but the longer that takes the further he gets away. After an hour he'd be beyond the moon. Arresto Momentum on the capsule would get it to return to Earth, but not without turning him into a red splat on the wall.

And yes I've gotten a lot of inspiration from The Expanse lately.

Having the prison having been built hundreds or thousands of years ago, with the soul intent of holding some ‘immortal' enemy, in relative comfort, a gilded cage, would explain why they don't just keep everyone there. Having Grindelwald ‘kill' that immortal enemy would explain why everyone agrees he's unfightable.

** Yeah but killing the dude is not easy lmao or they would have done so earlier. Even though he's evil he's really good at combat and maybe dumbledore is the only one capable of defeating him one to one. We don't see any situation where Voldemort gets ambushed do we? It's always him coming out of whatever hole he's hiding in.

I mean if you wanted to kill him then you can just use Snape honestly, when he apparates to DE meetings then like a bunch of aurors can side-along apparate with him and then ambush him. But the thing is Voldemort is damn powerful and that's why the majority of the population is scared of him plus aurors like moody know how many people have been killed by him, so they won't just ambush him cos that might lead to greater losses for them.

So many people don't understand his characterization despite it being spelled out and it makes the discourse surrounding some of Dumbledore and Harry's choices in HBP and DH annoying. What makes it so terribly confusing is that his hiding was a huge part of OotP and DH.

Remus in DH:

"Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it. However, that is the point: They whisper. ...Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear."

Could the good guys have been more proactive? Absolutely, but that wouldn't have taken them to Voldemort.

**** You are damn true and now that you point it out not only is Voldemort a intimidating duelist, powerful wizard but he's a master manipulator as it can be seen from what Remus says. He's selfish yes but he knows how to manipulate people, if not he wouldn't have amassed that many followers especially those stuck up pure blood types. Those are his greatest strengths.

The good guys could have been more proactive but the thing is I don't think the books really do a good job of showing Voldemort's true prowess, I mean if not don't you think dumbledore would have staged a ambush with ootp if he could be so easily bested? From what I can remember Voldemort does things only on his terms. Emphasis on the only. He's only gonna come out if he wants to come out, he isn't gonna be lured easily because he's self serving there's nothing he cares more than himself and killing Harry of course.

***** Usually, it's the wrong kind of gun though. I remember one where Harry tears through Death Eaters with a Webley, which might work in a surprise confrontation, but you generally want to do the job at range (meaning Sniper rifles) or through an ambush since in a set piece battle, wizards have a massive advantage due to apparation. You need to kill them before they can react, so no fancy A-10 gun runs or attack helicopters. Although there's an argument to be made for heavy or guided bombs dropped from high altitude.

With the cash to buy a crate of 38s, you could probably buy a T-55 or a self-propelled 57mm AA gun.

He probably saw the aftermath, but he didn't have any experiences cowering in bunkers while the world above burned. And neither V1 nor V2 were particularly effective, they were terror weapons which did little damage since they couldn't be aimed precisely.

****** Against the main gun of an A-10, uh... that would be a massive amount of energy at a high rate of fire. judging by the typical fanfiction standard of casting multiple shields quickly for each spell hit instead of holding a strong shield for longer, it's possible simply overwhelm the caster's shield and nail them before they can recast it, for anything that isn't powered directly from a rune network or Ley Line.

There are certainly other things that could be tried if the author was ballsy enough; Sulfur Mustard, Sarin or VX come to mind as even if the bubblehead charm was used, those agents will attack through the skin. Hell, Ricin, Thallium or Dimethyl Mercury poisoning could work, depending on the viability of the beozar to counteract those (or Snape's ability and willingness to properly diagnose and treat the poisoning).

Depending on what you believe alchemy to be capable of, you could also use mini-nukes or blow radium dust all over Moldyshorts.

There's a whole family of options in-between like the GAU-19 in 50BMG.

Another interesting option would be using recoilless rifles like the M40, it gives you access to 105mm ammo with barely any recoil and the back blast problem doesn't really matter in midair with proper formation flying (although if it happened to kill a character I didn't like...).

** The issue with killing Voldemort prior to his resurrection during Goblet of Fire is the fact that Harry is a Horcrux.

See, until Voldemort made the choice to use Harry's blood as part of his resurrection ritual, there was no way to kill Voldemort completely without killing Harry. So long as any of his Horcruxes exist, Voldemort has a tether that allows his specter to remain in the world, undying and effectively immortal until their destruction. And Harry is himself a Horcrux, meaning that to destroy Voldemort, one would have to destroy Harry as his life was tied to the Horcrux (much like Nagini's was when Voldemort made her a Horcrux post-resurrection).

However, Voldemort didn't realize Harry was a Horcrux (and Dumbledore himself only had strong suspicions, but no definitive proof until Chamber of Secrets when Harry is revealed a Parselmouth and proof of Voldemort's usage of Horcruxes was made clear). So, when Voldemort sought to find a way around that pesky "Protection of Love" that made any attack Voldemort made against Harry only result in his own destruction (see Halloween 1981 and 4 June 1992), he believed that since the magic protecting Harry was in his blood, if he used that blood as part of his resurrection ritual/potion, he'd count as part-Harry and thus be able to bypass the protection that kept him from attacking Harry and killing him. He was actually correct in this instance - using Harry's blood allowed him to physically touch and attack Harry without triggering the magic Lily placed on Harry with her sacrifice.

But what Voldemort didn't realize was that it also meant that within Voldemort was that very same magic that kept Harry safe. And so long as Voldemort's resurrected self lived, Lily's sacrifice would also live on. Any attempt Voldemort made to kill Harry would fail because Voldemort himself was sustaining the magic of Lily's sacrifice. Even if Voldemort could not attack Harry, he couldn't /kill/ Harry. Voldemort's own body would exist as a tether keeping Harry alive because his body housed a portion of the magic that protected Harry.

This is why Dumbledore looked triumphant when he learned that Voldemort used Harry's blood to resurrect himself. Until then, he had dreaded the fact that destroying Voldemort would also require Harry's death. But now that Voldemort had taken in part of Lily's sacrifice... Harry would no longer need to be destroyed in order to end Voldemort's threat once and for all. If Harry was attacked by Voldemort in the future, Lily's protection would still be in Voldemort, protecting Harry. So, any attempt to kill Harry would still kill Harry... but if Voldemort was still alive when Harry died, Voldemort's living body would act as a tether through Lily's sacrificial protection, keeping Harry alive. The only thing that would be destroyed should Harry die before Voldemort would be Voldemort's own Horcrux.

So, if Voldemort /doesn't/ use Harry's blood to resurrect himself in a new body, any endeavour to destroy Voldemort would be futile - you could kill off all the other Horcuxes and attack his weakened specter... but so long as Harry lived, so too would Voldemort. But when Voldemort used Harry's blood to fashion his new body, he inadvertently gave Harry a tether to life... a tether housed in the body of the second-most powerful wizard in 1990's Europe (after Dumbledore).

Otherwise... if you want to eliminate Voldemort for good, you're going to need to murder Harry Potter.

*** None of that explains why it wouldn't be better to kill Voldemort whenever you can, though. Sure, he'll keep coming back as long as the Harry horcrux exists. But that's no reason not to kill him off in the meantime. Dying is a huge setback for Voldemort. He's far more dangerous and powerful when corporeal. OP's point is that no one seems to bother trying to kill him, as they see no point since he's able to return, but in fact there is a point: it gives the good guys a huge advantage because it takes Voldemort years to come back. Nothing in your post refutes that.

Alternately, it's possible that Dumbledore didn't know Voldemort had made multiple other Horcruxes until later on, and by the time he'd cottoned onto that theory, he was already busy fighting Voldemort in a shadow-war circa OotP. Prior to that, Dumbledore might have assumed that the only Horcruxes Voldemort had were the Diary and Harry himself... And as has been mentioned, Dumbledore doesn't like the idea of killing Harry permanently to get rid of Voldemort.

Plus, there's also the prophecy to consider, one that Dumbledore is deeply convinced is true. He's under the impression that Harry must be responsible for killing Voldemort, so even if he does hunt the Horcruxes, destroying a Horcrux doesn't really stop Voldemort from coming back again and again. And Dumbledore believes that it's not his place to destroy Voldemort (even if he does come back), but Harry's... and Harry wasn't ready to do so until he was older and more skillful.

From the Doylist perspective, the author likely hadn't thought up the Horcrux plot-idea until later on, so it wasn't featured. Fanfic authors also have a tendency to stick to the canon plot and timeline (with some variances and the like) because it provides a conveninent framework to fall back on so they don't have to think too hard about working that stuff into their own plots.

From the Watsonian, it's possible Dumbledore wasn't aware of the other Horcruxes until later on, and until he had evidence of the contrary, believed Harry to be Voldemort's only remaining Horcrux... and it's not like Dumbledore is willing to murder Harry just to kill Voldemort's last Horcrux. That isn't his style.

** Doylish reason : Rowling needed Harry, the Hero of her story, to be the one doing the job. As said Hero is also a children/ teen throughout the story, it also means that all the adult must be useless in order to let him come and save the day. Also, since it is a "children book", you can't really put a scene like a very graphic description of Voldemort "death" after he ingered poison.

Watsonian reason : Trying to kill Voldemort is too hard, and too dangerous.Because of his talent, the only 2 people with a "true" chance to kill him are Dumbledore (in a duel), and Snape (with poison). But even then, their chances are not that great (does poison even work on Voldemort? And even when outmatched in a duel, he can probably still escape.), and in case of faillure, the Order would loose his only spy in the Death Eater side or his leader.Even worse, Dumbledore whole strategy was to destroy the Horcruxes without Voldemort knowing they learnt of their existence (since he would then hide the remaining one in places impossible to find), and having his body destroyed may lead him to check on them.\\
So Killing him is way too risky, and the rewards are not even worth the risks.

At that point, I figure he gets really worried as he then starts trying to figure out what the hell he's going to do about it since the fact Harry is a Parselmouth is a decent indicator to Dumbledore that Harry is, himself, an inadvertent Horcrux whose life provides Voldemort a tether to immortality...

It's not until the end of Goblet of Fire, when Harry's blood is used in the ritual to provide Voldemort a new body, that Dumbledore has an answer to his crisis - Voldemort's body has Lily's sacrificial protection running through it, giving Harry a tether to life. With that, Harry doesn't have to die (permanently) for Voldemort to be destroyed.

If Dumbledore was unaware that Voldemort had made more than one, assuming Harry was the only Horcrux until given other proof would explain why he didn't bother hunting the others down.

Various people in Wehrmacht tried to blow up Hitler at least half-dozen times, and some of their plans even involved a suicide bomber. They failed every time, despite Hitler being a squishy human without Shield Charms and teleportation abilities. Blowing up a tyrant is /hard/.

There's no canon indication that anti explosive spells exist. And most detonators work with a simple chemical reaction or a short electrical impulse. Any spell which would counter that would be a killing aura since it'd fuck body chemistry and your neurological network.

****** 1. Stauffenberg's attempt was only the last and the closest attempt. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assassination_attempts_on_Adolf_Hitler][There were more than a dozen, most involving an ambush with explosives.]] I repeat: assassinating even a squishy human tyrant is hard.
2. Large amounts of explosives take up a large amount of space and are harder to conceal.
3. There is no situation in canon in which an anti-explosion jinx would have been useful to anyone in Harry's presence, so in this case, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Given that they have spells like Flame-Freezing Charms, it's not particularly far fetched. Voldemort is a genius who grew up during World War II, so he would be well aware of what could be done with explosives, so he could just invent one. In any case, someone planning the assassination wouldn't know exactly what precautions he had taken.
4. Magical spells are not crude local alterations of laws of physics. They are perfectly capable of discriminating between biological processes and not. But, again, the point is that it's only one element on an already very long list of things that could go wrong to foil the ambush.

** linkffn(The Sniper by DobbyElfLord) has Harry take him out with a sniper rifle, but I don't think it addressed horcruxes (horcruxen?) at all.

He also whacks him with a sniper rifle in linkffn(No Thanks by old-crow). I don't remember if horcruxes were an issue in this one, either.

In linkffn(The British Reformation by kb0), snipers and bombs are used as backups to the main method Harry uses, which does take out the horcruxes.

In the series [[https://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/][Apprentice/Journeyman/Master Potter]] by Draco664, Voldemort is killed at least once before the horcruxes are dealt with. Actually, as the last story is incomplete, they haven't all been dealt with.

In linkffn(The Queen who fell to Earth by Bobmin356), Voldemort is trapped in a largely-unusable body that he can't leave without consequences.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4070610/33/Thrilling-Tales-of-the-Downright-Unusual][chapter 33]] of Thrilling Tales of the Downright Unusual by Clell65619, they sidestep the need to deal with the horcruxes by imprisoning Voldemort until the sun is a red giant and mankind is (on Earth, at least) extinct.

** You're right, it makes no sense and it has always bothered me too. That said, here's my best explanation:

Killing Voldemort for good requires that you know the exact number and exact locations of his horcruxes. If Voldemort realizes his horcrux secret is out, he will move his horcruxes and make more that no one knows about. Killing Voldemort once you've started collecting or destroying his horcruxes, but before they're all gone could alert him that you know of his horcruxes, because he might try to use one of them to return, and discover that it is missing or destroyed. At that point, he could return using one of the remaining horcruxes and then make several more you know nothing of and hide them away, ensuring he can always return.

They were in a unique position to defeat Voldemort because they knew how many he made and had a good idea of where they were hidden. Killing him early would reveal that his horcruxes were in danger and deprive the good guys of these two pieces of information.

** It's been a while since I've read the books but I think the only thing stopping voldemort from simply returning for so long was the fact that he couldn't find any human to possess. If he is killed again, his most fanatic and loyal followers would definitely go seeking for him and won't believe that he is actually dead. This would mean that he would be found sooner.

For the potion used for his revival, I don't think you would have to use Harry's blood and that would speed up the ritual although I don't think he Voldemort would be so pragmatic and would be adamant about using Harry's blood.Besides there is nothing that says Voldemort has to go back to Albania. For all anyone knows, he might end up somewhere nearby this time, like the Malfoy Manor.

There is also the fact that Voldemort is powerful enough that he can only really be defeated in a duel by Dumbledore and the fact that Voldemort prefers guerrilla tactics and would not show his face long enough for anyone to do anything against him in the first place.
