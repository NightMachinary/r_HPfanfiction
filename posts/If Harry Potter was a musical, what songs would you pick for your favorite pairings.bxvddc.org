Like, /Love Will Find A Way/ for well-written Lupin/Tonks.


** Lavender would so get an ABBA song

** It is a musical. [[https://youtu.be/CDx1TyuosJ8][A Very Potter Musical.]] I think all these songs are pretty much perfect.

In the sequel, Snape's ballad, There Will Always be Douchebags, is particularly beautiful.

** Well, Harry x LV will be this [[https://youtu.be/xmVzeriU5m0]] Become the beast by Karliene. It's haunting, beautiful and still sinister (the best about it is that it's not even romantic but rather trying to sway HP to LV's side.)

Or

Harry x Tom Riddle will be [[https://youtu.be/xjy_ls5fOPI]] I never knew I had a heart by Karliene. Which only fit a pre-LV or Diary Tom.
