I just suddenly have a strange craving for a competent (or at least lucky) Umbridge who during her year at Hogwarts, survives an average of two assassination attempts a day. Bombs in her office, curses from dim doorways, gift-wrapped voracious creatures, explosive whoopie cushions, slippery floors with spikes, hiring an atrociously bad singer...


** Wow. Sounds like fire with gasoline.

Honestly, that would be a pretty believable proof that Dumbledore in fact was training his own army. You send someone to watch them, those students retaliate with outright murder attempts.

**** Yeah, but frankly, its a step up from writing with blood quills to retaliating with explosives and Class XXXX creatures. And while Umbridge /is/ atrocious, we don't really know the extent of how she handled the majority of students. Lee is, as far as I am aware, the only one mentioned besides Harry to use a blood quill.

This solution is akin to the police used pistols, so the vigilantes use grenade launchers and flamethrowers. Escalation never really stops once you start.

I think you need a bit of perspective though. Remember 1st year? Where McGonagall sentenced a quartet of 1st years to go into the Forbidden Forest with only Hagrid and a boar hound? The reality is that Umbridge's treatment is only slightly outside the norm for how Hogwarts appears to have operated for the overwhelming majority of its history. It was only when Dumbledore took over that corporal punishment was banned, and that was only in the 1950s.

***** Corporal punishment wasn't outlawed in UK schools until 1967(?).

Even today, abuses of children and teenagers are covered up on a routine basis, for example [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Nassar][Larry Nassar]].

****** Nevertheless, there has been a marked cultural shift in what constitutes acceptable treatment of children in the 21st century. One single example of an abusive doctor in a private organisation can't be used as evidence that physical abuse is widespread in state-funded schools today.

...I mean, shock me with better evidence if you want/can, but I reject the apples to oranges comparison you made.

As for Hogwarts, I'm with [[/u/XeshTrill][u/XeshTrill]] on this one: punishment at Hogwarts is nuts.

******* Not that it changes your point that much since it is just a single data point, but Larry Nassar was employed by Michigan State University, a public school (in the American sense). The school's president and its athletic director both resigned. There were allegations that sexual assualts by athletes were routinely covered up.

Similar scandals happened at Pennsylvania State University with Jerry Sandusky, and at Baylor University. (Baylor is a private school).

********* Yeah, over the past few years there's been a lot of discussion and lawsuits about how universities handle sexual assualt accusations.

The Nasser and Sandusky cases fed into that, but actually dealt with public universities covering up for child molesters.

*** ...Now that WOULD be zany. When Umbridge survives multiple Harrys coming back through time to kill her (you know, Peggy Sue fics...they're probably after Voldemort but consider getting her a side benefit), she develops incredible kung-fu magic anti-temporal skills, which make her the only person able to take on the job when Super Phantomort from the far future comes to past to conquer the world.

** Is it a desire to see Umbridge prove to be a fearsome villain, or are you looking for new and interesting ways to abuse the witch, but in such a way as not to completely derail the plot of the 5th book?

I think it'd be worth collecting all the different tricks, traps, torments, and terminal solutions that fanfiction has devised for Dolores. After all, just killing her doesn't serve the desire for poetic justice that she seems to deserve.

But...would that mean Dolores succeeds in ousting Harry Potter & Dumbledore? Or would it give her a good outcome, like the opportunity to vanish to a deserted island with a ton of galleons and a few house elves to spend the next few years?

*** I wanted to defend Snape there for a second, but then the question came: What /did/ Snape do that was good, exactly? Spy for Dumbledore? We've never seen what the effects of that were, if any. Give Harry the Sword of Gryffindor? He would have gone to Hogwarts anyway, and found another way to destruct Horcruxes. Not to mention it probably wouldn't have evaded Harry to begin with if he hadn't stowed it away. This seems like a simple case of bad writing, certainly a wizard of Dumbledore's stature would have found some other way to leave Harry the sword. The same goes for the memory that let Harry know he should sacrifice himself.

Snape makes just as little sense as that incredibly useless, jealous and traiterous brat called Ron Weasley. Just two of the things Rowling royally messed up for which I'm glad fan fiction is there to correct.

Useless? Like, not willing to dive into a frozen pond to save Harry's life? Not willing to follow Harry in the Forbidden Forest to face his most dread fear, in a form ten times as large as he'd ever known? Didn't keep a spare wand stolen from the Snatchers in case it was needed when he finally could reunite with his friends?

Traitorous? As in he turned Harry over to the Death Eaters when the Snatchers captured him? As in not sticking with him when everyone thought Harry was the heir of Slytherin? Surely you must mean when he didn't follow Harry on a Thestral he couldn't see, to fly for hours until nearly frozen to its back, then fight alongside Harry when facing twice as many Death Eaters as their crew?

I think fanfiction may be doing you a disservice.
