I'm looking for Recs where an OC or SI dies and is reborn as Harry Potter, only to completely mess with the story! It would be better if the SI/OC was a huge fangirl of the HP Series and knew the plot back to front and back again. It can be any Ship, so I hope there's more than Google says there is...


** Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614626/1/Half-Blood-Emperor]]) one of the best fanfic i has read.

** Well, it's not an OC as Harry, it's Harry as Harry after reincarnating into a ton of different lives and finally ending up back in his original lifetime, but I think it fits the spirit of your request. Tom reincarnates with Harry and they mess with people and the timeline. It's Tomarry. The story just recently updated again; hopefully that's part of a pattern. linkao3(6614155)

  (aka 'how to survive endless rebirth with your so-called soulmate') Harry and Tom's souls are tied together. Which is why they're in this endless loop of rebirth. At some point, they stopped caring and just started fucking with people. (crack with a hint of seriousness, my specialty)

**** If this kind of story is something you're interested in, you should really check out linkffn(His Twenty-Eighth Life by Lomonaaeren).

It's a similar concept, but a bit more thought-out, imo. It's not complete, but is updated frequently.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
