Hoping someone out there can help me. I'm looking for a post- Deathly Hallows story that I read a few years ago.

I don't remember the full plot, but I do remember that Harry was fighting a former death eater right after, and that the final confrontation ended in the chamber of secrets or somewhere under Hogwarts, and for some reason the villain could create the illusion of multiple people. Does anyone know of this fanfic?
