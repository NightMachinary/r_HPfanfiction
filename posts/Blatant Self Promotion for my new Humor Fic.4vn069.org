Small extract from the story,

#+begin_quote
  "/Â§What is your name?Â§/"Harry quietly hissed at the snake. There was no reply. The snake only looked at him for a second before going back to what could Harry only assume was contemplating its existence.

  Curious, he turned to Scamander.

  "Is this snake yours?" he asked the man.

  "Butpleg? He's a medical snake. Belongs to the hospital. He does colonoscopies."

  "What!?" Harry's voice reached a new level of pitch.

  "You know . . ." Scamander said, oblivious to Harry's shock. "He goes in from the back door, sees what's in there, then we copy out his memories and see what's wrong and what we can do for the patient. He does a lot of animals. Mostly horse types though. Unicorns, Abraxans, Pegasi and the like."

*** Oh there's an entire joke planned for that. In my story, Harry tells every single person he meets a different name as an alias. I asked the subreddit for suggestions in that department. You can see the results here. [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/4v029w/need_an_alias_for_harry/]]

**** I understand. Still reading Harry as Dobby doesn't sound much of a fun. Because usually readers(or me) mentally create a picture whatever name the character is. Whenever I read the name Dobby, a certain creepy thing comes to mind, not a funny image for a humorous story. Finding several different names(as par the link you share above or by Googling) that's not used in canon aren't that hard. Dobby sounds creepy to me. I am sure, many other readers think similar too.

Edit: btw, I like the concept of the story, surely wait for new updates.

Edit 2: You could use Pokemon Go as Harry's alias ðŸ˜Š

****** I actually assumed that people would understand what sarcasm was without needing a /s. I mean, I look like a twelve year old because I made a joke and didn't put a '/s'? How does that make any sense? There's no need to be so passive-aggressive. I see it a lot by you, to be honest.

******* You look like a twelve year old because you acted like you didn't know what a word from the late nineteenth century and you use the word weeaboo in your name. Sure, mine is a stupid as fuck name using a number instead of at but this was originally a throwaway acocunt to reply to someone since i couldn't remember my old account and I wanted to let them know.

And perhaps I am. I'm also a 24-7 caregiver without pay for a grandparent with dementia. I'm living with more stress than most people save combatants.
