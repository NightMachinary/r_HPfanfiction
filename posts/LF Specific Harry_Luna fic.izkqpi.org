:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a specific Harry/Luna fic that a friend recommended a while ago. She sent me a few quotes to hook my interest and some plot parts. I was reading through old emails and came across the rec. I'm very interested in reading the fic! I don't however have the name.

It was Harry/Luna. BDSM ish with Luna on the top. She was part of a coven, and her father was dead. Hermione became Christian after her parents died and this was bad in the wizard of world. Snape was in a relationship with Charlie Weasley and taught Luna to use a paddle. Luna and Harry rode a motorcycle with cool helmets in France where they met a muggle photographer. Harry grows his hair to go to a masquerade ball and is given a mask to wear by the muggle photographer.

I expect it was on FanFiction.Net but haven't been able to locate it in any forays through the H/L tag.

Any thoughts on which fic this might be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)


** If you have actual quotes from the fic, have you tried putting them into Google to see if it can find them?

*** Thank you for the suggestion. I tried and didn't get very far but it was only sentence fragments that are direct quotes amid my friends plot summary.

** It's called an Unstoppable Force by Hecateslover.

Good luck finding it though as it doesn't show up on google, the original Author seems to have removed it.

*** Amazing - thank you! Just knowing the name is a good starting point. It was bugging me so much. I was beginning to think I'd misread the whole thing or was missing something obvious!
