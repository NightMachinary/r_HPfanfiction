So this bit of canon has always bothered me the most. Horcruxes are fine as far as I am concerned. But how did Harry become one?

We know that there is a deliberate act to it, otherwise a lot of murderers would be immortal.

A) Presumably, you murder someone and then put a piece of your soul somewhere.

B) Alternatively, you designate a vessel and then do the murdering.

C) Or the third option, you do some kind of "ritual" after the murder bit.

There was no object found at Godric's Hollow which would fit this description (Dumbledore would have mentioned it in HBP, and Hagrid would probably also have remarked upon Gryffindor's gold ingot if there was such a thing around.

So Voldemort shows up, determined to kill Harry. James is washed aside. Lily is given the chance to stand aside, refuses and also dies. That invokes the protection. Voldemort TRIES to kill Harry, but due to the protection, the spell backfires and destroys Voldemort's body. He flees as a wraith.

So how does a piece of Voldemort's soul ends up attached to Harry's forehead? Even if Voldemort already split his soul with the previous two murders, it takes a magical effort to remove that "shard" from the body and move it somewhere else. And even assuming that this piece of soul was freed by the destruction of the body, *why was it suddenly a "Harry-homing" device which could bypass the very protection which defeated its body 10 seconds ago?*

We know that Voldemort had to do with various small animals in Albania, and yet his accidental soul shard settles itself in a baby especially fortified against him? And not let's say a random rodent, fly or bacteria? I call bullshit.


** I don't think...it's not attached to his forehead.

  “You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be victim who had survived

/shrugs/ The protection appears to be a buffed up Shield Charm specific to Voldemort. The Shield Charm protects against magic and physical objects. The soul, to my understanding, is neither.

But why Harry? There were countless animals nearby, countless objects (and most Horcruxes are inanimate as far as we know).

****** “Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort's soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsing building..." -Deathly Hallows, The Prince's Tale

The soul cannot live without a vessel and I imagine it cannot go inside a non-living object without help. As such, it sought the closest living object: Harry.

** If you're talking about canonically, under normal circumstances there is a spell involving a ritual that is performed after the murder has been committed. Every time murder is committed, the act is so inherently evil that your soul fractures, and the process of making a horcrux involves a magical process that deliberately transfers one fragment to a physical object. JKR has hinted that it is disgusting so I've always inferred from context that it likely involves dismembering the body or perhaps cannibalism.

For the scarcrux in particular, it was caused by the instability of Voldemort's soul. He had made so many horcruxes that the remaining fragments were unstable. My understanding is that when his own killing curse rebounded, one of the remaining pieces of his soul (perhaps the fragment that had just broken off in the act of killing James and Lily?) flew into Harry.

I'm not sure why it couldn't have gone into an inanimate object, since horcruxes are traditionally objects rather than people. I suppose because Voldemort was not deliberately creating a horcrux using the ritual, the soul wasn't looking for an object but the usual vessel for souls - humans.

To answer one of your specific points, I don't think Lily's love would have protected baby Harry from a flying soul fragment. I sort of imagine the love magic is protecting him from imminent mortal peril, not permanently protecting him from anything having to do with Voldemort. It was such a freak accident, and a random shard of soul flying at a baby isn't the same thing as a killing curse. Just my two cents.

If anything, that makes canon even less satisfying. Especially if you think about the probability involved in the soul's trajectory overlapping with Harry. I mean, there's a point where tragedy becomes comedy because it is just too much to be believable. And the odds for all the events leading up to that encounter, Lily being there and Snape's desire for her ass. Add a ~1% probability on top of that for becoming a Horcrux, and being a serial lottery winner is suddenly a common thing.

** The story The Complicated Life of Harry Potter by kevin1984 discusses this. The plot had that Voldemort had already split his soul (remember he killed two people already). When the killing curse rebounded the wraith took off due to the other horcruxes. The sliver of soul in order to survive latched onto the only living thing in the vicinity - harry.

The story The Potter Attraction by Achilles has a similar explanation.

*** But why would it latch onto a living thing in the first place? Most Horcruxes are objects. And Harry was certainly not the only living thing in the vicinity. The Potters had a cat, there were countless birds and rodent around the house, nevermind thousands of insects and millions of bacteria.

**** But the soul is not an object it's a living thing and therefore would gravitate to another living thing (hence the ritual to place/force it into an object in order to create the horcrux). In terms of in the room if I remember Harry was the only living thing close by. If you then assume (yeah I know) that the soul only had a few seconds to survive before passing on there wasn't enough time for it to go looking.

Also remember the spells that were flying around and the explosion when the curse rebounded and unless the animals were trapped in the room it's doubtful there would be anywhere in the vicinity. Leaving Harry as the only possible "safe" place for that soul fragment.

In reality Harry isn't actually a true Horcrux as his body never underwent the preparation/spells. However, he was a living being that the soul could try to take over (via the wound that is his scar) it is his mother's protection that keeps the soul trapped in the scar. Of course the only way I can see his mother's protection not destroying that soul fragment is the scar tissue is not alive and her protection only works on Harry's living flesh.

And the biggest reason why the "soul fragment" works that way......the author wrote it that way.
