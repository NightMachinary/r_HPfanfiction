I'm not asking for a "star crossed lovers" that are "reunited from another life" Snilly fanffic. I'm asking if there's any fanfic where it depicts the consequences of this duo never having met. In fact, I definitely don't want a Lily/Snape fanfic, while I can enjoy Snape as a mentor or friend of Harry, I can't see him with Lily. Nor Lily with James either, cuz I do hate bullies. I mean, I loved Stages of Hope because Snape isn't a douche and he wears burgundy, Sirius isn't bigoted against Slytherins, and Lily ends up with Remus, which is someone, even if he's a fucker for never checking up on Harry because "Dumbledore said so" or because "he's a werewolf-tiny-violins", is a much more relatable character than James, in my opinion. There's very few James's in fanfic that I enjoy reading.

Wow, thats a big tangent. Sorry.

**** Yeah, that's along the lines of what I was thinking. The premise seems like a good way to bring that about. There would still probably be some rivalry between James and Snape. The effects on Snape would be interesting too. Would he still be interested in Lily? If not, I'm guessing that he would probably openly act like a blood purist sooner. That would probably make Lily unhappy and maybe not be as mad at James and the rest of the marauders.

I just didn't want to derail the whole thread as sometimes happens.

***** Its ok, it made a lot of sense what you talked about. And since James might not be such a bully towards Snape, due to his jealousy of Lily, Lily herself might be "persuaded" even before seventh year, when he "grew up".

****** No, not in real life, but in a literary way it is the closest you can get to show early tendencies. You claim that he only joined in his quest to seek acceptance and just dismiss the things written in the books that show him having those ideas early on. And Snape was never willing to give up on those ideas or his dark magic for Lily, he just was willing to deny using it in front of her. He was willing to say whatever she wanted to hear, but he didn't actual put that into reality. He kept using dark magic and he searched out other dark magic users and bigots.

And quiet frankly your assumption that the Marauders pushed him in that direction is an assumption. From the text we have, it could be that they started to focus on him after he showed himself as somebody that used dark magic and anti-muggle tendencies.

He has a problem with the word mudblood, because in his mind that was what made him lose Lily (not true because it was only the straw that broke the camel's back), but he never did anything about this way of thinking, he openly ridiculed Hermione, a very intelligent muggleborn and through that allowed his Slytherins to do the same and ignore the fact that she was worthwhile.

But being an accomplish in child murder or even attempted child murder his not forgivable. Never. And that is why he can never redeem himself and that is fine. That is the most interesting part about him.

The only reason Harry became the boy-who-lived in the first place is because Snape specifically asked Voldemort to spare Lily, which he didn't do in this story since he never cared about her. Voldemort giving her the chance to step aside enabled the sacrificial protection and Harry's survival. Without that, Voldemort would have killed her and Harry with no issues and continued undefeated. If Voldemort was never defeated, then there's no reason for Snape to even get caught or sent to Azkaban.

****** Well yes and no. I think magic works with intent and even if he hadn't "tried" to spare her she would still have offered to die for him without fighting back (as apparently it factors in the sacrifice aspect) and ultimately do so. Her intent would have been the same and I think that for that the result would have been the same if with less bargaining (everyone is not some strange doctor).

We clearly saw this when Harry sacrificed himself. He didn't beg for anyone's life but still it worked because for all intent and purpose he chose to sacrifice himself without a fight. I think it would have worked the same if Lily had just stood in front of Harry without saying anything but just accepting to die for her son (even not knowing it would give him a protection).

***** Well I don't totally agree with that. Magic is apparently a lot of intent and even if she wouldn't have had the chance to beg for Harry's life as long as she did she would still have stepped in his path and tried to ask for mercy anyway. Not the same situation but still a sacrifice (over for example fleeing to stay alive to avenge her family or just letting him do it or even fighting back (because apparently the fact that not fighting back is part of the sacrifice).

We clearly saw this when Harry sacrificed himself. He didn't beg for anyone's life but still it worked because for all intent and purpose he chose to sacrifice himself without a fight. I think it would have worked the same if Lily had just stood in front of Harry without saying anything but just accepting to die for her son (even not knowing it would give him a protection).

Her chance of choosing not to make the sacrifice doesn't need to be verbal but in her action in my opinion. As Harry could have chosen to fight or flee or sacrifice himself; Lily also would have had those choices anyway.

If we were to follow the idea that he didn't have a wand with him well he tried to fight anyway. Either way his mindset wasn't of just sacrificing himself for Harry and Lily but to hinder Voldemort for his family to flee. Again I think the intent and mindset is important in this. I don't deny that he maybe had no chance, he knew it and in a way it was a sacrifice but his idea wasn't to die hoping Voldemort would stop like Lily did, it was to slow him at the very least.
