This could also be taken as a prompt.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6870892?view_adult=true][The Colors of the World]] is a great FMA x HP fanfic that has Filtch fired and Umbridge arrested after OotP because of them willing to torture students. Are there any other fanfics where that happen?


** Most manipulative dumbledore fics have that happen because once you've read the first two chapters of one you've read them all
