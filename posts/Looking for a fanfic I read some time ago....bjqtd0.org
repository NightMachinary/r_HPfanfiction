I'm desperate....

The fanfic takes place after the summer. I think it was during his sixth year? Draco was raped by Voldemort. (A car was waiting for him when he ended his 5th? year) I remember that Voldemort had put a mark on him and that if people said a word/spell, Draco would be forced to listen to them. In one chapter, Ron says the formula out of curiosity and is forced to take care of Draco. There was also a scene where students tried to rape Draco. He was changed from house to Gryffindor too. And Severus said to Dumbledore that he had a friend with the same mark who commited suicide years ago.

The fanfic was well written and I would like to read it again, but I can not find it ...
