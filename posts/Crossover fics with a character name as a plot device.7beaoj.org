Hello! To clarify, I am looking for crossover fics where the author makes it so that characters from HP university are also the characters from another universe simply because they share a name. For example, Harry Potter becoming a kingsman agent named Harry Hart(have seen a few of those on ao3). Or Peter Pettigrew is Peter Parker(why not?). The only condition is being well written and believable. Will also take crossovers where hp character changes their name and becomes an existing character from another universe.

Thank you.

  Ruby Rose lived to be a Huntress, wanting to be just like her Mom, Summer Rose, however her last name wasn't always that of the one she saw as her mother, she was once known as Ruby Potter. The Wizarding World has no clue where their savior is, but a Death Eater decides the Goblet of Fire is the best way to bring her out of hiding. Ruby Rose is Fem! Harry.

*** That's ... not really it, though, I'm afraid. The request is about some character from another series being really a character from the Harry Potter series because they have the same name, the same as the character has in canon. Think stuff such as Ron being Ronald McDonald, or Voldemort being Tom Sawyer because they share the name Tom. As such, since Harry's canon name is Harry and not Rose, this ... doesn't really count.
