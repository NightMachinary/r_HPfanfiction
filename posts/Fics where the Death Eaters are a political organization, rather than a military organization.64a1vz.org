Looking for fics where the Death Eaters remained a political organization, not a band of psycho badasses who weren't badass enough to take over the country by force.


** Linkffn(the pureblood pretense) Riddle created the S.O.W. political party to advance pureblood ideals and won several strategic battles against Dumbledore's side before the start of the series, causing a drastic social schism in wizarding Britain. He never became Voldemort.

*** Fair warning, this is extremely long-winded.

**** While I can see where you are coming from, I personally find the story to be continually engaging. YMMV of course, but this series is my favorite fan fic so far.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.

**** Was this the one were the Death Eaters came to Hogwarts and introduced themselves, as well as the one where Harry's mother planned the massacre of the families of a bunch of Death Eaters?

If so, I loved that fic. A pity it was rather short.

***** Are Death Eater ideals (bigotry against muggleborns, etc) portrayed positively in this fic or do the DEs not believe in them at all?
