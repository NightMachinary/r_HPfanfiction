A wizard was asked by a king to create a way to become immortal, the wizard after studying many ancient tomes invented the Horcruxes, after some tests the wizard discovered that the process would create a piece of soul without protection against any kind of magic .

Then the wizard greedily created a ritual using the piece of soul to make the owner of Horcrux his slave.

After a while he came up with a bigger plan: why not spread the knowledge of how to make a Horcrux and let the Dark Lords present themselves to me as my slaves?


** Someone linked a fic with some of that here once. Can't remember what it was.

During the trial in fifth year, the Unspeakables show up, ask two questions and poof away to the veil. They do a quick ritual and banish all of voldemort into the veil. They made a statement that TL;DRs to "We spread this for Dark Wizard Bait".

Harry is kicked out of the house and travels to the magical world where he's confronted with the steady destruction of his reputation. The public should have realised Harry never stands idle when faced with injustice. - Set after fourth year

** This is actually a pretty common theme in fantasy stories wherein a wizard sticks their soul somewhere, if somebody gets ahold of it they can(depending on setting) if they know what to do with it do and make the wizard do just about anything with it.

I believe its inspired by a variation of the Koshei the deathless myth.
