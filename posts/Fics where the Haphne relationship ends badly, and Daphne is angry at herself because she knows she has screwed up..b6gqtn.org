What are pics that have the Haphne romance end up badly with a massive argument, that has Daphne become angry at herself for screwing up and strive to make it up to Harry for?

I am curious because I watched Crimes of Grindelwald a few days ago, and one of my favorite things about the movie was the Newt/Leta sub-plot.


** There's a good series where daphne is forced to fuck up in a massive way. Let me see if I can find it.

I've been fucking loving haphne lately and I can vouch for pretty much anything by James Spookie like the other redditor mentioned. The legacy preservation act was one of my favorites.

linkffn(8678295) this is it! I loved it could be just what you're looking for

To clarify: the issue was that the bot can only auto link stories from the original comment post. Since you EDITED the story link in secondarily, you have to manually call the bot back to re-check your links... which is what the command I commented did.

**** Yeah, Recommendations are for fics you want to share with people, Fic-Search if for a specific fic you forgot the name of and Request is for general requests based on a few tags, like Hapne TT or Raised by Tonks types of fics.

  Last Heirs of noble bloodlines are forced to marry in order to prevent wizards from becoming extinct thanks to a new law passed by the Ministry in order to distract the public from listening to Dumbledore's warnings of Voldemort's return. Rated M, so once again if you are easily offended, just don't read it.
