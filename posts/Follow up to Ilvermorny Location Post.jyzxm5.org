The original post is linked above but for my story,

I decided to build Ilvermorny in the Salmon-Challis National Forest in Idaho. I feel like it has a lot of geographical advantages, and I think it would be a great place to build a secret school of magic. In addition to the location, instead of a generic castle, I think Ilvermorny would be better built in the style of a college campus. It would look similar to the University of Virginia, which has 25000 students living on campus, so definitely enough to accommodate all of the US's magical children.

Thanks for all the comments and help!
