The four-part story by "mj2007" begins about 10 years after the battle of Hogwarts and concentrates around the Weasley family, especially around George and how he copes with Fred's death.

It's heartwarming, exciting, PG-rated (no smut, no gore, similar to the original series, I think), the characters are super relatable and it has loads of appearances from the original series, and totally redeems some of the old characters.

The series is called "We belong" and you can find it on fanfic.net

Here's the links to all of the parts:

PART 1 - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3840380/1/We-Belong]]

PART 2 -[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3868705/1/We-Belong-II-In-America]]

PART 3 - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3938487/1/We-Belong-III-Moving-On]]

PART 4 - [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4061916/1/We-Belong-IV-Growing-Forward]]

I am NOT the writer of this series, I just discovered by chance and was hooked instantly and have cone back to it over and over again, because it made me feel the same things the original series did.


** Thanks for the recommendation--I'm enjoying Part 1 so far!
