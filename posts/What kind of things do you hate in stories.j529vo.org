A few of mine are:

-Draco being physically abused by his father. Draco may have the feeling he has to be the perfect son but Lucius Malfoy does NOT lay a hand on his own son! Narcissa would kill him anyway if that would ever happen...

-Overused bashing reasons. I have no problem with the bashing. It can be amusing and in cases of Dumbledore a plot devises but it gets boring if Harry gets sorted into Slytherin and Ron is the first one to scream 'Dark Lord in the making!'. I mean come on! G get a bit more creative!

-Why would Dumbledore ever have to steal from Harry's faults? I believe after 150 years or so he got the facts on how to run his fault.

-Molly/Ginny/Ron and fucking love potions. How about to change it a bit and make them the victims? Like Ron was a victim of Lavender. Or one of the other Weasley was drugged. Like Percy is behaving weird during their second year, the trio and the wins want to find out and see some girl or boy slipping it into Percy's drink or how he gets abused by his "boy/girlfriend". That could be a good way to become friends with him and let him stay with his family.

-Does Percy always have to be the asshole? Why not the twins for a change. Their pranks could be changed into bullying (Slytherin first year's)and they get called out for that or something in the line.

-A/B/O. Why? Just WHY?! Who on this earth and any other planets or planes thought something like this was a great idea?!? From where did they even get that idea?

-Harem: there exist some who are good, even great but most are just not.

-Harry's personality changes completely but does not get a different wand. A child that's lazy and just wants to sleep all the time is not suited for a wand that is made for adventurers.

-Crabbe and Goyle don't seem to exist if Harry is sorted into Slytherin. They have absolutely no role or are not even mention in most of those stories.


** In no particular order, just as they come to me:

- The use of "Y/N", "FN/LN", or similar constructs in self-insert fics instead of, you know, /using an actual name./
- ABO and mpreg. If the rest of the fic's concept is /really/ compelling I can sort of gloss over it, but the mere presence of these tags is usually enough to make me seriously reconsider reading.
- Most bashing. Every now and then I get a hankering for a fic that bashes the fuck out of Dumbledore, but nowadays that's the only bashing I can stand, and only in small doses.
- Excessive typos, misspellings, poor grammar, etc. An error here and there is one thing, but when I'm seeing mistakes every other paragraph, it starts actively detracting from my experience.
- Wimpified Harry. This mostly shows up in slash fics, but it weirds me out a bit every time.
- Anything that rehashes the Department of Mysteries debacle.
- Dialogue that doesn't make at least a passing attempt to match the character's voice.

** Lot's of things, just to name a few:

-Muggle guns used in magical fights - this causes me to drop the fic almost every time.

-Over the top bashing.

-Friendly goblins - they are vindictive bastards.

-11 years old children speaking and behaving like skilled politicians.

-Inheritance tests - 10 random houses, random number of galleons preferably with a dozen of zeroes, countless of priceless books and artifacts that aren't really used in any meaningful way.

-Abandoned Harry in WBWL story - this doesn't make any sense most of the times.

-Stupid and cartoonishly evil Dumbledore.

-Fred and George twins talk - this is cringe af.

-Luna's omniscience.

-Dual wielding wands - it isn't really something unique. Custom made wands.

-M-preg and most of the slash fics no matter if m/m or f/f (I don't read m/m though). Slash fics have this problem that authors tend to make gays of everyone.

-Harem stories most of the times.

-I also hate when Sirius and Remus are calling Harry names like "Pup, Cub or Pronglet". It's extremely cringe.

*EDIT:*

-I also dislike magical cores, it's far too overused plot device.

-And one of my pet peeves that concerns all fandoms: gaming fics. I really dislike them.

** Anachronisms annoy me sometimes. I don't expect perfection in fanfic, but if you're writing a story set in the 70s or the 90s, make at least a little effort to think about what might have been different. And especially if you're a young woman writing male characters born in 1960 or 1980, it really shouldn't sound like they're regurgitating your Tumblr feed circa 2020.

Ifs often that Alphas rule the world and are seen as the protectors of the weak Omegas but are very emotional and have anger issues, Betas are the rational people and communicators between A and O and the Omegas are those who care about the children, stay home, are often weak and are in many stories abused.

**** Not op, but thanks a bunch for giving the abo explanation without all the unnecessary shaming and whatnot that I see a lot here when the topic comes up. The lack of judgement is refreshing!

(Not to say that people aren't allowed to dislike abo, that's 100% okay. There's just a fair amount of "abo is terrible writing and just an excuse to write a fetish" thrown around here, when there are in fact well written abo fics that aren't just fetish excuses.)

** Harry raped by Vernon.

over the top bashing. especially if it isn't important for the story.

gobliiiiiiiiins

rewrites or time travels, where it's all THE SAME as in canon just with that one change. including dialogues, even if that particular character is not there anymore. like Draco saying something Ron said in canon because now Harry is in Slytherin. that's just plain plagiarism. even if it isn't word for word, if the story is completely same, why change it. why should I bother to read?

OC that isn't tagged or mentioned in description. completely fine with OC side characters, but if an OC is going to be in the main group of characters, the story should have that tag (thinking ao3 or other sites where you can do that). so many times I started a story only to read about some group of OC vigilantes... ugh

stories that make Snape good, but instead of him, there's this sweet mashed potato with... feelings. ugh. I like my Snape being a jerk, thank you very much. basically OOC Snape. example: "Potter, he is just like his father. arrogant..." "but look, here is his health report. look at all these scars and broken bones" "gasp, Harry is such a sweet child. hopefully he is going to accept my apologies. but how can he when even I can't forgive myself." *sniffle* /// it isn't that hard to make a good mentor Snape where he is still himself. maybe they are written by younger audience that still believe that nice=good and mean=evil... or something.

** Hate is a strong word, so I am just going to list things I don't particularly like to read but wouldn't necessarily stop me from reading a story involving them if it manages to be successful in delivering them.

Not Harry-Centered Fics. 99.9999% of the time I only read fics that are mainly from Harry's perspective.

Dark!Harry. I generally stay away from these type of stories not because they are horrible or something on that line but because I love Canon!Harry just the way he is. I don't want to witness him doing atrocious things to other people, so these type of fics are definitely not for me.

Harry not enjoying flying or playing Quidditch.

Harem. For me, polyamorous relationships cheapen the romance in stories, so I avoid reading them.

Canon Rehash. I'll stick with the Harry Potter books, thank you.

Boring time travel stories. I need things to change. That's the whole reason I'm reading a time travel fic for Merlin's sake. If things remain exactly the same, what's the point?

Bashing. Make a character as evil as you want. I have no problem with that. But give them a personality. Give them a brain.

Age Gap. Simply because I find them uncomfortable to read, especially Harry/Voldemort fics.

Mentor!Snape. I don't like Snape, so I don't read fics where he mentors Harry.

Romance as a main theme. I like romance as a genre but not for the Harry Potter fandom.

Haphne. I've never understood why this ship is so popular.

Gay, gay, and more gay. I actually like M/M stories, but I find it irksome when every single character turns out to be homosexual.

Renaming Harry. Harold, Harrison, Henry, etc

Nicknames. Mia, Siri, Rem, Mione, Drake, Blaizy, Deac, Voldy, Moldy etc.

Changing things, and not having a good reason behind said change.

**** I know. I am really picky when it comes to Harry Potter and I am just as surprised as you that I actually can find some stories to read lol. It takes me a while but I do manage sometimes.

Canon Divergence are my absolute favourite. Fics where the author completely deviates from canon.

Time Travel. Those that truly follow through with their premise. Harry goes back in time, and actually takes the initiative to change the timeline.

Dimension Hopping AUs. This is what I call those fics in which Harry jumps from one dimension to another.

** Spell incantations as verbs. "He crucio'd it" or "she accio'd it" or any other made-up colloquializations of spells that are never seen in the books. Just bothers me for some reason.

Also, "Voldie" or "Voldy"

*** Yeah, that is quite annoying. The only things I "allow" are when Sirius made Harry his heir and when Magic herself chose someone to be Lord/Lady of Gryffindor.

Not right of conquest (even if go with only if the opponent was killed) since that would mean Voldemort and his death eater would be Lords and Ladies of like 25 houses.
