:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I saw a glimpse of this fic on AO3 and haven't been able to find it since. It was Harry Potter x Regulus Black if I remember correctly. Something along the lines of “by charming the pants off of” was in the summary. It mentioned that Harry planned to cure the Black Madness by being in direct contact with them, and that's a concept that has me hooked. I wanted to read about his interactions with all of the family, considering Belatrix was tagged in the fic as well.
