The idea that wizards would stay secluded in some backwater community of only a few (dozen?) thousand people really bothers me. That, and muggles not noticing a thing for hundreds of years... it makes no sense to me.

Any fic that has muggle/magical integration?


** Strength of Steel Wings has a muggle group determined to unravel the magical world based on exactly what you mentioned: The muggles DO notice that childhood friends who go to Hogwarts often change in ways one might expect to see from someone who joined a cult, boxes occasionally appear in weird places (owl orders), inexplicable deaths, etc.

** I imagine a lot of memory charms are used, and people in the know (such as the Muggle PM). With enough careful planning, you'd be surprised at what a government can keep hidden from the general populace, especially when you have access to magic!

*** Yeah but this /is/ the ministry of magic we are talking about.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8429437/1/The-Perils-of-Innocence][The Perils of Innocence]] covers this in a way.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]] shows a pretty good example of how I'd imagine things to go down once the Statue of Secrecy broke down. Also helps that the fic is pretty damn good.

** Try Noah Phantom's Albus Potter series on FF.net--the first fic in the series, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8417562/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Global-Revelation][Albus Potter and the Global Revelation]], addresses tension between wizards who want to reveal the magical world to muggles and those who don't. I don't want to spoil to much, but you can probably guess what the "global revelation" is. It's a great story, too. :)

From the fic's summary: "The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all."
