As a newcomer to this wonderful subreddit I'm curious as to how to use the fanfiction bot and how it works. Can somebody explain it to me please?

** In case you can't find it on the sidebar, the full guide is here.

LINK - [[https://github.com/FanfictionBot/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage]]

I believe if you're on the phone app, you go to 'about' in the top bar and scroll about three or four down to find the 'bot usage guide' there.

** If you don't want the fancy ways, this is an easy way.

write

Linkffn() With your link in the parentheses!

Like this:

Linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6243892/1/]])

There are other ways to do it, but this is easy for me.
