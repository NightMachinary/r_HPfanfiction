I've been listening to a few Harry Potter podcasts lately and it's an aspect of the (canon) books I never really thought about before, but definitely does seem to recur throughout the series. While obviously when Snape is the classic bad teacher it seems to make easy sense, but as Snape is revealed to be more complex and aware, it requires more thought than "because he's a Slytherin and he hates all Gryffindors". At least, maybe it does.

Is it simple Doylist poor planning of Snape's character? In-text resentment? Blood prejudice? Another reason?

*** His continued employment had nothing to do with there being so few magicals. He had a role to play as a spy and to protect Harry. Had there not been a war, he would have probably experimented with potions and not have dealt with adolescents, who he was way too overeducated to teach. His position was way different than other professors at the school. He has to bully the golden trio, and we don't know if he treats the other students in Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as he does them. We only see how he treats the gryff/slytherin class, which are two houses which should NEVER have potions together. By no stretch of the mind am I trying to say he's /nice/ to the Huff/Claw class, but I'd imagine he wouldn't personally bully them. a strict teacher is necessary in a potions class, where people could actually die.

He could have just treated them like any other student, and if it got back to wrong side that he wasn't treating them poorly, he could have just said he'd been ordered to treat them professionally by Dumbledore as a condition of his continued employment because he'd been getting complaints, because they were Dumbledore's favorites, etc.

Of course, he's really working for Dumbledore, so he needs to convince Voldemort he's really working for him. To do that, he needs to act, not like Dumbledore's supporter, but like /Dumbledore's spy/.

****** Bullying is exactly what he shouldn't do. Good spies blend in. They gain their targets' trust. Every time a deep-cover spy is discovered, every one says “Wow, I never would have suspected them!”

Would anyone have said the same about Snape? No. For a spy trying to maintain deep cover with Dumbledore and Dumbledore's associates, he pretty much does everything wrong. He should be working overtime to gain Harry's trust, not drive him away. When he returns, Voldemort should be furious that Snape (and everyone else in Slytherin) has utterly failed to take advantage of their access to Harry such that they are in a position to gain lots of direct intelligence from him. It's a colossal failure - one that the students can perhaps be forgiven (not that Voldemort is very forgiving), but not Snape.

Snape would certainly need to act differently in private - pretend to support the same views as Death Eaters when meeting privately with Death Eater children. And proper Slytherin children would understand the importance of showing one face to the world and another to family/confidantes.

And the idea that Hermione has done anything that causes her to /deserve/ bullying is just disgusting. Stricter treatment? Perhaps. Stronger disciplinary measures? Perhaps. Outright bullying from an adult? Never. Even Draco didn't do anything to deserve bullying from a professor, and he ultimately deserved to go to Azkaban.

******* Voldemort isn't very smart. If he hadn't bullied then Voldie would have been suspicious even if Snape told him he was just getting their trust. Besides, it would have been worse for Harry if Harry trusted him because then Voldie would ask Snape to bring Harry to him and Snape obvi wouldn't do that and yeah his cover is blown.

I believe in karma, what goes around comes around, which is why I said that. If Snape wanted to bully the students it would be a completely different story. I don't believe he did, he just did what was necessary. To be fair, we don't really know if he did or not so my guess is as good as yours. Ultimately, Snape's bullying of the students was necessary.

Perhaps Hermione didn't exactly deserve the bullying, but I still do believe in karma. And when he said 'I see no difference' there were Slytherins nearby who would have questioned him if he hadn't said that. Other than that, he didn't really do much to Hermione other than calling her an insufferable know-it-all, which she was, and reprimanding her for helping her friends, which she shouldn't have been doing.

Except it wasn't. That behavior is exactly the *opposite* of how a spy needs to behave. He can easily express his support for Voldemort's positions in private, which is far more cunning and intelligent than bullying children in public.

Put simply, his public behavior comes with no gains that can't be gotten via other means and a lot of disadvantages that aren't needed.

Exactly! If Voldemort doesn't realize this, then he's a moron. If he does, then he knows that Snape isn't really loyal to him. Or is a moron himself. Either way, he's only useful for feeding disinformation to the enemy. And do we ever see him bring truly useful intelligence to the Order?

I don't think Voldemort is an idiot. He must know that Snape is compromised at best, but perhaps finds Snape's inept attempts to look like a spy useful.

That's abuse and bullying. He isn't making neutral observations here, he's expressing harsh, negative value judgements. That you regard abusive insults as not much and simply calling things as they are is frankly disgusting. I hope you enjoy exactly the karma that's coming to you.

Except, again, Voldie is not that smart all the time. Snape would have a harder time convincing him that he isn't betraying Voldie. It would look highly sus if Snape was under Dumbledore's wing for a decade and didn't act the way he did while coming back to Vovldie's graces. Voldemort would think he betrayed him

I'm not gonna say that Snape didn't bully his students, but where Hermione was concerned, it wasn't that bad. He stated /true/ things about her, whereas with Harry he didn't. Try telling someone over and over again to do something that they've heard a million times yet still ignore it. He shouldn't have been a teacher, but it was necessary for the war. There were Slytherin students who would have told their parents if he acted any other way.

** Honestly, his dislike of Hermione is the most justified of the trio. While Harry broke rules and such, Snape hated him before he did those things. Keep in mind that I do love Hermione, but I'm not blind to her faults.

1). She is so very rude to him. She isn't outright rude like Ron and Harry are, but she is, even if she doesn't know she is. She constantly undermines him and his authority.

2). Going along with that, she speaks out of turn MULTIPLE times. I don't care whether the teacher is ignoring you when your hand is in the air. You should NEVER blurt out the answer if you aren't called, it's rude and common etiquette. And then she and the golden trio get mad when he takes off points? Like, mmm, yeah he's going to take points when she's disrupting the class.

3). She continues to repeat information from the text again and again even after Snape tells her not to. To be fair, she probably does think he's just saying so to humiliate her, which he was, but he was also trying to, maybe tell her not to regurgitate information? And then, again, she gets upset once he takes points away.

4). She thinks herself to be above the law. She lectures Harry and Ron for breaking the rules when she does the EXACT same thing. She is, possibly, worse than those two, because they will admit that they break rules when she doesn't. Hypocritical, really. Anyways, getting back on point, rules are there for a reason. Yes, she breaks them for better reasons than Harry and Ron, but still. If you didn't get punished for breaking the rules because you had a "good reason" for it, then what's the point of having rules?

5). She does more harm to Snape than Harry does even. First year, she lights him on fire. Yes, she thought he was trying to kill her friend, but still. It probably wouldn't have killed him, but it could have harmed him even more. She steals ingredients from his PRIVATE stores her second year. These ingredients were probably expensive and harder to get. Again, she had a good reason, but still. Additionally, she, Harry, and Ron cause that diversion (i don't remember exactly what it was, but it exploded something). In a potions class, that is DANGEROUS. It could have KILLED Harry, Ron, Snape, or any of the students in that room. I don't think Hermione herself did that, but she allowed it. Third year she knocks him out. One could say 'she didn't know it would knock him back.' She's supposedly the brightest witch of her age! She's also a bookworm. I'd be thoroughly surprised if she didn't know there was a possibility of that.

I don't think he hated her because of her blood status. Snape never showed signs of being a blood supremacist still. He despised muggles because the only muggles he'd ever come in contact with did fit the image of muggles being evil. If you only know evil, how are you supposed to know good? I don't know what his opinions were on muggleborns. I'm guessing he didn't like them much, but I don't think he necessarily wanted them dead. He joined Voldemort to get power and respect. I truly don't think he agreed with Voldemort's agenda, even if he wasn't completely opposed to it. Sorry, I'm getting off point again haha. Even if he was a blood supremacist, he had 10 ish years to get over it, all of which he was under Dumbledore's supervision, so I am sure that by the time the Golden Trio entered Hogwarts he was over it.

He also probably disliked her because she was friends with Harry, but I don't think he hated her because of it.

He did have a role to play, he couldn't be seen ignoring or giving favor to a Gryffindor muggle-born, brightest witch of her age, AND harry potter's friend at that. While I think his dislike of her was real, I don't think he would have treated her as badly as he did if he didn't have to. That's a moot point because if he didn't have to, he wouldn't be a professor.

I don't think he hates the house Gryffindor, specifically. He hates people who are hot-headed and arrogant. It just happens that most Gryffindors fit that bill. Even though Hermione was more logical, in the end, she let her emotions control her. He despised that trait in people.

She was a know-it-all. I would be pretty annoyed with her as well.

This all sounds like I hate Hermione, lol. I don't, she's one of my favorite characters, believe it or not, but I'm aware she isn't perfect.

She feels the need to prove herself when honestly no one cares if she knows the answers or not. I imagine her as that annoying kid in middle school who was the teacher's pet and licked their boots to get high marks and looked down on his peers.
