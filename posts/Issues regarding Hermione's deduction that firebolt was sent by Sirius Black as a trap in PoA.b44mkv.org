Let me say this before I get to the meat of the topic. For her age, her deduction is quite impressive and it almost hit the nail. But there are some huge, gaping holes in it. Not that it's a bad thing, as I said, even arriving to that conclusion for her age is quite impressive.

But what bugs me here is a responsible adult like McGonagall blindly agreeing with a 13 year old's theory and confiscating the broom from them without any second thought, just because she tops in her classes and is her favourite student.

Now what might be the holes in Hermione's theory you ask?

Firstly, every student in Hogwarts is taught arresto momentum in their second year, why? Though it's not explicitly mentioned, it's most probably to prevent students from fatal injuries from nasty broom falls/accidents. Think of why students are allowed to own broomsticks only from their secondyear?

Now think from the murderer's point of view (assuming that Sirius sent the jinxed broom solely to kill Harry).

Firstly, it's an authentic firebolt, which is supposed to be the most expensive broom in the world, almost like ferrari. Now don't you think it is possible that it contains some intricate inbuilt protection charms inside it?

Okay, let's assume that Sirius bypassed those security charms, but wait! To bypass those intricate security charm, Sirius needs to be like master in runework and charms, and most importantly, he needs to gain touch back in his supposed expertise! Now how on earth do you think an Azkaban escapee whose mind has been tortured by dementors for 14 years and whose wand has been snapped/with an alternate wand that most likely do not have that much compatibility as his original wand (remember wand chooses the wizard), has enough competency to perform a sensitive taks like jinxing a world class broom?

Okay, let's assume that he overcome all those hurdles... because plot, and sent the jinxed broom to Harry. Now as I said, every second year students learn arresto momentum, so even if he falls off the broom, he can easily escape alive. Even if broom explodes midair, the chances that Harry is certainly killed midair are astronomically low. He is the boy-who-lived who survived the freaking killing curse (albeit it purely luck) for the gods sake!

Do you think that the murderer would waste 1000 galleons on a murderplan that has like 0.1% chances of success, considering the reputation of boy-who-lived?

What do you think? Please comment.

P.S: Again, I do not blame Hermione, I blame McGonagoll for blindly agreeing with a theory cooked up by a 13 year old girl, despite how much booksmart she is.


** Her point was that they didn't know who sent it (Black was just her example do to his position in book 3 as well as dramatic irony). For all they new the broom could be rigged to explode or be coated in poison. This is actually one of the few time I felt like the staff was actually acting in a responsible manner consisted with there position (mostly, if I remember right, and it's been a while so I might not, McGonagall wasn't clear about why they were taking the broom).

*** If broom is coated in posion or rigged to explode, such obvious traps would be found in preliminary examination itself. But even in preliminary examinations McGonagoll wasn't able to find anything. Which means, the jinxes are more subtler than that (or there are no jinxes).

If the jinxes are more subtler than that, now the fundamental question arises. Why waste 1000 galleons on a half baked murder plan when you have better methods?

**** Explosion was just an example (and even then if it had a specific trigger such as reaching a certain height or speed it wouldn't necessarily be obvious) and remember that McGonagall is not an expert on potions or curses so unless it was a fairly poor attempt I wouldn't expect her to find it with a preliminary exam (I always assumed it was implied that various members of the staff examined the broom before it was declared safe).

Ultimately we don't know enough about HP magic to say what was or wasn't possible in this case so are left with speculation other than McGonagall thought it was worth looking into.

Exactly, now can you imagine a madman, an azkaban escapee with no wand/second hand wand that has less compatibility, having enough subtlety/sanity to perform sensitive tasks like tampering with protection charms in firebolt that could even get past McGonagoll?

It's because it's obvious deduction that it is hasty. Still, she was able to come to that conclusion without succumbing to the temptation of firebolt. You have to giver her credit for that.

But again, for a murderplan, it's full of holes.

He escaped azkaban. It's literally never been done before. They have no reasonable expectations. They don't have any clue what he could possibly be capable of

#+begin_quote
  He is the boy who lived
#+end_quote

Which doesn't give him any protection? If anything it'd make people more protective of him (and did) because he's a public figure

Harry got a insanely expensive broom, free, without even a note. A broom used for competitive quidditch. And you don't think the teachers would be suspicious? While there's an escaped murderer, who escaped from somewhere no one has escaped from before, and has already broken into Hogwarts at that point (i think) on the loose with a vendetta against Harry.

Not to mention that Hermione was right. It was sent by Sirius Black. And no, that sort of deduction isn't that hard to make at thirteen. Had you never read any kind of mystery book at that age?\\

Arresto momentum being thought in second year, that is probably from games.

Also,

/"Dumbledore ...ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground."/

If 100 year old Dumbledore has enough time to /run into the field/ and then cast arresto momentum, while Harry was in /free fall/ (aka with an acceleration of 9.8 m/s^{2),} then I'm not sure why Harry cannot cast his spell as soon as he feels that something is funny.

Besides, And in QTtA, chapter 6, Changes in Quidditch since the Fourteenth Century (> Balls > The Quaffle):

/Chasers were also becoming increasingly irritated by the necessity of diving continually towards the ground to retrieve the Quaffle whenever they missed a catch and so, shortly after the Quaffle's change of colour, the witch Daisy Pennifold had the idea of bewitching the Quaffle so that if dropped, it would fall slowly earthwards as though sinking through water, meaning that Chasers could grab it in mid-air. The “Pennifold Quaffle” is still used today./

It's obvious that arresto momentum can be used at the starting of fall as well. Heck you could even enchant a broom so that arresto momentum is activated the moment it falls. If it works for quaffles then why not for brooms?

Now do you think it is so easy for a single person to tamper with that protection in a world class broom like firebolt? With 14 years of mental torture in azkaban and not having his own wand?

Again you are merely repeating other's explanation. True, it is suspicious. But it doesn't make sense for the murderer to waste 1000 galleons on a half baked murderplan of jinxing a broom.

Does it not? If I recall correctly, Harry and Ron were enamoured by the broom and didn't consider where it came from and were certainly caught up in the excitement of having the best broom on the world. It would make sense to send a young boy an amazing gift- just when he needs it- that he would want to use immediately. As such, even Oliver Wood was caught up in the glamour of the broom. If the broom had been jinxed and Hermione had not taken it to McGonagall it is likely that it may have killed or harmed Harry. Surely spending 1000 galleons is worth it for a plan that likely would have worked without the intervention of Hermione?

** Arresto momentum was first mentioned in the third book when Dumbledore casted it. It's only taught to students in the LEGO games... which are even less canonical than the regular games. And even if it was, in a stadium full of people where ~80% are capable of casting it, only the most competent wizard of the century used it in time to stop Harry's fall. Cursed broom seems to be a legitimate way to kill someone in magical Britain if Dumbledore isn't there.

To severly injure someone or disable someone so that he won't play in next match? Yes. But to kill someone? Nope. Unless you are 11 year old and you have Voldemort jinxing it. Even then Quirrelmort had to maintain /continuous eyecontact/ for what? Nimbus 2000?

And now to think that Sirius is suddenly more capable than quirrelmort in jinxing the /firebolt?/

**** Q-mort was doing it real-time, wandless and wordlessly while Snape worked against him. And having broom stop working mid-air isn't the only way to assassinate someone with a broom. Dumbledore died because he wore a ring. Harry was kidnapped because he touched a cup. There are ass biting toilet seats, biting books and many more dangers in the world. Sirius, a man raised by the Black family who the man himself confessed as to being amongst darkest of dark families, would be reasonably knowledgeable in cursing an object.

And levitation charm? Really? You expect a kid to be able to cast a levitation charm at a rapidly falling object? Even if Harry himself could cast it, while in an uncontrollable free fall, a levitation charm isn't useful for flight, it would make him stop, yes, but it wouldn't let him do anything else and I don't know about you but staying mid air doesn't sound safe to me.

And your reasoning is ridiculous from the start because a life isn't something to put at risk for a ridiculous reasons like riding 'the fastest' broom. Harry had perfectly acceptable brooms he could use provided by the school. There was no conceivable reason for him to risk his life for a broom.

** Ignoring all the other stuff, you're probably right that anything involving the broom would have a low chance of killing him by dropping him from a height. That doesn't mean it couldn't be triggered to harm him in some other way, such as by releasing a curse or trying to abduct him. It could even turn into a portkey at a specific time.

In any case, McGonagall is just being safe. A gift from a Death Eater and madman, the same one who betrayed Harry's parents and caused their deaths, does not make any sense /except/ as some sort of threat. The reasonable response was to keep it away from him until it could be thoroughly tested.

Hermione and the staff had every reason to be suspicious. A highly expensive racing broom being given to a public figure like Harry Potter anonymously, with no message or anything, is incredibly suspect, whether it actually came from Sirius or not.
