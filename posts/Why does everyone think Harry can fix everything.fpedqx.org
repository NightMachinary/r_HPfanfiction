Okay, this really pisses me off. Why is it that in EVERY single post Battle of Hogwarts fic I read, the Auror Department and the Ministry, in general, are completely fixed. Like they act as if defeating Voldemort just eliminated corruption and that everything suddenly became okay. The line I hear most often is "Now all the Death Eaters and people with Blood Supremacist ideas are either locked up or dead.". No, they're not. Arian Supremacism didn't just end after Hitler killed himself. Stop it.


** Look, you're not wrong with saying Harry can't fix everything himself. However, there is a serious case that can be made that lots of people knew what they were doing was wrong, but they could get away with it under Voldemort and it looked like he had already won. Voldemort's mere existence was a free pass to be a cunt towards certain people. With Voldemort dead you suddenly have people realising that they can't get away with it any more. How many people are there that would be murderers, paedophiles, racists or any other thing that we consider awful if they could get away with it? Maybe it's because they're twisted, maybe it's because they're just curious, it doesn't really matter but humanity has a well documented history of being massive twats towards each other. So often the reason you don't punch the person annoying you isn't that deep down you didn't want to punch them, it's because the punishment you would earn isn't worth it.

Harry doesn't magically fix everything. It's people who realise they have to change for the better, even if it is only for their own survival, who fix things. The realisation however, that they need to change only happened because of what Harry achieved.

*** Yeah, sure, but you can't say that in times of peace, there is no crime. Sometimes, and most of the time, wars DON'T wake everyone up. There is a war, one side wins, and hopefully, lives change for the better. We know this happened with Harry Potter, but in any world, even after a war or revolution, life isn't perfect. There is still going to be crime and supremacy and corruption. Just because a major problem is fixed doesn't mean society is fixed. Not all bad people are Death Eaters.

** I imagine it's because that's the tone the Epilogue took. Malfoy the war criminal was apparently happily married and still free, etc.

** Well, a lot of pureblood fanboys like to think that all evil was just Voldemort's fault (and his Death Eaters'), and as soon as they are gone, everything is alright. No one else was a bigot, no sir! We were all Voldemort's victims, sir!

Just like 90% of the Germans suddenly discovered that they hated the Nazis all along - once the war was over.

  For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would become a Dark Lord. For Teddy Lupin, Harry Potter would take down the Ministry or die trying. He should have known that Hermione and Ron wouldn't let him do it alone.
