  Harry watches it go, still astonished. Then he turns back to the kitchen, where Padfoot, who is still a human and not at all a dog, is staring at him.

  Harry stares back.

  “Damn,” says the man. “I suppose you have some questions.”

  “Are you magic?” asks Harry.

  “Yes,” says the man. He is wearing Padfoot's tags and license on a necklace.

  “Are you a werewolf?” asks Harry.

  “What? No,” says the man. “Why would I-- that's not how werewolves work.”

  “Well, no,” says Harry, who has now had a second to think about it and feels a little foolish. “I suppose you'd have to be, like, a reverse werewolf, right? Because you're a dog all month and now you're a man.”

  “I'm not a reverse werewolf either,” says the man. “I'm your godfather.”

  “My fairy godfather?” Harry asks, because his mother reads him a lot of Brothers Grimm.

  “Not --- in that sense, no,” says the man. “Just your regular godfather.”

  “My regular godfather, who is magic,” says Harry.

  “Yes,” says Padfoot, who has lived in Harry's house for more than a year now, and read most of the books on its shelves in the middle of the night, including the ones with titles like /The Adoptive Parent's Toolkit/ and /My Family, My Journey/.

  He says, “Your birth dad was my best friend.”

  “Was he magic too?” asks Harry.

  “Yes,” says Padfoot. “And so was your mum. And so are you.”

  “What?” says Harry, who had not been expecting this turn of events in the least.

  “You're a wizard, Harry,” says Padfoot. “And so am I.”

  Canon Divergence AU  Dumbledore raises Harry from the age of four after the Dursleys are found to be unfit guardians. They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  “House pride means nothing!” explained Draco in very loud whispers while he repeatedly hit the Slytherin badge in his robes. “All I'm saying is that the house division is merely a mechanism imposed by the super structures to keep the lower classes, that is us the student body, unable to unite and demand more rights.”

  Crabbe and Goyle were completely lost, but Zabini and Nott were listening and nodding their heads.

  “They are forcing us to compete to destroy any semblance of solidarity, all so they can exercise power unchallenged” Draco went on.

  “I told you to keep quiet during study hour, Mr. Malfoy. Ten points from Slytherin” said professor Willington as he walked down the tables of the Great Hall.

  It should have ended there. Nothing more than a murmur between a few students. But then Draco abandoned the language of his readings and said something easy to understand and memorize.

  “But that's just it! Don't you see? It is just a symbol of their ill acquired domination!” Draco had a feverish look about him. It was so clear to him! “The point system is a lie!”

  Which even Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs could comprehend. The points meant nothing. They didn't even hand out a special gift to the house that earned the House Cup at the end of the year. Hurray, you won, you are better, look at his cup behind the glass. That was it. It was just a system to enforce discipline and avoid unionizing by turning the working class students against each other and stopping them from confronting the teachers.

  All this was explained later, while in the middle of a lecture of History of Magic. As long as you didn't speak louder than Binns, you could do whatever you wanted there. Like indicating to your fellow classmates the absurdity of the house rivalries and how it benefited the governing powers.

  Harry wasn't sure how, but he suspected he had been the spark of the change that came over the school, even if Draco was the engine. He was actually quite pleased and a little bit scared because the next time a Prefect took points from someone breaking the curfew, the student, a stressed Ravenclaw that had been studying nonstop for the NEWTs, laughed in his face like a maniac.

  “The points are a lie” said the girl, half laughing and half screaming. “I can stay outside if I want!”

  “Miss Turpin, I must remind you-”

  “You have no authority over me!” she seemed surprised and elated. “It means nothing.”

  “Miss Turpin you are not making any sense.”

  “Exactly, Roderick. It doesn't make sense. We produce the points with our conduct. Whether you choose to acknowledge them or not is irrelevant. The points belong to us. Ahahaha!”

** "Weasley, Ginevra!" Professor McGonagall called out. Ginny was surprised as she'd assumed that her name would put her dead last. Mustering her confidence, she walked down to the stool where the Sorting Hat rested. She had half-believed Harry when he told her about the Sorting Hat, but she'd imagined something a bit grander and not so shabby.

"Shabby, am I?" said the Hat, causing Ginny to emit a soft "meep."

"Um, sorry?" Ginny thought rather than said. She was suddenly surprised to realize she was having a psychic conversation. "You're just ... not what I was expecting."

"Humph, you shouldn't be expecting anything at all. Who'd had thought Harry Potter of all people would be such a blabbermouth? Oh well, let's get this over with. You are a Weasley, I see. Though the first female Weasley in centuries. Ever since that unpleasantness with ... ah, forget I said anything about that. I suppose Potter's not the only blabbermouth around here."

"Wait, what are you ...?"

"No, no. Forget I mentioned it. Anyway, you are, as I said, a Weasley. So I suppose you'll be wanting to follow in your brothers' footsteps blindly without the slightest thought to your own ambitions. That seems to be the Weasley way. On the bright side, I suppose if you're in Gryffindor with your four brothers, they can look after you and protect you and keep you from any sort trouble. That's good, right?"

"What?!" she explained mentally. "No! I'm not blindly following anybody! I do have ambitions of my own, you know, and I certainly don't need any of them looking after me and protecting me! I can look after myself and find my own way, thank you very much!"

"Hmm, feisty!" exclaimed the Hat. "Lots of Gryffindor spunk, I see."

"Eight-year-olds have 'spunk.' I have determination."

"Heh-heh. I suppose you do. So I guess there's only one question left. Which is more important? That everyone around you know how brave you are? Or that you actually be brave?"

That question surprised her and brought her up short. She thought for a few seconds. "Be brave, always," she finally said and with firm conviction.

"Humph. About bloody time one of you lot said that," the Hat said before finally shouting out:

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Ginny often got her guessing games wrong. Who could really predict someone like Luna? She seemed above earthly things as much as she seemed to understand them better than anyone.

It didn't matter, though. When Harry asked Luna to Slughorn's party, Luna's smiles were brighter than ever as she bounced around wondering whether she should wear her butter beer cork necklace while Ginny assured her that there wouldn't be any Nargles at the party. Ginny couldn't have been happier for Luna, and so it was all right if she didn't understand the Quibbler's latest theory about the Rotfang Conspiracy.

As they laid in the grass one day in a rare moment of luxurious laziness, Ginny decided to play one last guessing game. Just one last question. And a rather personal one, at that.

"Luna, who's your favorite person?"

She felt the grass tickling her bare feet as the obvious answer entered her mind almost immediately. Luna's father, her most talked about person, the person she believed without question, no matter what he said. They surely had a wonderful family relationship.

But Luna smiled her brightest smile and twitched her nose in that rabbit-like way of hers.

"You are."

Ginny leaned her head back and smiled. She was shocked once again, but that was fine. She didn't think she would ever understand Luna completely--nobody would. The girl was an enigma, bright and mysterious as the moon. But that was okay.

Because Luna was Ginny's favorite person too.

  “We thought you were dead,” Shacklebolt says. He's an old man. They're all so /old/ , Harry thinks, and he's almost jealous stuck forever at almost-eighteen.

  Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. "Hang on," he said, looking back at George, "didn't you promise Hermione you wouldn't bring any Wheezes products to the wedding?"

  The reminder of his promise made to a very stern looking Hermione caused George's face to slip down a few places on the Smug Scale but he was otherwise unfazed.

  "Yeah, but this was a prototype," he explained. "Not an actual product."

  Harry gaped at him. "You've unleashed an untested Wheeze on Muriel at Hermione's wedding?"

  "Gotta live dangerously if you want the galleon, my friend," George winked.

  Harry had ridden dragons, fought a gigantic basilisk and deliberately angered Severus Snape on multiple occasions and even he thought that George was living a bit too dangerously here.

Victor preferred to glare, Fleur kept distracting the man with her charm, and Harry would not give any facial expression. Only Cedric appeared ready to smile for the camera. In the end their photo came out with Cedric smiling, Fleur smirking, Victor scowling slightly, and Harry starring at the camera, absolutely blank. The man gave a great huff of annoyance as he left.

*** Normally, I'd agree with the "show, not tell" approach. But for this author, the stories are almost like sketches (as opposed to say, paintings). Showing not telling would result in a fiction that was significantly longer than what is written. Instead, the author chooses to quickly sketch out the story, covering years of time in a short span and conveying interesting plot points.

  [...]

  The worst was always when Peeves saw someone stepping in to bother Harry. Peeves had spent Harry's childhood dropping water balloons on his head, jumping out of armor at him, and tying his shoes together (once Harry grew into using shoelaces). But the first time a bully loomed over Harry, Peeves flew shrieking at him and spent that next week keeping the bully from a full night's sleep and shoving his full plates of mashed potatoes into his face at mealtimes.

  [...]

  It started out as a study group in the Ravenclaw Tower, blue-hemmed kids reading Defense Against the Dark Arts books and trying spells with the Grey Lady's supervision. They figured she was ancient enough to count as adult supervision, and ignored the fact that “lethal danger” didn't ping too many warning bells in her translucent head.

  But Cedric Diggory, who Harry had walked through homesickness in his first year, wanted to practice too. Fred, George, and Lee were disgusted that nothing /fun/ was happening; Ginny Weasley, still pale but growing warmer, was quietly, firmly furious that children were not being taught to defend themselves.

  [...]

  The older Hufflepuffs remembered Harry learning to read in their common room. The younger ones remembered him conjuring them hot chocolate (one of the first spells he'd ever mastered) when they were missing home most. Draco Malfoy still ran a “Potter Stinks!” campaign, but it was much less popular, especially with Harry and Cedric walking down corridors with their heads bent in towards each other.

  Harry was still concentrating. "Do you think Dumbledore suspects that I am, in his terms, a horcrux of Lord Voldemort, or more generally, that some aspects of my personality were copied off Lord Voldemort?" Even as Harry asked this aloud, he realized what a dumb question it was, and how much completely blatant evidence he'd already seen that -

  "Dumbledore cannot possibly have missed it," said Professor Quirrell. "It is not exactly subtle. What else is Dumbledore to think, that you are an actor in a play whose stupid author has never met a real eleven-year-old? Only a gibbering dullard would believe that - ah, never mind."

** "Mister Potter, you will take your feet off of your . . ." The Professor stared at the needle. ". . .finished needle? Did you finish?"

"Yes, Professor." He still didn't have his eyes open.

"I see." She placed another matchstick on his desk. "Can you . . ." before she finished, it had become a silver needle with a gold-plated point and little green scrollwork along the sides. She blinked. "Alright. What are you doing now?"

"I'm reading my textbook, Professor."

"You have it under your feet, Mister Potter."

"Yes?"

"Do you have eyes on your feet?"

"No, Professor. Besides, the book is closed anyway."

"So how are you reading it?"

"Very well, thank you."

"Detention, Mister Potter."

Alternatively:

There was a cheer from the Gryffindor table. "Alright!" cheered Gred. "Malfoy's started a food fight!" Suddenly, the air was thick with mashed potatoes banished towards other tables. Tureens of gravy emptied themselves as Lee Jordan helped his friends.

Within seconds, the other tables had responded, half at the twins for the attack and half at Malfoy for starting it. Professor Dumbledore animated a roast chicken, which picked up a knife and saucer and proceeded to defend him, wearing a helmet made of a hollowed out roll. He then went back to eating as the pseudo-knight warded off flying food with its little china shield.

Snape was almost instantly covered from head to foot in mash and gravy and he was being barraged by animated drumsticks that kept trying to beat out the school song on his head. The four tables were all buried under food from other tables. Malfoy himself was currently buried under a roast pig, sixteen loaves of bread, four sticks of butter, and a selection of sherbet the providence of which was uncertain, as dessert had yet to appear.

In the midst of it all, Hari was eating from his small bowl of rice and fish, unsullied by comestible projectiles. He was currently sitting on the pile of things covering Malfoy, apparently unaware of the war taking place. Sometimes, without apparent realization, he dodged a ballistic victual. Several of his housemates had taken refuge under the table and were using their wands to launch a concerted barrage of peas at the Twins, who were already coated in food, but apparently enjoying themselves immensely.

It took several minutes before McGonagall managed to return the hall to order, primarily by transfiguring all flying objects into water. Once everyone but Hari was soaking wet and covered in sodden food, she cleared her throat. "There will be a school-wide detention courtesy of Mister Malfoy for starting this fight." Professor Snape's mouth opened. "No, Severus, Mister Malfoy clearly, and in front of all of us, flung the first piece of food. Now Poppy, if you would please make sure that the students are uninjured. You can leave Mister Malfoy for last, since he was so enthusiastic about this fight."

  The Ministry would burn. Not today. Not tomorrow. But soon. They would burn, every last one of them, because if that was the only way to keep them from ever going after Ron and Hermione again, then that was what he would do.

  Burn it all, scour it to the very bedrock, and rebuild it from scratch in the ashes. If the Minister could not command the Wizengamot, then the Wizengamot would yield. By Fiendfyre, blackmail, or loyalty, he did not particularly care which.

  His left hand rested by Hermione's neck, tangled in her hair. His right had a tight grip on Ron's shoulder, “silent reassurance that he was there, that they had him back for good.

  "They will burn," he vowed quietly. "Every single last one of them will burn for this."

  Hermione's breath hitched. Then her grip tightened and she looked up to meet his gaze, stubborn and furious and defiant through bloodshot eyes and ash-grey skin.

  "They will burn," she agreed.

  "... Every single last one of them," Ron finished, low and hoarse. "Every single last one.”

  Turning around, she cast an Amplifying Charm. "Wand-Commander Daniel is dead. Special Authorisation granted. Centre, move to engage the enemy! For Britain!"

  The Wands behind the walls charged to the gaps or climbed the walls. Hermione herself rushed to the top of the closest wall thanks to conjured steps, pointed her wand at the monster and summoned all the hatred she felt.

  "Avada Kedavra!"

  All around her, green spells flew towards the enemies. For a moment, she felt elated. No one could dodge that many spells!

  The monster was too quick though, and vanished behind a conjured wall himself. Even before the obstacle was shattered by dozens of curses, Hermione was already casting the next Killing Curse.

  "Avada Kedavra!"

  Another wall shattered, and this time, staggered curses followed it up. Hermione saw several of the Fanatics behind Lestrange fall down, struck. She aimed her wand at the centre of the enemy's formation, where a wall was stubbornly standing. Spell after spell hit it, and it would be destroyed soon enough, no matter what kind of magic kept it standing despite the onslaught.

  Before it fell though, two figures shot up into the air from behind it. The monster and Lestrange, both flying without a broom. That ... Hermione sent a spell after them, together with several other Wands, but she knew they wouldn't hit them. They were too fast, too far away.

  The stragglers on the ground though... that was a textbook encirclement. No one had to give the Wands any orders as they cut the fanatics down with well-aimed spells.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

*** Everytime I stumble over "The Sum of Their Parts" I can't help but feel of two minds. On one hand it was a superb story. On the other, the author made it incredibly bad by losing interest and just jumping from the middle of the story to a half assed epilogue... I mean, that excerpt you posted is like the last paragraph before the epilogue... It should be 200k words away from it. Just sad that the story was kind of ruined.

  ‘Ask me something else instead,' Albus said softly.

  ‘Alright,' Harry said eagerly. ‘Tell me about the mirror.'

  ‘What mirror?'

  ‘You know damn.well what mirror I'm talking about!' Harry scoffed. ‘The mirror that shows the future!'

  Albus raised his eyebrows. ‘You think it shows the future?'

  ‘Well, doesn't it?' Harry faltered. ‘I thought it did.'

  ‘Why, what do you see in it?'

  ‘What do you see in it?' Harry threw back at him.

  Albus shook his head. ‘No, no. You're just fishing for clues. You tell me first.'

  Harry squirmed. ‘You won't laugh? I'm worried about it now.'

  ‘I won't laugh,' Albus promised solemnly.

  Harry leant back and closed his eyes. ‘I saw myself but older and stronger. You and I were standing side by side and there was a crowd of people behind us cheering.'

  He paused uncertainly. ‘Its hard to explain, but somehow I could just tell that there'd been a big battle and Voldemort was dead. There was blood on my face and you had your arm around me. We were both smiling.'

  Harry took a breath and opened his eyes. Albus was staring at him very intently indeed.

  ‘And you thought that was your future?'

  ‘Yes,' Harry said sadly. ‘It's what I always hoped would happen.' He sighed. ‘What was it really?'

  Albus smiled. ‘You said it yourself, it what you hoped would happen.' He leant forward and adjusted his glasses. ‘The mirror of Erised shows us what we desire most in our hearts. I should also mention that our greatest desires are often linked to our greatest fears so it's no great surprise that you see yourself living in a world where you have conquered Voldemort and are strong, whole and free.'

  Harry breathed deeply and nodded. ‘And that you're there with me, too. That we're safe together.'

  ‘Yes.'

  Harry sat up slowly, rubbing his eyes. ‘It's so embarrassing,' he mumbled. ‘What do you see when you look in the mirror?'

  Albus cast his eyes down. ‘Well, that's the interesting thing. You and I appear to have been subject to a very rare phenomenon.'

  Harry blinked. ‘What do you mean?'

  Albus looked up again, his bright blue eyes meeting Harry's emerald green ones.

  ‘When you and I look in the mirror of Erised we both see exactly the same thing.'

Harry isn't some miniature adult who slings curses and steals witches, but he has read 1001 magical herbs and fungi and does know an earworm jinkx that doesn't go away until dispelled. He's smarter, more curious and more knowledgeable than canon Harry, but not unbelievably so. linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989]])

They live in relative isolation, away from the pressures and dangers of the wizarding world, until Harry turns eleven. Then they return to Hogwarts together in the role of headmaster and student.Nothing has changed except for Harry and Dumbledore and what they mean to each other. And that changes everything.

  "This way." She led him to a, a...

  "Sorry, there's an anti-muggle Notice-Me-Not charm on the entrance. Take my arm, you should be able to walk through the doorway even if you can't see it."

  He did as he was told, and soon entered what was obviously a pub, although with a different clientele than he was used to. Everyone was in wizarding robes. Tom noted with a mix of joy and despair that more than half of the witches and wizards were better dressed than their little party. None were as pathetic as the Gaunts. This gave him hope for his son's future, and simultaneously embarrassment for his immediate situation. It was intolerable for a Riddle to look worse than average at any gathering.

  "That may have been the least disagreeable trip I've ever taken from Little Hangleton to London," remarked Tom casually and quietly, for it would not do to seem at all amazed by his surroundings. "The train takes so long."

  "Apparition gets more tolerable with experience," said Miss Granger as she sat him at a small table. "Try a butterbeer." She went to the bar and bought two. "It has a tiny bit of alcohol, not enough to worry about."

  He tried it. His mouth liked it, but his recently-emptied stomach didn't trust it. He gave it some time to adjust. "Where are we?"

  "A pub called the Leaky Cauldron," said Miss Granger. "The gateway to Diagon Alley, and a conduit for all walks of wizarding society."

  The pub had quite a large fireplace. Sometimes the flames turned green, and people stepped out of it, or into it, so that was another doorway. Quite a grand couple appeared from the fireplace, beautifully dressed, sparkling with jewels. They had a peculiar little servant with them, with grey skin, huge green eyes, and furry ears. It was dressed in a rag, the maximum contrast possible to the finery of its masters. It rushed around its lady's skirt, removing the faintest traces of ashes from the hem.

  Tom drew close to Miss Granger, although he caught another disturbing whiff of Amortentia when he did so, like opening a door in a storm and realizing he'd been breathing stale, stuffy air before. The sensible thing to do was to close the door and not let the storm in. He did his best to ignore this and spoke quietly. "That couple over there, that's the look we need to go for. Where can we get clothes like that?"

  "What?" This was not the question she'd been expecting.

  "Everyone in this pub treats that couple with utmost respect. Look at how everyone steps aside for them. They didn't have to wait at the bar for their drinks, they got them immediately. That's how the Riddles will be treated."

  "But... you're just trying to blend in unobtrusively. You're not trying to join the aristocracy!"

  "Of course I'm not trying to join the aristocracy," he agreed. "I'm already in it. The wizarding world must simply recognize that."

  "They won't!" she said in a furious whisper. "You're a muggle!"

  "My son's not," said Tom. "If I'm going to raise him, I intend to do it right, and that means giving him the best possible start in life. No Riddle is going to start at the bottom."

  "This is ridiculous!" she said in her furious whisper. "You should count yourself lucky if your half-blood son is tolerated in wizarding society at all!"

  "What's ridiculous is the suggestion that any son of mine would not start at the top," said Tom calmly. "I just have to establish that that's where we belong. I'll start with the clothes."

  "You can't be accepted into pureblood wizarding society by just buying the right clothes!"

  "Of course not. I'll also need accessories, like that little grey thing they have. With the big green eyes."

  Miss Granger closed her eyes and rubbed her temples. Eventually, she said, "That's a house elf. You are not getting one."

  "Maybe not today," he said agreeably, for she clearly felt strongly about this, and it would not do to have an unseemly disagreement in public.

  "Hesper," Draco sighed, but Astoria didn't hear whatever else he had to say. Professor Babbling had turned back to the board again to diagram more logograms. She looked down to check them against her notes, only to find words she had not written appearing in between the symbols she was meticulously copying.

  /Coming to the meeting tonight?/

  The handwriting was untidy, quite unlike her own, and it had simply flowed into existence between eihwaz and setze on the parchment in front of her. Astoria was baffled. She looked around the room for someone pointing their wand at her desk, but everyone had their head bent to their papers.

  /This is Harry Potter, by the way. Sorry to be writing on your homework./ And, of all things, a tiny smiley face appeared next to the statement.

  Astoria whipped around to look at Potter in shock. He smiled at her, and gave a little wave. She turned back to the parchment.

  /We're doing unbinding spells tonight. But we'll go over the patronus charm in a couple of weeks./ Out to the side of this one he had drawn what might have been either a long-legged dog or a short-legged horse, though Astoria suspected it was supposed to be a representation of Potter's patronus. She'd heard it was a deer of some kind.

  Fascinated against her own better judgment, Astoria picked up her quill. /Can you read what I'm writing?/ she wrote, because whatever Potter had done was something she had never seen before, and what if he could do the same thing during an exam?

  When no reply was forthcoming, she turned around in her seat again. "How did you do that?" she mouthed, drawing a curious look from Misty Fraithwaite who sat at the desk behind her.

  /Echo's Cage./

  Astoria blinked. She looked at the words Potter had written, looked over her shoulder again only to see that he had his head bent to his work, and then she blinked again. Echo's Cage? That didn't sound like a spell at all. It sounded, if Potter wasn't just engaged in some obscure form of Gryffindor teasing, like the name of a ritual. Astoria turned the idea over in her head. The funny thing about ritual magic was that it was a bit like putting together a puzzle with a large but still limited number of shapes. Once someone knew all of the shapes, they didn't necessarily have to put them in the right order. They could swap pieces around to make a different picture. Ritual names usually just told you what main pieces were used, so, theoretically at least, a witch or wizard could figure out how to do something based on the name alone. Astoria knew how to make an echo in a ritual, and she knew how to make a cage. She stared thoughtfully down at her parchment, boring logograms forgotten, and then she began to work.

  First the /echo/. She imagined that Potter must have already done most of the work of this for her. After all, from his seat he could probably see her paper well enough to copy her notes, or at least, the runic bits. She always wrote the runes large and spaced them far apart so that they would be easier to study. She carefully erased her margin notes and the random spots of ink, hoping that the clear rune diagrams closely reflected what Potter had copied, and then she meticulously traced Potter's writing in her own hand. Satisfied, she moved on to the next part.

  The cage stumped her for a couple of minutes. There were several ways to make a rune cage, and she had no idea how Potter had gone about it. Finally she decided to just use the two most basic binding runes in the standard size. She etched these quickly all around the border of her paper. She sat back to admire the rather pretty effect all of the runes made when combined while she pondered what sort of thing she might use to empower parchment. What would Potter have used? She highly doubted that the Gryffindor sixth year had some kind of illicit stash of Objects of Power in his school bag. Maybe there was something he could have used in the advanced potions kit? Astoria's own year four kit didn't have anything likely, but who knew what Slughorn had the sixth years brewing.

  Glancing around once to be sure that no one was watching her, Astoria casually scraped the pad of her finger against the edge of her quill. A single drop of blood beaded there, and she dabbed it onto the center of the runes at the four corners of her parchment. /"In cruor, vita,"/ she murmured, pressing her magic forward with a mental effort and hoping that the words were both vague enough and powerful enough to do what she wanted them to do. To her surprise and pleasure, a nearly invisible shimmer ran down the runes on the parchment, almost as though the ink was suddenly wet enough to reflect the sunlight spilling in through the classroom windows.

  Feeling so inordinately smug that she was sure it must show on her face, she picked up her quill again and wrote, /Potter, why are you scribbling all over my notes?/

  /Bravo./ Potter wrote. /I knew you could do it. The first DA meeting is tonight. Are you coming?/

  Astoria had been so pleased with the challenge of unraveling Potter's miniature ritual that she hadn't even stopped to consider what she might write back when she did it. Her lengthy pause didn't go unnoticed.

  /Astoria?/

  Her initial impulse to tell Potter that they were most certainly not on a first name basis was halted by the appearance, in rapid succession, of an itty bitty ink dementor, a frownie face, the dog-horse patronus thing, and a smiley face. To add to the madness, little arrows appeared pointing to the faces and labeling them /Astoria G. without the DA/ and /Astoria G. with the DA/. Oh, Merlin. This had to stop right now. She was starting to think that Harry Potter might actually be endearing, and then she wouldn't be able to eviscerate him in battle.

"Yeah. Once we got the big toe got in, the rest just followed." Harry looked at the back of the van where muffled sobbing could be heard. "So, do we go ahead and drag him to the nearest police station? Or just call and let them pick him up?"

After a moment of contemplation, they went ahead and got a nearby individual to let the local law enforcement know about the guy before going back to their original plan. The candy proved to tide them over till they got to the barbeque joint.

** He had wandered around the globe, without purpose, without direction. Taken where the winds, the sun and the stars led him, he had seen every continent, visited incredible places, and met wonderful people. He owned nothing but the clothes on his body, the wand in his pocket, the guitar on his back, and the few items in the small backpack slung around his shoulder. He didn't care for anything else, didn't need anything else. So long as there was food in his mouth, and a soft bed to sleep in once or twice a month, he didn't really care where he was. But now, he was back. Back in Britain. Back home.

When he'd first gone out, it had felt like he was escaping. Escaping the pressures of his new-found fame, escaping the confines of what his world had turned into. Shaking hands with random pedestrians, because they had recognized him from the papers, enchanting his house, because he might be attacked in his sleep. Slowly, what had seemed marvelous at first, had become oppressive; irritatingly so. The thought of leaving hadn't consciously formed until a year after the Fall, but he knew he'd been playing with it subconsciously quite a long time before that.

When it had registered, the thought wouldn't go away. He spent his nights alone in his shabby apartment. At first, he was dreaming about what to do, out alone, later, he began planning. He included no-one in those plans; not his best friends, nor his family. This would be a solitary undertaking. A quest, not for the greater good, not for the wizarding community, but for him. Just for him. And that had been enough.

*** Harry's got his fingers twisted in the hair along Neville's nape, and things are just starting to look interesting when there's the distinct sound of someone clearing their throat somewhere to Harry's left. Neville jerks away, and Harry makes an annoyed noise, because, honestly, don't people know enough by now not to go snooping in the janitorial storage? There are only two reasons for students to be in there, and both of them work better with the door closed.

“Hermione,” Neville sounds slightly choked, and of /course/ it would be Granger who found them, the busybody. Fuck. That's slightly awkward. Neville won't approve of Harry wiping his best friend's memory.

“Is there something you need to tell me, Neville?”

“It's not what it looks like,” Neville says, and Harry can't help but roll his eyes, even as Granger arches her brows.

“So, what, you tripped on your shoelaces and just happened to land on Potter's mouth -- knocking you both into the closet and pulling the door closed behind you?” Granger may be a know-it-all, busybody bitch, but Harry has to give her points for sarcasm.

“Longbottom's a klutz,” Harry tells her, lets his teeth show when he grins, ignores Neville's sputtering. “And I was strategically positioned.”

** Snape read Harry's article and the ... elk horns that had come along with it.

The essay had been well written, and to the point. Harry pointed out that the cause of the effects of the potion came from the conceptual properties of the potion ingredients being transferred to the potion/cream itself by the usage of magical transference that occurs in the brewing process. Then he pointed out that compared to newt eyeballs, elk horns were much easily obtained and in greater quantities.

The boy then digressed into economical benefits of running a elk farm rather than a newt farm. Unfortunately, that particular bit wasn't on topic, so points were taken.

However, by providing his own material to back up the theory he had written, Harry had essentially earned those points back anyway.

What confused Snape was where Harry might have learned about elk horn usage in potions.

Snape himself didn't know, and he knew for a fact that Dumbledore didn't know.

Was it his family?

He shook his head.

'Where he heard it is not my business,' Snape thought as he graded the paper and moved onto the next. 'But a good read, nonetheless.'

Then he scowled as his own Slytherin's work came up as a chicken scratch.

"Bloody ingrats," he muttered to himself as he bled the paper with his red ink.

** Suddenly a huge jagged bolt of lightning struck powerfully right in the middle of the street, when the light and smoke cleared a thick stench of ozone hung heavily in the air, and there stood the seven foot, noseless figure of the Dark Lord Voldemort. He was accompanied by a triad of masked Death Eaters, and a fourth which was the clearly unmasked form of one Lucius Malfoy.

"Avast! Harry Potter. My great nemesis. You shall not escape me this time. Ha. Ha. Ha. Haa!" Lord Voldemort cackled beneath a 'Sonorus' as the shoppers all took note of what was happening. Many of them took cover, or scattered in flight altogether while the two foes looked one another over with scorn.

Harry turned with confidence, squarely facing his adversary. "Ah, Voldemort. We meet once again, do you like my boots?" gesturing down to the accessory crafted from blue‑grey dragon leather.

"Yes‑sss of course I do, they scream 'Harry Potter: Dragon Slayer.' But now is not the time, for we must duel. Is that not right Lucius‑sss Malfoy?" intoned Voldemort, the ess's dropping off into Parseltongue.

The two traded tremendous blows back and forth, big bright flashes of light and an immense conclave of energy bleeding off the Dark Lord made the duel one for the history books. The First Battle of Diagon Alley it would eventually be named, the opening skirmish in Voldemort's second war.

"Crucio!"

Luna Lovegood went down in agonised screaming and Harry Potter from his knees shouted a big, "Noooo!"

"I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!" The Dark Lord taunted to his disheartened opponent.

Just when things looked to be at their worst a powerful beard stepped into the middle of the battle, protecting the injured Luna and the exhausted Harry. "You cannot hope to win Tom, the light side is more powerful than you can possibly imagine. And Lucius, I cannot say I am surprised to see you here today."

With that the aged Headmaster and the feared Dark Lord begin to battle in earnest. An even more impressive duel broke out with both opponents flaring a Visible Aura, bright flashes of spellfire were unleashed as the two traded thunderous crashes of terrible energy. Eventually the Aurors showed up, witnessing several bone shattering spells harmlessly splash over an Imprimis shield Voldemort somehow cast with wandless abilities, and the team even heard a parting message intoned by the fleeing Dark Lord.

"Avast! You may have won this time Dumbledore, but you cannot stop me forever. For I am invincible, Bwahahaha!"

With that Voldemort and the Death Eaters were gone from Diagon Alley, and the world now knew of the Dark Lord's rebirth.

','

"Harry, why in heaven's name did you keep saying Avast!?" Hermione asked him as he set about removing the glamours which were making him look like Voldemort.

"What?" the black haired fifteen year old answered with a questioning look, "Voldemort speaks in a pirate voice doesn't he?"

Hermione face palmed and Luna, the polyjuice potion charged with Harry's hair running its course, answered with the boy's distinctive tone, "Not as far as I'm aware Harry. You were supposed to go for a kind of sibilant hiss. Remember?"

** "The thief was further ahead than he had expected - and he was closing in more slowly than he should, too. Unless they were on a Firebolt as well, of course! He clenched his teeth - the thieves had stolen enough gold to easily afford one.

The witch shot above the next roof, close enough that he almost expected to see tiles break. She was good - but Harry was better. Yet another series of jinxes, followed by a pair of Stunners. One missed, the other didn't - and the thief's Shield Charm shattered.

Harry grinned. He had her now - his next spell would end the chase.

Hermione Granger pulled hard to the left and down when she felt her shield shatter. She almost ploughed into the roof of a garden shed, but two Stunners missed her - one by what felt like inches. Clenching her teeth, she took a hard right, dropping lower, using the shed as cover. That gained her a second out of her pursuer's line of fire. She used it to recast her Shield Charm and urged her broom on. She just needed to gain a little more distance and she'd have outrun the Anti-Apparition Jinxes...

She flew even closer to the ground, skimming the pavement, and reached the corner of the side alley she was in before another Stunner flew at her. She banked left again - she had to keep flying away from Grimmauld Place - and tried to apparate.

It didn't work. That was the third time! Had the Aurors covered half of London with Anti-Apparition Jinxes? That was impossible! Maybe if she flew straight up... She glanced over her shoulder as she accelerated above the road leading to the bus station, and gasped. Her pursuer - it had to be Harry, no one else flew as well and as fast - was diving at her from above!

She pulled up and rolled, almost losing control of her broom when another Stunner splashed against her shield and forced her off-course. She managed to recover and pull up in the last moment before she slammed into a parked car.

Hermione kept rolling as she banked right, narrowingly missing a wrought-iron fence and a lamp post, diving into another side alley for a second. Now she had to be out of range! She focused - and cursed some more. Apparition was still blocked!

And there came Harry again, closer than before - she spotted the marker behind her. And red flashes as he cast Stunners at her. Her shield was gone, but she was twisting her broom into desperate rolls, and the spells missed her again. She pulled up, then dived down - any straight course would let him conjure obstacles in her path.

There was the corner. She grit her teeth as she forced her broom to take a sharp turn to the left - sharper than wise at her speed - and pulled up, heading straight for a taller building. A glance behind her showed that Harry's marker was taking the same turn - and tighter than she had. This wouldn't work either - he was just too good on his broom.

She jinked left and right, then shot down to the ground. Muggles were walking around there, unaware - Harry wouldn't be able to cast at her here. But neither would she be able to lose him.

She was panting, sweat running down her neck as she bent low over the shaft of her broom and tried to get a little more speed out of it. Another attempt to apparate failed. And she was coming up to a crossing - with several cars and a few pedestrians.

She recast her Shield Charm again, then veered right. She had to lose Harry! She spotted a park ahead. Maybe she could lose him in the trees there... No, he'd follow her in. And he was the better flyer. And a conjured wall between the trees would be fatal.

Short of the park's entrance, she veered off again. She had one surprise left. There was a side alley. Very narrow. It was risky - foolhardy even. But what choice did she have?

She rolled and jinked, more spells missing her. As soon as she rose above street level, to a height where muggles wouldn't notice anything amiss, Harry's Stunners came at her. But low on the ground, she would hit someone sooner or later.

She urged her broom forward, spending a precious moment to calculate the angles. Nudging her broom a little to the right, she flicked her wand. A sticky line shot out of her wand, the Chameleon-Tongue Spell wrapping itself around the lamp post on the corner. She felt as if her arm was wrenched out of its socket as she was pulled to the side, but managed to hold on as she whirled around the lamp post, straight towards the side alley."

Now the Foe-Glass suddenly perked up. It was ghostly and fuzzy. People unfamiliar with Muggle technology would likely have just passed it off as a shadow. However, Snape knew better. It was a missile or bomb. And judging by the size of it, a big one.

He feigned a look of concern. Turning to Voldemort, he said, "Sir, I'd like to scour the grounds to make sure there are no Muggles or wizards eavesdropping on us. I'll be back in a moment. If you don't hear me come back in, say, five minutes, come and help as I'll be in danger."

Voldemort nodded. "Be my guest, Severus. We'll hold off on the grand finale until you come back."

With that, Snape Apparated out of there. He reappeared on a hill about a mile away where he would have a good view of the target zone.

Quivering with anticipation, they waited for the explosion to subside. Meanwhile, they received a message from Wizard that he was all right.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

I knew there'd be some good ones in here. I wonder if I can influence the spell through intent. I try the spell again, focusing on the words 'mortal' and 'doom'.

  'Mortal Doom, Dr. Evil.' Hmm. Well it appears you can influence the spell, but 'Dr.' seems a bit too muggle and not vengeful all-powerful God enough for me. I give it another shot.

  'Dr. Doom, Evil Mortal.' No doctors! And I am not mortal! I will rule forever! I don't think my influencing is helping the spell any. Let's just see what it comes up with on it's own now.

  'Diva Lord Meltmoor.' Umm... I don't even know what to think about that one. But my instincts are screaming 'No way, sister!'

  I think I might need to reevaluate the trust I place in my instincts.

"Dobby?" Lucius asked in disbelief. "Thank god you've come here to rescue me."

"Dobby didn't come here to rescue you," Dobby disagreed.

"Then . . . why?"

"You is Dobby's bitch now," the house elf said savagely. "Dobby traded his Galleons to nice Uncle Bubba."

"No," Lucius said in horror. "No . . . NOOOOOOOOOOO."

** “As soon as he was given the antidote, Severus felt the numbing effects of the veritaserum overdose fade. In its place, fury and betrayal such as he had not felt in years filled him. He seized his wand from Molly Weasley's hands.

"Severus, I apologize for --" Dumbledore began.

"Today you have violated me as surely as the Dark Lord ever has," Severus interrupted. Nothing that you can say can forgive this, old man. I gave you everythingin exchange for your promise to protect Lily. Yet still she died. Later, I swore my continued service to protect her worthless son, asking you only to let me retain my privacy. Today, you broke those terms. Twice broken, never mended.

Severus looked up. The phoenix had, as usual, refused to enter Grimmauld Place. No matter. He shouted, "Hellspawn! I surrender! I agree to your terms." I will have my vengeance, no matter the cost.

The moment he called, the phoenix appeared. Severus felt a jolt of power flow from the creature to him. Flames covered him, yet he did not burn. All of the texts he had read had described phoenix fire as a comforting warmth.

They were wrong.

Perhaps if Severus had accepted the phoenix when he had first appeared, it would have been different. None of his extensive research had found anything to suggest that phoenixes remained invisible to others before bonding. From that, he suspected that either very few had ever refused an offer to bond, or else his phoenix was more stubborn than most. Severus had been at his emotional nadir when he met the phoenix. The phoenix's fires might have felt comforting then, a welcoming hearth after a long, cold day.

He was in a very different mindset now.

His rage and the phoenix fire burned as one. They consumed him. He blazed, a figure of wrath and pain and vengeance.

The treacherous Order backed away from him in fear, as was only right.

"Come. We have a prisoner to rescue," Severus said.”

** Hard to do without any other clues, but I found this one fun. The excerpt is about halfway in. It's Sirius' thoughts on the situation at hand.

/Well,/ he thought/, At least I know he's a good kid, well, as good as the son of a Mafia Lord can be. And he knows me. I've been able to be a part of his life, even if I didn't know it at the time... How the hell did I not figure it out? It's so obvious! Green eyes, black hair, bad eyesight, MAGIC! But then, everyone knows (well, thought) that he was actually Sal's kid. And I wasn't looking for Harry, I thought I knew that he was hidden in a safe spot, which wouldn't be here./

  Then was the day of the winter solstice, and only three stood in a small stone chamber, saying vows they had said times before. Vows that felt written into their hearts and on their skin, floating inside their bones in blood they gently spilled into a bowl that Flitwick held, voice gentle and commanding.

  They held hands and watched magic rise and twine and gather and release. They saw yellow tying together emerald green and violet-blue in a fragile thread, a knot over their heart. So delicate, and yet so strong.

  /Two are stronger than one. For when one would fail, two would prosper./

  Flitwick's final words, as he held their hands in his own.

  Then yellow swirled and was gone, collapsing upon itself out of existence.

  Then they, too, fell upon themselves, in a fever of magic and emotion.

  And between them, slender and strong as a spider's web, their souls grasped one another tightly and didn't let go.

** “Draco?”

The squeal that echoed through the house was quite impressive and Harry was startled that he had caused such a reaction in his best friend. Granted, he hadn't announced his presence when he had climbed the stairs to the third floor of Grimmauld Place and located the bedroom now belonging to the blonde. He also had expected to push open the door and find Draco standing in front of a mirror, wearing a skirt.

“DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO KNOCK?!” Draco was blushing so intensely that he thought he might spontaneously combust, twisting to view his friend with a nervous looking glare. He was barefoot, his shaggy hair in pigtails, wearing a t-shirt that hung off one of his shoulders and a black pleated skirt with red edging. Certainly not what Harry was expecting to see.

The two stood awkwardly, staring at one another as Harry quietly closed the door behind himself - clearly Draco hadn't wanted to be discovered.

“That's, uh, quite the outfit, Draco...” he spoke slowly, finding that his eyes skimmed over his friends body from top to bottom, several times. The blonde nervously tugged on the front of his skirt, pulling it down as though trying to cover more of himself.

“Not a word, Potter,” was the response, silver eyes glancing to where Draco's wand lay on his bed. The summer had treated him well and he continued to grow, the skirt making already long legs look even better.

“Are you... wearing panties?”

Draco moved quickly, it seemed, and Harry suddenly found himself outside the bedroom with a solid wood door slammed in his face.

** "I'm sorry," Harry said. And they were silent for a few moments.

"What do you miss?" she asked. She feared he wouldn't answer. That the question would be too invasive for him to answer. She knew that some reporters had tried to get him to do an interview about the accident. But he'd refused.

"Hermione," Harry said. Gabrielle just stared at him. For some reason that answer surprised him.

"Why?" she asked.

"Hermione was the first one to really make me not feel alone," Harry said.

"Whether it was at school or after. She was the one that was always there. I mean I didn't want to fall for her. I knew Ron liked her. And it would have been so much easier to not. But she was the first girl that actually spoke to me and was nice to me. What else was I supposed to do?" He let his voice trail off.

"I don't know," Gabrielle said quietly. Harry barely heard her.

** Voldemort was severely angry with his Mirror. Harry gripped the balustrade as his scar continued to hurt.

He made his way through the Dursley's house, now cleaned from the mess his arrival had created. He heard his aunt chopping vegetables in the kitchen rather vigorously. The little dog in the hallway growled at his approach.

Petunia turned around, holding the knife up. "What do you want now?"

He gripped the table as that strange feeling overcame him again. "Nothing."

"You look like you need a cup of tea." She went back to hacking her vegetables for her stew, and did not lift a single finger to put the kettle on to boil.

He looked around, wincing in pain. Harry needed to be distracted from the uneasy feelings he felt, so he asked questions, hoping to find out a little more about this world. "Are you in contact my mother?"

Petunia's knife paused. "No, not since..." She tensed. "I do not have contact with the freaks of your world."

"Er, how-how is Dudley?" He figured he should've started with a question that would've softened her a little.

Petunia grabbed a handful of chopped carrots and dropped them into the pot. "He has recovered from his injuries, and was almost expelled from Smeltings for unruly behaviour and obtaining drugs. Vernon thought it was best to get him away from here, and take him somewhere for a holiday to harden him up again."

"Right..."

"Your people killed our neighbours, Dudley's friends, and tortured many. We were so terrified. Out of all the streets in the world, why pick this one? Was it some sick joke from your side? What did you tell them to make them come here?" she spat.

"Aunt Petunia, they all know I have Muggle relatives---"

"I'll never forget the look on your face when you tried to wake Dudley."

"Why's that?"

"It was as though you were torn. I can't describe it." Petunia closed her eyes. "It was as though you were half happy, half sad. It was only a split second, but I could see it burning in your eyes... then you knocked me unconscious."

He could clearly sense the mistrust in his aunt.

"What happened to your brother?" she asked.

"I just killed him."

"You're keeping secrets."

"Of course I am."

She pursed her lips. "Two days after the attack on my street, I went to your brother's funeral. That was the last I saw of your mother... Your father almost cursed me when I mentioned my doubts about you, and Mr Dumbledore walked away from me. Everyone brushed me off, saying that Harry had made a mistake not killing my son."

Harry thought that was a bit harsh. "What's the Muggle---I mean---your world without us like?"

"Horrible. This mist," Petunia waved at the foggy weather outside the kitchen window, "has been a phenomenon in the U.K for many years. It's quite rare that we get two days in a row without it clouding our vision, and some say it's getting worse and thicker. It's spreading to the continent. From what I heard from your lot, it's because of those /Dementeds/ breeding."

"Dementors," said Harry, gently correcting her.

"Normal people are disappearing in record numbers. Others end up like vegetables or insane and then there are people who turn up dead---bitten to shreds. Then homes and buildings are destroyed.

"The government knows and is terrified -- but they made up a story that it's terrorism from the Green Skulls.

"Two Prime Ministers have been killed by the /Dementeds/ in the last twenty-eight years. People are scared and leaving the UK in droves and there's a curfew after dark. In many cities the army has been employed to keep the streets safe. What good are tanks, when they're dealing with your lot? No one helps us. The U.N turns a blind eye, and the other countries don't help us much because they know that only wizards can fight wizards. The bad side is so powerful, so they kill us for fun.

"It's mass murder, Harry. It's genocide of the Normal folk." She pointed her finger into his direction. "It's your people destroying our world!"

So this is life if Neville had died and if Voldemort had never been vanquished. Harry was shivering. "That's just horrible."

She laughed. "What an understatement." Petunia stirred the pot, the gentle steam giving off a pleasant savoury aroma. "Now, if you please, I'd like to enjoy my dinner alone." But she did ladle a bowl full of stew for him to eat. Full to the brim, which was something she never did in his world.
