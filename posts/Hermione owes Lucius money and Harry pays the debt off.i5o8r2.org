This might be a fic where Harry's really involved in politics. The title is a very small part of the story, sorry I can't remember anything more.


** Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality had something similar, but I guess it's not that.

**** Chapter 81 is where the scene is, but Hermione is not in debt, but she's convicted with an attempted murder against Draco and Harry pays reparations.
