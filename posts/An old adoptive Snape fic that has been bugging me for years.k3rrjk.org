:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Alright so, when I was younger, I went through a Dad!Snape phase. I'm not really in that anymore but nevertheless I went through it and when I was younger and did so, I came across one fic that has since been lost to time and has been driving me nuts for so long.

​

I can't remember a lot of it, but I do remember some key details. Harry gets stuck on a mission with Severus on an Island i believe? where they have to go and collect something.

​

I can't remember if Harry and Draco became brothers but they at least went from being more then rivals. Harry was still friends with Hermione and Ron though it could be shaky, and they lived in a mansion.

​

And if i'm not mistaking it was a trilogy of fics. I know this isn't a lot to go on but it was such a long time ago, so I lost it and more then anything I just want to find it so it stops driving me nuts wondering what fic it was.


** It's the Somewhere I Belong Trilogy by shadowarwen

** I think it's the Psychic Serpent Trilogy by Barb linkffn(288212;699701;1370920).

Certain parts don't happen until a certain point in the trilogy but I think it should be this.

*** Thank you for sharing. Looks interesting but this doesn't seem to be it. I don't think anyone but Snape and Harry (and the Dursleys) appear in the first few chapters of the story i'm thinking of.

​

certainly the Island stuff (if it even is on an island) is the very, very beginning of their adventure.

** is it the one where I think Petunia gets leukemia or something and Harry gets his marrow taken, but Petunia still dies and Harry gets taken by death eaters and they use needles to torture him, but Snape rescues him and Draco then gives him his wand when he changes sides?
