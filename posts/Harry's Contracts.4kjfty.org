** linkffn(9774121)

It's a good Harry/Daphne story. The contract itself isn't the central focus, but it does play a large role in the plot, and the story just recently updated.

** Why would you get major flak? Even in the books Marriage contracts are technically an implied thing (albeit out of favor).

I too enjoy marriage contract stories if they are well done and do not feel "forced" or utilizing characters that could NEVER in a million years work.
