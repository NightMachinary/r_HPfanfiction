If you are quite fond of this pairing you probably already read it, if not I invite you to give it a go :

#+begin_quote
  A book left by Sirius opens Harry's eyes as he delves into the mysteries of magic, learns about the realities of a war, and shifts towards the Grey. Meanwhile, Daphne Greengrass is faced with an unusual solution that involves the Boy-Who-Lived, but could be more trouble than it's worth. And in the end, there is always a price to be paid for everything. HP/DG Contract, 6-7th year
#+end_quote

Starting with a simple, and classic idea (a marriage contract), the author quickly goes deeper with a big part related to the (canon) war, replacing in a way the 7th book. And the bit of Harry/Daphne interaction are just quite well written if you ask me. You don't have any trouble believing teenagers would act like that.

Updates are frequent. Basically three times a month, most generally the 3rd / 13rd / 23rd.

Give it a read !


** *Pros*

- Regular updates

- A few decent world building ideas (e.g. the different types of occlumency)

- Good action, on the one occasion the author actually put Harry in a combat situation (wedding)

- Strong Harry

- Harry/Daphne that isn't insta-love

- Okay character voices

- Slightly above average characterisation (e.g. no absurd caricatures)

*Cons*

- Pacing. Good god, the pacing. This fic could easily be rewritten down to about 50k words without losing any of the plot or characterisation points. The author just lingers endlessly on plot points. He seems to think that forcing the reader to stew on the same idea for 10 successive chapters is the same thing as realism. Yes, in real life things take a long time and progress in tiny increments. But fiction isn't real life. Realism isn't achieved by replicating real life (else conversations would go on for pages and pages without moving anything forward), but by capturing some essence of real life and distilling it in fiction form.

- Rambling. To make the pacing worse, the author often goes off on rambling technical tangents on the most boring topics imaginable: sub-clauses of marriage contracts and the legal principles guiding their interpretation, for example. If you took all the talk on that topic alone from this fic you'd probably save at least 40k words. Which brings us to the next point...

- Repetition. The author just rehashes the same conversations again and again, often between the same characters. The "explanation of the marriage contract" conversation was had about 20 times in the first 10 chapters. We got it the first time. We also had explanations of occlumency and magical theory being repeated again and again. Then there was the trust issues with Daphne in Grimmauld Place. Then there was the "killing in war" discussion, which was still going on at the time I quit the fic (and was completely stupid: there is almost no moral dilemma in killing enemy soldiers in a war, even the Order does it in canon). That conversation was had every chapter for the last 7 chapters or so before I stopped. This comes back to pacing: the author wants to make things take a lot of time, but he doesn't actually have any content to fill that time, so he just has the characters have the same conversations ad infinitum.

- Lack of story direction. The story feels unfocused, like it hasn't been planned much. The pacing contributes to this: 400k words with almost zero plot progress. But another big factor is plot advancements that make previous plotlines completely redundant. Harry absorbing Voldemort's memories, for example, makes the previous endless chapters of Harry studying magic pointless. The author may as well have cut them, because the end result is the same.

- Romance. For all that the author tried to make the romance progress in tiny stages, they failed miserably. When the romance did finally arrive, it arrived with all the elegance of a car crash. So what we're left with is 370k words of Harry and Daphne hating each other, then suddenly bam! In just a few conversations they're opening up to each other. The author wrote himself into a hole, really. He went too far in the opposite direction from insta-love. By the time we got to the point where Harry/Daphne was happening, he'd made the reader absolutely hate Daphne and made all possibility of a relationship look absurd.

- Inconsistency. The author pulls off a classic fan fiction error: making things happen in a certain way because the he wanted them to happen that way, not for any rational reason. E.g. Harry has absorbed Voldemort's memories, including his skills and instincts, but nonetheless needs Hermione's help with arithmancy, didn't know how to obliviate someone, and doesn't completely smash Daphne in a duel.

- Shitty magical theory. Magical cores. Direct access to horcruxes. Nuff said.

*** This critique may seem harsh, but I'd have to agree. The pacing is off and the writing is very long winded.

*** I used to look forward to the updates but lately I don't even care. I used to read every word but now I just skim through the chapters.

It's a good idea but it's just too dang learn with nothing going on. I was looking forward to the new Harry/TMR persona but it seems to be the same old Harry with a desire to kill death eaters.

*** I agree with you on several points, especially with the Pacing / Repetition stuff.

However I disagree on some other points :P Romance was not so bad written as far as I am concerned, and it tooks more than few chapters to come at this state. And quickly about this :

Results may be the same, but the character development, the story and the background is not. You can at least some some progression, which is for me even better than "ok, harry didn't really study before. Now he doesn't need it anymore. Lazy ass"
