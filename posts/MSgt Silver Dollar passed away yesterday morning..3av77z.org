** It's always sad to see writers pass away. Because we feel so close to them after knowing their stories, it painfully reminds us of our own mortality.

** One reason I'm so grateful for the reddit hpff community is that news like this (that I probably would have unfortunately missed in the past) can be shared and seen by those of us who "know" and appreciate an author's work. It's not much, but it's nice to be able to lift up a prayer or sentiment for the families involved.
