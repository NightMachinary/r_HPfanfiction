Okay, so here's my idea:

After a lifetime of forced starvation due to the Dursley's abuse, Harry Potter upon arriving at Hogwarts develops an increasingly severe eating disorder. By the end of his second year he becomes so colossally fat that he causes the levitation charm (or whatever) on one of the Shifting Staircases to fail nearly killing himself and his friends. After this humiliation, he decides that enough is enough and he goes to Dumbledore for help who sends him to Fat Camp (name to be determined) for the summer. To maintain the family protection charm thingy Dudley is sent too.

Once at Fat Camp, Harry is surprised to find Neville Longbottom (his Grandma made him go) and the two team up to conquer their waistbands. They'll need each others support too, because apart from Dudley's bullying there's also dark forces at work that's making the fitness focused camp counselor's into sadistic slave drivers. Long story short they beat the bad guys, get swole as *FUCK*, and all in time for their third year of class at Hogwarts. At the very end Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle attempt to ambush Harry on the Hogwarts Express, but they underestimate his gains. While Harry's beating the ever-loving shit out of Draco, Neville /dominates/ Crabbe and Goyle into brutal submission with his raw animal power! After reducing Draco to a quivering bloody pulp, Harry and Neville return to their cabin victorious like the champions they are.

And that's it. Also, I'll imply Hermoine has a crush on Neville now because not only is he a man mountain, he also accidentally drops a kettle bell on Scabbers smushing him flat.

So does this qualify as bashing? There'll be fat jokes aplenty, but its all in good fun. I don't want this story to come at Harry's expense by making fun of fat people, I want him to overcome his weight problems and have a positive message about getting fit. I'm thinking the tone will be really light. This story would be short too (maybe 50,000-60,000 words?). I'm trying to think up what to write for this coming summer and I think this is a pretty good premise.

PS: Besides the bashing, don't hesitate to let me know if you think this idea is stupid too, please. I have thick skin, I can take it. Also, has this been done before?

Thanks.
