It has to be mostly canon complaint (not inclusive of cursed child) . No bashing and preferably no romance. Also no weird pairings like Hermione/Snape, Harry/Daphne(Ik it's quite popular but avoid that if possible).


** I don't know if this is up your alley, but I would recommend the [[http://www.jamespotterseries.com/][James Potter series]], by George Norman Lippert. They're written in a very similar style to that of Rowling, so they become quite easy to read and immerse yourself in them. The books were even endorsed by Rowling herself. There's a total of 5 main books, and 2 "spinoffs" that elaborate a little more some of the character backgrounds. Yeah, you read that right, novel-length books. They can be found in several places if you google them, including the author's site that I just linked in this post.

Good luck with your search.

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Linkffn(Strangers at Drakeshaugh) is something of a slice-of-life fic when Harry and Ginny's kids are young.

** linkao3(Raindrops on Roses by backinyourbox). OK, there is plenty of romance (but no smutt, it is mostly PG-13), but there is much more than that. I really liked it.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
