***** I love how it says "Ron bashing" and then it's just everyone being an ass and bullying Ron whose only "fault" is being a bit clumsy and slightly childish.

"You're so insensitive!" -Hermione, after repeatedly saying extremely cruel things about Ron in front of him and to him, after he says she will one day get a heart attack from the excitement from spells, which, while childish, is not in any way harmful and can be taken as a joke.

Edit:

Rin: /Says that he thought they were all going to die painfully/ Harry: /Ignores the fact Ron still went with him despite thinking he would die there/ "yOu sCuM! yOu'Re nOt mY bEsT fRiEnD aNyMoRe!" /Breaks bond which requires strong feelings from both sides. After he, alongside with Hermione, had bashed Ron into the ground several times just in the first chapter, meaning Harry probably saw Ron as just a toy to bully. Also, it could only break if one if the Wizards perceived betrayal. Not magic. But the wizard./ "sEe iT wOuLdN't bReAk iF bOtH sIdEs hAd sTrOnG fEeLiNgs!"

Ginny, who also bashed Ron and bullied him: "I'm DiSaPpOiNtEd iN yOu."

******* For me, bashing is more like the character behaving stupidly or evilly or whatever. The above comment sounds more like Harry and Hermione-bashing, portraying them as asshole bullies.

Which part of it sounded "wow this fic is so terrible it says Ron bashing but it's really just everyone bullying Ron I despise this and am [[/r/veryangry][r/veryangry]] I think I should drop this but note before writing a Looooooooong complaint letter on every social media I can find and giving it 0 stars out of 5"
