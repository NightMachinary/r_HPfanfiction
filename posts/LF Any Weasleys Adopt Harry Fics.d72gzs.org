Are there any completed fics where the Weasleys adopt Harry? I realized I've read loads of Harry gets adopted stories- Snape, McGonagal, Grangers, OC muggles, Sirius (duh), Remus, etc.- but never that Molly and Arthur adopt him, which is crazy to me.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.

  Molly always wanted to have children, but when the unthinkable happens, her path to motherhood takes a twisting, winding turn. AU. COMPLETE. Now with an epilogue!

** Nightmares of Future Past has this, but it's obviously a time travel fix-it/Redo whatever fic. But I thought it was pretty great for that plot, even with Harry being from the future. Because, yah know, the Weasleys on their part still got to act like he was just a normal kid and stuff, so...there was value in that. Having their viewpoint on adopting Harry. And his "adult" behaviors only furthered their opinions on his mental state from the abuse and all. So that was great.
