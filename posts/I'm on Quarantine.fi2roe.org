So boys and girls, this person here. You know, this person is stuck on quarantine.

So you know the drill. What's some good stories to kill now that I'm off work.

Funny, sad, deep, smutty anything you name. I'll read.

I'm just going to crawl into bed


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is always one of my go-tos; also here's a mix of a wide variety of fics: linkffn(The Granger Principle by Starfox5; The Augurey by La-Matrona; Forbidden by Savageland; The Young Adventurer's Club by artemisgirl; The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) linkao3(Into the Fold by pasi; Swung by Serafim by flamethrower; The King's Indian Attack by Nectere). I'm going to plug my own series as well, which starts with linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn).

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.

  Aurora Sinistra spends most of her time watching the stars. She's no centaur, but she's better than Trelawney. In the summer of 1991, she has a plan redeem the reputation of Slytherin House, and maybe some of the people inside it. Recruiting Severus Snape to help her over a game of chess, the two teachers undertake a gambit of their own that leads the Boy-Who-Lived and the Brightest Witch of Her Age into Slytherin House and friendships with Draco Malfoy.However, there is something strange going on at the school. Can the three figure out what it is that Professor Quirrell is up to and stop it? How will the changes in House and friendships effect Harry's relationship with Dumbledore and the headmaster's plans?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth.

** Well full disclaimer this is my fic but According to the comments I've gotten it makes people laugh, so I figure if you are stuck in Quarantine for a while, you might need a little Humor sometimes. Just fair warning, his story is pure Crack .

Here is the link: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22273192/chapters/53191642]]

If you don't enjoy the fic I recommend

A Black Comedy, It's always good for a laugh. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/31/A-Black-Comedy]]

And if neither of these fic work try check out the Terry Pratchett discworld novels, Going Postal is Hilarious.

Yay self-promotion!

I was originally going to post away longer list but Reddit said it was too long.

  The war is ended , and the world along with it. It wasn't the dark in the end , nor the light.It was the muggles , and their cure for magic. How can they learn how to survive in a world where they are hunted for what they are.(Post HBP , goes wildly off canon from there , character deaths , ZOMBIES and post apocalyptic / Dystopian world)

  Contrary to what she claimed, it wasn't grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste she smelled.A mind-boggling amalgamation of confusion followed by a peripheral realization, and then instantaneous fear made her flush so severely that the room went fuzzy around the edges of her vision as she choked out the lie.It was old parchment housed in the restricted section, tart green apples, and something spicy---not cinnamon, cloves?---that lingered inside her nostrils. She was woozy, her lids drooping heavily, even as a small part of her brain screamed at how wrong this was. A larger, louder part of her shoved the shame down in favor of baser instincts. Those instincts dampened and dissipated and the shame crowded in the further removed she was from the delicate, unmistakable scent wafting from the cauldron.WINNER of Mischief Managed Award (Best Recently Completed Story) 2019 Enchanted AwardsWINNER of Summer Lovin' Award (Best Love Story) 2019 Enchanted Awards

**** It about a 40 year old Harry who has a career as a carpenter, Lily is still in Hogwarts but Al and James are graduated. To outsiders he is happily married to Ginny, but it soon becomes clear in the story that their marriage is long over and that Ginny has somebody else in her life.

Ginny gets murdered and Harry and his friends and family need to catch Ginny's killer. To the ministry it is an old tale of jealousy and a love gone wrong, while Harry and his friends quickly suspect political motives.

It is a great "who-dune-it" and "catch the conspirators" with plenty of plot twists. There is a huge side order of slash and the main pairing can be off-putting (I did not read it for almost a decade bc I said "oh, no way!") , but the plot gets you through this.
