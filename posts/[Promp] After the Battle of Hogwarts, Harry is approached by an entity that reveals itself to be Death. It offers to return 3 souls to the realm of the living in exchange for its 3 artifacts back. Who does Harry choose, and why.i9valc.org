** Remus, Tonks, and Fred. Having grown up without his parents he could never let that happen to someone else if he could prevent it, so he would bring back Teddy's parents. I wanted to say Dobby, but I don't think he is selfish enough to bring someone who means a lot to him (mostly) when he could bring back someone who matters to him and the closest thing he had to family.

*** I would completely agree. He would definitely bring back both of Teddy's parents. Then he would have the choice of Sirius, Lily, James, Dobby, for himself but I can't see canon Harry choosing to bring back someone who really only means something to himself. Therefore, the only real choice left would be Fred.

*** This is the real answer. Canon Harry wouldn't pick Sirius or his parents over Fred or Teddy's parents. Especially not after DH

** Tonks: He agonized over this choice, but he settled for her because Andromeda would otherwise lose too much

Fred: For Ginny, Ron, Arthur, and Molly

Lily: He deserved to be a little selfish here, he also thought that James, Sirius, and Remus might want to stay together

** I think Remus, Tonks, and Fred.

Remus and Tonks: Teddy doesn't deserve to not know his parents properly and Harry wouldn't want another child to be an orphan like him.

Fred: The Weasleys wouldn't be the same without the two twins.

*** It could happen if death tricked him, for example: death says he will resurrect a person for each Hallow, but after he gives them back death doesn't give him the chance to choose and just resurrects whoever it wants.

** Probably chose between Cedric, the first victim of the war; Tonks and/or Remus, for little Teddy; and Fred, for the Weasley Family.

*** Since this occurs after DH I can't see Harry choosing Cedric over Fred (I think Tonks and Remus are a definite as I can't see Harry letting Teddy lose either of his parents). While seeing Cedric die tore Harry up he really doesn't know Cedric and is much more emotionally attached to the Weasleys and Fred.
