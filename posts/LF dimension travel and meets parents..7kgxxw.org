I have found a lot of fics recently where harry travels to another dimension/reality and meets his parwnts and/or siblings, but in every damn fic so far, Harry either hides who he is from his parents, or refuses to acknowledge them as his parents, and it is annoying the hell out of me. (Why does every damn author decide that Harry cant reveal who he is, or that alternate!parents cant also be his parents? -rant over) So if anyone would be so kind to link fics where Harry meets travels dimension and meets his parents, and there is a teary meeting, and lots of hugging from his mum and dad, then please link them!


** The closest to what you want that i've read (i love this genre as well) is linkffn(Too Far From Home), it starts with Harry not acknowledging them as his parents(James is the most impacting of the two, surprisingly) but eventualy ends up wanting them for him too. Its still ongoing, in fact was updated recently. Just a heads up if you haven't read, its angst filled and there's mention of abuse. This is the only one of the genre that i've found that is either complete or ongoing, every other is always abandoned.

  Transported into a parallel universe, Harry finds himself in the shadow of an evil growing force. Amidst old and new faces and the chance for a family that he never had, Harry must come to the terms that although there are two worlds, there can only be one hero. *AU Dimension travel, No slash, Abuse, Contains Angst*
