I'm in love with Sirius Black and his animagus Padfoot. Always have and will prob love him till i die. Anyway, does anyone know and good Harry and Sirius stories with enphasis on Padfoot? Padfoot aww scenes? or Padfoot as Harry's pet?

I like to trade titles i've read, here's some stories i do know of.

Would love some nice long stories but i don't mind shorts. Besides that, anything goes i guess..

Thanks!!
