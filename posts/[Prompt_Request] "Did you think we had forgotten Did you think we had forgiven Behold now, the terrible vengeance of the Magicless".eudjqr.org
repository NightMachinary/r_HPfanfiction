/"Death to the Dark, and Death to MAGIC!"/

A group of squibs, filled with hate and jealousy develop an anti-magic tool, lethal to any magic user and corrosive to magical items and buildings. They unleash it during the Battle of Hogwarts, killing or severely crippling every fighter on both sides.

(Shamelessly copied from the Wrathgate)

This happens during book 4 IIRC. Dumbledore is evil/manipulative though.

  It's the day of the First Task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and the last people that Harry ever expected to be there to see him before he was to face the dragon was the Dursleys, or even the other revelations that would be revealed. H/Hr. Some Draco bashing.
