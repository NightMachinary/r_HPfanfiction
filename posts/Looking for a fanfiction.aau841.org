I've been trying to find a fanfiction that I used to read in high school (which was about 6 years ago so it might not even be around anymore) about the marauders and Lily when they were at Hogwarts.

This is everything that I remember about the story: it took place during their 7th year, Lily was really good friends with the marauders and also had 2 female friends that I believe ended up dating Remus and Sirius (or at the very least there were hints that it was going that direction), and James and Lily were head boy and girl and had their own private dorm/apartment-like place together. I believe they started dating shortly into the series and I know that one of the last chapters I read at the time was called "Sit With Me, Potter" and involved Lily and James sitting out in the snow.

Please, if anyone can help me track down this story I would be eternally grateful!

Thanks!
