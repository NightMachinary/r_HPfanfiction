I'm just curious, for an average fic (precluding one-shots of course) what is a length that makes you satisfied? I know that many readers will see a fic and if it's too long, will avoid reading it altogether so, what's your ideal length for a fic?


** Long enough to tell its story and no longer.

** 2-10k words per chapter is my sweet spot. 60k - 200k words per story. I usually dont read anything under 20k as most authors seem to stop writing their idea prior to then.

Edit: I will happily read longer fics, but finding a good one happens maybe once in a blue moon if lucky.

*** I'm writing a Harry/Daphne one shot right now. It's only 6k so far in 3 days, but man, I already feel like pulling my hair out. Don't get me wrong, I've been having a blast writing it so far, but by the 5k words mark I was really drained. I respect all those authors that can pull around 10k chapters a week like it's nothing,

***** As I said, it's a oneshot and still a W.I.P, so it will take me some time before I publish it. It's around 7k words so it will probably end up at 15k by the time I finish. I already have half of scenes written, only the middle part is missing(for some reason I always prefer to write both, the intro and the ending, at the same time). And, as I said, I've had a pretty good time writing it. Still, I'm trying my best to make it fluffy and serious without going overboard.

** well see, if you're a degenerate like me, you won't mind fics all the way up to 900k words, and NEED fics 100k+(seriously tho, in five years I've read something around 1020 fics, majority over 100k words. It's like crack for me). It took me a long time to give in and finally start reading fic below 100k, and when searching, it definitely helps you find some good stuff.

chapter lengths are ideal around 2-6k, but sometimes longer or shorter is ok, I've even read a fic that had a 28k word /chapter/

seriously tho the amount that some people write... 100k words is like a typical full length novel.

** Depends on how good it is.

The better the fic, the longer it can go and be put up with. Personally, my favorite have all been long, good fics over 150K words, but that is not a requirement. I also have kind of a weird thing where if something doesn't sit with me right, I just move on to something else immediately.

** As long as the chapters aren't too short (sub 2k), I don't particularly care how long a story is. In fact, I actually prefer the super long fics because they keep you in their world for multiple sittings and it feels comfortable going back to it again and again.

** Depends on the story, but I mostly stick to 200-500k words. Chapter length preference is 5-7k words, but I'm not opposed to reading anything over 7k if I'm enjoying the story. I'll be hard pressed to click on anything with less 4k.

I will say though Methods of Rationality and A Marauder's Plan are unacceptable in that they basically cover one year and are north of 600k words.

** I have the tendency to prefer one-shots of 5,000 words or more because they encapsulate a full story that I have the satisfaction of knowing how it ends. For long stories, I'm open to any length so long as it holds my attention and does not exceed over 500,000 words. Quite a few of my favourite fics tend to be abandoned, so I actively search out stories that are already complete, or by authors who have a solid track record of finishing.

** Am I the only one who doesn't pay attention to the word counts? I've honestly never even looked at those besides making sure it's not a drabble. There are some fics that do drag on - like Gabriel by Shikatanai for instance has a lot written but it doesn't go anywhere really. I love the story but the pace killed me when I last read it. If the the fic is well written, characters are actually in character, and the plot is interesting, I don't care how long it is. I do try avoiding 60+ chapters because that seems excessive but that being said I read Kurinoone's Darkness Within and loved it. It was one of the first fics I read. Slow pace stories are the worse but if it's well written and I'm honestly enjoying it - I'm super happy to see the scroll bar on my phone be barely visible because of the length. (Every update of thebiwholived's An Hour of Wolves makes my heart happy even with the heart wrenching fic topic)

** It really depends on my mood, I mean if I'm in the mood to hide from life and read forever then a 300-600k word fic is easily read and enjoyed in a day or two, but if I'm not then it's around 100-200k, maybe a bit over, although at this point it's extremely rare for me to find a single fic that's good and that I haven't read soooo, yeah.

I can read and enjoy a fic if it's under 1mil and over 100k, it's very rare to find a fic I enjoy over a mil, but I can't currently read under 100k comfortably

Chapters over 6k, preferably 10k, but I can take 15k and enjoy it as much, a bit more will get annoying.

Please link the rarest good fic you know and your favourite fic.. pls, thanks..

** You gotta get the structure right. You need to write enough to tell your story, no more, no less.

Many 200+ chapter stories I've seen could be better told as a oneshot. Many one shots I've seen, I yearn for them to be longer.

I've seen 200+ chapter stories that are AMAZING, and don't ever have boring moments that drag on, and 200+ chapter stuff that is boring and fillered and you can feel time drag on.

​

​

If you're so concerned about people turning your 200+ chapter book down because of it's length (it's a normal concern, a huge portion of long fics are too long and boring), then split it into sections.

Normally, they are split into 7 where each book lasts 1 school year. Each section is published as a fanfic, but remember to write in the desriptions if they are a sequel.

For example, The Downwards Spiral Saga (Not the best quality fic, but still enjoyable) is split into sections. Each book more creepier than the last.

** Depends on the type of story. If it's a quick what if idea then it can be done in 10k words. If you have a year-long war epic with four different sides including Voldemort, the Order, the Ministry and a foreign government that's trying to interfere as well, dozens of different battles, strategies, betrayals and spies, with tons of new characters all fleshed out, then you can write several million words without being boring.
