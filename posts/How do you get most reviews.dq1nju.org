** Looking at the most popular fics, here are some ideas:

- Ship fics

  - Harry/Draco, Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort for slash
  - Harry/Fleur, Harry/Daphne, Harems for het

- Independent!Harry

  - Weasley & Dumbledore bashing
  - Lordships & inheritances

- Popular tropes

  - Time-travel redo
  - Time loop
  - Betrayal & revenge

Consider that the majority of readers on FFN [[https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-K49JmOf-h8U/TYObP6JJsjI/AAAAAAAAAC0/tZvjYQVVwqk/s1600/ageafter.jpg][are around ~14 years old]]. They look for a power fantasy, so your protagonist must never lose and always get revenge on anyone who so much as looks wrong at them.

This is so annoying. I've had reviews complaining that Harry didn't kill people talking shit to him. In a 4th year fic.

Running around on a murder spree isn't even the sign of power, it's the sign of insanity.

** - Harry-centric. No question.

- Powerful and competent Harry. Wish fulfillment is a big aspect of fanfiction. Write the story of a life you wish you had, with power, money, success, and witches, written in a way that makes it sound like Harry's PoV instead of you projecting, and the readers will come rushing in. Few people outside of Hurt/Comfort fans like seeing a weak, doormat Harry.

- Good writing, intriguing summary, interesting premise, and a strong first chapter. New readers will check out a fic by scanning the first chapter, and if they don't like it, won't keep reading. If you ask authors, most will say their stats show that their Chapter 1 will have 4-5x as many hits as Chapter 2, and it curves down as the chapters go on. Give people a reason to check your fic out, by writing a spell-checked summary with a strong hook.

- Action/Adventure category with a magic system and setting that leans close to the books without major background adjustments (eg. Muggle AU, coffee shop/university AU, werewolf alphas AU, Cursed Child AU). Other popular sub-categories are Suspense, Humor, and Romance.

- Rating T, M, or higher. Means the fic will have swearing, violence, and sexual themes. People love dark and edgy content, and a high rating shows that your fic is not going to be a simple kidfic. The average HP fanfic reader is much older than in the heyday of HP fanfics, back in 2003, and as many of us OG readers aged with the books, we don't to read HP fics with the same childish tone of Philosopher's Stone.

- Updates frequently, or on a regular set schedule with dates posted. Once a week at the same time each week and you will get readers opening your fic who normally don't read fics until they're completed, because they trust that it won't be abandoned.

And a good summary. Actually summarize the story, not just the divergence point. Main character pairings should already be in the character stats, don't repeat them or list every single pairing. Do not include author's notes^{1.} Do not use sentences that start with "What if Harry was..." or "Watch Harry as he..."^{2.}

^{1} "BETA'D UP TO CHAPTER 7!"

^{2} "...takes the magical world by storm!"

*** Regarding your first point, stories don't have to be Harry-centric to get a good number of reviews. There are plenty of other stories that don't have Harry as the main character that have gotten thousands of reviews. The Three Portals, Games are Afoot, Applied Cultural Anthropology, Have You Ever, Ultima Ratio are just a few off the top of my head that are stories in which Harry isn't the main character but have gotten many, many reviews.

** An Indy, god mode Harry fix it story with a goddess Hermione, a non-existent Ron, best friend Neville or Draco, and a manipulative, idiot Dumbledore. Maybe throw in a kind Snape and a super bitch McGonagall, a Daphne Greengrass who has always wanted to be Hermione's bestie, seer Luna, and potion master Ginny.

You don't have to use all these clich√©s, close your eyes and throw darts on a board.

On a more serious note, pick a clich√© or a fav pairing and do something new with it.

** Write a really good first two chapters then turn the rest into a cliched poorly written piece of garbage and I promise you're gonna get a lot of reviews.

On a more serious note what are you looking for out of the reviews

** I just skimmed through, but I do not thing I've seen anyone point out the, possibly, obvious answer.

A: write a brilliant story\\
B: bribe people to review you

I'm sure I could be persuaded to leave random token reviews for 1‚Ç¨ per review.

** Well, a popular pairing in a popular fandom. Eg Hermione/X in Harry Potter. Several chapters with a decent length, regularly updated (best on the weekend).

*** Saturday evening (GMT) is by far the best time to update. The European crowd gets something to read in the evening or on the next day, which is free since it's Sunday. And the Americans, who are the biggest reader base, get the entire weekend to read it AND they are awake when they get the update notification.

**** Interesting. The stories I have posted get the most hits during the week (mainly Tuesday and Wednesday) and the least on the weekends.

** To be honest, the bulk of readers at any given point are the ~1-2 year types who just get into any fandom. Most often, these people immediately go for the wish-fulfillment and common tropes - Dumbledore/Weasley/Ministry bashing, OP!Harry or OP!Hermione, insta-romances, harems, and fix-it or canon-rehashes. And they think thats amazing, not realizing its almost literally carbon-copied 20,000 times on [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]] /alone/.

Thats not just in Harry Potter either; its fairly common to see nearly identical reviews in these types of fics across genres. Go look at say some of the low-brow Naruto, Star Wars, or Game of Thrones fics (not the ASOIAF ones so much though) and you will see the same sorts of wish-fulfillment stories get the most reviews.

The question you should ask though is the same one you could say about the writing itself: its about the /quality of the reviews, not the quantity/. Most of those aforementioned fics have texting-style meaningless reviews (either good or bad). In its own way, the quality of the review(er) says something about the quality of the fic itself I think.

** There are certain types of fic that seem to garner higher numbers of reviews and the more reviews you have, the more you get. Don't ask me why; the logic escapes me. But it seems that many readers are more inclined to leave a review on a fic that already has plenty. And there are review games that will guarantee comments. But really, don't you think it would be pretty soul-destroying to be pandering after readers rather than writing something you really believe in? I reckon that no matter how many reviews you get, you'd pretty soon get sick of writing it and you'd probably start to despise your readers.
