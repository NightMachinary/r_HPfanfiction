Hey guys, So I just finished reading Saras_girl's fanfic, Turn, on ao3 and I really liked the whole background she created. So I was wondering in anyone had any recommendations for fanfics where Harry helps Draco after the whole bathroom incident, and Draco joins the good guys and becomes friends with Harry and the gang. I enjoy Drarry, but it definitely is not a must, mostly I'm just looking for Draco being friend with the trio after 6th year.
