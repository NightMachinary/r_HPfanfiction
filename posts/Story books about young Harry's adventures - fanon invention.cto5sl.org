Just a quick question: It's a pretty common trope in HP fanfiction - books about The Boy Who Lived and his adventures before Hogwarts, completely unfounded in reality of course - but I'm not entirely certain whether the concept is a fanon invention or not.


** It IS canon that Molly told Ginny stories about Harry while she was growing up. In my stories where I mention them (and the dreaded Harry Potter dolls) I simply provided a series of books that the stories have come from.

I've had fun with some of the titles: Harry Potter and the Evil Muggle Queen, Harry Potter and the World's Largest Dwarf, Harry Potter and the Cyclops with Two Eyes.

I've seen other writers attribute the stories to Lockhart and Skeeter.

** It's Fanon, but it's also fairly well-reasoned based on conversations the characters have...which is better than we can say for most Fanon.

In the first chapter, Professor McGonagall notes that for vanquishing Voldemort, books will be written about Harry. We never see any storybooks about Harry, but Hermione does mention that Harry is referenced in several textbooks including /The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts./

McGonagall also notes that "there won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name" and that it may come to the point where Harry Potter Day becomes a holiday (imagine the look on Snape's face!).

So it isn't a stretch at all to think there may be storybooks written about Harry.

** It is. There are, however, canonically (for a measure of "canonically": it's from the online WOMBAT test, IIRC, or something low-key like that) seven history books about the Trio's Life published after the War, written by one Ms Rowling.

*** Thanks, I was pretty sure about it, but had some doubts about my recollection.

*** Wait, hold up. It's canon (...ish, close enough) that the Harry Potter books we all know and love exist in the Harry Potter universe?

That. Is. /Delightful./ I want a fic where Harry learns about this now.

**** The implication is that Harry & Co. were interviewed by Rowling for her to write it, though. Hard to think how she could have done it otherwise. All relevant details should be on the "J. K. Rowling (character)" page on the Wiki, at any rate.

** I totally thought this was canon until recently too! Not sure why.

This is useful for the story I'm working on so if anyone sees titles of these in fic it'd be nice to share.

Harry Potter and the Clever Clauricorn is mentioned in The Perils of Innocence
