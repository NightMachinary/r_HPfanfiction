Have already read linkffn(8241324) "The secret life of epsilon brown" and I loved it. But can't find any more like it, so if anyone could help that would be great. Hope I linked that right and also no slash or fem!harry if possible.

** I liked linkffn(Agent Potter), be warned though, it has quite a few lemon scenes in it. That said, it was a few years back when I read it, so I don't know how it aged
