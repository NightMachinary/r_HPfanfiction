I'm in the middle of writing a story on Ao3, it's got over 10,000 hits and a lovely following but I simply hate the title. It's one of those awkward, clunky titles.

I don't see how I can change the title without deleting the entire thing and if I repost what I have submitted so far under a new title I'm afraid I'll lose any followers of the story I had.

Any advice? Ever been in the same predicament?


** I changed the title of my WIP recently. People liked the name change, and it hasn't caused any confusion as far as I can tell. In my summary, I wrote “(Formerly called The Ollivanders)” at the beginning. Both FFN and AO3 make it really easy to change the name of existing fics.

** No need to delete it all just for a title change! Just go for it and change it. People who are following won't hardly notice. I'd just recommend making an author's note at the top of the next chapter letting people know you have changed it or putting in the summary “Formerly named ________” for a bit.

** I think you should just forget it. If you have that many Hits despite a mediocre title, it's because the story is good and nobody cares about the title anyway.

I've considered changing the title of my story too, but I know I will lose a lot of guest readers and I'd rather just avoid all that confusion
