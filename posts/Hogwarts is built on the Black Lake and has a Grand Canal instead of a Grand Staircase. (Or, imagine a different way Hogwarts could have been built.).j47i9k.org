Or, Hogwarts is built in the canopy of the not-so-Forbidden Forest, using animated tree branches to move students from room to room.\\
Or, Hogwarts is an elaborate underground lair dug out of the caverns in the mountains near Hogsmeade.\\
Or, Hogwarts is a floating castle in the sky where everything is gigantic, Jack & the Beanstalk style.\\
Or...well, you get the idea.


** Nah, leave Hogwarts the same, let's introduce these elements in other schools. For example Durmstrang could have lots of old ancient tunnels, while a school in Italy has a Grand Canal

*** Fair enough, I wanted Hogwarts because I was actually thinking 'how would scenes from canon be different if Hogwarts had different architecture', but you can imagine up the landscape of other magic schools too.\\
...I wonder if there's one in the crater of an active volcano?

** "If we miss this Gondola, we'll never get to Transfiguration on time!"

All I can imagine is that the Grand Canal just looks like automated frogger. :D

It would be possible though. Venice became a thing in like 400-500 AD, so there'd be more than enough time for the water-lyfe vibe to filter into magical society and be present enough for one of the Founders to want to make Hogwarts floating.

** Anyone know of a floating school? Like Dalaran or Vane?
