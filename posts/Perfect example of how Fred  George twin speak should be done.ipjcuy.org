** That is definitely infinitely better than having them switch off every other word. However, I would still prefer it limited to a few lines, rather than having an entire conversation like that.

** It's a bit better than what I usually see but it seems more like a conversation where they are both in agreement. In my headcanon they do it just when they want to be irritating, kind of like pretending that people had got them mixed up.

Also unpopular opinion but I never found Fred and George that funny (except when they charmed the snowballs to chase Voldemort). I think some of their antics are obnoxious at best, while some of their "pranks" are actually dangerous. Not much of a fan of Hermione's obsession with rules either but when she scolds them in OotP, I'm totally with her.
