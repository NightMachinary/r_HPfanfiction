*** Well, I don't like her, because everyone (even Rowling) descripe her like perfect women. Beautiful, smart, kind. It's annoying. I don't speak in english very well. Then I could write a lot more, but I don't know how to write it in english, sorry :)

**** I think I understand what you mean. She's too perfect so she's boring because she doesn't have any flaws, nothing wrong with her. People with no problems are not really fun to read about because they always do what is right, and things like that :)

What language do you speak ?

***** I'm from Poland so I speak in polish language ;D I undestand what I read in english but I have trouble with speak and write in english. I love pairing James/Hermione but we don't have many FF with this couple. I star reading in engish a few months ago and I discovered reddit.com a few day ago. I don't know where you read FF, I know only fanfiction.net and I know almost everything FF with James/Hermione in this website :)

** I can't remember the name of it, but it was only ever on Granger Enchanted and the author was MistressMalfoy. That site seems to be gone, but someone might have it archived. If I remember correctly, it was quite long and I know for sure that it was complete. It was an excellent story.
