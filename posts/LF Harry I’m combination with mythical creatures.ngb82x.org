As in a Basilisk/Phoenix familiar/animagus. I really like that aspect of fics where the possibilities of the different animals are explored.

Probably unrealistic in regard to the basilisk, but I'm not really a fan of Dark!Harry where he joins Voldemort and kills a bunch of purple.


** Basilisk-born by Ebenbild has harry being barely human with lots of details about the creatures that are sentient (complete)

on crimson wings by Contramancer has harry become a dragon/human hybrid (complete but unknown if the author will ever finish the sequel though it is great as a stand alone fic if you are okay with cliffhangers that let you decide how things will end)

Blood of the Phoenix by midnightjen is the first in a complete series of fics that explore the powers harry gets by becoming half phoenix half human as part of the plot

Sorry I don't know how to post links from my phone

Edit they are all on fanfiction.net
