Do you guys know any fics in which Harry (alone or with co. ) travels into the Cursed Child future and gets to meet his kids and his friends's children? I really wish to read something like that, extra bonus points if there is some Scorbus involved , but really, him meeting the next gen into the future is enough. Thank you.


** I dont know such fic. But have something you can give a try if you want.

It is set in distant future of Hogwarts and Harry's great grandson is in Hogwarts. Though is not the primary character.

I think the next gen of heroes is actually kind of boring. I am not just speaking of wizarding world or Harry's gang but in general. Usually the successors of heroes are not that interesting as the Heroes themselves. I usually read next gen stories to see our heroes in the light of future.

*** Agreed with the fact that just the notion of not being the original characters might make them seem a little luck luster from the get go, and how they are written in the book kinda confirms that. It is not a rule, just a valid example in this case. However i read some pretty epic and creative characterizations of them in fanfics, proving yet again that fanon takes can be superior to the original material. Thank you for your suggestion, i will give it a go.

*** Gave this one ago but this ain't it, unfortunately. 200k words in and the story has gone absolutely nowhere. The writing itself isn't bad but there's practically no plot to speak of.
