** The little picture in the corner of the office was immovable, the Prime Minister knew that. She has also been most surprised when the painting started speaking to her on her first night in office. After meeting with the Minister of Magic and somehow not waking up, the Prime Minister realised that, unfortunately, this was not a nightmare.

She took it upon herself to have the painting removed, even though there were visible marks of this process failing in the past. She wondered how this had never been brought to her attention before taking office. She settled, finally, on building around the painting- putting up drywall and sound proofing around it and creating a slightly smaller, but more reassuring office. She also had that wretched fireplace replaced with a more modern, electric version. That should stop that “Minister,” she thought to herself.

Meanwhile, Kingsley Shacklebolt was determined. He did not want to interfere with the Prime Minister's affairs, he merely wanted to listen in and ensure the right decisions were being made. He was under pressure from the European Wizarding Council to ensure that Britain was taking the most beneficial steps. After all, this “Brexit” fiasco would, most certainly, impact the imports and exports of dragon's blood, flying carpets and other various magical supplies. Never mind, Kingsley thought, how this would impact Hagrid's acquisition of various magical creatures.

Not to be deterred, he approached the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and a plan was hatched.

The cat showed up seemingly out of nowhere. Meowing at the front door of number 10, the Prime Minister scooped up the cat, waved at the cameras, and brought him inside. Surely she couldn't have the paparazzi seeing her turn away a stray cat from the front door. She wondered which one of them left it there for her to find. Still, she must keep the animal safe and well fed and ready for any more publicity shoots.

The cat, whom she called Larry, was the most extraordinary cat she had ever encountered. He was intuitive, friendly, and very crafty when it came to catching mice. She also noticed that Larry also seemed to have a way of calming, almost communicating with, other animals. Maybe, she thought, if she could impose this same calming strategy with her counterparts, they would be more receptive to her ideas. Stare them down, unblinking, just like Larry. In the few weeks she since she found him, she had built up a significant bond, and was somehow influenced by him. Maybe politics had worn her down, maybe she had become a warmer person. And maybe, just maybe, there was a liiittle bit of magic influencing her decisions.

After meeting with her constituents, the Prime Minister walked to her office, picked up her phone, and called Brussels. Larry purred on her desk, his big yellow eyes listening, no, watching, her speak. When she hung up, Larry got up and stretched, stared at her one last time, and waltzed, tail up, out of the office.

Back at the Ministry of Magic, Hermione Weasley sat in front of Kingsley. The news had come that the Article had been revoked and that there would be no international repercussions to this massive, three year long political fiasco. Suddenly, the door opened and closed again. Larry had returned. Kingsley looked at the cat and scratched his ears. The Minister was originally unimpressed with Hermione's plan, but could hardly be upset at its results.

Hermione pointed her wand at the cat. They both watched as his fur grew and changed colour. His tail became wild and fat. And soon a wiry, wild, ginger cat sat in front of them. Crookshanks looked up at Hermione, evidently non-plussed with his latest assignment. He was about to leave to go for a well-earned nap, when Kingsley spoke.

“Hermione, where is that cat going? We still need him for Boris Johnson, Teddy said he didn't like the taste of Reese-Moggs.”

** Or other way around, it is a kneazle smuggled there by the secret Auror in residence (kind of what Kingsley used to do for his Prime Minister) looking up for any unsavoury characters who plan to hurt PM.

** Hermione Granger-Weasley looked across the room at the man whose full-time job was political espionage, their closest version that they had to the magical version of James Bond to her M, her face fallen in despair at what he had just told her. "We're doomed. They're idiots. Complete. Utter. Idiots."

"And that was just the beginning," said Larry, taking a swig of badly-needed fire-whiskey that was provided. "I haven't even mentioned the canceled £13.8m ferry contract with a company that had never run a Channel crossing before..."

Hermione grimaced. She was grateful her husband wasn't in the room, otherwise he would have no doubt responded with a quickfire round of expletives that would make even someone as notoriously foul-mouthed as Malcolm Tucker or John Constantine blush. "I wonder, Larry. Do you think our diplomats might stand a better chance at sorting this mess out than this lot? I know it is unethical, but desperate times might call for desperate measures. The Prime Minister has been warned, it's our future as well as theirs that they're affecting. We can replace her with polyjuice for a day or more and I'm sure nobody would notice the difference."

"M'am, with all due respect, a garden gnome could do a better job at sorting out this mess than this lot," said Larry. "Our diplomats might be too overqualified. And after the last meeting, I'm afraid I'm going to have to put a request for a pay-rise if you ever want me to sit through that again. I was captured by You-Know-Who during the war, you know. Only for a few days. And I'm beginning to think that after that he might have actually had a point, and I'm a muggle-born myself."

"I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that," said Hermione with a heavy sigh.
