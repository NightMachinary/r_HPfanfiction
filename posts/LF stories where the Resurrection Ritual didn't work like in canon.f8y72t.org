Maybe it turned Voldemort good, maybe it turned him into a creature or a Squib or a baby. Just whatever works.

No Harem or Lord Potter stories. No Ron Weasley bashing. Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash.

Characters can be smarter or more powerful than in canon, but make it believable.

Horcruxes can be a thing or not, I don't care either way.

Would rather it be completed but if not that's fine.


** I've got a crack fic idea where Neville figures out a complex arrangement of magical contracts by which he forces Voldemort to be reborn into a girl, his fiance, and bound to do as he says on pain of loss of all magic. It was born out of the idea that if Harry could be forced to compete in the Triwizard tournament against his will, why couldn't they pull the same trick of putting "Tom riddle" in there? He'd have to either show up or lose his magic.

*** Yes, in combination with some of those batshite marriage contracts, it could be interesting. All the misogyny firing back!

** There's a time-travel crackfic where they tried to sabotage the ritual by replacing his father's bones with transfigured bones from a dead squirrel, and they end up with a giant squirrelly Voldemort (complete with squeaky voice). I'll try to track it down if you're interested.
