Feel free to suggest both themes (genres, pairings, etc.) and specific fics. This post will be up for the next week and then I'll pick something. I won't be picking any fic that's abandoned. I'll consider in progress fics that have been updated within at least the last month. I'm also interested in getting opinions on whether I should restrict my picks based on rating. Is the majority okay with M rated fics?


** Preface: I know that some of these have been widely read and have likely been read by most of the community, but I think for this book club to be successful some of the widely-read fics might need to be instituted to help get the book club a bit more off the ground.

I really hope that this book club idea finally works. Its something that I would love to be a part of and a great way for our great community to come together.

Soul-bonds that are actually pretty good.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.

#+end_quote

Hear me out on this one. Yes, the first two chapters are cliche filled and rather hard to take, I get that. Just get past them. While this fic is highly iterative of today's soul bond cliches, it does them all /really fucking well/. Hell, considering it's age, it wouldn't surprise me if the cliches are because of this fic and its sequel. It's probably the best soul bond story I've ever read, despite the issues.

This is similar to Error Of Soul, instead with Ginny. It's a realistic view of what would happen if two twelve year-olds could suddenly hear almost every waking thought of the other. Really fun read.
