While I'm sure most people are just gonna say A Very Potter Musical, I've gotta give props to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_People,_Dear_Reader][Wizard People Dear Reader]].

I've been watching it now and then going on nearly 10 years now, and it gets funnier every time.

My favorite part is when Harry accidentally traps Dudley in the zoo exhibit.

"And what do you know, dear reader? Providence must have cast a Glass-Be-Back spell. Cause take a look at the zoos new acquisition- it is a play! A tragic comedy! The Lament of Roast Beefy O'Weefy! Ahahah!"

** I'm an enormous fan of Makani's drawings of the HP characters. [[https://www.deviantart.com/makani/art/Leaky-s-Widget-pics-46664400][Deviantart link.]]

Imagine, if you will, an animated HP series with this as a sample character sheet.

** I'm gonna be a basic bitch and say AVPM, I just love it. It's been a while since I watched any of the movies and honestly I read fanfic with the musical's voices in my head rather than the 'official' actors'

*** I really loved Quirrel and Voldemort in the first musical, which I only finished watching in 2020 even if I knew of its existence ages ago. I still have to complete watching the second and third musicals.

** Since AVPM and PPP have been mentioned, my next favorite YouTube content is [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRWRP9PRt1LZ4do-UT_moXgoIQocQPJE0][Oh Snape!]]

I also like these comics: [[https://www.emilymcgovern.com/my-life-as-a-background-slytherin/]]. Someone made a "dub" of them here: [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWF9vw_ygHKbk5cdc_g1jqk9MzldUkeDJ]]

I also used to follow the Tumblr of a fictional muggle IT guy hired by Hogwarts to handle their Wifi and computers. I found it funny then but I don't know if it still gets updated. I'll go look for it now.

** I absolutely /love/ Cracked's Jarry Potter series. The humor can be very juvenile, and it was written in 2014, so it hasn't aged perfectly, but if you can overlook that it's basically an amazing crack fic that's been turned into a short film with a pretty good budget. Harry and Ron run away to America to become conmen named Jarry and Don after book 1, and Hermione has to come convince them to beat Voldemort.

â€‹

Edit: the A Very Potter Musical series is actually my favorite fan content, but that seems like kind of a given, so I went with something people were less likely to know of already.
