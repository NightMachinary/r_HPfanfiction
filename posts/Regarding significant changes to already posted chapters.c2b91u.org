How do you all feel as readers and authors about an author going back and changing a story after it's been posted? And how do you prefer it to be addressed? An author's note saying exactly what changed? A list of what chapters got changed?

I know we often get re-edits of a story after it's been completed because the author has grown in skill be the time they come to the end, and they want to make the beginning writing up to par with the end writing. But I'm not really talking about those.

I mean basically, the author has decided to revise their plan, and have to alter previous chapters to fit.

You know. For a friend.


** I've only read one story, where the author did major edits after I started reading. Parts of old version were removed/rewritten and parts of what was removed was re-added in later chapters. That was very confusing at the time, but author's notes helped a lot. They basically went "remember, this didn't happen yet, because I edited this and this". I often skip them, so what also helped is that the new chapter update was a notice about the rewrite.

Can't say that it made me love the fic, what I remember is a mash up of two versions of it. But really, I don't mind this as a reader much, imo this is better than fic being abandoned. More often I've encountered fics, which were abandoned on, like, chapter 20 for a rewrite (posted as a new story), which didn't progress past chapter 1 or 2. If you a certain that the changes will help you finish it, I think you should do it.

** I'm a fan of [[https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/][changelogs]] and no one uses them. Consider a short note at the bottom that you edited a chapter. Be specific or not, it's up to you.

There's a story on FFN where the author removed an entire c story and drastically altered a scene (eliminating a lot of character building). It really changed the story for re-readers.

** When you replace stuff, please create a separate fanfic that has the original work. I have experienced more than once an author deleting something I had bookmarked to read again, and disliking the new version.

In the most extreme case, an author might decide to rework an entire fic, only to abandon the effort a few chapters in, and now the whole thing is disjointed.

** If it's a WIP, I'd prefer the author to list major changes in the A/N to the next chapter, but if the fic is complete, I think that a short note about revision should be enough.

** I, as a reader, personally like to see a changelog of everything that got edited, so I can adjust my headcanon accordingly. It's especially useful if you are reading several stories at the same time and want to keep track of what happened in each one.
