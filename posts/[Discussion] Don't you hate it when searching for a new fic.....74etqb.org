And you think you have found it, /finaly/, after hours and hours of searching through already read fanfics and you're thinking "Wow, this is great!" and only after a couple of chapters your mind lightbulb goes *ding* and you remember everything about it, /everything!!/.


** Alternative situation: you leave a kudos for a great fic you've just read for the first time and then..."You have already left kudos here". But you have no memory of ever reading it.

** Weirdly, that's never happened to me. Then again, if I like a fic enough, I'll re-read it just like I re-read books and re-watch movies and TV shows.

*** I do have a list of fics that I loved and I usually re-read. But when I'm searching for something new, thinking that I found it when I really didn't it's kind of frustrating :(

**** It just never happened to me. If a fic really struck me as "wow" then I tend to remember it well enough that I can identify it from the summary, or the first few paragraphs at the very least.

I have had the "wait, I think I read this" experience, but never with a fic I actually LIKED.

** That happens to me all the time. And it makes me sad for multiple reasons. I'm sad that I forgot the fanfiction, although it had been great and I'm sad that I spent time reading something I already read because I could have been reading some other great fanfiction. I don't know how many fanfictions I read totally captivated just to notice in the last chapter that I had read it already...

** That happens to my mother with books, movies and TV shows ALL THE TIME. To the point where she no longer bothers to manage her own Kindle library - she gets me to put on things she hasn't read before, and remove the things she has, so that she doesn't accidentally reread and get annoyed with herself.

It's only happened to me a few times. Once, notably, with a fic that was taken down and re-uploaded with a new name, and a few times when things were posted on AO3 and FFN both. I think they were all decent fics though, so I just went ahead and reread them, since it put off the search for something decent to read for a few hours.
