I'd really love to read a fic where Hermione being black affects how she interacts with the wizarding world- specifically dealing with blood prejudice. It could also be a source for her constant need of academic success ('twice as good for half the credit') or her strong reaction to house elf enslavement. Any fics where she joins a POC group on campus (does Hogwarts have clubs outside Quidditch and Frog Choir?) would be cool too.


** If you don't mind femslash, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23465653][the miseducation of hermione granger]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/MaidenMotherCrone/pseuds/MaidenMotherCrone][MaidenMotherCrone]] sounds to be what you're looking for.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8210656][look to your kingdoms]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Vail/pseuds/Vail][Vail]] is shorter but deals with similar issues as well.

  Hermione Granger knows who she is. She is a Gryffindor. She is a Muggleborn. She is Afro-Arab. She is English. She is a Muslimah. She is a good friend. She is smart. She is an activist. She is things that she will never say out loud.Hermione Granger knows who she is. The problem: No one else does.1. Not her friends.2. Not her parents.3. Not even her. Not yet.  (this is the unlearning. the miseducation. minute by minute)

  When she visits Diagon Alley, Hermione hates that the first thing the shop clerk in the apothecary tries to sell her is a potion to “tame her hair.” She likes her hair the way it is, curls and frizz, heavy around her shoulders. She thought the wizarding world would be different. (Black Hermione character study.)

  Hermione was just a scrappy, autistic child with no name and no past until she was adopted by a wonderful pair of dentists. The summer after she would make the best friend she would ever have from Ottery St. Catchpole. How much more would her life change when she is told that that tingling sensation she felt in her very core is magic? [UPDATES COMPLETE]

** my WIP fic linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18485104/chapters/43800589)is]] based on the premise of a Hermione who is actually more like Michelle from Spider-man Homecoming than our Hermione and as such she's black, and played by Zendaya (if a British, war weary one)

Eta that my Hermione is /always/ black, but it's most obvious in this fic so far.

  When Remus came back to himself, he was in the middle of the Forbidden Forest, naked, shivering with pain and with cold, and he could taste blood.“I don't have the full story,” said Madam Pomfrey. “You'll have to speak to Minerva or Albus for that. But Black has escaped, and - Remus, I am so sorry. You bit Hermione Granger.”or: a story of innocence, experience, and prejudice, spanning the summer holidays after Prisoner of Azkaban.
