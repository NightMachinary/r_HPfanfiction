:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember the fanfic was on AO3 and the author had turned it into a series, with the current focus on year 6 I think. - James and Lily are still alive but apparently James doesn't really like Harry for some reason - Harry is in Slytherin - I think his brother's name was Daniel but I could be wrong. The brothers clashed a lot initially but ended up making some sort of amends but Harry only did it to get information from what the Order is doing since Albus isn't allowing him to be inducted yet

That's all I can remember so far.. Thanks in advance kiddos


** linkao3(Harry Potter and the Den of Snakes)

Is this it? It's been a while since I've read it so I couldn't be sure.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.

** Out of curiosity, are there any WBWL where Harry /isn't/ a Slytherin? I'm not a fan of the genre, but they all seem to revolve around Harry being a sneaky snake, his brother a git Lion, Ron usually siding with the brother and Hermione with Harry.

  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.

**** Ah yes, the story where Harry tries to be sneaky but fails and yet still somehow lucks out of everything. Underrated story though, made me cry :(
