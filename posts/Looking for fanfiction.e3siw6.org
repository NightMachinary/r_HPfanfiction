:END:
Specifically two but I can't remember there names.

The first started with Harry taking an ole avada to the head and meets Dumbledore. Except Dumbledore is death him/it self. Who sends Harry and him/it self back to fourth year. The most memorable thing I remember is Dumbledore getting turned into a chicken dressed as a grim reaper on Halloween and it was a Harry/Fleur I believe but don't quote me on that.

The second started with a over a hundred year old Harry sitting in the kitchen. His family for x number of years decides he is no longer useful. As he has been on potions fora long time he basically has no will of his own so they go on a whole supervillain type rant about how they were stealing from him the whole time. Long story short be dies and, i can't remember how but gets sent back in time and taken off the potions.

Any help is appreciated and suggestions similar to these are welcome.
