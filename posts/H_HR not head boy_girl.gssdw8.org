:END:
Harry and Hermione are not made prefect/heads and instead, I think, it was Ron and one of the other girls. They fail to preform their duties and Harry/Hermione step in and do them anyway, becoming a sort of mom and dad to the first years.

I remember a scene where Minerva hides on a shelf in the common room, as a cat, and watches them interact with the first years and decides that they were the ones she should have given them the badge


** Lequin last chance. And it's prefect not headboy

** This sounds really really /really/ familiar, but I can't remember which fic it is. Maybe something by RobSt? I remember it being bash-heavy.
