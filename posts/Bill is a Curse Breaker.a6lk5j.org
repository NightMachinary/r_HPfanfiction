LF any stories that address the fact that Bill is a curse breaker who had the cursed dagger that was used on Hermione when the escapees landed at Shell Cottage. Between his job and the skills necessary for doing that job, I personally think he would have be well qualified to heal her physical injuries after Malfoy Manor.

Complete, and prefer any Weasley (except Ron)/HG, please.

I may be remembering this wrong, but I don't think dark magic injuries are supposed to be healable at all. Think of Harry's forehead and hand scars, Bill's facial scarring, whichever twin's lost ear, etc.

*** True but you would think that if he could break the curse, it would make healing the injury at least a little easier, right?

** The Arithmancer is pretty long but there is a section where Hermione and Bill (and Harry) go hunting Horcruxes: linkffn(The Arithmancer) -- the part in question is in the sequel linkffn(Lady Archimedes). AU from Hermione as a math-genius. Years 1-3 are pretty close to canon, but Hermione does some cool magic with maths and terrifies everyone around her. The story really comes into its own in Lady Archimedes. Sorry, not sure if that's what you're looking for, but it covers the part you described.

  Hermione grows up as a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and tests into Arithmancy in her first year. With the help of her friends and Professor Vector, she puts her superhuman spellcrafting skills to good use in the fight against Voldemort. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

**** An early example is using her knowledge of light wavelengths to transfigure a pair of sunglasses tinted /just/ the right color of blue to protect against the basilisk's gaze, since its eyes are yellow.

**** -Figures out a way for muggles to brew potions. Snape is in for a big surprise in the next edition of "The practical potioneer".

-Creates sunglasses that block out the exact frequencies of basilisk gaze.

-Does theoretical work on transfiguration of radioactive materials. Gets the equivalent of the nobel prize for it.

-A ton of alchemy and soul ritual magic in the later parts.

**** Lots of stuff with transfiguration, like carbon nanotubes and basically alchemy (rearranging atoms). She gets to the philosopher's stone via some pretty advanced decryption, invents lots of spells, etc. I like how she, at one point, has a bit of a spell-inventing feud with Rookwood, where they each keep reverse-engineering each other's spells and using them against each other. Rational!Hermione but not as smug as HPMoR.

** Nothing about the dagger, but if you're just generally looking for stories that expand on Bill's job, then there's linkffn(Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider), which sounds like it should be ridiculous but is actually decent. Starfox is a great writer.

It's a minor plot point, though more than just a throwaway line, in one of my favorites, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past).

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?
