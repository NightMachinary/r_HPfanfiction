Just finished re-reading linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10563477/1/Harry-Potter-The-RPG]]) for the hundredth time and thought that it has been a while since I last googled around for video-game/RPG style stories, so, can anyone could rec me their favorite.

As an addendum, another of my favorites is Harry Potter: the video-game exploited, so any on this same vein would be appreciated.

  After his self-sacrifice Harry is faced with a choice, stay in limbo or play a RPG game about himself. Enough to say that stories about a character that actually chose to stay in limbo would not be a popular one... Video-game fic.

  Magic and Electricity don't mix normally... but exceptions can be made sometimes. Meet Lana Potter, a girl with an addiction for Video Games, Books, and Cartoons. Her face got shoved into an old TV and now she perceives life as those games she enjoys so much. If she works hard enough, she may become a true game Protagonist. "Hey isn't that just the Cliche Gamer Ability?" SHUSH YOU

** Not really favourite, but my prompt post from 6 hours ago resulted in some gamer fics being made or linked so it might be helpful to look there. But they are all about speedrunning the 'game'.
