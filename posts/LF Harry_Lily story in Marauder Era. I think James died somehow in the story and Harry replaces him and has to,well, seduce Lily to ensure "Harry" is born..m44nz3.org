Hey looking for the story I described in the title. I think someone described it sometime ago in one post, but I can't remember the Story title and can't find it.

Thanks


** This, Perception, is a oneshot on that theme. Too good, creepy and...sad. linkffn(3315171)

  Voldemort is dead. James Potter killed him. But Voldemort killed James, and Harry fulfilled the Prophecy. Confused? Well, it's all in perception anyway. HPLEP, sort of HPGW and JPLEP. Oneshot, short.
