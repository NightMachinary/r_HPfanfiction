We know Harry Potter is lazy. As in working on the second task at the eleventh hour lazy. But we also know that he can do quite remarkable feats ala Patronus at the age 13. Now the weird way canon presents Harry is that, this kid would try the impossible way of learning a really hard charm just because he is disturbed during his quidditch matches. But he also doesn't do much when he knows for sure that a mad dark lord is after him.

So, this is what I want to know from you. How do you give Harry Potter a very harsh call for action early on? Personally, I'd go with a Ravenclaw muggleborn [seventh year girl] getting fed up at his antics at fourth year and confronts him for getting liberties while they'd have to work hard. Even add that, he's doing nothing to deserve what his parents did for him. Or is there a more kind way you've seen done in a fic? Which would be the most effective as well as seem realistic?

Secondly, What about be the ideal career Harry Potter would take? Other than an Auror or the DADA professor and the occasional Quidditch Star? Will Harry even consider a career in muggle world?


** Harry suffers from a bit of inconsistent characterisation because I suspect (and this is only a theory, don't take it at face value) that JKR waffled back and forth between making Harry "The Chosen One" or making him "The Everyman". He's lazy because JKR wanted regular teens to be able to relate to him; the vast majority of teens are not prodigies or geniuses, they mostly don't even like working particularly hard. At the same time, he excels at magic because he's the hero of the story and he needed to be able to accomplish these feats when needed of him. I think Jo eventually decided on Harry being The Everyman since HBP and DH go out of their way to show Harry struggling with magic, as well as showing us just how much Voldemort outclasses him in sheer knowledge and magical ability.

If you want to make Harry "get serious", all you need to do is provide consequences for his actions. Forging the Sword provides the consequence of Harry being unable to save Ginny in the Chamber of Secrets, which serves as a catalyst for all that happens afterward. Of course, it doesn't have to be as dramatic as that, but there are several places where you can put such points of divergence dotted throughout canon.

I'm sorry, but this is the most absurd thing I've read in quite a while. You'd have to be a special kind of wanker to look at your marked for death one year-old son and go "Nah, he doesn't /deserve/ my sacrifice." What even is that logic? Plus, wouldn't James and Lily /want/ him to have a normal life? I doubt they sacrificed themselves going, "Well I hope my son spends his entire adolescence becoming a magic superweapon, that's the only way my sacrifice was worth it." If I were writing a fic and had some no-name Ravenclaw come and tell Harry that he didn't deserve his parents sacrifice, the next thing I'd write is that Ravenclaw being sent to the Hospital Wing because Harry (or Ron or Hermione) shattered their nose with a haymaker.

I think they'd much rather HP be alive and reasonably happy, normalcy be damned.

Also, I think OP meant that HP is quite reckless; as movie Lupin says, he does a lot of things which make for a very poor response to the parents who gave their lives for his.

**** Sure, but I really, really, /really/ doubt James and Lily would be happy with people hanging their deaths over Harry's head just because his coursework is only okay. Like, Jesus man, he's a kid, leave him alone. Criticise him all you want for his reckless hero complex, but telling Harry that he's disrespecting the memory of his parents because he isn't learning enough spells (which is essentially what the hypothetical Ravenclaw in the OP is doing) is a real gobshite move.

***** He's a teenager and he's kind of attending "university" (there's no after Hogwarts education - there's on the job training and maybe apprenticeships, but you have to qualify for those and Harry barely made Auror (hell, he used nepotism to get in without NEWTS! He confirmed Snape's bias against him, by accepting a handout! Deserved? Yes, but he still shouldn't have accepted, because it totally destroys his "I want to be just Harry" narrative!)), so yes he should IMHO do his level best and he doesn't! He's wasting potential (most of his classmates, including Hermione (the absolute teacher's pet!), could probably not have learned the patronus in PoA! Hermione struggled with it in fifth year after all!)!

#+begin_quote
  Will Harry even consider a career in the Muggle world?
#+end_quote

Of course, and going back to Muggle world doesn't mean he had to give up magic! He could cast all the spells he wanted behind closed doors. Household chores appeared to be one of the most ANNOYING things in Muggle life, and he could perfectly use magic without much worry here. Given experiences in HBP and DH, the Ministry seemed to have very limited means to detect magic in Muggle world.

There was a long discussion about how to rip off Muggles on this sub before, and it seemed that nothing in the Canon prevented them from doing so. The exchange rate from Galleon to Pound also looked super favorable at 5:1 during the 90s.

My opinion is that he could easily memory charm their way to the top. For example, it should be quite easy to 'convince' the board of directors to grant him tons of stock options for his 'valuable consulting work' for the company. He might as well do something for the company after all, such as 'obtaining' lucrative deals, favorable court decisions, and easy government approvals/certifications.

Wizards casually memory charmed Muggles throughout the Series, and were never caught. I doubt the various Ministries would really care. After all, Oblivate and planting false memories were the cornerstone of maintaining the SoS. As long as he doesn't flaunt flashy spells in the public, he should be fine.

There's one nice fic in which he ditched the magical world and became a fishing boat captain in Alaska: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7502511/1/][The Sea King]], linkffn(7502511). He used magic widely to save his crew and other fishers. Hermione finally found him after 18 years.

** I'm not sure I agree that Harry is lazy. Sure, he's not obsessed with schoolwork like Hermione is, but he does his homework and studies enough to get decent grades, judging from his OWL results. And it's not like he didn't do anything about the second task until the last minute:

#+begin_quote
  He therefore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up to the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the sound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical saws, but he had never heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigorously, and opened it again to see if the sound had changed, but it hadn't. He tried asking the egg questions, shouting over all the wailing, but nothing happened. (GOF, Chapter 24)
#+end_quote

True, he put off doing anything with Cedric's clue, but that reads more as stubbornness than being lazy. And once he knew what the task was, he was pretty dedicated to working out a plan:

#+begin_quote
  So Harry, thinking that he would soon have had enough of the library to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among the dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a human to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and Hermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole weekends --- though Harry asked Professor McGonagall for a note of permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the irritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help --- they found nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an hour underwater and live to tell the tale.

** I don't agree that Harry is lazy. In fact, Harry is pretty normal, effort-wise, for a kid his age. A lot of fanficcers seem to expect Harry to act like a training-obsessed thirty year old soldier who's preparing for World War 3, and when he doesn't do that, they call him "lazy."

Nevertheless, if you want to turn Harry into an obsessive hard worker and trainer, I'll tell you what WON'T work: Any sort of "harsh call for action" delivered by anyone who tries to tell him he has it easy while they have to work hard. We KNOW how Harry reacts to things like that, and it's not "Yes sir, you're right sir, I have it much too easy sir, I need to start making more effort sir!" Nope... Harry goes on the defensive. He gets angry and sarcastic, he yells and sulks. What he does NOT do is try to change his behaviour.

Take your Ravenclaw Muggleborn girl. If she goes on a tirade with Harry, what then happens is that Harry gets angry, tells her to leave him alone, and says something like "If you think my life is so easy, I'd be MORE than happy to swap with you!" If she then brought up his parents and how he didn't deserve what they did for him, he'd get REALLY angry: "WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT MY PARENTS?! YOU STILL HAVE YOURS!"

Want to get Harry to listen to you? Treat him with respect first. Show that you respect him as a human, and then SUGGEST, don't order or nag. Harry doesn't deal well with people ordering him around, nagging or otherwise telling him what to do. But if you listen to him, he'll generally do you the courtesy of listening to you.

So again: I'd love to read Harry getting an (at best early!) intervention (Hell, Remus or Sirius could do that, but having someone with a muggle-background do it? Priceless because such a person knows part of the struggle Harry faces - new world etc. - especially if that person's family is either wealthy or famous (or both) in the muggle world! Though an abused child might work well, too (such a person could relate to Harry and show him why he should try to excell at his school work etc. and such a person could also help Harry later on, getting more people for the eventual war etc.))

** Harsh call for action? I don't think he really would need that. The simplest way would be to remove Ron, whether he dies or just isn't Harry's friend. I'm not bashing Ron here, but Ron is probably the biggest reason Harry holds back in learning. He sees how jealous and angry Ron gets over anyone doing better then him, so he holds himself back to retain his first friend. He learns the summoning charm very well before the 1st task, when him and Ron are split, and the patronus is something that Ron would approve of, as disturbing quidditch is a no no for canon Ron.

Canon Harry's adult career is interesting. I could definitely see him slide into a support role, with his "saving people" thing. At the end of the series, he's not a good fighter, and he definitely couldn't deal with the politics of being an auror. Maybe a healer, but definitely something that allows him to help people.
