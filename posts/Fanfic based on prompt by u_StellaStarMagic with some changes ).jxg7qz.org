This is my first ever fanfiction and I'm really nervous...

I consider myself an amateur writer so criticism is very welcome

Also I'm not really sure whether I should continue... I probably am since it was honestly really fun to write

Please enjoy and tell me what you think <3

(Does the link work?)


** Promising start! (And the link definitely works)

I don't follow AO3 stories often, but I've got this one saved, good luck on keeping it going!

** Really unique premise! That was also clever to lean into Lavender's fashion knowledge to show her some depth. Can't wait to read more.

** Nice start to your story!

For the sentence: "'Are you sure?' insisted the loquacious Gryffindor" -- one doesn't generally insist when asking a question. And try to avoid the trap of referring to your character as something other than their name or pronoun. "Loquacious Gryffindor" is really over the top. Also, when two people are talking, the reader can generally tell from context who said what.

** O.O I'm hooked & am waiting for more, I can't think of anything else to say as it's only one chapter but the grammar & writing are good.
