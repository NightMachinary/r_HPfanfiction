I can't express how utterly disappointed I was with the Pottermore depiction of it. Like all that talk from Dumbledore about it being 'extraordinary' and you give me that...? And Uagadou students cadually turning into animals...? It contradicts book canon as far as I am concerned. It may be the largest reason why I don't consider Pottermore canon.

So what I'm asking for is a well written fanfiction where the Animagus transformation actually requires magical skill and talent, not just it being tiresome and annoying.


** The average wizard can't cast a shield charm.

The bar for extraordinary accomplishment is just pretty low in a small, isolated society with a practically non-functionining education system.

That said, how could a spell in HP's magic system ever be hard in a way that doesn't boil down to tedium?

All spells we know of require, at worst, a combination of materials, external circumstances, focus/emotion, knowledge and precision.

Am I missing something?

*** Hermione and Harry (in books 4 and 1 respectively) says there's more to magic than what we're told. For example, in GoF Hermione insists that learning the magical theory behind summoning charms will make them easier to cast. The series just doesn't ever get very much into that theory because, well, that's a lot to ask of a children's book series.

**** I'd argue that understanding the whys and hows of any action makes it easier to perform successfully, so that still doesn't hint at what 'magical talent' in HP means.

There just isn't a lot of room to work with in canon, so I doubt there is a story that would satisfy OP's request - Simply because any obstacle that can be overcome by the effort of a few unguided school kids can't have been that hard to begin with.

You grossly underestimate the effort of talented, but unguided school kids. I'd been involved with a lot of very talented school kids, and in their nieches they pick they can make pretty darn good things, things that even adults in their fields struggle with.

But hey, let's pick one example that is commonly understood: Sports. Just look at how good some young teens are with sports. Sure, they lack some refinement, but they can stomp everyone but the best adult in their fields.

The most talented thirteen year old soccer player can probably outplay most adults. Why is hard to concieve that "unguided school kids" can do cool things?

And for your first example:

**** They spend 5+ years in a non-optional DADA class, that a shield charm (with about a million other applications, since it also works on physical objects like stray bludgers) is not a central part of that curriculum just hints at even deeper problems.

In the end, everything we perceive as hard is just either tedious or dangerous to learn - Which the animagus transformation apparently is, so I don't see a problem either way.

*** She provided the incantation, but she didn't even mention that it was difficult, and it was supposed to be for talent in canon. Like, even Dumbledore called it extraordinary. Couldn't she just have sneaked the word in there? Everyone now assumes it's a simple spell, like what the hell? Especially the people who have a special tendency to drag everything Sirius and James in the dirt and mud. She provided them with more bashing sources.

**** Uh.. are we talking about the same thing? These are the provided instructions:

#+begin_quote
  Talent in both Transfiguration and Potions is necessary to become an Animagus. No responsibility can be taken for any physical or mental problems resulting from following these instructions.

  For the space of one entire month (from full moon to full moon), a single leaf from a Mandrake must be carried constantly in the mouth. The leaf must not be swallowed or taken out of the mouth at any point. If the leaf is removed from the mouth, the process must be started again.

  Remove the leaf at the full moon and place it, steeped in your saliva, in a small crystal phial that receives the pure rays of the moon (if the night is cloudy, you will have to find a new Mandrake leaf and begin the whole process again). To the moon-struck crystal phial, add one of your own hairs, a silver teaspoon of dew collected from a place that neither sunlight nor human feet have touched for a full seven days, and the chrysalis of a Death's-head Hawk Moth. Put this mixture in a quiet, dark place and do not look at it or otherwise disturb it until the next electrical storm.

  While waiting for the storm, the following procedure should be followed at sunrise and sundown. The tip of the wand should be placed over the heart and the following incantation spoken: ‘Amato Animo Animato Animagus.'

  The wait for a storm may take weeks, months or even years. During this time, the crystal phial should remain completely undisturbed and untouched by sunlight. Contamination by sunlight gives rise to the worst mutations. Resist the temptation to look at your potion until lightning occurs. If you continue to repeat your incantation at sunrise and sunset there will come a time when, with the touch of the wand-tip to the chest, a second heartbeat may be sensed, sometimes more powerful than the first, sometimes less so. Nothing should be changed. The incantation should be uttered without fail at the correct times, never omitting a single occasion.

  Immediately upon the appearance of lightning in the sky, proceed directly to the place where your crystal phial is hidden. If you have followed all the preceding steps correctly, you will discover a mouthful of blood-red potion inside it.

  It is essential to move, at once, to a large, secure place where your transformation cannot cause alarm or place you in physical danger. Place your wand-tip against your heart, speak the incantation ‘Amato Animo Animato Animagus,' and then drink the potion.

  If all has gone correctly, you will feel a fiery pain and an intense double heartbeat. Into your mind will come the shape of the creature into which you are shortly to transform. You must show no fear. It is too late, now, to escape the change you have willed.

  The first transformation is usually uncomfortable and frightening. Clothing and items such as glasses or jewellery meld to the skin and become one with fur, scales or spikes. Do not resist and do not panic or the animal mind may gain the ascendancy and you could do something foolish, such as try to escape through a window or charge a wall.

  When your transformation is complete you should find yourself physically comfortable. You are strongly advised to pick up your wand at once, and hide it in a place of safekeeping, where you will be able to find it when you regain a human form.

  To return to a human form, visualise your human self as clearly as you can. This should be sufficient, but do not panic if the transformation does not occur immediately. With practice, you will be able to slip in and out of your animal form at will, simply by visuali

****** We're shown throughout the series that Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms are insanely difficult for high-level things, and the Animagus Transformation is certainly high-level. This is a complicated potion requiring lots of preparation. Try to find dew somewhere that hasn't been touched by light or a human for a week. Try to get a clear night. Try to get up before sunrise every day. Imagine something that blows up if you accidentally look at it. It would be hard not to take a peek, or see it out of the corner of your eye, and the fact that kids in a school managed to pull all of this off without anyone knowing is crazy. The magic in Harry Potter doesn't only need talent, it needs lots of hard work too.

******* Yes, but my point still stands: doing all of this shows no talent in Transfiguration, something we're told they were 'exceptionally bright' at. Even the spell doesn't mention if it's difficult or not. The process is tiresome and is impressive if you manage it. But where's the talent wanded talent we're told is there? Nowhere. At best, the spell would be difficult, something which is likley, but never stated in the additional information.

*** This shows a complete lack of understanding of Peter's true talents. A knee-jerk reaction to a despised villain.

Peter has shown on numerous occasions his magical prowess (despite the likes of McGonagall and Voldemort verbally diminishing his magical potential) and proven himself as a more than capable wizard.

Exhibit A) In 1981 during his confrontation with Sirius following Peter's betrayal of the Potters, he was able to cast a potent Blasting Curse that blew up a street, leaving a 40-foot crater in the ground. Additionally, this curse was cast with his wand behind his back, a feat that shouldn't be undermined considering that most "average" witches and wizards require the comfort of wand movements and an incantation. Finally, a side note imo so far, the curse ended up killing twelve Muggles simultaneously; the explosion was so powerful that all the sewers hundreds of feet deep were completely destroyed.

Exhibit B) Jump forward to the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, where Peter was able to effectively use the Killing Curse (one of the three difficult to cast Unforgivable Curses) to execute Cedric Diggory. Now, the Killing Curse is noted by several experts on the matter - Barty Crouch Jnr, a Death Eater, and Severus Snape, a man infamous for his love and knowledge of the Dark Arts - that the Killing Curse requires great skill in order to be performed correctly. Crouch Jnr in GOF claimed that, if all of the students before him were to get out their wands and perform it on him at one time, he would likely be completely unaffected. In HBP, Snape also stated that to cast Unforgivable Curses you need nerve and ability. This is a feat made even more impressive that he used a wand he did not have allegiance with.

Exhibit C) (more of a subpoint for B I guess?) Guided by Voldemort's instructions, Peter was also able to successfully brew potions classified as powerful Dark magic, which even with the Dark Lord's instruction is impressive. If unimpressed see above points and read again.

Exhibit D) Peter, alongside the until recently Imperiused Barty Crouch Jnr, managed to get the jump on and overpower Alastor Moody who, despite being a tad rusty by 1994, is renowned as one of the most powerful and skilled wizards of modern times, let alone of Auror history.

**** A, I'll give you. My take on it was always that he actually managed to hit a gas main, feeding into the story the muggles were told later, but that's entirely non-canon, and a strict textual reading only tells us that Pettigrew cast a spell and blew up 12 people and a sizable chunk of street (not your 40 foot crater, but still a sizable enough chunk to kill 12 people).

B) Oh wow, the Killing Curse that requires an incredible amount of +skill and power+ desire to kill somebody. That's it, that's the only stated requirement to cast the killing curse.

C) "Guided by Voldemort's instructions" being the key point there. There's never any indication in canon that potion brewing is at all difficult if you can follow instructions, even the most difficult and potent potions.

D) We have no idea how much of that was Crouch, how much was Pettigrew, and how much was them getting the jump on him. It could have been an incredible duel where Pettigrew held his own against the incredibly capable ex-auror, or maybe Crouch did all the heavy lifting. This could go either way.

***** Crouch Jr says you need a lot of magical power to cast a Killing Curse, not just the desire to kill. However, this need not require too much skill, considering Crabbe (I think) was able to cast it once he became of age and his magic matured. The Animagus achievement is far more concrete though, it is deemed to require great talent and is difficult.

​

Potions brewing includes magic as well, certain spells to make the ingredients more than the mush a Muggle would get if they just followed the steps. However, we don't get any clue as to that being involved with the resurrection potion, I grant. Of course, he might have been saying the incantation ("bones of the father" etc.), considering it was more of a piece of ritual magic than anything.
