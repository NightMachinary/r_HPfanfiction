The idea intrigues me, but everyone says they suck so... Recs?

*** Another thing that people overlook is that they assume a soul bond must mean they will get married and love each other forever.

Did we just forget that Harry is also soul bonded to Voldemort? I don't believe there is any love between those two.

**** The best counter to this that I've seen is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4200568/1/The-Harmony-Bond][The Harmony Bond]]. The shitter is that it was a WIP, but I'm not sure if it will be finished cause the author is going through some stuff right now.

I mean they do get together eventually, but there's some serious issues at the start.

***** Another example of the implicit complications would be the accidental bond in [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4905771/1/A-Mother-In-Law-s-Love][A Mother In Law's Love]], which employs the premise that Harry's and Ginny's bond gets confused when Harry goes back in time and it attaches to Molly by mistake. Squicky humor ensues.

**** "Real Name: Dust"

That's like the name of a video game character.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8629685/1/Firebird-s-Son][Firebird's Son]] by Darth Marrs is an interesting take on Soul Bonds. It's a very AU story and a work in progress, though the author manages to update every Saturday.

*** I think when a WIP is at 560 000 + words it is a bit past where we need to warn people. It's long enough to get your emotional investment's worth. And thanks for the rec.

** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5720878/1/The-Caretaker][the Caretaker]] (Rated M) by aurette has a soul-bond theme. It runs a little long, but it's got a lot of character development.

** I'd have to recommend two stories by one of may favorite writers, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2036266/DriftWood1965][DriftWood1965]].

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5403795/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Price-of-Being-Noble][Harry Potter and the Price of Being Noble]] is a Veela bonding fic, and it is a great deal of fun to read.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5664828/1/Harry-Potter-and-Future-s-Past][Harry Potter and Future's Past]] is my personal favorite of the time travel soul bond fics. The first few chapters are a little silly, but when you get to the Department of Mysteries... well, I think it's the best damned DoM rewrite I have ever read, and I have read /quite/ a few.

** [[http://thetwobroomsticks.slashcity.net/sansa/OntheLastDayindex.html][On the Last Day of Our World]] by Sansa. Harry/Draco. The soul bond isn't the main focus of the story but happens later. I'll try to sum up the fic for you.

When Harry and Draco are locked up in detention and find themselves bathed in white light, nothing seems out of the ordinary; however, when they step out of it, they find themselves entirely alone in the world. The phrase 'not if you were the last man on earth' starts to seem a little extreme as the pair makes their way around the world while the wizarding world is torn apart by the Dark Lord. NC-17.
