:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
the basic premise from what i can remember was that harry would teleport into hermione's bed. this happened multiple time with one time harry just running before anyone realised and another with hermione screaming when waking up. Other details: at one point harry is monitored as he sleeps by madam pomfrey and flitwick i think.This fic had a few chapters if I remembered correctly


** I remember reading one similar. If I remember right he teleported to her bedside on his birthday I think
