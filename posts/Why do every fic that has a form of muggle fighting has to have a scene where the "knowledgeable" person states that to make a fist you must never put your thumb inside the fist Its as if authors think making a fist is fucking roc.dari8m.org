**** The reason behind why we do that is because if you have your thumb underneath your fingers when you punch something hard enough, you could break your thumb as your other fingers push against it.

Ask any self-defence, martial art or boxing instructor, it is one of the first things they teach you. So they can go even more in depth than I can.

Or you could just ask Google, “where to put your thumb when punching and why.”

Edit: Unless I'm misunderstanding what you're saying... Which happens I guess.

The first time I heard about this tip I was really confused because I didn't understand where else to put my thumb. Even when I read "thumb in fist" it didn't register to me.

**** You would be surprised. I taught a couple of informal self defense classes in college and about 60% of people in the class made fists with their thumbs inside their fists. Its to 'protect them' or something. Most of these people were women who had never been taught how to fight or been in a fight before.

It is a real tip from real classes. Same as having 'the knowledgeable person' go through a list of safety rules about guns.

** Because most writers aren't martial artists, so they have no idea what kind of real tips an experienced martial artist would give to a beginner.

This is the same reason why most fics that involve niche hobbies (blacksmithing, woodcrafting, gardening), the military, geography, or foreign cultures get details wrong. I think real Bulgarians would be disgusted by the way JKR and fanfic authors write Viktor Krum's accent.

******* Just because Durmstrang is somewhere in the Nordic Arctic Circle area, doesn't mean that all the students are Nordic. [[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/durmstrang-institute][Pottermore says the founder was Bulgarian.]]

#+begin_quote
  "The first of these unhappy men, Harfang Munter, took over the school shortly after the mysterious death of its founder, the great Bulgarian witch Nerida Vulchanova."
#+end_quote

Gellert Grindelwald, the most famous Durmstrang student, wasn't Nordic either. His headquarters during the Grindywars was in the Austrian alps, and was later his prison.

  *"SCENE 117. EXT. AUSTRIA, NURMENGARD CASTLE WINDOW---DAWN*

#+end_quote

It's similar to Hogwarts being a UK school, but taking in students that aren't just from the UK, like Seamus who was Irish.

And again, Viktor and his family speak Bulgarian, so it seems silly to assume that he is Scandinavian/Nordic just because the books never said outright that he was a citizen of Bulgaria.

** The obvious: Because otherwise some people would punch with their thumb inside their first. When I was a kid and getting threatened at school, my mum asked me to show her how I make a fist - and I did, with my thumb inside my first. She corrected me.

You can conclude "people are idiots" or whatever the fuck you want, but the fact is that (at least some) people who haven't fought would otherwise put their thumb inside their fist. Whether you think it's dumb or weird is beside the point - it didn't feel weird (at the time, it does now) and I'm not otherwise dumb.

** Because it's real advice. I remember being taught it. Because I put my thumb in my fist. So did several of my friends. It's not universal but it's normal enough to put your thumb in your fist if you're a beginner. Like, it's literally the most common rookie mistake.

The second piece of fighting lore I was taught was to kick the side of the knee, which turned out to be rather horribly effective and can't be used in play-fighting.

** My opinion is when someone gets to the point of throwing a fist they are feeling emotions. Emotions we are taught to hold on to and not express because They win when you go physical. Tucking the thumb in is last minute attempt to hold on.
