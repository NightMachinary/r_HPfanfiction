This is actually asking for some advice, but I thought I would turn this into a fun discussion. Currently writing a fic about another Weasley (since I've noticed there aren't too many fics about a Weasley OC). Well since the Weasleys seem to name their children after famous medieval figures and people from Arthurian legend, I thought about naming her Elizabeth, Eleanor, or Eglantine.

Keeping with the E names, what would you guys call her (those three names or another E name)? Because I'm stuck in those three and it's prohibiting me from moving on with my fanfic.


** I would absolutely name her Elaine, because I'm a literature nerd and the Tennyson poem "The Lady of Shalott" was about the Arthurian character Elaine of Astolat.

*** There are thousands of Elaine's in Arthurian Legend (Astolat, Corbenic, Listenoise, Garlot, Benoic, as well as Elaine the Younger, and Elaine the Peerless, and considering the Arthurian references in the Weasley family I think this is a good shout!

** Merlina, Morgana, Nimue, Fey.

Edit: do they have to start with E and why?

***** Lol, just a little joke. Just found it funny if I named her that (which I won't) and have this go down.

Neville: Where's the sword?!

Excalibur: (steps forward) My time has come... Neville yeet me at the snake!

** Depends on who her parents are. If it's Arthur and Molly Weasley, the most appropriate seems Eleanor.

** Gwendoline Cedrella Weasley. Have her take after Arthur. Perhaps replace Ron with her.

A variation of

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwendolen]]

Read the page, enough grounding in history. Cedrella is a reference to her grandmother.

** Enid might be a good shout, as it fits in with the Arthurian theme the Weasley's have going (Arthur, Percival, Ginny (harkening to Guinevere) and so on). Enid was the wife of Geraint and features in an early Arthurian epic, so is quite a nice choice. Elaine is also an option as it is a common name in Arthurian legend, being worn by the Lady of Shalott and the Grail Maiden among others.

If you are willing to move from E names, look at something more Arthurian such as Vivian, Lyonesse, or Isolt. There is also Anna, which is said to be the name of Arthur's daughter / sister / niece depending on who you're reading at the time.

** Every Weasley except for Ron has either an Arthurian name (Arthur, the inexplicably Italian transcription of Guinevere that is Ginevra, Percival) or a royal name (William, Charles, Frederick, George, arguably also Molly which is a diminutive of Mary). Off the top of my head, obvious candidate names could be Victoria, Elizabeth, Elaine, Isolde, or Igraine although the latter is weird as Igraine is King Arthur's mother.

  Percival
#+end_quote

Unlike several of his siblings (Bill, Ron and Ginny), Percy is not the contraction of another name (Percival), but his complete name. This is confirmed in OotP during Harry's trial chapter, where he has to write his full name as the court's script.\\
I am also pretty sure the same thing apply for Fred, but I don't think there are any evidence to confirm or deny it in his case.

** Elaine and Vivian are the best options thematically and sonically, imo. I would probably prefer Elaine unless it's Ginny's twin or you want to emphasize their relationship, in which case I think Vivian matches her name better

** Enid & Evaine are also female Arthurian names. Enid is cool because she literally goes on a quest with her husband and disobeys his wishes to keep him safe.
