I just can´t find this freaking fic anymore on ff.net.

In this FF Harry lost his eyesight and can now basically feel the magic around him. He gets the job as apprentice DADA Teacher and later takes over the lesson. He is a battle hardened Veteran of his war and becomes pretty much the second moody. I´m also pretty sure that in this fic, Sirius drugs Harry with a drink as a "prank" and Harry gets pretty pissed of because of it.

While im at it, i´m also looking for a timetravel story where fem Harry travels back as the MOD and gets adopted into the Potter Household. I´m pretty sure that Dumbledore and Harrys Grandmother know about her travel back in time. She attends Hogwarts in her 6th or 7th Year.

I also remember a moment where Sirius and James try to sneak into her room and look into her trunk.

The story got sadly abondend and the last update was, that another Author adopted the story. I just can´t find it anymore.

Cheers!


** There's one called linkffn(The Unbroken Saviour) where Harry becomes fem!Harry during the TT, is called Arianna, Kinda OP, but also not (its weird). Is Adopted by the Potters, but it isn't abandoned.

  Harry Potter gets captured in his 6th year, only to die and get sent back in time.. with a twist. He is reborn a girl with wild and uncontrollable magic as he tries to stop Voldemort's first rise to power with the help of Dumbledore. Can he change the future? Or is it set in stone?

  Albus was the only one awake in the castle. It was late at night, and he was stalling for time, not really up for more paperwork. Suddenly, a ripple in the wards sent him hurrying towards the source of the disturbance. Nothing could have prepared him for what he would find. And with Harry's luck, is anyone really surprised? Time-Travel fic.

** That second one sounds like The Last Peverell ^{linkffn(12744735).} Dumbledore and her grandmother don't know that she time-traveled, but they do know other secrets she doesn't want known.

  Being the Master of Death made life difficult, especially when you need to save all of magical Europe from inbreeding its way to extinction. At least Death was enjoying watching his Master attempt this over and over again. Harry didn't find it nearly as entertaining. Well, tenth times the charm right? (FemHarry)

*** Thanks for the answer, but this is sadly not the story im looking for.

HPfanfic is now basically my last resort, since im looking for these stories for weeks now, but i just cant find them anymore.

The one thing i remember is that i found both in a ffnet Community. I just dont remember which one.
