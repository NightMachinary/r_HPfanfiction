I'm looking for a specific story.

It is set after the battle of Hogwarts. Harry studies at Hogwarts during the summer, Bill and Fleur tutor him, and Dumbledore leaves a will that gives instructions on how to make a custom wand.


** A very highly upvoted post made one day ago was very clear about the need to put some description in any 'looking for fic' posts. You'll probably get more information if you spend 20 seconds reading the site.
