I'm looking for a fic that fallows a student or group of students at Ilvermorny that is either complete or is updated regularly. Time frame doesn't matter although it would be nice if it took place at the same time that Harry is at Hogwarts.


** Ok so i know this isn't exactly what you're looking for but The Alexandra Quick series is basically Ilvermorny in everything but names. Plus, the lore is more put together that whatever Rowling's doing with America.
