** I'm surprised there isn't more of that theme. The Muggle world was very close to destroy each other from the 1950s to early 1990s. Early 1980s was especially a dangerous time as Reagan raised the stake and put the Soviets in a very comfortable situation. Fear could drive people to do very stupid things.

I believe you made a similar request a few days ago, and I brought up a couple examples showing how close we were to the brink in 1983.

I think Darth Marrs' [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10912355/1/Revenge-of-the-Wizard][Revenge of the Wizard]], linkffn(10912355), has the Galactic Empire destroying the Earth and Harry leading some surviving Magicals to exact their revenge.

#+begin_quote
  A Harry Potter cursed with immortality must not only survive the ravaging of Earth by monsters far more powerful than any humanity has encountered, but he must rise to save it, and in the process exact one wizard's revenge against the Galactic Empire.

***** Yea, Thankyou. I was having a stressful day, and I was a bit snippy. Its still kind of annoying that he reposted nearly the exact same response though. But it was interesting to learn about, if somewhat depressing..
