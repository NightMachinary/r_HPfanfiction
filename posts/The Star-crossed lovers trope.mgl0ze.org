I wanted to know, since this is a trope I really like, if there were anyone else who liked it?

Also, what is your opinion on the trope itself according to your experience with HP Fanfic?

Does anyone have any fic they can recommend?

PS: I am new to this reddit and still navigating, sorry for any trouble I may bring.


** There must be somewhere some good pre-HBP Dramione, where Draco comes to his senses, while his parents don't (pre-HBP because after two attempted murders, Draco should be in Azkaban, not in Hermione's arms).

*** Interesting take. I see your point about the two attempted murder being just too much. Then again, I'm not a big fan of Dramione. I don't really like Harmione either. I'm a big hinny or rare pairing kind of guy.

**** 1. I am not a big fan of Dramione either, because I have yet to find a good redemptive arc for Draco (and no, I was not looking for it too hard), but I think it is very natural and a canon-compliant solution to the original problem.

2. I am not that much hung on the question of ships, what matters is story and plot, and everything else follows. So, yes, I generally prefer Hinny, but I understand that [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/blog/whats-wrong-with-ginny.html][canonical Ginny is so poorly written]] (and JKR cannot write a romantic scene to get herself out of a wet paper bag), that strictly speaking, using just pre-HBP canon, Harmony is probably more likely outcome (although, then you leave wasted a very powerful fairy-tale archetype of a knight saving a princess from dragon).

***** You just made me like Hinny more, with that forthright and excellent caveat.

As for redemptive Draco, I received some praise (and a lot of frustration) over how I dealt with it in A Simple Act of Vengeance. Because it is a long fic, and Draco's plotline is not central, i'll list how I did it here: Lucius drafts Draco to start the fight at the bookshop, so Draco is aware that his family has a part in CoS, which he has no problem with until Hannah Abbott is killed by the basilisk. Thr Abbott line stretches back further than his own, and Draco can't understand how someone like her could be seen as a worthy sacrifice in cleansing Hogwarts. As more violence and cruelty occurs, he slowly (over 2 years) sees that human life matters, even if its blood isn't pure. He falls in love with Morag, a half-blood, and after meeting a resurrected Voldemort, rejects the death eater path and makes plans to flee with Morag's family to the continent.

Over Yule Break, though, Harry comes seeking revenge for the Lovegoods, and kills every Malfoy.

***** That's an interesting article! I must admit, I mostly like Ginny because I had a friend who reminded her of me.

Also, I kind of like Ginny's development in the series, because it is actually interesting from a meta perspective... I don't know if I make sense ?

****** I really like Hinny myself, but I have to admit that I like them more because of the excellent writers like [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/103340][Northumbrian]], linkao3(601124), and others.

  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** I feel like this is why a lot of people pair Harry and Daphne Greengrass. Gryffindor + Slytherin is sure to bring up this type of issue. If you search this subreddit for “Harry/Daphne” or “Haphne”, I'm sure that you'll be able to find a lot of results.

*** Yeah I thought so too... I'll try and find interesting stuff then ! :-) But then again, I would have loved to see a Durmstang Harry x Beauxbaton Ginny, or Fleur, or any other rare pairing...

But anyway! Thanks for your opinion and advice :-)
