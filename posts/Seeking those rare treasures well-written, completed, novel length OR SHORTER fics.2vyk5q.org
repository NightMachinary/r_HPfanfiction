I can't be the only person who has a particular love for shorter fics, that are all the more impressive for packing such a punch in so few words. (And let's be honest, as fun as the sprawling fics are, it can be quite daunting to start in on a 100k fic...that might have 2 sequels, yet unfinished.)

So please, rec me the stories that have no fear of being left abandoned. The scenic one-shots, the unforgettable ficlets, the neat novella. Interested in anything around 50k words or less, but would prefer 15k or less.

Some possible examples: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180686/1/Across-the-Universe][Across the Universe]] are one-shots I think many people have heard of; I quite like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2082979/1/Remembering-Tomorrow][Remembering Tomorrow]] and [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/923019][Cheap Philosophy]] (ok, almost anything copperbadge, really). In the 10-30k range, perhaps [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/36645][Finding Viktor Krum]] (Mature, rarepair slash) or [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3673824/1/End-Of-the-Line][End of the Line]] (technically a crossover, though you don't need to know the other fandom).


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7062230/1/Concentric-Wavelengths][Concentric Wavelengths]]

My favourite one-shot.

Trapped within the depths of the Department of Mysteries, Harry is entangled in a desperate, violent battle against both the Death Eaters and a horrifying creation of the Unspeakables, with time itself left as his only weapon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4586362/1/Dark-Marauder][Dark Marauder]]

One-shot

The Maruaders were not nice people, but what if the gang was as Dark as they should at first glance appear to be? AU Marauders era one-shot.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3573787/1/Not-Slytherin-Enough][Not Slytherin Enough]]

One-shot

Harry was sorted into Slytherin. Five years later, members of the Order of the Phoenix come to collect him from Privet Drive. The Boy Who Lived isn't quite who they expected. Warning: female Blaise.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10108247/1/Proud-To-Have-a-Witch-in-the-Family][Proud to Have a Witch in the Family]]

Very short one-shot, but I found it funny.

Even if Lily's parents had survived the war, Dumbledore wouldn't have given Harry to them for the very same reason that the Evanses had been proud to have a witch in the family.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8272476/1/Secrets][Secrets]]

One-shot

One Shot. Harry Potter, Director of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, hates secrets. Dark story, not for children. Post-DH, adult Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9799457/1/Sirius-Black-and-the-Facts-of-Life][Sirius Black and the Facts of Life]]

One-shot companion to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5071058/1/The-Reluctant-Champion][The Reluctant Champion]] which is the novel length fic I'm currently reading.

Never promise Sirius Black he can answer your son's questions about babies. Just don't.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5998729/1/The-Valley-of-the-Kings-Massacre][The Valley of the Kings Massacre]]

Oneshot

An adult Harry finds his destiny as an independent curse breaker in Egypt.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3087210/1/Yin-and-Yang][Yin and Yang]]

Abandoned at 3 chapters and 50k words, but leaves off at a place that seems like a completed story. Although, if I could have any abandoned story picked back up, I'd want it to be this one.

PostHBP Following a trail of mysterious messages with a Yin & Yang symbol on them, Harry comes to certain devastating revelations, pushing him down the path to darkness. Dark!Harry, no romance.
