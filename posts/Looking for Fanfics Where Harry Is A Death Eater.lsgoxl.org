Like the title says, Also he must be it willingly not out of some spell or forced too in any way.


** I recommend the Downward Spire series. It is incredibly well written Here is a link to the series: [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/the-downward-spiral-saga.38068/]].

**** linkffn(Antithesis) fits the criteria at first but unfortunately he turns on Voldemort near the end. I really like the evil/death eater Harry trope but most of them have copious amounts of bashing in them.

  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
