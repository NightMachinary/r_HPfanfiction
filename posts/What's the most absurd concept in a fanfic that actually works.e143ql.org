Anything goes if it's absurd and good.


** Putting Gordon Ramsey in the HP universe. Linkao3(12805206) This fic is honestly so good. Gordon's personality is spot-on (very Masterchef Jr-esque but he goes full on Hell's Kitchen when arguing with Snape lol). I'm reading it right now, and I really love how Ron's character is written.

****** Yeah no I prefer my endings as unrealistically happy as possible. I mean, why have an interest in fiction if not to escape reality? Miss me with any realistic, tragic or bittersweet shit.

#+begin_quote
  Inspired by a post on Tumblr, this is a AU story set during Harry's sixth year at Hogwarts, with one big, foul-mouthed difference. Instead of Horace Slughorn, the position of Potions professor will be taken on by...Gordon Ramsay.

** There's a hilarious one about a Harry/Pansy relationship where they hate each other but persist in dating. It's a humorous story and is ridiculous. At one point Harry begs Voldemort to kill him so he will stop screwing her.

*** This reads like it was written by an alien who was possessed by a demon, but the demon was once a human and didn't know how to work the alien brain. So the alien with the demon inside it sat down to write out a story as the demon who spent 2344 years in hell remembers it, but the alien's mind isn't very good at verbal language and its only gradually developing a sense of morality and storytelling based on what the demon remembers from the memory fragments it has eaten.

*** God I love this one and wish it could be updated. At almost a year since last update I won't hold my breath but wow, I really love it. It's enough of a crack fic that it has the lighthearted entertainment I crave when reading something online, while still being serious enough and having solid character development to be an all around good story.
