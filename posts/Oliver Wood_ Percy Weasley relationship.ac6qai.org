Inspired by the hosts of the "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text" podcast, I realised that Oliver Wood and Percy Weasley would be really good together. Both are driven, passionate and very goal-oriented. Both have lived through turbulent times and seen their world's crumble. Their belives we're challenged, loved ones taken.

Naturally, I want to read some quality works with this ship.

Please, share if you have come across such treasures in the endless oceans of fanfiction (filled with trash just as much as the real ones). The lenght doesn't matter, the rating doesn't either. The only things I'm absolutely not interested in are Omegaverse, Mpreg and rape.

Also, if this could double as a prompt for someone, I would be elated.

P.S. Check out this podcast if you love such a thing. I find it very soothing.


** It's VERY old now, but I always loved A'jes' Blue's trilogy. Oliver/Percy don't cross paths until the second part and don't become romantically involved until the third, but the story as a whole is lovely. The premise is that there was another brother in between Percy and Charlie who died young. To help Percy deal with some delayed grief, Charlie and Bill drag him off to Romania to visit the dragons, but Oliver's Quidditch team just so happens to be working out nearby...

  This is NOT a sequel to FMR... This is a Percy Weasley angst-ridden story... Born from the idea that Ron is a seventh son and Percy lost his best friend very, very early.

  The third in the three episode story-arc that began with "Catharsis" and continued in "Fallout"... WARNINGS: This bit is *slash* as well as R-rated for not explicit sex. Pairing: Percy/Oliver (who else could it be?)

** There was a Percy-centric story with a Percy/Oliver pairing called "The Scarlet Pimpernel" by AMarguerite, but it appears the author took it down. You might see if someone downloaded it or use the wayback machine to read it: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20181030041926/https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3784000/1/The-Scarlet-Pimpernel]]
