After red Slave of Daphne - Iris Potter, (I'm not putting a link bc of its nature) is there a fanfiction where a Harry/Femharry did it with Daphne and Daphne corrupt them? I mean Daphne is dark and Harry became dark to be with her and does everything she says even killing muggles starting with his/her aunt family


** Not sure if it's what you're looking for but I'm currently working on a Dark!Harry fic where Daphne acts more like Macbeth's wife... she corrupts him and encourages him to do the first kill because she wants to use his name and fame to climb the social ladder but he ends up enjoying the taste and becomes so bad that he even scares Daphne. It's not a major plot in my story though but if you were interested in my project and act as my beta reader, PM me.

*** That sounds interesting. I would like to read that once you are finished. I just hope that it will have a happy ending, at least from the main charactersâ€˜ point of view ... I like my Shakespeare and tragic endings, but not in Fanfiction ðŸ˜…

**** It's intended to be an exploration of the trope 'you either die a hero or live long enough to become the villain'.

** I write a story in which Daphne leads Harry on a somehow darker path, even if it's not as extreme as you described.

The story: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13480069/1/Birds-and-Monsters]])

The oneshot the story is based on: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13435249/1/Desire]])

And here is a oneshot from another author: linkffn([[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13411100/1/As-above-so-below]])

  A slightly different purchase planning during his first visit to Diagon Alley means that Harry meets a completely different person than Draco Malfoy at Madam Malkins. How will this encounter change the fate of the world? And will two restless souls together be able to find some happiness and love in a ruthless world? HP/DG

  There were times when a single decision, a few words could irreversibly change a person's life. And sometimes even the fate of the entire world. Harry sensed that such a moment had come.

** There was the old Traitorous, by Flamata, if you can find a copy somewhere. I'm not quite sure about cause and effect (is Harry becoming Dark because of getting close to Daphne, or the other way round) because it's been that long, but back then it was good, anyway.

** Not a perfect match for what you're looking for but there is linkffn(6245561)

Plot summary kinda gives it away so I'll put it in spoilers

Daphne tricks Harry and kidnaps him. He gets tortured by Bellatrix and goes mostly insane. He escapes but is still messed up in the head
