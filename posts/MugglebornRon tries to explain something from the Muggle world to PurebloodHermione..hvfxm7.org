This would take place in an alternate universe where the Weasley kids are all Muggleborns as Arthur and Molly are muggles (bit of a stretch, I know), and Hermione is a Pureblood as her parents are Healers or whatever the magical equivalent is to dentists. Otherwise, their personality's are the same.


** I'm just imagining Arthur's enthusiasm for all things magical. “Ooh, do I get to ride the Floop?”

“It's Floo, dad.”

*** George is a Muggle, but that doesn't stop Fred from bringing him to Hogwarts all the time. Their pranks combine magic and mundane technology, including magically amplified whoopee cushions.

***** Let's make the Mixedblood!Weasley family rich too, to freak Draco out. At some point he finds that Arthur and Molly's net worth is more than Lucius', even though in the Muggle world they're not worth that much. And then they tell him about Bill Gates.

****** The funny thing is I'm sort of writing something like this right now where Hermione's parents became medical device inventors after dental school and they control several lucrative patents, own a chain of dentists and Hermione's Dad is GBE for his contribution to Medicine. The similarity is that it's going to be one of those 'we're richer than Malfoy' type stories.

******** I've been juggling three bunnies at once during the quarantine. I don't like teasing something unless I'm going to work on it. I might still post the first few chapters of the aristocrat!Hermione story just to see if anyone is interested in reading it. Most of my dear readers on AO3 want the smut, though, because that's what I normally write, so I'm not really sure how a story that starts when they're all 11 is going to be received.

** “Honestly, Ronald, it's not that hard! The judicial system of the Wizengamot is actually very logical, its members have many responsibilities and they are all very stretched, so it's really not their fault-“

“But /why?/”

(Honestly I could see this happening in canon)
