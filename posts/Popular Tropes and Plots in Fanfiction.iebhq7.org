What are some popular HP tropes in fanfiction?

I don't read much, I write, so there's a lot I'm not aware of. Like the seemingly popular trope about Harry being Lord of a bunch of houses. I've never seen it pursued of this subreddit but it's apparently fairly popular.

I was just wondering if there were any other popular tropes or plots that I wasn't aware of.


** Some of the more popular AU plotline tropes and their corresponding traits, which in all cases are /not mutually exclusive and do not imply causation./ Also, for most of these tropes, there are incredible examples of fics that subvert them, although doing this requires a keen knowledge of the implications of each trope. Subversions can also become tropes of their own.

*Independent Harry,* which sees Harry detach himself from the major forces in the war, usually because of distrust, and attempt to take down Voldemort by himself. This is usually accompanied by *bashing* (drastically changing for the worse and often flanderizing) canon characters who are close to Harry. Often these fics feature Harry inheriting multiple houses' lordships, friendly goblins, Harry becoming incredibly strong at magic and/or school, and Dark magic. Subtropes of this include attending a different school, dropping out of Hogwarts, and alternate Triwizard fics. Pairings associated with this trope include Daphne, Fleur, and Hermione, although many good fics without the trope exist for all three of those.

The most common storyline involving bashing is *manipulative Dumbledore*, where Dumbledore is pulling the political strings of every character, often illegally, and is either acting "for the Greater Good", plans to sacrifice Harry to defeat Voldemort himself, or is actually working against wizardkind. Because of the Weasleys' role in the Order of the Phoenix, this plotline often sees the Weasley family bashed, as well as most of the Order, with Sirius, Remus, and Kingsley often being the few spared.

*Wrong Boy Who Lived* is a trope-plotline where someone else (either Neville or Harry's sibling) is known to the Wizarding World as the BWL and has canon Harry's character. Early WBWL fics often build up to a "reveal" of the ignored Harry as the true BWL, but many of the most popular "WBWL" fics do not actually have this reveal, with the BWL being sincere. Often, Harry is in Slytherin. James and Lily are often alive in these fics, and the most typical examples feature bashing of them along with Dumbledore and the rest of the Order.

There are trope plotlines for every *alternate Sorting*: Slytherin Harry is the most common of these. Slytherin Harry fics are associated with independent Harry, manipulative Dumbledore, heavy politics, and mentor Snape (covered below). Hufflepuff Harry fics are associated with slice-of-life and crack. Ravenclaw Harry is the least common and doesn't really have many associated tropes, other than independent Harry. Sometimes, the hat refuses to sort Harry or sorts him as headmaster; most of these fics devolve into crack.

*Severitus* is a genre developed in response to sexually-explicit Snarry fics, and features Snape as a mentor/father-figure to Harry. These are often hurt/comfort fics where Harry is in Slytherin and the Dursleys' abuse is played up, which causes Snape to snap in anger and start caring for him (usually after noticing that he has Lily's eyes). EDIT: Originally, the genre was a challenge to write Harry as Snape's son. The term *Sevitus* denoted fics in which he was simply a mentor figure, but those are now generally regarded as Severitus as well.

There are of course countless others; this is just what I came up with off my head. Hope this helps.

*** This is a great list! Just for clarification though, a Severitus fic is actually based off a prompt/challenge by the writer Severitus. I can't remember all the rules off the top of my head, but Snape has to be Harry's father in it. If he isn't, and is merely a mentor/father figure, that's when it generally becomes a Sevitus fic.

Source: I read an embarrassingly large amount of Severitus fics

**** It's worth knowing some of these, because while some of these tropes have become legitimate genres, many writers end up writing the same plots independently. There's a /lot/ of Harry Potter fanfiction and these are simply some of the easiest divergences from canon to write.

** I see a lot of Marriage law fics. As the name implies, the Ministry enacts a marriage law, usually after the end of the 2nd Wizarding war in order to increase the population. All single adults must marry by a certain date (either by choosing their partner or the ministry does it for them) and pop out a few kids, or risk being sent to Azkaban. This trope is usually used to force Hermione into a relationship with someone she hates (Snape and Draco are the most common that I've seen)

Veela!Draco fics are where Draco is a Veela and has just come into his Veela heritage. It makes him even more beautiful and now he is unresistible to other characters such as Harry or Hermione. May or may not have a lot of sexy times past the first chapter.

*** You know what's funny about such measures? Not even Nazi Germany or the USSR under Stalin ever realistically considered such drastic measures, and both were aware that they needed more people. You know what the Nazis did to improve birth rates? Tax cuts and a pr campaign (awards for mothers and such), the SS went further and paid unmarried women to have children who were racially pure (the rest of the Lebensborn program did not really influence birth rates but merely abducted children).

It's funny how low some authors are willing to go to force a pairing.

**** Oh 100%. The whole genre isn't my cup of tea. I personally don't find anything romantic about being forced to marry and procreate with someone. But to each their own, I suppose!
