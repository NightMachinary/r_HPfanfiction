You know that one cook/janitor/menialandinsignifigantjobtitle/chef whose actually a total badasss like so badass that you need three s to show the level of badassery taking place. That one janitor who decides to teach the mc to be badass or the chef who wrecks an army and responds to "w-what are you!" with "a cook" or yoda because fuck cannon yodel is a fucking baker got it cuz if you don't I will force puff pastery your ass into last Tuesday that was on the October 31st and a full moon.

Basically that one guy nobody notices or cares about but is actually super badass and preferably a cook because I had this wierd dream about bardock actually being broke who was actually bobby flay while becoming jesus as he travelled the sea and I got puff Pastery on the mind so let's talk about them and recommend fics involving them because I'm tired now and am about to go to sleep but had to post sometjing cuz that dream was so trippy.

So like can we talk about those secret badasses and recommend shit about them and goodnight.


** Hum. Go watch the movie Under Siege ? Don't really know a fanfic where Filch was the Chekhov's gun that Harry knew not.
