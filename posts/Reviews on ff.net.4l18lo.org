Do you guys ever get a review but not get alerted about it? And I don't mean those occasional glitches the site has. But for example, I have one or two readers who leave reviews but I never get an email alert for it. I usually dont even know they left a review until I go to the review page to respond to other people's. I was just wondering why that is or if anyone else has noticed that too.

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I was just curious.


** I wasn't aware that was possible, I'm going to go check through my reviews quickly to make sure I didn't miss any.

Edit: I didn't see any, but I wasn't particularly rigorous in looking through all my email alerts - I just checked if there were any questions I hadn't answered.

*** Yep, two different reviewers of mine never show up in my email alerts and they're not guest reviewers either

** It happens to me sporadically. The annoying part is that you never got a 're-do' email notification. Sometimes, you just miss the review.

** Have you set a filter for them by accident?
