It might be fun to talk about the kinds of fics that get recommended a lot around here. And hopefully we can get an active discussion going about a popular fic or a popular author's work.

Fic suggestions? Other ideas?


** Could be a fun idea. How do you see it organised though? A comment branch for each title? Wouldn't such a thread get too “bushy”?
