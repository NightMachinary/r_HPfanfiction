I was mulling over the quote from the Ravenclaw door knocker in HPDH: "Where do Vanished objects go?" McGonagall replies "Into non-being, which is to say, everything."

Have stories taken this concept for non-objects? Animals? People?

The vanishing cabinet from the original stories was used twice, both times for great effect and I can't help but think that there are stories that could be told about The Place Vanished People Go. It makes me think of the Hell world that Nightcrawler jumps into between teleportation, but also grants the potential for things like time skipping forward by vanishing someone and then years later, re-summoning the into existence.

I can't recall any stories that have used this concept at all and if anyone has any, I would love to know!


** It's explored in linkffn(Alexander Dantes).

The first book is pretty good, if tropey; the second one goes a bit off the rails. But some cool concepts in there.
