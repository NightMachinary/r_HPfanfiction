In canon, Harry never wants to be anything other than 'Just Harry.' Any recommendations for a Harry who wants to reach his full potential and become something greater?


** Linkffn(The Life He Leads by GeneralStarfox) has a Harry diving into ancient Northern Magics, driving to be among the greats. I'm at Ch 29/32 and with the last update of Aug ‘19, I'm hoping this is wrapping up soon because I don't want to be left hanging! But it has been a fantastic read to this point.

**** The idea itself doesn't bother me, but it would need a proper explanation - namely a manipulative enough Dumbledore to prioritise Neville's need over Harry's inheritance, and an acknowledgement of that logic in story. Or potentially Dumbledore asking Harry's permission to retain the cloak and lend it to Neville beforehand - which I can see Harry accepting given that Neville is the BWL.

Then it isn't unreasonable you might say yes, if only out of social pressure/a desire to do the right thing. Especially if you're a heroic or self-sacrificing person yourself, which Harry may still be even without the BWL thing since he was already like that by the time he reached Hogwarts and learned about his BWL status.

************** Yeah, I can see that, but to an extent everything is kinda a crutch, in that if you remove anything that Harry uses or benefits from, he'd have to improve or develop to deal with the loss.

Remove the cloak, and Harry has to think or magic his way around situations where he previously relied on the cloak.

Remove Hermione, and Harry has to think or magic his way around situations where he previously relied on Hermione.

Overall, it's still better for him to have the crutch and succeed as a mediocre wizard, than not have it and be forced to work harder and risk failure more.

Better for us as readers, or better for the wizarding world long term, maybe not, but better for Harry.

** I think Harry wanted to be "just Harry" because he's never had a chance to be just Harry. He was either "freak" or "Boy Who Lived" or "Chosen One". He never got to just live his life.

If he'd grow up a happy kid in a normal family with no special destiny, maybe he'd have been more ambitious. And even then, wanting to be an Auror isn't exactly aiming low in terms of career. They're supposed to be the elite of magical law enforcement, and IIRC a number of Aurors have gone on to be Minister.

That said, I think teaching DADA is probably the job he'd be best and happiest at in the long-run.

**** The books are pretty consistent on them being considered elites (at least in theory- in practice probably some of them get their jobs through political or family connections). They have to have top marks, several years of training (McGonnagle details this to Harry in book five), and most of the ones we see are noted as fairly competent (Dawlish seems to be the exception, having "book smarts" but not actually being much good in a fight).

They do have a fairy wide range of responsibilities, though, likely due to the small size of the Wizarding World.

#+begin_quote
  Being the Boy-Who-Lived is horrible, because that's all anyone ever cares about. He wants them to look at him and see the person, not the false legend- the myth. And if he has to use all his power to create a legacy that will last a thousand years, then that's just what he'll do.
