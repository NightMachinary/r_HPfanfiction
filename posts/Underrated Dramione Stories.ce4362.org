I've been wanting to read some Dramione stories lately, but I feel like I've read all the popular fics already. Is there any seriously underrated, lesser known fics? I prefer Hogwarts era, but I'm open to whatever as long as it's complete and preferably a slow burn.

  Tired of Draco's arrogant claims that he can 'get any girl he wants', Daphne proposes a challenge to knock him down a peg or two. However when Draco unexpectedly accepts, the stakes are raised and neither Slytherin wants to lose. Elsewhere, Hermione has her own point to prove, but when she finds her path crossing with Draco's, will either of them succeed? 4th Year A/U *COMPLETE*

  “I can't tell anyone”, he repeated over and over again.Hermione helplessly stroked his back a couple of times.“Then don't”, she said.He stared at her with a bewildered expression.“Don't say anything”, she repeated. “Just play. I will stay and listen, if you want me to.”This is a bit of an AU. I was always a bit disappointed by the almost complete lack of music in the Harry Potter books. In my world, music is such an important thing... so I decided I would deviate from canon and make this a possible thing. I'm trying to stay as close to the original as possible though. It's mostly set in the sixth year and it's going to be pretty short. I'm planning on about 6 chapters total.

  COMPLETE: Hermione's eighth year at Hogwarts is already going to be difficult in the aftermath of the war, but it is further thrown into upheaval when Headmistress McGonagall orders a re-sorting of all students to promote inter-house unity. But when the Sorting Hat sends Hermione to Ravenclaw with Draco - and without Harry or Ron, how will she cope? [AU/Dramione] Prevalent alchemy.

  It's not until she's brought a basil and strawberry sponge cake to Neville Longbottom and his new girlfriend, Hannah Abbott, a dozen rhubarb hand-pies to Luna and Xenophilius Lovegood, and another basket of ganache-covered muffins to Dean and Seamus, that Hermione admits to herself what she's actually doing: she's making a thing of this. It's a veritable PTSD tour. With pastries. And hand-skimmed clotted cream. And she has no idea why she's doing it, but it's becoming very apparent that she is.  Sometimes you're sad. Sometimes you need dessert. And sometimes, it's a little of both.
