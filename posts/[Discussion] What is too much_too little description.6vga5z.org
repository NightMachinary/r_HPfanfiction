A topic that always interests me. I love detail in work, because it helps draw me into the story by creating a more vivid picture in my mind. That being said, too much is a huge derailment of the story. So where is the happy medium? What is too much, and what is too little? Do you have examples?


** It depends.

Perhaps a better question might be, what is the purpose of description in fiction? Description adds weight and importance to things in addition to giving us a better idea of what things look like. Things worth describing are things that add to the story. The corridors between Charms and Transfiguration don't matter, they're corridors. The first moment you see Hogwarts, that's important. Some places are like people and they need introductions. You don't introduce everybody but when you introduces someone of weight and importance you describe them.

An example might be, in Harry's second year he overheads some people talking about him being the heir of Slytherin. What is the important bit? The boys or Harry's reaction to their statement. Every bit of description of the boys from the moment Harry overhears them distracts from the reaction. I don't care what some random child looks like, who is friends are, what his dad's job is, what I want to know is if Harry is going to throw a fit or keep his head down. They're not characters those boys they're stimulus. Now on the other hand, your protagonist is walking towards the final confrontation with the antagonist. You want to add weight and importance to this. You want to reinforce what you've built, remind us he's alone and outgunned. I want tension built as he walks towards something that matters. I want to feel every step he takes, I want to know if there is pathetic fallacy, I want to know if its creepy or if the sun is rising giving them hope. I want to feel invested in something that matters. Heavy description here slows down the story but it adds importance, that pause acts like the pause at the top of a roller-coaster.

Therefore good writing should strike a balance. Unnecessary description bloats the word count which is something that can matter to amateurs but what it really does is slow down the story and adds weight to things that don't matter. The benefits are that things can be slipped in easily. Foreshadowing and references can be slipped into the middle of description without the flow of the story being broken.

This is extremely important. I have stopped reading very promising fics that started of well, just to drag on and on and on and on with stuff that didn't matter.

**** You don't like reading stories where they talk about the "pale skinned, avada kedavra green eyed boy with messy, raven hair" in every paragraph?

** I like detailed scenes, with decently placed "/fast-forward paragraphs/" or time-skips in between.

** To be fair, its not just about too much or too little. Its also heavily about WHEN or WHERE within a story it is provided. You can get a hell of a lot of detail into a story but it does not have to be in one big chunk, but can be snuck in in little bits, or one can create something like a prologue which deals heavily with laying out the world.

So realistically I think its less about quantity or lack thereof, and more about quality and how its inserted.

** I think in general if description actually adds to the tone or feeling of a scene, and isn't just description for the sake of description, it's good. Initially describing Hogwarts by impressing its how incredible and magical it seems, sure, a paragraph on a feast, maybe not.

Also, it's not the large scale, Tolkienesque paragraphs of description I think you're talking about, but caution's needed using adjectives/adverbs. There's another fandom that has the problem of a particular character always having a 'vulpine smile', which gets obnoxious. At the same time, cracking open a thesaurus in order to get new descriptions for each bit of dialogue is equally annoying. Sometimes it's just not needed.

**** Certainly, that's sort of what I was trying to get across. Though in terms of dialogue I prefer minimal speech tags. 'he/she said' for instance, without any fluff.

***** Though 'said' gets old after a while. Appropriate use of tags is not bad. And does break monotony. Upside is there are lists online of the hundreds of options.

** This has nothing to do with Fanfiction but Stephen King, to me, adds great description that adds a ton of weight to his stories (currently re-reading "It" right now before it's cinema release). On the other hand, Jonathan Franzan is also an author who adds a lot of description (especially with his book "Freedom") yet I felt the story never went anywhere with it. It kind of sputtered into near-boredom and instead of ending with a Bang! it ended with a mere whimper.

*** The only author who adds just enough imho is Patrick rothfuss. He also manages to write a perfect story.
