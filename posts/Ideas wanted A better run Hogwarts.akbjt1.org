I am working on a fic where Hogwarts is run better than in canon. Got any ideas?

Some I thought of: More sports

Clubs

NEWT students required to tutor younger kids (1hr a week)

School store that sells supplies etc

More teachers

Teachers have assistance (maybe they are working towards their mastery)

House elves run a small farm to keep food cost down

More classes (including option after owls to do vocational classes instead of NEWTS)

Weekend classes for things like music, art etc

(Not sure on this one) still having having houses but everyone stays in the same dorm split by year mates.

Eight story library split by year. Firsts year on first story going up. Eighth floor for restricted action. Students can only go one floor above their grade.

Any more thoughts would be lovely :3


** A couple of things:

#+begin_quote
  More sports & Clubs
#+end_quote

There are clubs in canon. Harry just did not care for any of them, so we don't know them. But there is both a choir and a gobstones club that are mentioned.

#+begin_quote
  NEWT students required to tutor younger kids (1hr a week)
#+end_quote

That's not going to happen. Have you ever even seen a real school?? This isn't going to happen. Fred and George tutor some poor kid? This is just completely not how schools work.

#+begin_quote
  More teachers & Teachers have assistance (maybe they are working towards their mastery)
#+end_quote

Hogwarts is ridiculously understaffed. We would need three times as many teachers for each course. years 1-3, years 4-5 (OWLs) and years 6-7 (NEWTs) should be handled by different teachers.

We would also need an entirely separate support staff for the "boarding"-aspect of Hogwarts. Positions like "head of house" are a full-time job in itself and not something you do while also teaching transfiguration to 7 years!

#+begin_quote
  House elves run a small farm to keep food cost down
#+end_quote

For all we know this already happens. Harry never bothered to find out where the food comes form.

#+begin_quote
  Weekend classes for things like music, art etc
#+end_quote

How is this a different category from "clubs"??

#+begin_quote
  (Not sure on this one) still having having houses but everyone stays in the same dorm split by year mates.
#+end_quote

As insane as it sounds: the houses are NOT an invention of Rowling, but a real thing British boarding schools do... Also, if they aren't sleeping in the same dorm, then what is a house even??

I'm massively late so I imagine you won't reply to this (nor do you need to), but thought I'd say this for any other people who read this thread.

It's doable and has been done. My school had older students tutoring younger ones. It worked to varying degrees depending on the chemistry between them.

My school also had something called vertical tutoring, where our form groups didn't consist of people just from your academic year, but instead had students from 11-18 all in the same form.

It kind of helped encourage kids to socialize across years, and in the better cases the older students helped out younger ones in beneficial ways and learned to take on some responsibility.

I would argue that smaller dorms or even single rooms would be preferable over some barrack style dorm where 20 people share a room. Because honestly, I would refuse to go to such a school and rather learn French than to suffer through that.

#+begin_quote
  Students can only go one floor above their grade.
#+end_quote

What's the point here? The restricted section is off limits because the contents can be dangerous (dark magic, complex potions which easily go wrong), but why would you ban students from reading a book on Thestrals or the history of magical Europe just because it is not within their scheduled curriculum? What if someone is interested in Potions and wants to read some of the advanced material because their teacher is an abusive bastard? Or read up on the monsters they know from Muggle folklore?

#+begin_quote
  NEWT students required to tutor younger kids
#+end_quote

Why make that compulsatory? And a lot of people are simply not good at teaching. Hermione would completely overwhelm some poor first year and Malfoy would probably sabotage a Mudblood by telling him/her false information simply to fuck with them.

If you want to improve Hogwarts, fix the pureblood supremacy and the teachers who suck at their jobs (Snape, Binns, Trelawney, Hagrid for anything but NEWT classes). Those are by far the biggest issues.

Now that I think on it I agree but I still like the idea of students running study groups or tutoring. Though I can't think of what reward would work. As for the library it was more of the thought that you don't want first years hurting themselves by trying magically costly spells.

** I like the idea of NEWT-level projects and it fits in with the British education system as A-Levels require independent coursework. My A-Levels in Business Studies and Psych for example required me to write a business plan for a start-up in our city and to carry out a psychological study. Other subjects have more traditional essay-based submissions but are still the student's own choice so it allows for a lot of variety.

It also leaves lots of room for creativity in fanfic to have characters figuring out what they should do for their projects and it can even be tied into the storyline as a whole by having them discover something which can help in the war (or whatever else the story revolves around).

** The only real problem is understaffing for core subjects. While Trelawney has a couple of classes a week and is free to lounge with her bottle of sherry, McGonagall has three time as much classes and has to juggle two other positions as well, Sprout has a dozen greenhouses to tend to and Snape has all the hospital wing and probably other potions to brew.

I like it when fics add Art classes or some introductory courses for Muggleborns, though sometimes writers focus too much on describing all these shiny new clubs and choirs and football teams and healing courses. If they are introduced, they must have some relevance to the plot or character development.

** I know it's usually the realm of Lord yada yada yada, but honestly culture classes for muggle-born and muggle raised make sense. And the same for purebreds/magic-raised to take mandatory muggle studies.

If I were to suddenly move to Britain or France or somewhere else, I would have at least a rudimentary idea of the country and the culture there. Muggle-borns have no clue about the world that they are moving into and the Muggle world has advanced by orders of magnitude in the last few decades. Even in the 90s, when Harry Potter is set, the world was hugely different then it was in the 70s and 80s.

** And why are you restricting non-restricted knowledge? Hamper learning, will you? Yes, not everybody is Merlin, Dumbledore or Voldemort but a lot of kids will learn extra stuff in areas they are interested in and the true geniuses will not like it if you don't let them learn (some might even transfer to Durmstrang etc.)!

No trick-stairs (and other such dangers!), no sexist staircases! Either the boys dorms also get a defense against girls or the girls get theirs removed!

Economics class and politics (for people who are interested)

Wizard-Studies for muggle borns (mandatory for muggleborns and muggle raised half-bloods!) and Muggle-Studies (not taught by a pureblood, but by a muggleborn - mandatory for purebloods and wizard raised half-bloods!)

More teachers (seriously, I doubt McGonagall has any free time - Deputy Headmistress, Head of House, Transfiguration teacher etc. - I bet she'd love not teaching the first 3-4 Years! Only taking OWL-Year and above students! Same goes for Snape, I bet he'd be friedlier (or at least not a total asshole) if he had time for more research and less "dunderheads" to teach!)

Students get their own rooms (can't do homework in a crowded and loud common room! Hell, even a library isn't the quietest of places!)

Students can earn special rewards (peeks at the teachers' private book collections or something like that!) and are allowed to decorate their rooms (older students might to expansion charms, transfigurations etc.)

More teachers and subjects - restoration or healing - alchemy - mind arts - spell creation - curse breaking - Dueling - enchanting - advanced core subjects - ritual magic - illusion and mysticism - dark arts - wandless magic - conjuration - magic and technology

Sports - fencing - Dueling - battle school (great fic too!)

Houses that only get points that apply to sporting contests and academic scores Everything else is just separated by year. House doesn't have to matter except in competitions. Dorms assigned randomly and change yearly (separated only by gender. 4 dorms each gender non house affiliated. Eg 1A - boys and 1A girls, 1B Ect.) 10 cubicles per dorm(non private, just low walls) and 2 people per cubicle. People can choose these beds. 2 dorm cops (older prefects that have private rooms attached to dorms) can give punishment individually. Year 4 move to shared private rooms (2 people) and above that it's private studies. This was close to the way my boarding school was run.

Likewise, Hogwarts teaches the core subjects, and then those who want to become healers or curse breakes can get training with an apprenticeship at St.Mungo or Gringotts. For people who are interested in spell creation and mysticism, there is Department of Mysteries, and so on. And many students are going to inherit their family business, or play Quidditch, or work as a clerk at the Ministry, and they don't really need any of that fancy stuff at all.

Been done a time or two- I even saw a fic where the supposed real purpose of the Room of Requirement was to serve as a farm during sieges, simulating perfectly an outdoor environment- and leading some credence to it... the great hall- one of their earlier attempts at an indoor greenhouse stronger than glass (I assume unbreakable charms depend on the base material at least partly with this theory)

I've seen all house common rooms with temporary copies of relevant texts/supplementary reading for each year done before, using professors I think to supervise, gradually ending house prejudice, it was a bit too easy though, crack for sure.

--------------

Now, further ideas:

Start off teaching the brats about the wizarding world/school- yep, orientation day, sucks for them but at least no work the first "class day".

A guided tour through Hogwarts and/or maps handed out that at least show the route to their classes, the library, bathrooms, the healer's office and the great hall and stuff.

Start off the kids with occulmancy classes if you want to make it easier for them to learn and depending on how you want your occulmancy to work. Obviously Snape and Dumbledore wouldn't like not being able to peek in the minds of trouble makers so sadly you have to kill them or ship them off to the Goblin mines to shovel dragon shit, or have them have a change of heart or something.

Muggle subjects- at least a writing class for first years so they know how the hell to write essays and what is expected out of those essays.

Latin Class so they understand spell composition better. (though it's all supposedly pseudo latin anyway)

History: Replace Binns, possibly with ghosts/paintings that aren't boring and experienced history- or have a teacher that uses those as guest speakers. Possibly have Mrs Frizzle teach the class- or maybe Mr Peabody- I seem to remember a fic where Mr Peabody adopted Harry as his boy and eventually took over for Binns.

Castle could probably use insulating- and electricity would be nice for the muggleborns if you can work out how to plausibly make it work- one fic I saw had them build something just outside of the wards, a power generator and a 'modern' muggle home otherwise for the most part- revamped muggle studies.

Wards need updating bad- trolls shouldn't get in school, nor cursed diaries or any of the really bad stuff on the list of banned items, nor howlers, etc.

Quills suck- a lot of fics have them as wand cores to prevent cheating or spelled to but nothings stopping them from just putting those same cores or whole quills into a felt pen or something. Paper would be nice too.

Muggle sports, or at least a basketball like version of Quiditch. Quadpot too (again on broom sticks but one of the balls explodes like hot potato or something)

Better career guidance- perhaps allowing shadowing of professionals and/or career days.

Healing course

Dueling course

More diverse meals, healthier too possibly

PE class

Sell off the stuff in the room of requirement to pay for it all, or make a magical museum out of it and charge admittance.

Better potions classes if your Snape is incompetent (Some fics show him as strict because potions is dangerous and for all we know his first lesson was why to take potions seriously and after that he started at the beginning with basics of potion preparations and potion ingredient reactions charts and shit.

A planetarium so kids don't have to ruin their sleep schedule a night every week- instead have outdoor classes once or twice a year or something.

Field trips- I've seen trips to the ministry of magic, muggle london (for muggle studies students) and the bank because goblins.

More inclusive (Invite vampires and shit), double edged sword because werewolves are a bad idea- they let the thing roam free on full moon nights putting everyone in danger- Snape almost got eaten by the thing- sure it's not his fault but safety should be any schools first priority followed by a good education.

Gather donations from alumni.

Hogwarts reunions to drum up some money maybe.

Yearly/biyearly dances/proms (Research what's done in the UK, I know it's different from the US)

Have the elves provide birthday kids with cake.

Parent/teacher days where the muggles can see what their kids are learning instead of paying for something as far as they know might be parlor tricks that won't earn a good living.

DADA - change the name or have Tom Riddle's award to the school be a hocrux and/or carry the curse of DADA- and destroy it- or have the Diadem in the room of requirement handling the curse and destroy it (Hire cursebreakers to go through every inch of the school or have Aurors do it.). Target practice should be a thing- paintball (with a paint spell) dodge ball (With levitating spells) to help learn aiming/blocking unfriendly AKs with a solid object might work.

Practical skills aren't much seen- it's like most of the classes are teaching the fundamentals necessary for preforming any spell (transfiguration doesn't make much sense if that's not the case)- which means the only people getting a good education are self-motivated people and those that spend a lot of time in the library researching new spells like Hermione- you should change that- kids shouldn't be expected to know that without being told or be expected put in the effort needed on their own. It's like they're breeding incompetence.

Penis, er, I mean wand inspection day, have all the students wands tested since Neville and Ron used floppy wands and that's just no good- they weren't getting a good education with those things.

Maybe teach wand crafting and shit so they can make their own- at least a basic wand that will be better than nothing in an emergency- when you're dependent on a stick and don't learn how to make one- well that's just kinda silly when it's supposedly so essential.

Wandless magic (maybe for 6/7th years if it takes a lot of power), wands are often seen as a crutch.

And that's just off the top of my head.

Edit: No one should hold more than two positions, much less 3 or more- no time for that. Possibly dedicated heads of houses (hundreds of kids with no supervision- no wonder things get so crazy). Possibly more teachers.

Edit 2: Have the sorting hat screen for abuse and/or have mandatory check ups for all students- perhaps requiring wizarding vaccinations before admittance.

********** Where do you get that idea from? I mean sure, Greyback is practically the definition of what you describe, but other than him and Remus we know practically no werewolf in canon. We do know though that the wizarding world in general seems to heavily discriminate against them, with Remus unable to really get a job, everyone being afraid of / outright hating werewolves etc. (Not sure if this 'Umbridge always tries to push stricter anti-Werewolf laws' thing is canon or fanon though.) Which might possibly be connected with them having a very bad reputation, thanks to people like Greyback, so... yes, there are most definitely /some/ werewolves like him.

But honestly, the probability of many werewolves being simply normal people who are driven to violence as they're already heavily discriminated against (werewolves are not allowed to go to school for example, as Remus was an exception thanks to Dumbledore) is pretty high in my opinion. So it would be really easy to rally them against the rest of the wizard society (which in turn, of course, confirms what the rest of the society thinks about them, thus creating a vicious cycle). That doesn't mean that they're all mindless killers though. If anything, admitting werewolf children to a school, granting them the same rights as 'normal' wizards would probably help to improve the general 'werewolf problem' by a lot in the long term...

Of course, that part is speculation too, but just based on what we know of the two canon werewolves we have really isn't enough to say that all werewolves are murderous beasts. At least not in the Harry Potter canon. (I mean - in their wolf form they most probably are, but that really only is a case once a month, during which there are possibilities to create safe environments for them to transform, I assume)

You treat the whole thing as civil rights issue when the reality is closer to terrorism. You will certainly find the odd decent person in between ISIS fighters (Lupin), but as a matter of fact, most of them are not.

************ Your answer actually doesn't contradict mine. At least not directly. I never denied that there were loads of werewolves working for Voldemort, but we never know if they are being murderous assholes for fun (like Greyback) or if they're angry at being denied their basic human rights based on a condition outside of their own control.

Of course, what they end up doing is terrorism. I'm not questioning that - I'm questioning their motivation. I believe that it's more desperation driving them than simply all of them being mindless beasts.

There actually is a quote in your linked article making it even clearer to me:

#+begin_quote
  *Remus Lupin*: "/I've been living among my fellows, my equals. Werewolves,... I'm not complaining it is necessary work and who better to do it than I?/"\\
  *Harry Potter*: "/How come they like Voldemort?/"\\
  *Remus Lupin*: "/They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life./ "
#+end_quote

So... Yes, in canon there is a group of terrorist-werewolves around. But basing all werewolf personality traits on a group of extremists can't be right either. As this is exactly what's making these extremists get their followers.

(Imagine it being switched around - werewolves are ruling and humans do not have the right to work and need to register themselves. How long would you think it takes for a group of the most violent humans to gather a lot more sympathisers who just want their basic rights, forming a big terror organisation? Does this mean all humans in this scenario are evil now?)

(Again, I agree that these specific people should be punished for what they did. They are not 'good' people. But they are not 'evil' because they are werewolves, but because what society paints them as. Saying their species is at fault is, in the end, racist, as there is no canon proof that all werewolves are evil (except for Remus, for some reason).)

In the end, even canon rebukes this, obviously painting the anti werewolf legislations as evil (as seen e.g. [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Anti-werewolf_legislation][here]] ) as well as depicting discriminating actions, like Lyall Lupin calling werewolves "soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death", as a bad thing.

I'm not even saying that it isn't fair game to paint them however you want in fanfiction, I just disagree that canon demonises them to the extent you've been describing.

Well, to me it pretty much looked like you said it's not racist to say werewolves are evil:

#+begin_quote
  Given how Lupin is the only non-murderous werewolf, that is not called racism (speciesism?) but common sense. Werewolves are not cuddly men who have a chocolate addiction, they are killer machines who live to spread their curse by brutally attacking others.
#+end_quote

Because otherwise I totally agree, besides Remus all canon werewolves seen are pretty much bad guys and it doesn't speak too much for them that they rally behind people like Greyback or Voldemort. Though I can still see where they are coming from, even if this is obviously not the right way to go. (In the end, Remus /was/ privileged, being allowed to even attend Hogwarts...)

Fair enough, he's not canon. I was just trying to show how the whole universe tries to make it clear that not all werewolves are evil by showing that anti werewolf laws and phrases are bad too. Umbridge's anti-werewolf legislation /is/ canon after all.

And I still believe it was Greyback choosing himself as the leader by simply rallying other werewolves with no other options to his cause. I mean, it's probably better than to be oppressed and hated by everyone with no reason? At least in their mind. Rallying up the unsatisfied people is surprisingly easy as a bad guy... Guess what Hitler did, too, in the end... :/

***************** And that legalisation is probably the only thing where Umbridge had a point. I mean, not even Lupin was safe to be around because, as proven in canon, wolfsbane is not foolproof. Even the "best" werewolf came very close to mauling/infecting three children through gross negligence on his side (and Snape's). That's why hating werewolves is common sense. There is no safe werewolf. Each of them we get to know is proven dangerous.

A general workplace ban is the wrong option, but the current legalisation is entirely inadequate. Ideally, you would detain them in a secure location around the full moon and force them to wear a tracking device. And chuck the criminal ones into Azkaban of course.

So how is that an argument regarding safety? In the Harry Potter universe, every eleven year old kid is running around with a wand that can kill you with, like, thousands of spells and nobody cares... And there are dozens of dark wizards 'proven to be dangerous' and it's still not common sense to hate all wizards for it. (Well, there always seem to be marginalised groups of wizards too though - and surprise, they often start rebelling as well, like muggleborns under Voldemort's regime)

To be fair, better laws regarding the actual transformation would probably make sense, but everything that's touching the ~29 days/nights a month where a werewolf is /not/ dangerous (at least not because of his 'condition') is just wrong.

​

I feel like we're going in circles by now though, so perhaps it would be simpler to just 'agree to disagree' on this issue, seeing how it was simply not a focus in the books so basing arguments on the scraps available is pretty hard and ends up automatically going into the assumption route.\\
You assume they're mostly evil (?), I assume they're mostly desperate. We'll never know - but that's what fanfictions are for, I guess. We can read/write whatever we prefer.

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason that Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after his meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

  Weird. I guess whenever I step on a stair my leg muscles just decide to not work then. I mean, a normal school has....say 20 steps per floor? That is not an exercise, I agree. But climbing 2 floors, each a couple of hundred steps, just to get to one class is. And, again, they do have actual sports.
#+end_quote

No, it still isn't.

  There's Polyjuice, Ageing Potions, Love Potions. Truth potions, and stuff like that. I'm sure there's a potion for this as well.

#+end_quote

They are competent. But curriculums are not chosen by the teachers. They have little power in that regard.

#+begin_quote
  So? We already established that your PE teaching was bottom-of-the-barrel.
#+end_quote

No, we have not. We have two people that have different experiences, you and me. It doesn't mean that mine is the bottom of the barrel if you received much more.

You seem to expect an all-or-nothing enjoyment reaction. You seem to expect someone to enjoy all sports equally or none of them, expect children to already know all about it without even exposure. Some kids like football but not cycling, others like skiing but not acrobatics. Proper teaching includes exposing children to a wide variety of possibilities, some of them they never experienced before, and being able to judge which suits which child,

  That is not how it works. And besides, it is an extremely rare subject that less than a handful people know in all of wizarding Britain.
#+end_quote

It works however the author decides it works- if we went exactly by canon every fanfiction would just be.. canon. I mean honestly... Besides, it's entirely possible Snape was teaching the quick and painful method, trying to turn Harry's mind into an attack dog at best- something I could see him doing. [[https://eocinstitute.org/meditation/meditation-will-increase-your-capacity-for-learning/][Meditation in itself is said to be beneficial to learning]] as well.

#+begin_quote
  Most of it isn't even related to Latin. Some of it is, but only a tiny bit
#+end_quote

Then teach what it is related to, honestly.

#+begin_quote
  That was tried in the second year. It was a massive failure. Combined with the lack of teachers and the fact that there is a different teacher for DADA and it simply becomes not feasible
#+end_quote

I later go on to say get more teachers. And of course it failed- it was run by Lockhart and Snape.

#+begin_quote
  They are in charms and DADA. And Transfiguration has lots of practicality, most of it is just for the upper years tho.
#+end_quote

DADA- depends on the year and the competence of the teacher. Charms? Yep, teaching pineapples to tapdance is of the utmost importance- though it is more useful than most transfigurations- I'd hate to have to hunt down a rat to make a box because that's the only spell for it I know.

#+begin_quote
  You yourself pointed out why that is a bad idea.
#+end_quote

People said the same things about ending segregation- it has it's problems but it can be argued it's the right thing to do.

#+begin_quote
  Never happened canonically with Dumbledore and only once with Snape. And that was after Harry almost murdered Draco.
#+end_quote

How many times did Harry say/think that Dumbledore and Snape seemed to know all his secrets or something along those lines? More- every time Harry was noticing Dumbledore's twinkle could have easily been.

#+begin_quote

#+end_example

#+begin_quote
  Why
#+end_quote

Why try to get more money? Seriously? Tons of reasons, extra teachers to reduce class sizes, replace the brooms that are falling apart leading to accidents, to put in place additional changes and upgrades.

#+begin_quote
  No one would attend paid reunions.
#+end_quote

I'm not saying to charge em a door fee- but getting them into the door and trying to convince them to donate...

#+begin_quote
  Hogwarts is free. No tuition fee no nothing. All they need to buy are books, a wand, and clothing. Schools supplies for seven people (Used) are less than a single galeon
#+end_quote

Yes, and that's why the school brooms are crap- Okay, I admit that's the biggest and most glaring example of why they need more money but you're telling me the teachers wouldn't /like/ a raise if nothing else- like say getting additional teachers for dangerous subjects- Professor Snape certainly could have used an assistant to stop Dunderheads from adding this or that and cause accident for example.

#+begin_quote
  Except it is never needed. It only is useful in war times. And those are supposed to be rare. Even then only the most gifted can do it, and even they prefer using wands.
#+end_quote

You're taking a lot of the magic out of magic- never useful? So there isn't some super easy disarming charm that rapists and thugs could learn? Even outside of war there's going to be criminals- besides the Muggles will learn of witches and wizards eventually and bigots still exist, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt#Modern_cases][still hunting down witches]]

#+begin_example

#+end_example

#+begin_quote
  Why?
#+end_quote

Might bypass the curse, possibly not but hey, it's something easy enough to try. Sides' one should learn how to defend against others in general- not every criminal is going to know dark magic.

#+begin_example
  or have Tom Riddle's award to the school be a hocrux
#+end_example

#+begin_quote
  why?
#+end_quote

Why not- it'd give an anchor to the curse- a reason why Dumbledore couldn't break it- if perhaps it was a sentient being behind it, a piece of soul constantly reinforcing it perhaps.

#+begin_quote
  One of the most powerful wizard in Wizarding Britain couldn't break it in 31 years so no fresh out of the school curse breaker ever will.
#+end_quote

It's all about specialization- yeah Dumbledore's a super wizard, but how much practice does he have cursebreaking? We don't know that- did he go out of his way to study cursebreaking? Are there skills typically learned person to person in the field? Are there tricks the books don't cover?

You wouldn't expect your mechanic to be able to preform rocket surgery, why are you expecting an old man to be the expert of every single field better than ones that have dedicated their entire lives to it?

#+begin_quote
  I see. So you know how to make all of your essentials then? Food, water, house and all that stuff?
#+end_quote

I know how to grow food in small quantities- gardening you see and could do so in an emergency probably- I know how to obtain water and I redid most of the plumbing on a house, I could manage a leanto at the very least. So ha.

Really this is about worst case scenarios, and it's such a central part of the magicals way of life- what's wrong with teaching them the basics about wands and wand crafting so if the muggles attack and they're scattered to the winds they won't be useless should their fragile stick break?

#+begin_quote
  Great idea. Let's let a hat mind rape your secrets and hope that someone will help you. Harry was starved, people knew that and nobody did a thing.
#+end_quote

Yeah, because the hat doesn't already do that to sort you. Harry was a special circumstance- most students won't have old men scheming to keep them in an abusive house so they'll stay alive.

The only explanation for learning some of those offbeat spells I can think of is is to teach concepts/theory that can aid in more advanced transfigurations or other transfiguration spells that aren't shown taught- such as a more freeform kind of transfiguration spell, or using more common things to transfigure.

That's more or less what I've been saying- useless spells for learning theory and as building blocks... but I still say the kids are meant to be using the library to supplement their education and learn useful spells.

#+end_quote

Newt could very well have a magical zoo, though transfiguring them instead is a good enough idea- so why did Hagrid get the job of Care of magical creatures instead of a Transfiguration master that could make sure his creations didn't kill anyone? Maybe the behavior of the transfigured animals is only as good as the knowledge of the person creating them, or maybe control over them is more direct or any number of reasons.

For that matter, why get pets and not just transfigure animals? Why date, just transfigure a woman out of a chicken?

More many zoos have tours with knowledgeable staff.

Planetariums... Maybe they wouldn't care, they see the stars enough, but museums?

There are some really fun/cool museums out there, like Discovery Children's museums- I used to beg my parents to take me. And what kid doesn't like seeing massive dinosaur skeletons?

I see you've already choosen to stand with the Wizards when the war breaks out. What magical can cast hundreds of spells in a minute like a machine gun? There are limits, either due to some sort of magical core (not canon as far as I Know), depleting one's innate magic power, or things that are supposedly impossible with magic (Like making food out of magic) that we could do with technology (Lab grown meat).

#+begin_quote

Well, maybe outside of wars but you're discounting just how many security cameras are in the muggle world and just how many wizards are ignorant of them. Apparating place to place is probably going to be the worst- just because an alley has no people doesn't mean a camera can't see into it.

#+begin_quote

That doesn't quite add up- wands are more like guns than fists, and wands/magic can do more than just injure/kill.

#+begin_quote
  Lets be honest here, he did jack shit as a headmaster.

He did worse than jack shit, hiring such gems as Lockhart, Snape and that guy with Voldemort on the back of his head. Though maybe he really didn't know what he was doing there.

#+end_quote

Yes- I couldn't spell it off the top of my head if I wanted and didn't feel up to googling just for the name- and it looks like you felt the same.

Time, yes, but he has hobbies too- though we never see it Dumbledore's said to like bowling (said on his chocolate frog card) for example, and we have no idea the work load he's under- I bet he has a backlog of mail when he returns from the ICW, a lot of people asking his advice if nothing else.

Additionally it can't be easy to find DADA professors when they all die/go insane/flee from Hogwarts.

Not to mention Alchemy which seems like a rather demanding field though we know next to nothing about it canonically.

Hell, maybe he's writing his memoirs and RIta found the rough draft after he died.

#+begin_quote
  Wards aren't canonically a thing. Different Difficult Protection spells layered and combined are a thing although it's not clear to what extent.
#+end_quote

Wards is just a word describing a grouping of related spells for protection- so what if J.k. didn't use it? She didn't use the word teleportation or if she did she didn't use it often, but saying someone teleported in Harry Potter just means they apparated or otherwise magically transported themselves somewhere.

Besides- finite incantatem could very well be the brute force method- JK R. never went into detail. Maybe it uses blunt force, wiping out any active magic (spells) with the raw power of the caster, or maybe it makes a magical black hole that sucks all magic out of that spot and dumps it in Disneyland or another dimension- whatever.

#+begin_quote
  More magical, the better the wand.
#+end_quote

Something is better than nothing, and I imagine despite seeing some fanfics that are claim the contrary that a person's own hair would be a good match for them- even if the wands a little floppy that counts for more than a bit.

Since we have no proof on Flitwick's words I'd assume its more of a warning. Sorta like you warn your kids that if they misbehave a boogeyman will steal they away/Santa Claus will gift the coal/etc.

They don't need to. Apparate to the government, Imperius the leaders, war over. Apparate to nuclear bombs, nuke the muggles, war over. Fly over a city and Fiendfire. War over. They don't need to attack directly. And if they are shot at, shielding charms.

We never find out- obviously three kids getting through defenses to keep out a Dark Lord is absurd but.. Honestly I think Rowling never planned much ahead with her series- someone could have accioed trevor the Toad for Neville (upset kid and a simple spell to get him happy again, why not?), we don't hear about the great hall being off limits for any reason (such as apparation practice) until Harry's old enough to go through it himself, and a lot more little things like that.

I think Rowling wanted Dumbledore to be the good guy, but didn't count on her later putting even better spells in her books otherwise the stone would be under a fidelius charm- though it's possible she meant him to be some grand manipulator trying to force the confrontation early, to resolve the prophesy- though the idea of testing Harry with it is absurd- too likely Harry would die and I doubt even Dumbledore could have weathered the shit storm of this national hero being killed on his watch.

Except some companies like Microsoft have no grounds for copyrights seeing as most of their Eula is not valid under the law. That's why they don't go after people who resell their keys super cheap. It is legal despite their wishes. And plenty of companies know better than to push. They don't want to be massively fined or have an incident that forces them to change stuff. And Movie theaters can't do anything about bootlegs, at least the Chinese ones. I believe they are legal...at least in China they are. Unless you mean filming and reuploading it on the internet?

**************** Taken down fast but some people still saw them- and with something like this... that's enough really, secrets once out are hard to get back in.

President has and knows some but all, or all that knows- probably not- probably knows that knows that knows that knows- and every time the wizard goes after one/a person he risks exposure on security cameras or a muggle getting a lucky shot off.

What if the President is a wizard though? Or has muggleborn on his staff? Also why are we talking about presidents, I think they have a Queen and Prime Minister over in England where they'd logically start.

Wordless magic is close to newt level, and wand motions can be complex, try a swish and flick then try a trigger motion- the trigger is faster. If you have a gun you could totally take on a first year on Halloween.

Even a jab with a stick vs a trigger motion is a pretty close race. though

Goodnight again, yep, been fun.

Also easily dealt with. But seeing as British government(Magical) placed some of their people inside the muggle one, this likely is not an issue. Those will be loyal to you and won't attack you. Plus they can easily imperius the president and no one would notice. Not even other staff

Queen has no power in Britain. Technically, yes, she could repel or make laws, but they'd throw her out if she tried. Not sure about the Prime Minister, but either way, the same can be done for them as well.

Not the best thing to judge by. Many wizards who lived through WW2 likely know stuff about muggle technology. Assuming they don't, muggleborns can teach them, or they can force a muggle to tell them.

**** Harry did not almost murder Malfoy.

#+begin_quote
  Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought

Harry had a perfectly valid justification (self defence against an attempted Cruciatus) and he had no malice afterthought. After that incident, Malfoy should have been expelled and tried. Punishing Harry makes no sense whatsoever.
