I tried looking at older posts but all those recommendations are just way over the top at an emotional level. But there is almost never a Snape who actually teaches Harry some skills. So im starting a new post in hopes to find a Snape teaching Harry something usefull. Can be anything from just potions to broad magical knowledge. I would prefer a fic starting from 4th or 5th year but everything else is fine to. No slash or any other romances please. He is a teacher after all.


** Hmm, Snape would never be a good choice for mentor unless they overcome their differences after a few angsty scenes. Nevertheless:

Linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) The whole Pretense is for the sake of Snape's potion mentorship. Wins him over with raw talent.

Linkao3(To Reach Without) Snape accepts Harry as an dark arts apprentice on her request.

Linkffn(Mistaken Sorting) Snape mentors Harry for the best reason: to spite the WBWL.

*** I know that there has to be some angst but in the stories i read recently its a nice buildup till around chapter 5 and then you get 10 or more chapter repeating everything over and over again.

Also thanks for the recommendation:).

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

  Harriett Potter dreams of going to Hogwarts, but in an AU where the school only accepts purebloods, the only way to reach her goal is to switch places with her pureblood cousin---the only problem? Her cousin is a boy. Alanna the Lioness take on HP.

  Sequel to 'Mistaken Identity'. The Dunce Who Lived and his unfortunate brother have finally arrived at Hogwarts. Snape is both manipulative and placing bets. Not so oneshot.

** I very much like O Mine Enemy. It takes its time to move to Snape being a mentor but it's an enjoyable journey. The scenes where he teaches Harry occlumency - properly this time - are really well written, and the characterisation of both of them feels very credible.

  Harry and Snape are thrown together by annoying relatives, a series of strange dreams, and Voldemort's latest hunt for Harry, but their greatest challenge may well be surviving each other. A slow-burn enemy-to-mentor story. Alt 6th summer, post-OotP.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.
