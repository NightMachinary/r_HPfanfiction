Something else I remember about the story is that Snape and lily were engaged after Hogwarts and Snape used to play for the slytherin quidditch team and was their captain.

  Harry wakes one morning, he discovers a badly injured Snape in his living room, & tries to hide him. But Petunia discovers them & reveals a secret she has kept for 13 years-one that will change the course of Harry's life forever, and Severus' too. AU, pre-GOF.
