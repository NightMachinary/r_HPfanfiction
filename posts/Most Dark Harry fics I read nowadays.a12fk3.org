** I do not understand the picture please. What does it mean? Which one is the one you do not like, or do like? Is it the top or bottom image?

*** It's a common meme based on the rapper Drake. In this context, it means that authors who are currently writing "Dark Lord Harry" stories are writing their fics so that Harry joins the Death Eaters and is happy with that, versus older "Dark Lord Harry" stories that tended to have Harry kill Voldemort and then become a new dark lord. The poster, [[/u/josssticks]] doesn't directly state a preference, but it is sort of implied that he prefers the top image (at least that's how I interpreted it).
