Spoilers ahead for the later books.

Okay so I'm at the point where Tonks has pretty much forsaken Harry in favor of Leon (I can't express how much that sentence makes me sick), but I am aware that she comes back to him in the next book. My question for those who have read the series is this: is there ever a scene we get where Tonks admits she was wrong?

** It's been quite a while since I las read the R-Series but if I recall correctly the answer is 'Not really' she knows what she did but it's all chalked up to teenage hormones and Leons "condition" and so she couldn't really help it.

** I never managed to finish the series, because I lost interest in fanfiction in general while half way through the sixth one, but I'm pretty sure they'd made up by that point.

As for if she admits she's wrong, I can't remember. Pretty sure she apologises quite heavily though

*** It strikes me as a story I would have loved five years ago before I'd had an actual relationship that meant something. As it is, the lack of actual admittance if wrongdoing - on both their parts - is patently false and just upsets me. I'm bailing out
