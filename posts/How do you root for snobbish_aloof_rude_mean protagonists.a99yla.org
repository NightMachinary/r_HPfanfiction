I've run into situations where the plot is interesting, but the main cast is utterly unlikeable. And I'm not talking about taking brutal but righteous vengeance, I mean stuff like using friends as bait without telling them. Or being mean to people for no good reason. Protagonists who blow small things out of proportion or treat the people around them as pawns. So pretty much everything you will find in a political/Slytherin Harry fic.

How do you keep reading these fics where Harry is acting like the canon Malfoys in the first to fifth book? Where you really want the main cast to fail because they are unlikeable?

If the plot is boring the answer is pretty straightforward, but stories like Black Luminary are interesting enough to overlook the character flaws. Yet I doubt that the author intends for people to read it without wanting the main cast to succeed.

Tl;dr: How to root for mean dicks?


** Abrasive protagonists are some of my favorite to read. They need to have at least one redeeming quality, though. As an example, Dr. House is an unrepentant sarcastic misanthrope, /but/ his actions show that he cares for his patients' wellbeing above all else, and he breaks any laws or regulations that impede the outcome he sees as right. He's also undeniably masterful at what he does.

We like House because we see past the attitude he presents to the world. If, as in the fics you refer to, that surface dickishness is all there is to the character, there's no reason to root for them. They need deeper drives that one can relate to.

To answer your question of how to root for them, you simply do or don't. If you feel the need to ask advice for how to enjoy a character, you're reading the wrong story, I think.

*** To keep with my previous example of Black Luminary, I enjoyed the overall world building, I enjoyed Hermione's depiction, I utterly loved the batshit insane Lestrange daughter. The plot is fascinating and unique. But the most important characters aren't appealing to me at all.

I mean, you could watch HIMYM just for the awesome Barney stories, even if you didn't like one or two of the other characters. So is there a fanfic equivalent, a mindset to get into when your enjoyment of the plot is hindered by some of the characters?

I don't believe there's any special mode of thinking that will enhance your enjoyment. It's a question of whether the parts you're interested in outweigh the parts that repel you. Speaking for myself, I would rather be reading something where I liked both the plotlines and the main character, at the very least. The story will center on them, after all, and if you don't care for them, you won't care what happens to them or how they develop, and as a result you won't care for the majority of what you're reading.

I wouldn't watch a sitcom for the story of one character if I disliked the rest of the cast, either; I'd spend more time annoyed than not. That's me, though, so it depends on you and what you consider worth your time.

Edit: Your comment doesn't merit downvotes, so I'm confused. It's a normal conversation.

****** The perils of having controversial opinions. I remember you had some issues with Hermione haters a few months ago who did their best to trash your reputation.

It'll go away eventually and I'm not overly concerned since my last story has gotten overwhelmingly positive reviews. Haters gonna hate no matter what, it's just part of the Internet.

**** For me it depends a lot on the fic/show. Sometimes there are certain characters or the world or the plot I like more than I dislike the other characters and I can go through the story for that. But at other times, as much as I want to move forward with the story, those characters keep hindering my enjoyment and I give up.

An example of the former is the Shadowhunters TV show where I don't like Clary, the protagonist, but I love the way the show has built up on Alec and Magnus' relationship and I continue to watch the show (fowarding a few scenes sometimes). However, I tried reading the books the show is based on and my favourite show character Alec is such a dick in the first few chapters that I ended up giving up on them. (Which I hate because I used to be a firm supporter of 'The book was better')

** Being an asshole is fine. I've read too many stories that have Harry be a shy, kind, caring, humble, helpful, polite, even-tempered young man with *EMERALD ORBS*^{TM.} Give me some pride, arrogance, hate, conceit and anger over that shit any day - that makes the characters more human.

*** In theory yes. In practice it is often overdone for the sake of "political/traditional" plots where the MC would fit right in with the KKK or a similar batch of arseholes. There's a difference in hating Bellatrix Lestrange for killing your last living family member and being an abusive friend because that's "pureblood culture".

I personally have no problems with these fics, so long as their premise isn't outlandish, like Harry/Hermione being adopted by Voldemort or something equally ludicrous. I've read a lot of stories where purebloods, or wizards in general are hated by the MCs, so the alternative - where the MCs hate muggles/muggleborns - is fine with me.

There are also many fics where the MC advocates for a humanist utopia where all manner of creatures are treated equally. I find that idea unrealistic as hell, so some hate and scorn would be much appreciated.

****** King's dream speech was only about humans, and is indeed a utopian idea. Inequality is a salient feature of all societies, there simply has to be hierarchy for a society to stay afloat without collapsing in on itself. Equality can exist in name only, never in practice.

FF authors extrapolate King's idea to include all manner of creatures, like centaurs, goblins, werewolves, vampires and whatever else. Centaurs hate humans and consider themselves superior, while gobbos have declared war on witches and wizards for dominance. Werewolves and vampires consider humans as food.

There can be limited diplomacy with centaurs and gobbos, but with werewolves and vampires, none can ever happen. It'd be like treating with xenomorphs.

** They should be justified in their meanness in some way, by being clever in a way that makes their lack of patience with others sympathetic. If they privately have a compelling sense of humor, for example, then it's hard not to appreciate their worldview, even if it's ultimately disagreeable.

** I've enjoyed and 'got into' plenty of abrasive and unlikable characters in fiction (Lando Mollari, Chrisjen Avasarala, Walter White, etc), so I know there's nothing "wrong" with me.

Fact of the matter is that fanfiction authors usually have no idea how to write them. It's interesting you brought up Black Luminary which is full of characters that I despise and don't want to read about. I think I've mentioned this before: Fanfictions get much less leeway from me in regards to giving the characters the benefit of the doubt. I quickly jump to the conclusion that the characters being unlikable is a total accident or - worse - intentional, not to make them interesting, subversive or anti-heroes, but because the author thinks they are cool.

*** I mean, Amy Lestrange is a blast to read and I'm pretty sure that I'm going to use it as inspiration for a "Demelza Robins is, unknowingly, the daughter of Bellatrix Lestrange" oneshot.

But the Daphne characterisation was so annoying, her only redeeming quality was her rack. And Harry, I found him alright until he killed a few thousand people through negligence and didn't bat an eye.

** I don't think I have to root for anyone in particular to enjoy a story. I might be rooting against the main character, or just enjoying how bad things are.

I'm writing a story in which the main character is an arrogant, overconfident snob, and I'm pretty sure my readers are following along like, “Oh boy, how will he manage to make this already messed-up situation even worse?” It's my most popular story by far. He's much more popular than my nice guys.

** My random thoughts which may or may not have any correlation with reality; Jerk, Serious, Invincible, pick any two.

So you can have a jackass who uses his Wizengamot seats (plural) and supreme magical power for silly shenanigans, or a serious villain protagonist who encounters many setbacks, or a sincerely good super-duper hero for whom things just go right. But you can't have a bastard protagonist with oodles of inherited power making him unstoppable, /and/ be all dark and dramatic about it.

** Well, there is Death Note, but Light Yagami at least has a straightforward goal, specifically to stop crime.

While Light is understandably fairly insane by the end of it, he also wasn't entirely wrong to do what he did, because he practically succeeded.

If the protagonists are just jerks for the sake of having a reputation as a jerk for something like social standing, then that isn't particularly likable, even if that social standing could mean the difference between life and death. This is magnified by the fact that this would be Out of Character for Harry as well.
