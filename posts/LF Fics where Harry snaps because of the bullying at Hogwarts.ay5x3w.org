Not necessarily snaps as in goes crazy, but gets fed up with how he's treated in second, fourth or fifth year. Maybe he leaves Hogwarts, maybe he goes dark, maybe he just decides to focus on himself. I'd prefer, if there's bashing, for him to not just automatically forgive the people he has issues with. Or even forgive them at all.

Dark!Harry, bashing and slash are fine. Please no mpreg, pottercest, genderbending, romance/smut-centric plots or harems. Thank you!

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  how he's treated in second, fourth or fifth year
#+end_quote

Technically, nothing happens to him in second or fifth year that's done by students. In second year, the only thing the students do is avoid him and view him with distrust - I don't know how this can be construed as bullying.

Same in fifth year - the most that other students do is regard him with distrust. If you're not counting Seamus' episode, there's literally nothing else.

Having an unfavourable opinion on someone does not mean that you're "bullying" that person, even if your opinion is shared by a lot of your peers.

Fourth year, it's only the badges that can be counted as bullying. That's it.

He isn't cursed in the corridors or beaten up or "pranked" or any of that. In canon, anyway.

**** Lol.

And just what does Malfoy do?

First year, he throws a remembrall and inadvertently helps Harry become seeker for Gryffindor. He tries to tattle about the trio wandering after curfew, but that plan backfires rather spectacularly.

Second year, he doesn't do anything more than strut around. Sure, he calls muggleborns mudbloods, but how is that any different from the regular shit that adolescents and teenagers spew out?

Third year, he dresses up as a Dementor in Harry's Quidditch match, but gets humiliated in front of the whole school thanks to the Patronus Charm. To add to that, he gets punished by McGonagall right then and there.

Fourth year, yes. The Potter stinks badges could be construed as bullying, since he's the one that makes them and hands them out.He's not punished for that but then, nobody bothers telling any teacher about those badges - not Harry, not Hermione, no one. He doesn't do anything more than that. Giving quotes to a gossip rag isn't "bullying". Neither is reading a newspaper article loudly and making comments on it.

Fifth year, he's in Inquisitorial Squad, but really, what do you expect when a student is given that kind of power - it's safe to say that had their positions been reversed and Harry and Ron were in the squad in lieu of Malfoy, Slytherin's points would have suffered in turn. Even with that power, the most he does is insult people and take House points - which is hardly bullying. Oh, and he insults Molly Weasley in front of Fred, George and Harry, and gets his face smashed in for his troubles.

He tries picking a fight with Neville once (not sure which year) during a Quidditch match, but Neville and Ron fare rather well against him, Crabbe and Goyle.

Out of all these things, the only real case of bullying is the badges. But then, Harry gets pissed about it the first couple of times and forgets about them from that point on. He does not even complain about them to any of the professors.

Malfoy being a "bully" is one of those stupidly overdone fanon tropes. He's an unpleasant little shit, but hardly a bully.

Mudblood is the equivalent of the n-word. He also threatened the Muggleborns when the Chamber opened, in plain sight and hearing of everyone else. Imagine hearing over the news that ISIS is planning a bombing in your city and instantly yelling about how the infidels are going to get what's coming to them. He also says that he'd be helping the Heir if he knew who it was, and throws a venemous snake at Harry during a disarm-only duel. Yeah. Harmless. Incidentally, he laughs at Harry while he's being chased by Dobby's Bludger, but that, in fairness, isn't much.

#+end_quote

Uh, yeah. Spreading misinformation about someone is libel. Reading something designed specifically to incite outrage is bullying. That's ignoring him hiding in the woods during the World Cup and making fun of the Muggle family being tortured, while telling Hermione she could expect to be next. Also, here's a quote from good old Draco at the end of the year:

#+begin_quote
  *"You've picked the losing side, Potter! I warned you! I told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? When we met on the train, first day at Hogwarts? I told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!" He jerked his head at Ron and Hermione. "Too late now, Potter! They'll be the first to go, now the Dark Lord's back! Mudbloods and Muggle-lovers first!"*

  Fifth year, he's in Inquisitorial Squad, but really, what do you expect when a student is given that kind of power - it's safe to say that had their positions been reversed and Harry and Ron were in the squad in lieu of Malfoy, Slytherin's points would have suffered in turn.

#+end_quote

No, I the fuck don't think that if Harry, Ron, and Hermione had power over Slytherins, they'd abuse it. Ron and Hermione are made prefects, and don't punish the Slytherins out of turn, if you'll recall.

Second, IIRC. Neville fights Crabbe and Goyle and gets destroyed, Ron fights Draco and comes out mostly the better.

...aaaand after that he's an actual homicidal terrorist instead of just a sympathizer.

Yeah - but challenging someone to a duel is not picking on that person. I'm not sure how you can ever think of it that way. What's more, Harry accepts. He does not have to - he may have been goaded into it, but he doesn't have to.

I despise the bastards that say it and wish painful death upon them, but...calling them /bullies/ feels like cheapening it.

Lol. No one was using the disarming charm in any of those duels. Not Harry, not Hermione, not Millicent, not Malfoy, no one.

To be fair, he's in the right here. As the professor it is Hagrid's responsibility to ensure students' safety. Yes, Malfoy was begging to be attacked, but he's in fact a thirteen year old. Expecting every single thirteen year old to heed warnings and follow instructions in front of hot tempered animals is sheer stupidity.

Whether you believe that the trio would take advantage of their powers had they been IS (lol) members... they do hate Slytherins, they saw no harm in letting a guy be trapped inside a Vanishing Cabinet for however long (Fred and George trap Montague, but Harry and Ron hear about it and do nothing), and they're all quite impulsive. I'd say that's enough grounds to assume that they would take advantage of their IS powers.

After he joins the Death Eaters, he's no longer a "bully", he's a criminal. But the rest of those things - to me, it seems like you have a different definition of what comprises bullying.

That's literally what Ron says. He thinks that all they'll be able to do is shoot sparks at each other. Death only comes up when Harry asks what a second is for.

Wherever you grew up might be slightly different, I suppose, but pretty much any real-life place you go, dropping a hard R on a young black girl is absolutely bullying. If you're saying you've done that or something similar, I'm going to go ahead and call you a bully.

Not every bully realizes that what they're doing is wrong, you know.

The same thing that MURDERED A MUGGLEBORN is back and he tells the Muggleborns they're going to die. What the fuck kind of standards do you have for bullying that that somehow doesn't count?

#+end_quote

Again, what the fuck standards do you have for bullying that this isn't that. As for the lack of disarming in other duels, that was explicitly due to lack of supervision. Harry and Malfoy's duel was supervised, and Malfoy was the first to stop using Expelliarmus.

#+begin_quote
  To be fair, he's in the right here. As the professor it is Hagrid's responsibility to ensure students' safety. Yes, Malfoy was begging to be attacked, but he's in fact a thirteen year old. Expecting every single thirteen year old to heed warnings and follow instructions in front of hot tempered animals is sheer stupidity.
#+end_quote

It's literally just 'don't insult the monster.' Potions, Transfigurations, confronting Boggarts, flying, practicing the Imperius Curse, potting Mandrakes, and more are all just as dangerous, but the students are trusted to follow their teacher's directions. Malfoy deliberately played up his injury and Buckbeak's fault, specifically to make Hagrid look bad. He then laughed about it right as it was happening.

#+begin_quote
  He makes allusions. He doesn't actually say anything about Sirius Black, or that Sirius is out to get him. The only thing he says is that if he was in Harry's place, he'd want revenge. That is not "bullying".

Okay, then it's just bullying. Or is spreading lies about someone behind their back to everyone they know suddenly not bullying?

#+begin_quote
  You know, for all people like to talk about certain things being offensive, they're also making the decision to take offense at the same time.
#+end_quote

That's so fucked up. No, it's the fault of the person saying the offensive thing. That's whose fault it is. Everyone has the right to go through their day without being degraded, and if you infringe on that right, you are the one in the wrong.

That's actually a canon error - Percy threatens to take points away from Draco second year. Prefects /do/ have the power to give detentions and take points away. Later editions fix this, as Rowling admitted it was an unintentional mistake.

So they do have that power, and they don't abuse it.

********* Of course I have been. You're literally trying to pass off racial slurs as a non-issue. The more I'm seeing, the more I'm convinced that you're just an actual bully. Malfoy and Harry are not friends. They aren't even close to friends. They aren't civil. They literally fight in more than half the books.

What Malfoy does isn't civil, it isn't just normal ragging on people. His dad killed people. His dad tried to kill Harry. In-universe, he's coming off the wake of a terrorist regime, still spouting its rhetoric. People make Nazi comparisons all the time, but he's doing it /a decade after wizard Hitler died./ Half the people in the school have family members who died to Malfoy's dad or his friends.

You're trying to pass of your own behavior - which, I might add, is objectively shitty - as somehow equivalent to what he did.

You don't have any right to decide how someone else reacts to what you do or say. That's why most normal people try to avoid insulting other people in the first place.

In any case, you're clearly a deeply flawed human being. I hope you improve yourself. I'm done here.
