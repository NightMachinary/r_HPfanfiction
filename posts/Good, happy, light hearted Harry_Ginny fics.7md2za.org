** Aunt Marge's Even Bigger Mistake is the best one in this category. linkffn(11982933)

Cwarbeck on SIYE has a bunch of fun reads. [[http://www.siye.co.uk/siye/viewstory.php?action=printable&textsize=0&sid=128876&chapter=all][Win a Date With Ginny Weasley]] is the best of her work.

Here's a couple more - linkffn(9818387; 4958055). The writing in Amplitude is a bit rough, but it is amusing enough, especially in its characterization of Dumbledore.

  A Love Story that doesn't start with love. A Soul Bond that doesn't start with a kiss. Love is not handed out freely. Love is earned. When Harry and Ginny are Soul Bonded, they discover that love is not initially included, and that it's something that must be fought for. H/G SoulBond!RealisticDevelopment!EndOfCOS!GoodDumbledore! Trust me, you've never seen a soul-bond fic like this

  Harry and Ginny experience a series of "firsts" together. What are friends for, right? Fun and fluff and some last chapter steaminess. Rated M for final chapter only.

** Its not exactly "light hearted" but isn'tt angst and has fluff(and lemons, but they're short) on several parts, there is a bit of "dark background story" but its sorta negligible. linkffn(The Return of the Marauders)

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

  What could have happened between Lily and Severus if he had said the right thing outside the Gryffindor Common Room. This story is AU. Everything you recognize belongs to JKR everything else is me. Rating is for violence, language and some adult content.
