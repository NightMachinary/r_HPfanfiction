** One of the best scenes in the story line. But you know what would be better?? If Umbridge had coughed a few more times and Minerva had transfigured her into a toad. A Pink toad. And maybe then Moody had been visiting for some work with dumbledore and saw Malfoy and got jealous of the imposter in fourth year. So he transfigured Malfoy in to a blond, slash that, a Pink ferret. Umbridge and Malfoy fall in loveðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®. MALFOY and UMBRIDGE sitting below a Tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. THE END. For this side story.

But yeah. You were saying something..... Harry... Auror.... Spite..... Umbridge.... Minerva..... Sorry I didn't read. Just needed a place to drop off the Idea. No disrespect.
