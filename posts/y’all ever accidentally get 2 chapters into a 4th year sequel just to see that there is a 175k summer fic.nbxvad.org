pain.


** I began reading a fourth year fic once, but I've forgotten everything about it, even the name. What I do remember however, was feeling it was extremely slow, so I broke a rule of mine, and went ahead and took a look at the latest chapter published.

What I discovered, caused me to drop it like a hot potato. You see, the fic wasn't even at the first task of the Tri Wizard, and it was already 400k plus words long. Waaaay top long, and judging by what I had read thus far, I was in for like 300k words of pretty much nothing.

Writing long fics is fine, but if there's no development of any sort, I can't read the story.

**** Like I said, I don't remember, but with fics like that, it is often useless detail, which have no bearing on the story, aling with massive tangents about nothing. Or they spend four word pages talking about people's feelings, instead of showing us how they deal with things, with some added info about how they feel.

Some stories go for too much detail, and I don't think it's necessarily done to beef up the word count, or anything like that. I think people are just trying to add meat to their characters and world, but end up getting bogged down in too much detail no one cares about, because it has no bearing on anything.

What I try to do, is make information flow naturally. We all pretty much know the HP world, but any addition I make, I try not to use more than a couple of short, to the point paragraphs. And I try to make what I write, relevant to the story. It makes things more interesting.

Of course, if you make massive changes, or perhaps send your characters to an original world of your own making, some info dump is unavoidable.

There's no need to spoon feed your readers, engage them, and often, less is more. Give people just enough detail so that they can form an image in their head.

***** I think it is these three: linkffn(13001792; 13372464; 13439553)

First one, /All According to Plan/, was good and well paced. The summer interdule, /Nothing to do with the Plan/, was good as well, I enjoyed reading it. The third one, /That Was Part of the Plan/, lost its way a little and had far too many names and events happing at once to remember it all and is going so slowly.

  One year has passed since Lyra (formerly Bellatrix) Black traveled thirty years into an alternate future. Unfortunately, this means she's expected to go back to boring Hogwarts for more boring normal people stuff. Except, there is that Tournament thing. And Angel Black. And her muggleborn girlfriend. And maybe an international incident or two... Never mind, should be fun.

*** This right here is why I decided I'd have like 4-5 chapters per year when outlining this one fic I have in the works. I had to put it on hiatus without getting much into it while I prioritize another longfic, but I didn't want to be one of those people who doesn't get through all the years. I also give myself wiggle room to not have the fic last all 7 years because it is a gen fic and not romance oriented.

** I'm generally against fanfic stories that are broken up into volumes because 99.9% of the time they fall apart and never get completed.

If I see anything marked as book 1 or year 1 of a multi-year arc, I always go to the author's page before reading to see if they've dropped the series 3 chapters into the sequel-- and they almost always have.
