** Oh I'm a big fan of that one where Draco thinks the trio are his best friends. The story written by like three different users were incredibly hilarious.

Also this one. Because of this thread I literally wrote a story in which Snape had to marry James Potter to get out of a life debt. And it was only partially a crack fic
