**** Still waiting for a proper "Ginny goes back in time after Harry died and goes on an absolute rampage to save Harry". I've read one or two, but they were not that well written, sadly. I think Ginny, being such an in-your-face character towards the end, would be a really good main character in a time-travel fic.

***** There's an obvious problem with romance in time travel stories, of course, but most stories ignore age gaps. I'd like to see more of that awkwardness handled explicitly.

Incidentally, I've been looking into the Star Wars fandom, and it's utterly rife with time travel fics.

****** Yeah, the romance part is always a bit tricky, isn't it. It's still the same person the main character fell in love with, but it is a younger version, therefore different. Is it pedophilia? Is the other person being forced into a relationship or does he/she do it out of free will? Then there's the matter of hormones. You have a younger body, which will obviously confuse you (the lack of sex drive would be strange if you went from being 20 to 11 for example). And then there's the fact that even though you try to convince yourself otherwise, you still have expectations from the younger version of your (future) boy/girlfriend. You're used to a mature person giving you loads of attention, but instead you get a mere child who is still growing up.

Many fanfics brush over these matters. Probably because it slows the story down (time travel fics have a relatively high tempo). But also probably because it's morally questionable and therefore the writer doesn't feel good writing about it.

****** Star Wars is really built for it because you want Luke and Leia involved but you also want to save Anakin before he falls to the Dark Side. Plus "because the Force did it" can be used to just explain away everything most of the time and not many people question it. I've seen good Time travel fics where Luke and Leia go back to the Clone Wars or Anakin comes forward in time to around Empire or Return of the Jedi and see's what he becomes.

** Tropes that are guilty pleasures:

Marriage/breeding law (Currently reading a Hermione/George)

Time travel to the first war to either try to fix something, or to ensure current timeline stability (already been there, so you've gotta go back, you know?)

Soul bonds between opponents (like Drarry, for example)

Secretly-a-pureblood (I think it was "The Muddy Princess" that I read the other day and I really liked it).

That's all I can think of at the moment for Severitus.

Mentor!Snape:

This and it's sequel are great.

Pretty much anything by Sita Z on Potions and Snitches:

****** By Severitus I mean Mentor!Snape - I don't /really/ read BioDad!Snape.

Thanks! I haven't read that one yet.

******* I absolutely love Severitus but I mostly read BioDad!Snape. I have a couple non bio Snape I can recommend though.

The first Mentor!Snape I read was [[http://www.potionsandsnitches.org/fanfiction/viewstory.php?sid=1284][A Year Like None Other]]. I really enjoyed it. It gets rec'd here from time to time. It's super long too (like 800k I think).

linkffn(Turning Time by SpinnersStart) was pretty good, but that was a Time Travel fic with more Snape & Harry friendship rather than him being a mentor.

You might try linkffn(Heart of the Guardian by thewandcrafter). I thought Snape was a bit OOC but the story was interesting enough.

  When both Severus Snape and Harry Potter survive, against all odds, they must renegotiate their relationship... and save each other all over again. This is a MENTORING/adoption fic, not slash. It is canon -compliant and begins immediately post-battle. It's rated Teen - for everyone 13 and up. Mild cussing in one or two chapters, some angst.

******** Thank you! I've read the first, but I really love Time Travel + Severitus (because Harry's usually a bit more competent there). Thank you!
