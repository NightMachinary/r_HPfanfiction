Does anyone know of fics similar to Charlotte the Great and Powerful by Evandar? I thought it was an interesting twist on a cold, but not Tom Riddle like, Harry as a girl, but the one issue I had was that she suffered many of the same problems as canon Harry.

I dislike Harry/Snape and Harry/Voldmort pairings (Harry/Tom Riddle is okay), but other than that I don't care about the pairings.
