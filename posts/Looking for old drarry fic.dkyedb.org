It's a very long fanfic that states off with Harry dating Ginny but Dumbledore passes on some phoenix powers to Harry and his phoenix chooses Draco as his mate. They fall in love obviously and win against the dark lord. The story also has a couple song tiles as chapter such as let's dance by David Bowie which I believe is played at some exclusive wizarding restaurant won't Draco, harry, tonks and Remus in attendance. I can't remember if Hermione and Ron are there. Harry basically looses all his memories and Draco goes a little nuts but eventually comes back to discover Harry is coming back. The last part of the fic is their life together after. There was also a bit on Draco finding solace in Charlie Weasley and Ron discouraging Harry from finding out when his memories were gone. I can't for the life of me find it and for some reason I really want to read it.
