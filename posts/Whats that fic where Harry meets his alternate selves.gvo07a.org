Harry meets his alternate selves in some sort of dreamscape? The Harry who set the whole thing up was raised by LV and kinda became a mentor figure to 'cannon' Harry. I'm pretty sure that it was incomplete/abandoned? I haven't been able to find it but its kept niggling me at the back of my mind lately.
