Looking for a Powerful!Harry fic where he can see magic. I like descriptions of the magic that he uses/sees.\\
Preferably also Smart!Harry and Grey!Harry, I like Daphne x Harry (but not required), don't mind cliches (i.e. harems, flawless!harry)

Thanks in advance!

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

**** linkffn(The Sorting Hat's Stand) definitely fits everything except Daphne though.

I'm kinda mixed about the pairing. I think the archetype could work, but only if it was a more Andromeda Tonks person rather than Narcissa junior.

  What if the founders built in a safe guard to protect incoming students from abuse at home, in the form of the hat? How would the hat react to Harry's so called childhood? Rated for language and expected violence. As complete as it is ever going to get. Revised as another story.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

***** Well there's the story For Love of Magic, which I know is super controversial on this subreddit, but it had a super powerful (in magic and character) Grey Harry

I really like that story, even though I disagreed with a lot of things it said (i.e. religion)

Pretty much looking for something similar in terms of story

****** People are too sensitive, I can't really be arsed about whatever new "controversy" they conjure up. It's a piece of fanfiction, get over yourselves.

Many people think that a protagonist must act in mirror of their own morals, and that the author should have their own worldview. This collective pressure is why there's so few fanfics with an actually interesting Harry Potter. There's pretty much a couple templates to choose from (with minor variation). Even in the interesting stories that try and more radically change things - like make Harry "dark" or whatever - he either still largely has the same moral framework and just feels varying degrees of guilt, or he is just another "bigot" like Malfoy who likes doing evil things... Just 'cuz.

You never get motivated, strongly characterized Harry anymore, because it's all been done and the collective expectation of what should be portrayed as good or evil is stronger than ever.

I've said this before, and this won't be the last time, but something that really infuriates me is how pathetic and unbelievable the antagonists are.

And this is largely what contributes to Harry always being such a flat and two-dimensional character: he always reacts to and fights the same boring enemies with the same nonsensical reasons who are all inexplicably evil.

Some other things might change, but the one constant is that they're always written like Rowling wrote them; nearly all are stupid, illogical, needlessly cruel, greedy, ridiculously sadistic, and for no good reason or explanation. Voldy is just born "evil", and his followers are as described, so they're always bigoted but dangerous buffoons.

Why not write an antagonist and group of enemies with an actual goal people can go and say "Alright, I can understand why they do this, I wonder how Harry will react?" instead of presenting these sadistic clowns every. Fucking. Time. and knowing exactly how Harry will react and which side he will take.

My point is, if you want an interesting hero, you need an interesting, believable villain first.

The story you mention I read a couple times and even enjoyed, but it also falls victim to a boring Harry. Not just for the reasons above, but because the author is using it as a tool to take snippets of his own worldview and have Harry enact them. That wouldn't be a problem, if he actually integrated this into the story and plot, but he didn't.

Like okay dude, we get that you don't like religions, you're a "woke atheist" (aka a cringy fuck), but why does Harry despise religions?

Holy shit, this comment is waaay too long, but I'll just end it with a question; wouldn't it be more interesting, if when a Harry is told of how purebloods/half-bloods look down on and don't like muggleborns, he replied with "why?" instead of "that's terrible!"? Wouldn't it be even more interesting if the reply wasn't "oh, no reason, they're just evil sadistic bigots"? And wouldn't it be amazing for these people/antagonists to actually be human, and not deranged maniacs like Bellatrix and Co?

A story where there's two sides with motivations more than "good" and "evil", fighting for what they believe is moral - now *that* would be an interesting story, with interesting Hero and Villain.

****** I am surprised to see you reading that fanfic. It is fairly old, I believe it was on fictionalley before Joe put it on fanfiction.net

With that trilogy you have to understand that Joe was in his early teens when he wrote it so his characters, especially Harry, can be a little flat at times. It does get a lot better as the story goes on, but if you are struggling with it I'd suggest one of his others, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)
