/Very shy, plot bunny infested, serial procrastinator seeks strong willed, intelligent beta for longterm work on (likely) a variety of projects. Applicants must be dedicated, willing to hold conversation, and open to just about any horror (ficwise) that may be borne of such a partnership.../

In all honesty, though, I've had accounts on various fanfiction sites for about six years now, yet I've never bothered to sit down and actually write anything. Very recently I decided to finally do so and found myself fleshing out a plotbunny that had been gathering dust for a few years--quickly I had a rather sizable fabula and a first chapter, then a dodgy second chapter, and a viable third chapter... so on.

I did have a bit of a look at the beta section on ffnet, but just /looking/ at that mire was enough to put me off actually trying to /find/ an active, decent beta on there, out of thousands listed.

Besides, I think I trust people here a bit more (having lurked often enough).

If anyone would be willing, I'd be pleased to discuss the initial project with them (with a view to further projects if things went well). I promise that I do--despite some mishaps--have a working understanding of English and its grammar therein. Though checking over my work would be extremely helpful, the most vital thing for me is, I think, just having somebody to bounce ideas off of and to keep me motivated... A muse, in a way. Though I will warn that I'm horribly lazy and very easily distracted, and will often require poking with a massive stick to get back on track.

I promise to wine and dine any good soul brave enough to work with me. :)

/Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming level of responses, both here and PM's. I now have an enormous list of people that, if I was crazy enough, could be organised into a huge team of crackbeta's and critics. I promise anyone I haven't gotten back to yet, will get a reply when I have the time to sit down and write out a proper one. I think I've chosen a primary beta, but you never know--the two of us might turn out to hate one another and decide never to speak again. To know that so many people are willing to give this a go is quite exciting. :)/

My beta comments for this post:

Good tone, and you're clear when you want to be. Not sure how much I liked the joke up-front. Comes off as a little cute, but I think I buy it anyway. You might be expecting a little much from a beta/muse/cheerleader all-in-one package.

Also, props for inspiring laughter at your own expense, but if you're going to laud your own grasp of grammar, you probably don't want to make the #1 Grammar Mistake Of All Time in the sentence in which you do so.

*** /is horribly embarrassed/

I'll admit, English isn't my mother language, and it's nearly two in the morning, so muscle memory is definitely overcoming brain. As I have a case of 'the dumb' (and at the worst possible moment), it may be best I don't try to write anything important tonight.

I didn't mean it to sound quite that way. I just genuinely find I get things done better whilst talking to someone about them, and think that having someone question 'where is this going' might be helpful.

**** No worries, happens to us all :) Good luck in the search for a beta - finding a good one can really take your fic to the next level. I'd offer my own services, but my dance card is pretty full at the moment trying to keep my own fic going with a good update rate.

** I am excellent at poking with a large stick, usually in amusing or sarcastic ways. I also collaborate for a living, so can be very useful in bouncing ideas off of. I've beta'd before. If you want to discuss, PM me!
