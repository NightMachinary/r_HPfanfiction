I'm looking for well-written novel-length harry centered time travel fictions that have a good paring.


** I do a bunch of time travel, and try to stay away from common overpowered characters that solve everything easily. They're Canon pairings.

Unfortunately, I am the process of improving/rewriting them. Took them down some time ago and the only one I am republishing right now is a Ron centric. Ron travels to first year, tries to keep time unchanged while he finds a way back, things are not easy to be kept unchanged.

I have like 6 other time travel stories with solid premises that will be republishing in time. All Canon pairings.

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19364248/chapters/46071916][Kings Cross Redux]] To Maurarder's era

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/][Altered Destinies]] Goes back in time during Tom's younger years, cannot recommend this one enough!!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]] Marauder era, tangled in with Bellatrix

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh god not again]] Back to Hogwarts years, crack fic but sooo funny. It's probably what you were talking about with the cliches, but it adds all of them and makes fun of it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12813755/1/][Disorder of the Phoenix]] Back to 5th year, but as an adult not to his past body

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11434139/1/][Brand New Start]] Goes back to raise himself

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6820445/1/][Harry Potter and the Phoenix Burning]] Marauder era, but at age of 11

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868582/1/][Easier than falling asleep]] Wakes up on morning of last task

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/][Xerosis]] Dark Harry do-over

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1922112/1/][Crumbling Pedestal]] Goes back to Founders era

I have more (and even more non-Harry centric) but there was way too many to do, so if you liked any just let me know and I can do more!!

If anyone else in this thread wants the non-harry ones let me know too!

#+begin_quote
  Broken and angry after losing Sirius fifth year, Harry recklessly puts himself in harms way, dragging Hermione along for the ride. Now they are stuck in another time with some all too familiar faces. Will the time with lost loved ones heal Harry or end up doing more damage?
