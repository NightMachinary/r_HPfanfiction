I recently read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12740667/1/The-Mind-Arts][The Mind Arts]] by /Wu Gang/, after seeing it get a lot of love in the [[https://redd.it/8d9ble][General Recommendations]] thread, and I'd like to recommend it to all.

I think that the fic gets a lot of aspects *right* that other fanfics just fail at.

*1. Characters*

The story takes an interesting premise---Harry having strong, passive legilimency powers---and develops it into a character that really feels like someone Harry could be. Other fanfics have a protagonist that is different from "Harry Potter" in everything but name, but this fic houses a realistic character. It addresses Harry's abuse (physical and mental) to the right amount and shows how it affects Harry's character and relationship with Dumbledore.

Harry, though he has an extremely powerful skill, does not become Super!Harry. Rather, he continues from a legacy of half-blood masters: Grindelwald (assumed), Dumbledore, Voldemort, Severus Snape. Because his power has roots in canon, he seems realistic. We see this clear fallibility through his dementor-sickness arc and his constant self-doubt about his future.

One part that I don't like about the fic is the lack of development of any of the other characters. A lot of what we think about Neville and Hermione comes from our preconceived notions of those characters from canon and other fanfictions, but I want more character development. This is nowhere more apparent than his relationship with Daphne Greengrass. In canon, Greengrass is completely a blank slate, and this fic does not do a satisfying-enough job filling that slate. Lisa Turner is another example.

*2. Story*

I think the fic really shines in its ability to adapt canon to its own storyline and characters. Most fics fail at this, and I lose interest immediately when this happens. When characters are unrecognizable from their canon-self but still encounter the same situations (the third floor corridor, the Chamber of Secrets) and have the same reactions, a fic just loses all of its integrity and becomes a shoddy canon-rehash. I think /The Mind Arts/ differs in this aspect because it does enough to diverge from canon while sticking with the main aspects of each of the years. I'm still keeping my reservations until the Triwizard Tournament events, which I know will have to be different from canon. I guess I'm just a sucker for a good AU.

This fic also fixes a lot of the problems that I see in canon. Harry's abuse is apparent in his cool, reserved demeanor and weighs on Dumbledore's conscious, so it isn't glossed over or completely defining of his character. We see Ginny's psyche in a material sense through Harry's mental powers, along with the after effects of having Tom Riddle in her brain.

However, I don't really see any true conflict or an emphasis on the need to defeat Voldemort yet, which really slows the story down in my mind. I think the original canon is so immersive because each year has its own conflict (the Philosopher's Stone, the Chamber of Secrets, etc.) which push the immediate story line, while progressing the characters and the overarching story with the final goal of defeating Voldemort. In /The Mind Arts/, each individual school year is not distinct with its own story arch but feel like one story without an end in sight or a reason for existence. We read fiction not just because it's someone's timeline but because there are distinct events on that timeline that are connected, and I don't think that Wu Gang achieves that. The Philosopher's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets just happen with no build up. But I'm hoping the TriWizard Tournament changes all that. (Also, what happened with the Quidditch World Cup? Did that just not happen?)

*3. Powers*

This story shines with the various magicalities. The story is aptly named "The Mind Arts" because Harry's skill in those various arts is what drives the story. At times, the story seems like an encyclopedia, investigating what the soul is, what drives magic, while developing on the base that J. K. Rowling gave us with new powers like electrokenesis and pyrokenesis. I love that type of magic and reminds me of [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]'s /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9778984/1/The-One-He-Feared][The One He Feared]]/.

Overall, I think /The Mind Arts/ is a breath of fresh air after reading so many shitty fanfictions with bad writing. It isn't the best but it has a lot of potential, and I had fun reading it. 7/10


** Well thanks.

I'd like to defend myself here so while I can see a lack of development in most characters I can't see it in Daphne though maybe that's cause I have dossiers on her from first year which show how she has changed which you just don't have. I mean we see her every chapter and how her attraction to Harry has changed her.

Next Voldemort hasn't reared his head in a while and a lot of his rescissions have been focused on the fact Voldemort could take a lot from him.

Third the World Cup did happen without the other Death Eater March. It's just low on Harry's priorities. He just didn't care and neither did Daphne and those are the perspectives you've been given. (Nor Luna).

Thanks for reading and the promo. I really appreciate the time you put into this critique. It's given me a lot to think about and it's always nice to be appreciated. Don't think I underestimate the time this must have taken you.

So thanks.

***** So, what I understand about Daphne is 1. she's falling in love with Harry and 2. she wants to do well in school.

For the first point, I think more subtle cues rather than Harry reading her mind would develop her character in a more "show" rather than "tell" fashion, but I guess that ship has sailed (as we're past that in the storyline).

But on a larger note, I think her character can be more two-dimensional if you talk more about her family and their reaction to her friendship with Harry. I automatically begin to think of Daphne as some "Ice Princess" due to the common trope, especially since I have read nothing disproving that trope in the story as of yet. I can see her parents disapproving of her teenage romance with Harry in favor of a Pureblooded suitor, or approving their friendship to curry favor. But I don't think either of these would really fit the thematic elements of the story, which seems to avoid most common trope. It would be great if you defy these tropes in a more radical way by casting Daphne as more "human" and "teen-like" rather than some pubescent politician.

You can also talk more about her plans for the future (again, as I said in the original post, I don't quite know what any of this is leading towards).

** Just an aside to [[/u/Wu_Gang][u/Wu_Gang]] here. The term -mancy is the greek derivative for "to divine." So when you say Harry has "thermomancy" powers, your saying he divines the future through the tempererature (that would actually be pretty funny: "its 19 C outside, so you will find something you had lost today.").

The correct term would be thermokinesis, although since temperature is actually just the average kinetic motion of molecules this may be an oxymoron anyway.

*** While technically correct, this is colloquially incorrect. Common usage of the -mancy suffix is "to magically manipulate/control."

Nobody sees the word necromancer and thinks "someone who talks to the dead about the future" they think "dude who raises skeletons and zombies for fun and profit"

**** I know, I sort of explained that you run into that problem with the terms Necromancy and Animancy (dead and living respectively) in this thread.

The problem though is that he uses terms like pyromancy and pyrokinesis to describe the same ability in the fic. But pyromancy is one of the more well known forms of divination in the world, you need only look at the Zoroastrian Magi in iron age Persia to see this. Its more about consistency than anything else. And when Harry is considering his abilities, he states he has "thermomancy" powers at one point, but then describes himself as having "cryokinesis" (which is not even temperature, thats the ability to manipulate "ice," something Harry does not show or seem to posess).

I understand its a language issue, its more about /consistency of terminology and usage/ than anything else. After all, the books referrence the study of "TASSEOMANCY" as being able to divine through tea leaves, so there is some basis for that usage. And yes its a fanfic, but its better to stick to one name and not use different names to describe something that is functionally the same, unless its for a specific purpose.

****** No, no it doesn't really bother me. The kind of thing that bothers me is when people say things like "Disarming Hex" or "Banishing Curse". Thankfully you seem to be keeping things consistent in that regard, so kudos.

Sometimes I am just not sure why the names change. On a personal level, I can certainly understand the use of more esoteric naming of abilities and magics. After all cryokinesis sounds a lot more magical than "ice manipulation."

But don't take any of this negatively, I've been following your fic since Ch. 4 came out and am a big fan. Its probably the closest thing to a spiritual successor to Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived that I have ever read. Keep up the good work.

**** The difficult part of trying to keep all that similar is you run into the obvious question of "Necromancy and Animancy" sort of breaking that trend. I suspect those originally meant to divine from the dead and life, but the terms are now widely used to mean what are more accurately necrokinesis and anikinesis (I'll admit those do sound a lot lamer).

Also, just as an aside to the mancy and divination I said earlier, an interesting idea I have yet to see in fanfiction was someone using astragalomancy (to divine through dice, essentially). It seems like something that would play well with the earlier years at Hogwarts for students (tell your future by rolling the dice).

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]
