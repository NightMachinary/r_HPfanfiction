** Well try Reboot by Kallanit. It's first chapter was published August 2013 and it's last chapter was updated in September 2017. So it meets the after deathly hallows publish date of July 2007. It has 3 characters traveling back in time. Snape travels back to when he first met Lily (so pre-Hogwarts), Harry and Hermione travel back to their births.

The story is a response to Reptilia28's Don't Fear the Reaper Challenge with a small link to some Discworld characters.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9552519/1/][*/Reboot/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2932352/Kallanit][/Kallanit/]]

#+begin_quote
  Very loosely based on the Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Death Challenge, whereby Harry gets to relive his life. As do a couple of other people. What effect does this have on Harry's life and the Voldemort Blood wars? Not a Discworld crossover, but some guest appearances by Death's granddaughter. Some character bashing. No Cursed Child or Fantastic Beasts. COMPLETE.

** linkffn(Backwards with Purpose) is decent, but it's the sequel that's really great. Harry, Ron and Ginny all go back - although the other Weasleys are less than pleased about Harry and Ginny's relationship.

  AU. Harry, Ron, and Ginny send themselves back in time to avoid the destruction of everything they hold dear, and the deaths of everyone they love.
