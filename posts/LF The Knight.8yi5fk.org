I don't know the author, but I do have a summary of it from someone from DLP, here,

The Knight is a bit different. Harry is an Auror in training. Grindelwald was defeated by Dumbledore like in canon, but the empire he created didn't fall so half of Europe is some kind of magical super power.

The fic is deleted off ffnet, but I'm hoping someone has found a copy of it floating around somewhere

** Is it the one that has Grindelwald's granddaughter (?) show up in it someplace? Sounds slightly familiar to me, I think it was by Sereven.

It might be on ao3, but I'm not entirely sure.
