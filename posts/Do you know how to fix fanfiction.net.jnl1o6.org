** It's been happening since Saturday. Fiction Press hasn't yet acknowledged the issue or stated they're working a fix. The app still works to read updated stories.

*** Apparently they haven't even acknowledged the problem. If you follow a story when it gives you the email you can click the link (it works for me idk about others). But you can't see recent stories which sucks. I hope they fix it soon, I may write an email complaining
