I'd figure with his boy who lived status, he could really have some zealous followers. Or maybe he does this in a different time period or country?

#+begin_quote
  The blood wards around Privet Drive have a disastrous effect on Harry Potter's magical development, leaving him unable to use a wand. But there are other kinds of magic, and other paths to power. Harry/many witches. No horcruxes.

  Edith Potter's life with her abusive family taught her two things. First - the only language some people understood was violence. Second - fear only lasts a generation; kindness lasts forever. The Girl Who Lived returns to magical Britain a cynical visionary; drawing in allies from all four houses for an end game neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort anticipated. Dark!Fem!Harry

**** Alright, not terrible read? For a request this specific, the likelyhood of getting a genuinely good fic is low, but Cult Potter is eminently readable, just like pretty much everything Tsume Yuki writes. Or maybe my standards have slipped. One or t'other.

****** I don't refute the Mary Sue-ness or the cliches, but when you're regularly going through the weekly new fics for something readable, Tsume Yuki is significantly better than the majority of the authors who publish each weak. Also, some of them really aren't all that bad.

******** Well, to be honest, a combination of habit, laziness, and a dislike of the period in a book where one is introduced to the main characters. Even highly recommended works often have lackluster introductions to characters; something that fanfics tend not to. There are obviously exceptions, and I do go and those that are recommended to me.

Also, books cost money, but fanfiction does not.
