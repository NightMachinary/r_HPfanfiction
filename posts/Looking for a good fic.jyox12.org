Looking for a good HONKS or HAPHNE fic that has a good story. The longer the better. I use FFN. its hard to find a long completed one.


** I would recommend Black Luminary by YakAge for a good Haphne fic.. probably. It is still ongoing so we do not yet know the final pairing. However it does have over 500k words and 66 chapters and who knows, there have been fics that have updated after much longer gaps in time.

It is high on my favourite fics (would not be able say which is my all time favourite) with a lot of world building in an AU setting (still Harry Potter, just a major historical point has been changed).
