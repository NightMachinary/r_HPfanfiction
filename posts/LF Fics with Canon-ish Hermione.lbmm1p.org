I'm looking for fics that have Hermione as close to her canon characterization as possible. Full-blown character studies would be amazing, but they don't have to be. Something like [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7559806/1/][Cry Out, Curlew]] by [[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/1693442/][Evil Is A Relative Term]] would be amazing.

Edit: I'm fine with any ship, rating, or other characters.


** You're looking for the holy grail here. Rumours abound but no one is really sure if it exists.

My closest recommendation would be linkffn(3557725)

Here's the Hermione elevator pitch from Chapter 12:

#+begin_quote
  Across from where he and Ron had set up their game, Hermione snuffled in her sleep from her sprawl over the other booth seat. The girl had only stayed awake through a few games of Snap before her eyelids were drooping. By now she'd been snoozing for the better part of two hours.

  /Exams must have tired her out even more than we thought./

  Ron followed his gaze to land on their sleeping friend. "You ever find it amusing that everyone's convinced Hermione's just a nice, polite, girl we drag along on our crazy adventures while she tries to restrain us?"

  He raised an eyebrow. "As opposed to an enthusiastic enabler always willing to help us in our search, and who set /fire/ to a professor in her first year here? And started a brawl with another girl in her second, just to create an opportunity to snatch a hair from her for illegal polyjuice use?"

  Honestly, the wonder was that /Hermione/ hadn't been the one put in Slytherin.

  "Exactly," Ron said, sliding his bishop several spaces.

  He shrugged. "It is pretty impressive, isn't it?" He contemplated their sleeping friend. "She always follows the rules in class. I guess that means people assume she always follows the rules everywhere."

  "More fool them, then."

  He leaned back, staring at the board as he tried to figure out the significance of Ron's latest move. "Agreed."

** This one might do it for you. It doesn't have Hermione as the main charecter (I think she's introduced in the second or third chapter as a side charecter, who develops from there), but it stays remarkably true to the source Hermione characterisation.

  Helping others was her passion. It became a revolution. With the power of an open mind, Hermione Granger changed the wizarding world forever.
