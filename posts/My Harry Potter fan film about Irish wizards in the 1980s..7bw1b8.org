** The editing and special effects were really something! The apparition also felt just like the actual movie's effect.

** You had my attention the moment the original John Williams Voldemort Theme played. And yes, the special effects are pretty great. Only thing --- you perpetuated the films' annoying "opposing beams of spells" thing that drowns down the whole mystique around Priori Incantatem. But aside from that, well done! Wish this was a bit longer.
