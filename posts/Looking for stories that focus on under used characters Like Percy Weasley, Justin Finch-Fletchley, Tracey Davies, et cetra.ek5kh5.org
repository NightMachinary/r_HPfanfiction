As it says, looking for stories that focus on the more under used characters, I'd like to see them more focused, then in the background of the story, but if they have a decent amount of lines and moments, I'll count that.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Can be on fanfiction.net or on another site.

Stuff I don't want:

No Super Powered Harry, no Super Intelligent Harry. NO Manipulative Dumbledore. No Weasley Bashing.


** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14033613][Percy Take the Wheel]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/KittySmith/pseuds/KittySmith][KittySmith]]) is an interesting AU that has Percy as the main character. Some very unique twists. WIP.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19437019][Ten Tips to Tranquility]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/bking4/pseuds/bking4][bking4]]) is about Daphne Greengrass and I enjoy it bc it's 100% about her with 0 romance and 0 interaction with Harry.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3836023][Dances, Dulcimers and Marginalia Dragons]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Gehayi/pseuds/Gehayi][Gehayi]]) focuses on the female founders.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/84554][The Years of the Rat]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/kaydeefalls/pseuds/kaydeefalls][kaydeefalls]]) is from the POV of Peter Pettigrew.

#+begin_quote
  A freak accident with Arthur's enchanted Ford Anglia causes a minor explosion and a major change in the Weasley household. With Arthur in a coma and Molly having passed away, Bill and Charlie can't afford to quit their jobs and must support the family from afar. Thus, it falls to Percy to handle the day-to-day, even if he's not sure that he can.

*** How's Daphne written? I'm always iffy on Daphne, since it's largely Ice Princess stereotype with her.

Thank you for the other stories, will check them out as well; if you know any more stories that focus on the more under used characters, feel free to let me know!

**** The fic's actually sort of a trope subversion. A lot of fics use ice princess as this romantic plot point with the ice only being surface deep. This...is not that. Daphne is creepy as hell and the reasoning is unique and handled well.

** I just finished this awesome fic linkffn(12181042) called *Order of Mercy*, and it's absolutely amazing. The main characters are Bill, Fleur, Percy, and Audrey, and it's about how they helped smuggle muggleborns out of the UK during Deathly Hallows. The author is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2832915/keeptheotherone][MandyinKC]], and I'm currently reading through the rest of her fic, and it's mostly about minor characters and it's all really really good!

linkao3(5936821) *Lessons in Continuity* is a short fic from Professor Binn's POV

linkao3(5147618) *Eleven Up* is about a study done on muggleborns from Harry's year.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/39668][Cassiopeia Black]] is a series about, well Cassiopeia Black who in canon is just a name on the Black family tree. The first story is linkao3(400441) *The Unchronicled Battles of Cassiopeia Black*.

linkao3(1223752) *The Black Family in Seven Parts* is about members of the Black Family who have been blasted off the family tree.

Not sure if McGonagall is really an underused character, but I can't think of many long fics where she's the POV character. linkao3(11083359) *Vera Verto* is about her becoming the new Headmistress and healing Hogwarts after the war.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/series/296393][The Wild Youth]] is a series of oneshots about the First War including characters Peter Pettigrew, the Prewett Brothers, Mary MacDonald, and Dorcas Meadowes. linkao3(4462226) *And Peter Ran* is the one about Wormtail.

linkao3(4652130) *Little King* where Regulus sees something of his future in Divination class.

linkao3(11951) *In Between Days* is about Percy and Oliver running a safehouse.

linkao3(1397617) *brave* is about Andromeda's thoughts on what brave means over the years.

linkao3(14074770) *In the language of flowers* is an AU where Petunia is a witch and Lily is a muggle, but I can't say I've seen many fics where Petunia is the main character.

linkao3(11914698) *Renascienta* might be what you're looking for. It's an AU where Regulus didn't die, and hid in France instead. When Voldemort is resurrected he comes back to England and joins the Order of the Phoenix. POV is split between Regulus and Sirius, but I think it fits what you want since Regulus is underused in fic.

The author of Renascienta have also written a lot of stories about the Black family in a series called [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/989298][Renascienta: between the lines.]]The first one is called linkao3(16431527) *where once there were stars* about Marius Black who was a squib.

#+begin_quote
  In 1990, prominent Muggleborn research wizard Cromwell Albertson embarked on an ambitious project to interview six Muggle-born students -- before and after their life-changing discovery of their wizarding talent. He continued these interviews over the next nine years, a period of time which spanned both the Chamber of Secrets attacks in 1992 and Voldemort's second rise and subsequent persecution of Muggleborns in 1997. The Pensieve Projection that resulted won a Superbius award for artistic excellence in 2002 and has been required viewing in the Hogwarts Muggle Studies course since 2008.

  In the summer of 1979, Regulus Black vanished from British wizarding society with horcrux in hand, ducking his head down into the obscurity of a French village to complete his task of destroying Slytherin's locket - and with it, a fragment of the Dark Lord's soul. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again, sixteen years later, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict, with a very different set of allies. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the fog of the brewing Second War, tugging forth both old conflicts and new.

** linkffn(11916243) is your average (or slightly above-average) Harmony, but with very strong story of Percy Weasley, which was obviously the best of the story (Harry & Hermione story is so much Harmonical, it is boring), so the author rewrote it from Percy's point of view as linkffn(12373273) and the result is a way better than the previous story. Highly recommended!

** linkffn(11247748) focuses on Astoria Greengrass, a Gryffindor in Harry's year. It really delves into what could be going on in the background of the canon plot. Astoria has a really interesting backstory and the lines of the story are written well. This focuses a lot on Slytherins, but no one is whitewashed or OOC -- everyone has a distinct personality based on what we know from canon

  Astoria Greengrass's war was never black and white. Sometimes you can make them love you, but you can't ever make them fear you. Political drama and Slytherin hijinks abound. Draco/Astoria.
