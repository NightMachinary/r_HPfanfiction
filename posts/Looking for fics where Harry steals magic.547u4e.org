Before you downvote, read this out!

Basically I want a fic where Harry can steal magic, and adds it onto his own. However, I do NOT want him to instantly take Dumbledore's power. there has to be some conditions. Like, you can't take people with so and so amounts of power, ect ect.

Over 70k+ words please!


** Only fic that comes to mind but unfortunately, only a one-shot at 8.4k words. I, too, would love to see more of this idea though.\\

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?

** linkffn(A third path to the future by vimesenthusiast)

A large crossover where Harry left his original dimension via veil in the department of mysteries and shows up in a marvel universe.

He has a power to suck magic from things, don't remember if it works on people. However this mutant power is only a very small part of this very big fiction, and also isn't set in the harry potter universe at all.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

** The only thing that comes to mind is the Sacrifices Arc. The ability (being an /absorbere/) is treated well by the author - it is explored to its natural consequence, i.e a lot of people are terrified of Harry once it becomes known he can eat magic. He mostly uses on battles, to defend from curses, and a few times as a punishment.

**** You can try pinpointing the start of the relevant parts by Ctrl+F-ing for “absorbere”, since that's what the ability of eating others' magic is called in this story.

Also, here's an advise/*spoiler* on the final book's ending that you may find helpful: [[/spoiler][if the story manages to get your attention, and if you are reading it primarily for its relevance for this specific request, then get prepared that at the end of the story Harry will stupidly get rid of all the magic that he consumed from Voldemort. He literally pours it +down the drain+ into the ocean.]]

*** I would love to see a variation in which, similar to the quickening present in the Highlander universe, if HP kills another magical, he takes their powers, but he is incapacitated for a period of time roughly proportional to how much power/ability/etc. he received from the deceased.

For example, if he kills a randomly selected first year student, he may be out of it for a day. But if he kills a powerful & capable adult like Snape, he may be out of it for a couple weeks.

80k is just first year. Adding all years comes up to about 3 million words.

And yeah this is slash (but not until late 4th year). It's my favorite series *ever* and I despise slash. But yeah, it's that good. The worldbuilding, characterization, drama, the crazy magics, magical customs... just out of this world. Haven't read a story like this one since I finished it.

Also the only series that does lords right (as in lords of magic, not nobility). Harry is a lord-level wizard and it /feels/ that way. He fucks shit up in a level beyond all other wizards, apart from other lords and/or ladies. And the author excels in describing it.

**** Many readers in this sub have stylistic issues with Robst's writing. Here is my attempt to give a balanced take on the matter:

In favor of Robst:

- Writes rather prolifically

- Has some original ideas

- Has better than average spelling, punctuation, & grammar

Against Robst:

- He regularly levels up the protagonist but doesn't level up the antagonists, so there is rarely any doubt about whether his protagonist will succeed

- His critiques of certain characters, notably the Weasley family & Dumbledore, are generally bashing in nature

- His plot lines can sometimes be a little campy, or contrived, or melodramatic

My opinion on him is:

- He's certainly not the best fanfiction writer I've read, but he is also not the worst, he's somewhere in the middle of the road

- His works were some of the first stories I ever read in the HPFF universe, so I retain a slight amount of nostalgic affection

- There's plenty of HPFF out there - if his work doesn't suit your tastes, but if someone else /does/ enjoy his work, there's no need to berate them for it
