We broke time mom help!

Harry through some convoluted hijinks involving A Dustbuster half the Nigerian Quidditch team and three vampires all named Winston accidentally broke the time space continuum and with lack of resources and Hermione busy doing her taxes he can only turn to one person who just so happens to be his 17-year-old mother who thinks he is James potters slightly less annoying second cousin.

​

The secret must be maintained that he is not in fact her son and well the marauders aren't helping anything Remus keeps trying to set her up with Margaret Sanger and Harry is failing horribly at the overwhelming impulse to stab Peter so the vampires constantly passing him penknives and sharpens shifts from a toothbrush shipsshivs shiv Made from a toothbrush and a bit of lint they found on the stairs are not helping matters how are you just wants to go home hurry just wants to go home and feed his ocelot Lawrence the poor little bugger must have been starving by now it had been nearly 6 hours and Hey little fella the poor little fellow didn't take hunger well he would've eaten the draperies by now and gonny had just finally decided on a color scheme for their new flat hairy didn't fancy having to rehang debris draperies for the fourth time in a month there was still the matter of the giant ominous vortex pulling in various objects from around the cosmos the perpetually moving giant cow currently hovering over the black lake looking contemptuous who is not a good sign of things to come
