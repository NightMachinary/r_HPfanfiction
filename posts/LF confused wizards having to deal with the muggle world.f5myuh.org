I don't recall what the title was but I recently read a fic where the entire premise was that Draco Malfoy wasn't allowed to use magic for several years and ultimately ran away and tried to live out those years of his life in the muggle world, ultimately ended up taking classes at a university.

Give me more fanfics like this! Purebloods just trying to figure out how life works on the other side of things, any length, serious or humor. Broadening their horizons and changing their ways is appreciated but not a requirement

Preferably minimal to no romance

  "For crimes committed against the wizarding and Muggle world while underage, I hereby sentence you to one year without magic." Draco stood stiffly, his knees locked to help keep him upright. So many spectators. Potter and Granger were there, Weasel-less. His knees finally buckled and he crumpled to the floor in a faint. Chapter 66. COMPLETE. EWE. Dramione.
