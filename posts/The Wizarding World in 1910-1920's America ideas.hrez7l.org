I want to expand on the world of Harry Potter in America, in a time when war was near, racism was badly and before the modern era took off.

Basically I took the OG ideas implemented into HP and America and added a dark side to it, and I came up with a character who is faced by prejudice by both No-Maj and Wizards.

Basically the reason pure-blood superiority doesn't exist, is because the vile Wizard's set in the old ways didn't want white and black wizards (Specifically half-bloods) to stand up to them and their cruelty, when slavery was around. The KKK is a sect of wizards that are bitter about the loss of the Civil War, (Responsible for the introduction of a curse known to us as the disease that killed Chestnut trees in America, a potent wood for wands in my world as well as the assassination of Lincoln, the use of the Imperius curse on slaves. Also Grand Imperial Wizard, cyclops? That stuff writes itself). The Smithsonian is an institution that covers up fantastical beasts and evidence of such beasts (Such as the conspiracy that IRL they hid the bones of "Giants"), etc.

I came up with this so far, and I need more ideas of what stuff the world could have had back then specifically in the Wizarding World, all the zany and bizarre ideas that could fit. Also ideas for characters could be nice.


** I associate that time period (1910-1920) more with WW1 and the final chapter of the old west. Women's suffrage was big during this time, and it was also the period just after Theodore Roosevelt's Big Stick Ideology: "speak softly and carry a big stick" and the Great White Fleet. I don't think this is the time period you're looking for.

I expect the Roaring Twenties might be a more fun time period to write about: Prohibition, rum-runners, speak easies, flappers, a booming economy, and of course the most active years of the KKK (to my amateur understanding). Could be really interesting to write this from the Wizarding perspective. You might even include part of the Great Depression if you include a bit of the 30s. I think you'd be missing a great opportunity if you made this a dark fic exclusively about the KKK which is only a small part of what was going on at the time.

That's my advice. Could be a neat idea.

** I'm really interested that you mentioned the blight that killed off the chestnut trees. If you haven't read the first chapter of The Overstory, it discusses this in detail. Very interested in seeing where you take this!
