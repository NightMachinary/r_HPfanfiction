** I don't see how that's possible without pre-empting Lily as his mother, in which case Harry Potter as we know him wouldn't exist and it'd just be an OC, possibly not even with the same name.

*** Actually, I've read few fics where Lily found out she was orphaned pureblood adopted by Evans family, that would make Harry proper pureblood (for the life of me can't remember titles or whether they were any good).

Another route would be fics with blood adoption (Princess of the Blacks comes to mind) if OP is willing to take it.

**** Point. Though I've seen too many bad blood adoption fics to chance one of those without a solid recommendation to do so.

***** There's also the 'adopted by the Potters' or 'secretly stolen from another family to replace the original' rigmarole...

** In my story "Patron", he's legally a pureblood (and tries to outdo purebloods at their own culture, at least in public). But in that story, "pureblood" is a purely legal definition, which means it's what the Wizengamot and the law says. linkffn(11080542)

In cosette-aimee's "A necessary gift", an adult Harry is transported to an AU and arrives as a kid - and becomes a pureblood. Heavy emphasis on pureblood culture. linkffn(6671596)

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.
