Hoooo boy, I got this idea when I saw that image of Dudley killing his parents for only getting 36 presents this year.

What if you were an SI who had to deal with being treated better than your cousin, live in a magic world that you could never access magic, and deal with the behavioural issues of your mom and dad who should have gone to therapy ages ago?

I mean, if you weren't a reborn person, you knew, no wonder why Dudley turned out terribly being favored and encouraged to eat cakes and cakes.

Try navigating a life where Harry isn't resentful of you for being treated so much better than he is, while helping him out.

Thought that might be interesting!


** This is a fascinating idea, and I've never seen anyone write it before.

If I was personally in that situation, I'd probably:

1. Not punch him or get gangs of kids to punch him
2. Cry and throw a fit when my parents excluded him or were mean to him. Since they are easily manipulated by tantrums I might as well use my powers for good.
3. Cry and throw a fit when he was locked in a cupboard, insist on a bunkbed/shared bedroom and play video games with him.
4. Just in general do my best to make his childhood a happier one.
5. I'd probably also be a nerd child lol

*** It does stand for "self-insert"

Basically, it's a trope where someone from our world gets reborn or somehow magically transported into a fictional world. Sometimes they have previous knowledge of the fictional world and sometimes they don't. The "self-insert" could be an insert of the authors personality (as the name would suggest) or it could be an original character (OC).

In this case, the SI would be reborn as Dudley. So, their soul (or whatever you want to call it) would be placed inside Dudley's body.

It sounds weird, but SI fics can often be very interesting if written by a competent writer.

** I'd try to avoid the magical war, and go for the old "Oi, Dumbles? Tommy boy mad Horcruxes. Might wanna look into those!" strategy.
