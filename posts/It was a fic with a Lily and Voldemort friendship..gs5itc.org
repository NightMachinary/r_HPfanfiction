:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
In it, Lily realized how different her and James's ideas of parenting are and tries to get a divorce and keep Harry. Lily gets a muggle apartment and a job at a bar and meets Voldemort in said bar when he's trying to get away from his followers for a night. There's zero trust between them but a weird friendship but in the end it doesn't stop him from trying to kill her and Harry when he finds out about the prophecy. It was a one shot I think and the summary might have included something about Peter not being the only betrayal that night? I remember liking it and finding it incredibly unsettling having Voldemort playing with baby Harry, talking with Lily, and being a friend when the audience knows it's not long before he kills her and ruins Harry's life.

  A short little parody about Voldemort's Death in the final movie. The Golden Trio could always be counted on to completely ruin a moment. One Shot.

** I was thinking of /A Well Groomed Mind/ until I saw the description. That fanfic has a very strong, “History is written by the victors” vibe.
