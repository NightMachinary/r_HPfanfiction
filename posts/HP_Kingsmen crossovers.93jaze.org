Do any (of decent quality) exist? Or just any James Bond-y sort of fics? I feel like HP lends itself well to crazy spy/auror/unspeakable adventures to absove plots to destroy/control the world. bonus points for a flirty/smooth Harry or MC.


** I want this strongly. But who would superior? A wizard or a top agent with tech?

****** I personally love when Magic and Muggle stuff mix in a fic, it doesn't all have to be guns and shooting cause magic itself is highly malleable, imagine creating instant cover, walls to cut off escapes, create birds to take shots for you, and thats just defensively. I love when stories mix the two together, sure Harry has a self replenishing magazine in his 1911 and a enchanted dragon leather skinned bullet proof vest but he also has a wand that allows him localized reality warping

******* That too, I was just using the MG42 as an example of how ridiculously overpowered muggle tech upgraded with magic could potentially be.

*** Gonna go with the wizards. If for no other reason than magic can directly effect the mind.

But I agree with [[/u/HarryAugust]], I feel like the intention of this idea is that the Kingsmen are wizards. They've got tech, magic, and maybe the two combined into more effective/powerful techno-magical gadgetry.
