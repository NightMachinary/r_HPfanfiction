Voldemort, Bellatrix, Wormtail, Umbridge, the Dursleys, Draco, Lucius, Narcissa, Crabbe/Goyle, Grindelwald, Snape, Dumbledore, Fenrir Greyback, Quirrell, Regulus, Lockhart, Crouch Jr., Crouch Sr., Karkaroff, the Carrows


** At what point in their life? When they were at their most evil? When they died? When they were at their least evil?

Depending at what point you want to rank them will drastically affect the ranking. That being said, I would rank Doubledore as the least evil on your list and Voldemort as the most, regardless of what time period you are judging them at.

If we're judging as per time of death/end of the book (not including epilogue) if they aren't already dead it would go: Voldemort, Bellatrix, Greyback, Carrows, Crouch Jr., Umbridge, Wormtail, Lucius, Grindelwald, Karkaroff, Crabbe/Goyle, Draco, Lockhart, Narcissa, Dursleys, Regulas, Snape, Crouch sr., and Dumbledore.

** From the least evil to the most :

- *Dumbledore* : he is absolutely not evil, and, despite his probable issues with it, "For the Greater Good" is probably the best sentence to summarize his life. Any action done by Dumbledore in the series, any sacrifice he made (his own included) were there to ensure the best possible outcome in the end. He only had the best intentions at heart, and concidering the final victory, he would probably consider it as worth it.
- *The Dursleys* : they may be awful people, but they are not evil. They are not some kind of monster finding pleasure at others suffering (except maybe Petunia), they are just neglecting guardians who did a pretty bad job at raising their children (both Harry and Dudley). We meet people like the Dursleys everyday without even noticing, they are not special.
- *Crouch Sr* : another example of bad parent. But for all his faults, Crouch truly fought against the blood purist and did everything in his power to not lose the war. Some say he was too inflexible (like when he gave the Aurors permission to use the Unforgiveables), but others could argue that he is the reason why Voldemort had not yet won in 1981. Keeping his son under the Imperius for 13 years is also pretty bad, but did it to protect him after saving him from Azkaban. If I had to summarize, I guess it would be something like "Terrible means for a kinda good end".
- *Wormtail, Draco, Quirell* : I put them at the same level because I think they are pretty much the same. None of them are truly evil, they are just weak. Pettigrew betrayed his friends to save his own life. Draco thought he was ok with genocide until he discovered he didn't have in him to even kill one person. And Quirell let himself be tempted by Voldemort. Under different circunstances, none of them would have been evil.
- *Lockart* : Narcisist. I doubt he thinks in term of "good" or "bad", but rather in "Lockart" Vs "the rest". Anything that benefit him is good, the rest doesn't matter. Still he did bad thing and nobody knowing the truth would either consider him as a good person.
- *Snape* : I think he is a bad man, trying to do good things. He was totally fine with genocide until Lily became one of the victims, and then his whole seemed to revolve around avenging her and protecting her child. Still, I think that deep down, Snape was an ass (as seen with his numerous petty actions in Canon), but an ass who is trying to do better. And I think he did some progress on that front (DH Snape was probably above the cowardly Trio, but it doesn't erase a whole life of bad).
- *Regulus, Narcissa* : they are the same. Both were 100% with the genocide, and even helped it until one of their loved one was menaced. It may make them a good friend, or a good parent, but they are still not good persons.
- *Lucius* : he is pretty similar to his wife. I just put him one level under because his whole plot in CoS is very messed up.
- *Karkaroff* : Unlike Pettigrew who is only a coward, he is an evil coward. He always loved the Dark Arts, always looked down on muggleborn, and he happily joined a genocide. But he still betrayed everything to save his own hide.
- *Crabbe/ Goyle, the Carrows* : They are very similar. They deeply believe into blood superiority, they have this touch of sadism that let them easily grasp the Dark Arts, and yet they the capacity to become very dangerous. If not for the Battle of Hogwarts, Crabbe and Goyle would have probably ended up as the Carrows. Some kind of mid level enforcer under the order of someone more intelligent/ capable than them, never able to get the full attention or trust of Voldemort.
- *Fenrir Greyback* : pure ass. The man didn't had any principle, and only joined Voldemort because he gave him the opportunity of bitting people. Has a preference for children which is a big no no.
- *Crouch Jr, Bellatrix* : Fanatic followers. They love what they do and even take some kind of pride in their result, but nothing is more important than Voldemort approval.
- *Grinderwald* : This is kinda fanon since we don't know a lot of him (except the movies I guess), but I like to think that he had at least a vision. That he truly believed in the "Greater Good". That no matter the sacrifice, he truly thought that the world would become better with the Muggle back in their place and him at the head. Still responsible for WW2 so yeah evil.
- *Voldemort* : Unlike Grinderwald, I don't think he had any "vision". Sure he didn't like Mudblood and wanted to kill them, but I don't think he ever "truly" like the Pureblood either. Voldemort became a blood purist to rally the blood purist to his cause, but I doubt he really cared about things past "Never die" and "I'm the boss". With other circunstances, he could have been just as likely to gather Muggleborn, or Dark Creatures, or even Goblins. Anything as long as he is on top.
- *Umbridge* : for me, she is the worst. Sure some Death Eaters are monster, and Voldemort is "Theatrical Evil", but she is "True Evil". She isn't that strong, or that charismatic, but she knows the rules perfectly well, and know how to play the game. She will abuse every ounce of power she gets, and will take great pleasure making your life a living hell. She is a "realist evil", one that most people will (sadly) meet at least once in their life. So that makes her the worst.

*** Wormtail should be much more evil. He literally killed twelve people in order to frame his friend and sentence him to a life of imprisonment and despair for betraying and indirectly killing two other friends. Then he played a pretty big role in bringing back Voldemort

**** I put him relatively low because, unlike others like Crouch Jr or Bellatrix, he doesn't "want" to do these things.

Crouch Jr and the Lestranges attacked the Longbottoms because they wanted to bring back their Lord. In comparaison, Pettrigrew betrayed the Order (and later the Potters) to protect his life. He killed these Muggles because it was the only way he found to not be killed by Sirius. And he brought back Voldemort because he was the only one who could have accepted him and his rank and "protected" him.

In a world without Voldemort, Bellatrix would still be a Blood Purist that would at least thought about killing Muggles (if not act of these urges) why Pettigrew would just be a normal guy. And even during the war, we see that fleeing and hiding are often his prefered options, and that he only ressort to violence when he doesn't have any other choices. That doesn't make him a good person, but I don't think that truly make him "Evil", even if he did terrible things.

In fact, I think he is pretty similar to Lockart with a self interested view of the World ("/Does it benefit me? If not I don't care/"). The only reason why I put Lockart a bit lower is because Pettigrew did bad thing to protect his life, why Lockart did it for fame and riches.

***** Pettigrew literally killed multiple people and put Sirius in jail on a false charge. That's worse than Lockhart being dishonest. He could've escaped to another country instead of killing a dozen people and framing his friend

****** In my opinion, there is a difference between being a bad person, and being "Evil". Pettigrew is a bad person, that's a no brainer, but I don't really think he is "Evil", even if he did bad things.

Most, if not all of his actions were motivated by self preservation. Yes he killed people, and yes he ruined lives, but most of the time, he did it when his back was litteraly against the wall:

- When he killed 12 Muggles to fake his death and escape Sirius, he did it after spending 5 days on the run (since the death of the Potters). The reason why he was still in Britain was probably because he could litteraly not leave (or didn't think about it but then it was Rowling choice).
- When he brought back Voldemort, he did it after spending 12 years as a Rat, and only because his cover was blown. For some reasons, he decided that this was the last option for him (something Voldemort never failed to remind him).

Once again, the motivations behind his acts does not make him a good person, far from it. But I still think it makes him a little less Evil than Lockart, that ruined life for . . . his own pride.

In another world without Voldemort, Pettigrew would probably a pretty average wizard, while Lockart would still Obliviate people to steal their glory.

** Grindelwald: Much smarter than Voldemort

Voldemort

Bellatrix

Umbridge: Gets off on torturing children

Fenrir Greyback: Feeds off of kids

the Carrows: Tortures children

Crouch Jr

Lucius: could go either way...I personally don't think he's evil, just did what was best for his family. Still, he did worse things than the people below him, hence why he's here.

Wormtail: He's definitely bad, but I wouldn't say evil. He's a coward.

Quirrell: We don't know much about this guy

the Dursleys: There's no redemption for these guys except for Dudley, I think.

Crouch Sr.: He wasn't evil, just made bad decisions.

Karkaroff: He was a coward, but he wasn't evil.

Crabbe/Goyle: They aren't evil. They are the bad guys, but there's a difference. They are just brainless followers.

Regulus and Draco: They both are on the same level, in my opinion. We don't know much about Regulus. I think he died with his pureblood views, he only didn't think killing muggleborns and muggles was the way to go. Still, both ended up on the right side ish.

Narcissa: She just did what was necessary to protect her son, I wouldn't count her as evil.

Snape: Regardless of whether you like him or not, he didn't die evil. He died fighting for the light. He spent more of his life fighting for the light rather than against it.

Lockart: This guy isn't evil just a bad person.

Dumbledore: He wasn't evil, per se, just misguided, I guess. He did what was necessary, even if it wasn't right.

** It's hard ranking them because most of them are some kind of evil or highly complicated and others are imo not evil? Voldemort, Bellatrix, Grindelwald, Umbridge etc are whole different worlds. Dumbledore is manipulative but not evil. I don't think Crabbe and Goyle were evil? They were just bullies and followers of Draco. Regulus admired the Death Eaters and joined them gladly at 16 but made a last ditch effort when it escalated, though we don't know much else about him.
