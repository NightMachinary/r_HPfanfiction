:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I started a fic where I believe it was a HHr or H/D where Harry is forced to kill all death eaters since he made a bow that he would do so and Daphne begs him not too. I don't remember the name but I think it was on thelnger side being over 100k words. Someone's bound to know what it is but that someone most definitely isn't me. :shrug:


** this one I think is the one

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
