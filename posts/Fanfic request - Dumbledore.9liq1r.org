I really want to know how in the hell did Dumbledore manage to just walk into the forest alone and talk his way out of getting Umbridge back from the Centaurs, especially when the Centaurs were really miffed with Umbridge and the ministry.

I would also love a fanfic about Dumbledore and his years at Hogwarts as a student! - his adventures in the forest or in the lake (like how he developed a friendship with the merpeople for example). What things did he do with his wand that Madam Professor Griselda Marchbanks had never seen?
