Hello! I have a good friend who is (finally) starting to get into HP fan fic! I read a ton of fic with non-canon ships, so she may not be as interested in what I recommend.

What (relatively) short fics could you, oh champions of fanon, suggest for the novice reader? Nothing too AU or zany. I don't want to scare her off.


** Id recommend - Not from Others - to me its the perfect candidate for first time Fan Fiction readers, its canon compliant and its a "missing" part of the main series that could very easily be canon, all of which makes it easier for someone who might feel intimidated by Fan Fiction, because once they read a chapter they will realise that everything is familiar and what an awesome writer FloreatCastellum is and that Fanfiction can be as good as the main novels. linkffn(11419408)

** Other have suggested canon-compliant fics like Cauterize of Not from Others. I'll suggest the fic that got me into fanfiction: linkffn(Hogwarts Houses Divided).

Basically it's canon-compliant, but it focuses on the "next generation". It's another great way to get someone into Harry Potter since it feels like the first few books, but they get to discover brand new characters while still seeing familiar stuff (Harry, Ron, Cho).

  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

** Canon-compliant is definitely the way to go. I would recommend:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5677867/1/Ginny-Weasley-and-the-Half-Blood-Prince][Ginny Weasley and the Half Blood Prince]]: It feels like a companion novel to HPB and Ginny Weasley is very well characterised.

#+begin_quote
  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3867967/1/Asking-for-Roses][Asking for Roses]]: I recently read this and was very surprised, it's a sweet Hannah/Neville mystery that mostly fits within the HP timeline.

#+begin_quote
  Neville thinks his summer will be much like any other: working in his grandmother's garden and other lonely pursuits. After leaving Hogwarts many months before, Hannah Abbott believes she is trapped and isolated for good. They're both mistaken. PreTDH.
#+end_quote

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=247000][Latet Anguis in Herba]]: This did a very good job of characterising Slytherin House traits and it's sequels ([[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=259003][Shade to Shade]], [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293286][Falls to Shadow]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=318952][Beyond this Place]]) raise some interesting moral dilemmas.

#+begin_quote
  Slytherin House is a hard place to be in the run-up to the Second War. Any student has to worry about classes, careers, juggling the wishes of teachers and parents; a Slytherin gets the rest of the school's judgement, the internal politics of prejudice and choosing sides. How do the decent but cunning, the moral but ambitious, walk the thin green line?
#+end_quote

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=317613][Ignite]]: The plot is very well written and interesting, as are the characters. It has two sequels: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327625][Starfall]] and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332775][Oblivion]]

#+begin_quote
  A mysterious illness leaving a handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot.
#+end_quote

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12096051/1/Put-Your-Guns-Away-it-s-Tea-Time][Put Your Guns Away it's Tea Time]]: It's a very sweet Albus/Scorpius set after the Cursed Child.The Potter-Weasley relations are my favourite part. Sequel: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12121323/1/Put-Your-Curse-in-Reverse][Put Your Curse in Reverse it's Tea Time]]

#+begin_quote
  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

** I will always and forever recommend Schnoogle's "Refiner's Fire" (and sequel) by Abraxan: [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/abraxan/TRF2_.html]]

The series of two stories isn't short (probably 200-350k words total), but it's amazing; it was my first fic, and because of that it holds a special place in my heart. I always consider it to be my favorite fic, even if I know that logically there are likely other fics I've read that have been better. (By the way, that's not a back-handed euphemism for "this is bad"; I truly mean this series are incredibly good and well-written.)

It's a beautiful, well-written H/G fic (with some H/OC in the first bit, but it's incredibly well-done) that isn't incredibly AU; the series is post-OOTP, following years 6 and 7.

Even though (apparently) it's also hosted on FFnet, I recommend reading it on Schnoogle (fictionalley), because I love Schnoogle :)

** Personally, I like slice-of-life fanfics, especially those that focus on Ginny and Luna.

So, here's Fire and Air:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11152139/1/Fire-and-Air]]

And here's Dinner With the Weasleys--a fic I describe as the Sunday dinner you eat at your grandparents' after church. Most impressive about this one? Luna's point of view, first person, and it /works./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7227719/1/Dinner-With-the-Weasleys]]

You can never have too much Luna. Here's one of the best Luna-fics of them all. /Mind's Eye, Soul's Reflection./

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1]]

Finally, if you're looking for an AU story that will not scare her off...then the only one I can recommend is Stages of Hope.

** What did she like so far, or what did she like about canon? I think she should read some tropey, less than perfectly awesome fics first, because there's no way she'll enjoy them later. I read the Princess of the Blacks series by Silently Watches during my early days in this fandom and enjoyed it, but I don't think I'd like it as much now.

I'm linking a couple of crossovers that aren't too zany, since nobody here has.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

** linkffn(The Best Revenge by Arsinoe de Blassenville) is a super cute Severus saves Harry from the Dursleys fic -- it also has a sequel and ultimately a happy ending for everyone, which is nice for first-time readers.

linkffn(For Hogwarts: A Regency Gamble by Subversa) is a Hermione/Severus fic with a side pairing of Harry/Draco. It's just a cute fic, although it may not be canon-compliant enough for your friend.

The top 2 are rather lengthy, but are two of the best I've ever read.

For someone new to fanfic the 3rd (survivor) is perfect. It encompasses the beauty of fanfiction as a whole, tugging at your feelings and still remaining in the realm of canon. She will cry her eyes out, its a moving story.

*** I would argue that two of your three recs are misplaced.

The Firebird trilogy is one of the most dystopian AU fanfics in existence. It is also, like all Darth Marrs, love it or hate it. The OP specifically said "Nothing too AU" ...

Dodging .. etc is an ongoing fic currently on hiatus not far into its plot. Let's let it get someplace before we keep hailing it as a great entry fic. It has great worldbuilding and an excellent premise, but so does the Game of Thrones series and so did Wheel of Time before the authors got too wrapped up in themselves to finish/added too many filler books to a series and died before they could finish it (and I think this will be the end result of GRRM as well, dark as that may be).

I would recommend some of the "classics" before either of those. I would also push slice-of-time one-shots and comedies. Try these.

linkffn(a black comedy), linkffn(Cauterize by Lady Altair), linkffn(Inspected by No 13)

I would even throw Poison Pen and some Robst in there just so they get a chance to see the "popcorn movie" style of fanfic. Black Comedy may be a bit zany but it works. Also have them check out fanficauthors, many good "classic" stories are archived there.

(Aside: people fall all over themselves to recommend Darth Marrs' ongoing fic, and I simpy can't get into it. Maybe it is because I don't give a rat's behind about the Stargate universe, but I've tried four times and haven't gotten past the sixth chapter. Does it get any better? Does Harry get any more likable?)
