I'm looking for any story where harry is physically powerful whether through magic or training. Just to make it clear if it is through magic it is not temporary it's permanant as in doesn't need magic counciously performed to do it again.

I want harry to be able to if he wished easily beat vernon without magic. I'm just getting sick of the storys where without magic harry can't even beat vernon. I also want him to be able to do it pretty early in the story.

If he can learn martial arts that would be cool too. If his magic is so powerful that he can beat vernon without his wand and without alerting the MOM I would read that too.

  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

*** How powerful does he get in this story compared to everyone else.

I've read all of his work and most of it deals with op main characters so is it worth it, and if he does get op how soon.

**** Well, pretty soon I think. By fourth year? The OP doesn't get in your face till then I think. But noodle always writes Ãœbermensch Mad scientist characters. So don't expect anything different.
