Kinda reread the entire series and got back into this. I was wondering what your favorite tropes are? SO far I've found a home in the WBWL and Slytherin HP, While hating the whole Bashing (over the top kind), OP HP and the uhh... lewd kind. (where they take a fourteen year old and pretty much write child p**n.) It'd be nice to know a few of the tropes in the series I haven't found.


** Tropes I'm so over:

1) Lordships / nobility - I don't care whether it's Harry getting one lordship or multiple lordships, I nope out of anything where this plays a major role and kids go around addressing each other as “Heir So-and-So” and acting like child-sized adults.

2) Wrong Boy-Who-Lived, especially when James, Lily, and/or Sirius are neglectful, abusive, and/or abandon Harry in favor of their other kid.

3) Dumbledore and the Weasleys are stealing from Harry, blocking his magic and dozens of special abilities, and are using compulsion, loyalty, and love charms and potions to keep him in line. (And, of course, Harry discovers all these blocked abilities/curses on him by taking a blood test at Gringotts, and the goblins are happy to remove them all.)

4) All Slytherins are misunderstood, noble souls bullied by evil Gryffindors for trying to defend the superior pureblood culture against ignorant mudbloods

Tropes I like: 1) Time travel 2) Sirius as a good, competent godfather and parent figure for Harry

Lifehack: if you're reading a Slytherin Harry fic and you want to know if it's going to have this trope, Snape's speech will tell you. For some reason every single ‘Slytherins are the real victims' author feels the need to have Snape make a speech to the first years which goes “Rule 1: no fighting outside the common room, we present a united front. People hate Slytherins enough as it is so we have to look strong. Rule 2: don't get caught. Professors will come down especially hard on Slytherins, they look for any excuse to take points. Rule 3: go everywhere in twos, the other houses hate us and will take any opportunity to curse you in the corridors and the professors won't stop it. Make me proud, my snakes.”

So yeah if you read that then it's a good sign to exit.

  Harem. Often related to the above mentioned point. Head of 6 houses, gets so have 6 wives. Big Brain time.
#+end_quote

While I dislike Harem in general, I particulary hate this justification. It's not like Harry couldn't make several children with one wife, or just have one of them inherit several "Houses" since it's exactly what he did.

Then again I also dislike the Lordship! trope, and both of theses tropes are generally just an excuse for Super Harry to have a power tripe with his Harem so it's not like it truly matters.

** Best: Harry gets adopted, Harry runs away, just Harry gets away from the Dursley's period. My favorite adoption is snape, because I love the learning to love each other angle and Harry having no one else to turn to but his worst enemy but they become family.

If I want a good cry I can just turn to building doors or blessings in disguise by JAWorley. Building doors seems to have been dropped before the relationship really starts, but I love the line

 "I know the Headmaster didn't buy me clothes because he cares about me. He only did it because the Justice said he had to." He turned suddenly and Snape was taken back to see wetness in Harry's eyes, though the tears hadn't fallen yet. "Maybe you could quit reminding me that I'm only here because people are forced to take care of me, not because they want me."

Worst: wrong boy who lived. Especially when he still winds up at the Dursley's with his family still alive.

The lord heir stuff can be interesting, but can also be annoying as all hell.

Stat sheets like video games. Oh yes, his animagus and metamorphmagus skills are blocked by 75% each, and he is compelled to love only people with red hair, and his core needs to be unlocked and goblins have to do all of it.

A will stating that Peter was their secret keeper and should be locked up. Peter was one of their best friends and they trusted him enough to make him their secret keeper. If voldemort found them the assumption would probably have been that voldemort killed him and broke through the wards.

I don't mind a little Weasley bashing but that they are all criminal masterminds screwing Harry over is usually an interest killer.

*** Have you read the Ever Upward series? It sounds like you'd like it. Harry runs away from the Durseley's. Although it's a raised by the Basilisk fic, Snape is the human Harry gets closest to and Harry eventually names Snape his guardian.

linkao3(ever upward by stranglerfig) The bot has a tendency to link the third fic in the series rather than the first, so make sure you start with the right one if you want to read it,

  Growing up is hard, and growing up in the midst of brewing revolution while trying to break an ancient curse is harder. Harry journeys alongside old friends and new as he strives to safeguard his family, keep himself secret, and navigate deep and wild magics.

** Best: I love stories where Harry becomes the Master of Death & it means something more than just 'he accepts he has to die.' Dammit, JK came up with an awesome idea & then just threw it in the garbage. I fucking hated that so much.

Worst: Any story where the author gushes over Draco instead of portraying him as the vile, bigoted, arrogant, spoiled, cowardly, whiny little monster that he is. 'Dramione' particularly makes me want to vomit.
