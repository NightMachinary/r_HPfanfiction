  It is Christmas of the year 1977, and Sirius Black is teetering on the edge of madness. When one careless deed brings his world crashing down around him, with far-reaching consequences, Regulus Black has to step in and help his brother piece together the fragments of his life -- if he can stop himself from being sucked into the terrifying vortex alongside Sirius.
