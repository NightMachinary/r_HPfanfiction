*** Nowhere does it say they have to be english/uk comidians, and over a 40 ish (assuming he didn't start until mostly done with school, and remembering he was living impared for a decade) period, with any mildly famous comedian that speaks some english, add in a quick murder spree right before the battle.... can't be that hard to have a couple of thousand. Especially if they keep having to replace them due to disappearences. Would drop the bar in comedy though.

** Now I'm imagining Voldemort hunting down stand up comedians and jokesters. He offered them a deal: if they made him laugh they could live but if he didn't laugh at their jokes, he would kill them. So most of the jokes were so bad during the lake scene that Dumbledore had to chase them away with fire.
