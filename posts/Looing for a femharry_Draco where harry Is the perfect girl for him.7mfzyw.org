** So Harry would be a vapid gold digger who was really interested not in Draco, but in Draco's money and father? Of course, since Draco is basically Narcissus, that would make Harry his Echo. Harry would follow around, practically drooling over Draco and stroking his ego, but all along would really just want the prestige of the Malfoy name and Draco's money. Before the wedding, Harry would of course try to bed Lucius, because the only person Draco loves to talk about more than himself is his father.

Their marriage would be cold and loveless, and Harry would be helpless before Voldemort, because lord knows that Draco has no spine and would never stand up for his bride. Harry would end up dead as soon as Voldemort wished it, and the Dark Lord would rule Britain forever, or at least until Neville got fed up an shoved the sword of Gryffindor up his ass.

*** A Harry like that would never bother with the Stone. Voldemort would be stuck in front of the Mirror and neutralized by Dumbledore. Lucius Malfoy slowly but surely took over the Ministry, until fem!Harry conned Draco and murdered them all.

Fem!Harry would be that horrible dark lady type person ruling a dystopian Magical Britain.
