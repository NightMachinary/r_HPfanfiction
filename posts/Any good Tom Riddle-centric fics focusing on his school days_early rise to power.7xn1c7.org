I wanna see a tiny Tom Slytherinning his way into power, manipulating people, gathering the proto-Death Eaters, finding out about his heritage, stuff like that. Just his awesome (and angsty, maybe?) descent into darkness.

Canon compliance is cool, but not necessary

My favorite Tom Riddle fanfiction. It shows Tom as what we would expect almost in his early years and gives a human edge to him before it's killed into his official transition to Lord Voldemort.

** linkffn(their verdict of vagaries) If you don't mind slash, this here has a Voldemort's rise to power from the beginning till the end. I remember it having a very good look at Tom's character, no sugar coating at all.

*** I started reading this one, and I /wanted/ to like it, but I just couldn't go further than a few chapters. I mean... Harry says that he was sorted into Slytherin because /he became a worse person/ (AKA all Slyhtherins are Evil, and not, you know /cunning and ambitious/?) and the Slytherins don't even bat an eyelash to Harry's stealing (which, ok, he only talked to the Death Eaters, so that might be why). I could even accept that and every bad thing Harry says about snake house, since he basically admits that he was taught to be biased against all Slytherins, but... The Slytherins hiss in displeasure. That's a thing that they do. They /hiss/ when they disagree with something and Harry acts like that's a normal people thing to do, if you're a Slytherin. I mean, if Tom Riddle hissed when he was about that get dangerously angry, that would be one thing, because he's a parselmouth, but the other snakes? /Noooooooo/...

So, anyway, I actually really liked the story, specially the portrayal of Tom's character, but the third time a Slytherin hissed at Harry, I just... I couldn't.

**** I actually don't remember the hissing part, maybe it was figurative? I don't know. But I agree, the whole Slytherin house hissing at each other is kind of ridiculous.

It has been a while since I've read it and I am kind of reluctant to reread it because I might find lots of faults in it. Perhaps it hasn't aged well... At the time I considered it one of the best takes on "harry going dark", since it's done very gradually and consistent with the things that happen to him.

Sorry, it didn't work for you.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.
