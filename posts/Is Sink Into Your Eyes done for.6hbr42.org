I've been getting error 502, bad gateway, since yesterday. The site is at siye.co.uk. I've seen it down like that before but it's only lasted a few hours. Anyone know anything about it?


** I do know the person that owns it, I'll see if I can find them. It's been years since I talked to him, so I'm 50/50 on if I still have his email or not. (If I do, it's probably his siye mail anyway, which lowers the odds extensively.)

Used to be one of the submission approval people there, and it got to where even a few years ago people didn't want to do it, I'd log in to a queue of 50+ chapters that had been waiting a week or more to be approved.

I wouldn't be shocked if they just got tired of their whole vetting system and let it go.

*** Thanks for being a key part of making SIYE good.

People always underestimate how much work it is to moderate.

**** Sadly I don't have any of his old emails, I must have cleaned them out.

Edit: No more submission queues, goes to show how long it's been since I've been there.

*** They seemed to have been getting back on their feet and I just finished a story over the weekend so I don't know if they have truly been down for a week. Maybe I was just seeing cached versions of the site? The only hope I have is the hosting company/servers just had a bad malfunction and are coming back up eventually.

** That's a shame. It was the first site I started posting my stories on. All were completely dreadful tho lol. I logged on a few months ago randomly I think and was amazed that it was still up even then.

*** Any of them completed? I might have read them if they were. I had a rough patch in my life about 3 years ago and all I did was binge through as many of the stories on there as I could.
