As I am trying to improve my knowledge of this language, I'd like to read some good ff stories in German. I know my chances are low, but I thought I'd give it a shot. Does anyone has any recommendations?


** Wouldn't it be better to buy the books in German? Especially the first two as they're children novels and should be easier to understand.

*** This is somewhat of a misconception. Children's literature often uses complex structures because it's still aimed at native speakers. It also tends to include vocabulary which the learner is unlikely to have come across elsewhere - palace, dragon, and such like.

Fanfiction also has the advantage that you can instantly copy and paste words into a translation site without having to type them. (A browser add on quickly gets around the ff.net restriction. )

**** Fanfiction also has the distinct disadvantage of not being proofread by a professional. So if the OP wants the read German fics to learn the language, published books might be his/her best option.

Concerning your request OP, I tried reading German fanfics a while ago, but didn't like anything I found - mostly because I just didn't like the writing style. This is one exception I remember: linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1168683/chapters/2377391]])

Summary (translation):

#+begin_quote
  Accused of murder and treason, Harry is allowed to see one last visitor before the judgement is delivered. To everybody's surprise, Harry wants to see his old classmate Neville, a clumsy young man, who would prefer to live his life in peace. In his cell in Azkaban Harry tells Neville a story of betrayal, sorrow, hatred - and a destructive possession, that made him into the person England has him pegged as: a monster.

#+begin_quote
  Angeklagt als Mörder und Verräter wird Harry vor Verkündung seines Urteils ein letzter Besucher gewährt. Zur Überraschung aller entscheidet er sich für seinen alten Klassenkameraden Neville, einen tollpatschigen, jungen Mann, der eigentlich nur in aller Ruhe sein Leben leben möchte. In seiner Zelle in Askaban erzählt Harry diesem eine Geschichte über Verrat, Trauer, Hass -- und einer zerstörerischen Besessenheit, die ihn zu dem machte, als was ihn ganz England abgestempelt hat: zu einen Monster.

***** Caffeine_lights is right. I have PS/SS at home (in German), and it's annoying to have to look up words or sentences in a dictionnary. To Lukc, I'm certainly intrigued by the introduction of "Footsteps in the Rain" so I'll put it on the list. Danke!

** Any discussion of HP Fanfiction in German has to include [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYoHTlZH2Gs][Harry Potter and a Stone]], the fan dub by Coldmirror.

Previously mentioned by [[/u/fan-f-fan]] earlier [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/3tlr4w/original_deviations_from_canon/cx7hlmk][(link)]]:

#+begin_quote
  The greatest changes however all take place in the very famous German Harry Potter fanvideos by coldmirror (those are famous like crazy, ask any German who ever used youtube, good chance he saw those). Those vids are a bit politically incorrect and have a very crack-vibe to it, but I'll just list a few changes:

  - Harry's Parents actually did die while drunk driving, and Harry often has flashbacks to the scene where you see the green light from the AK flashing out of the window of their house, just that this time the scene is on repeat and with loud techno music, showing us how fucking hammered the parents must've been.

  - Voldemort didn't like Harry for absolutely no reason, and decided to throw a rock at him, giving him his 'famous' scar.

  - the philosphers stone is just a normal stone, which harry wants so he can throw it back at voldemort

  - Dumbledore puts Harry down on the steps of the dursleys and then rings the bell like 20 times and the quickly runs away, giggling like a schoolgirl.

  - Gilderoy Lockhart is a pornstar, who now has to teach math (which is why noone likes him).

  - Draco calls Hermione stupid, which she finds so incredibly offensive, that they even have to visit Hagridnto calm her down

  - Ron's wand never broke, he simply saw too much McGyver and tried to improve it using ducttape and stuff

  - The golden trio enters this phase where they think opposing adults makes you cool, so they start using really shitty insults towards McGonnegall, until she finally acknowledges them and gives them street-cred by deducting half a point fornimproper behaviour.

  - Harry Potter never actually does any magic

  - Wood isn't the quidditch captain, instead he's the owner of the infomercial station “Wood's super duper shop“ where he sells quidditch supplies and other things that noone really needs

  - Harry solves the translation-problems between him and the snake simply by opening the DVD-menu and activating subtitles

  - rita skeeter is not only a journalist, but also works for an insurance company, which is why all her interviews so quickly derail towards the certain death of harry potter: she wants to sell him life insurance

  - Cedric Diggory is literally “the guy who dies at the end“, and his father actually warns Harry not to befriend him too much, to prevent disapointment later on

  - Tom Riddle influenced Dumbledore to try to get closer to his students by becoming a rapper

  And my personal favourite:

  - neville receives a stupid ball of plastic from a cereal box as birthday-gift from his grandma

It generally sounds hilarious, though the english subbed version (linked) of the german dub seems to lose something in translation. Seems to be like a more crackfic-ey fic in the same realm as Wizard People, Dear Reader.

** Welp the one ff in german that appatently received the most praise was: [[https://www.fanfiktion.de/s/4d1c99d900014060067007d0/1/When-Hermione-Fights]]

Hermoine fights back with a lot of unessary sex scenes.

I think there about 40k german ffs so if you could be a bit more specific about the fic you look for I might be able to help you out.

*** Well I don't mind sex scenes, unnecessary or not. I liked Hermione as a character in the books, so I'm definitely gonna check this one out! Thanks! If you know any other stories, I'm not looking for a specific fic, but if you have any German DH fics, I'd love to read them, thanks!.

** Some times I read stories in French to try and expand my grasp on the language. Unfortunately I usually have to use chrome's translate function and reread it because I miss out on some of the intricacies. It has helped me a lot with reading french (not so much hearing it spoken). Good luck!
