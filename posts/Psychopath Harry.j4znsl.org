Looking for fanfictions where Harry is like Hannibal Lecter. A Psychopath


** Hadrian Lector: Becoming by Savya398 is one AU crossover of Hannibal where Harry becomes a wendigo after being â€˜rescued' by Hannibal and when he turns 18 he decides to play a game with the Wizarding World. Very dark minded Harry, but sadly unfinished/not updating recently. (Sorry don't know how to do the link thing)

#+begin_quote
  Revenge is the misguided attempt to transform shame and pain into pride. Being forsaken and neglected, ignored and forgotten, revenge seems a fairly competent obligation. Good thing he's going to make his brother pay. Dark!Harry! Slytherin!Harry! WrongBoyWhoLived.
