Been having difficulty finding long fics to really sink my teeth into lately. Looking for well written, long, het Harry-centric, action oriented fics, but slash and other genres are fine if you consider them a must read sort of fic.

Deviation from Canon is also fine, I'm not too fussed about the level of au-ness either.

Cheers in advance


** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13438181/1/The-Arcanist-Unspeakable-Mysteries][The Arcanist: Unspeakable Mysteries]] is a fic with different finds of magic and a pretty good Mentor/Student relationship from Albus.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12511998/1/Wind-Shear][Wind Shear]] is a time travel with a good bit of action but has Harry/Bellatrix which isn't everyone's cup of tea .

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2567419/1/Harry-Potter-And-The-Summer-Of-Change][Harry Potter and the Summer of Change]] is a Unspeakable! Harry with a Harry/Tonks Romance

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12848494/1/Atonement][Atonement]] is a fic where Harry has to learn how to deal with the responsibility given to him by Dumbledore.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13540876/1/A-Simple-Act-of-Vengeance][A simple act of vengeance]] is a very good fic with sequel being written.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13182638/1/Who-Dares-Wins][Who dares wins]] is a fic where Harry gets taught by a military officer while at privet drive. Harry/Susan

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/755028][Of a Linear Circle by Flamethrower]] is a long, juicy story with a lot of plot and twists and build up and cunning. I'd highly recommend it. It is slash but it's not a romance story so the pairings are not the focus.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2488754/1/A-Second-Chance-at-Life][a second chance at life]] by Miranda Flairgold. When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic. Nice and long. Complete but has an unfinished sequel.

** The longest series I follow starts with The Pureblood Pretense. It's a female Harry in a world where Tom Riddle went into politics instead of terrorism, leaving many more people alive but legally entrenching segregation and discrimination against non-Purebloods. There are a few possible pairings hinted at, but Harry doesn't really have time for romance - and there isn't anyone except her cousin (more of a brother) whom she trusts with all her secrets. Book four is nearly complete, over 1.3M words thus far.

Second longest is probably the Innocent series by MarauderLover7. Sirius accidentally escapes five years early and takes eight-year-old Harry away from the Dursleys. It's sweet to see Harry get a real parental figure, albeit flawed, but Voldemort is proving to be as dangerous as ever. No established pairing, but quite an interesting fake dating subplot during the Tournament. Book five is in progress.
