Personally here's what I've picked and some explanation for it:

Jacob Sirius Potter- Was originally James Sirius but I changed James to Jacob.

Percival Cedric Potter - A smaller less obvious nod to Dumbledore and I think Harry would want to name a kid after Cedric.

Ruby Luna Potter - Ruby for Hagrid Luna for Luna and Lupin. I like Lily Luna I just thought it was odd to name siblings after a married couple so I changed it to Ruby.

Edit: Will edit as I change the names.


** I don't like any of the Potter kid's names in canon. There are times when naming your kid after a dead relative is fine, but in this context it's creepy. Harry spends his entire life in his parents' shadow, and then he passes that on to his kids? Best case scenario, "you're really living up to your grandfather's legacy"? Plus, of the six names their children have, Ginny picked one. Bull.

Quoting myself: I noticed a trend in canon. Every time we know the middle name of a magic-born child, their middle name is the first name of a relative. For the firstborns of a gender, it's the parent of that gender: Harry James, 1st son of James. William Arthur, 1st son of Arthur. Ginevra Molly, 1st daughter of Molly. Draco Lucius, 1st son of Lucius. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian, 1st son of Percival.

For non-firstborns, it's the name of some other relative. Regulus Arcturus, 2nd son, grandson of Arcturus. Percy Ignatius, 3rd son, nephew of Ignatius. Ronald Bilius, 6th son, nephew of Bilius.

The only exception is Tom Marvolo. (Remus J. Lupin has neither a middle name nor a known father's name in the books, only in extended canon.)

So, I take this as magical tradition. I think Ginny would want to stay with the pattern she's known all her life and I think Harry would be thrilled to learn there's a family pattern his name fits into and his kids could fit into.

Therefore, I headcanon their kids as Random-name Harry, Random-name Sirius (or James, Arthur, or Ronald), and Random-name Ginevra. Given the naming trends of the Potters and Weasleys (typical British names, rather than constellations or Roman emperors), I'd say something like:

Stephen Harry Potter

Edward Sirius Potter

Elizabeth Ginevra Potter

*** Yeah I agree about not liking Harry's kids names. I always thought he was either putting the kids under a lot of pressure or in the case of Albus Serverus signing them up for a lot of bullying. After thinking about it more I might change them again before I finish my fic. I wanted to give Harry's kids original first names (or at least ones that weren't really obvious like they are in canon) but I wasn't sure if people would like it.

Not sure about this part. The kid goes by "Al," which is super normal. "Albus" isn't out there for Hogwarts, especially when he goes to school with a kid named "Scorpius," and how many people know somebody's middle name?

***** For the middle name I was thinking that James and his family who would know his middle name (at least close family) would have picked on him more for that and James would have probably told other students. Albus I assumed was very obviously supposed to be related to Dumbledore but I could see how it might not be that different for the wizarding world. They do names very differently.

Well, the kids in the epilogue are shown being so ignorant about Harry's fame that they ask why everyone's staring in their direction and Ron jokes he's famous, so I don't think they would really know stories of Snape. Is "Severus" inherently more funny sounding than "Sirius"? Eh. Victoire and Teddy are much older, so I don't think they would be bullies, and the kids younger than Al probably wouldn't bully him.

I really don't think other students would care even if James Sirius told them Al's middle name either. He kind of sounds like a jerk. I know he makes fun of Al being sorted into Slytherin in the epilogue, and maybe he'd use the middle name as proof Al's going to be a Slytherin, but I see a lot of nextgen fics with James Sirius as a one-dimensional bully and prankster. The exceptions to that rule really stand out. Not trying to dictate how you write your fic, but I like to see all the nextgen kids get unique and well-developed personalities.

******* James (or Jacob as I'll probably name him) is definitely gonna be interesting to write. I'm not exactly sure what I'm gonna do with his character but I definitely think he's gonna be a good guy in the end. I've been considering having him start as a bit of a jerk and not really involved then have him eventually turn around if he realizes his siblings are in trouble and slytherins not all bad or something like that.

******** That's cool. One thing that gets overlooked when people complain about the names of Harry's kids is that it wasn't just recycled names, but recycled looks and personalities too. Of course James Sirius is the bully-prankster with black hair, brown eyes, and glasses; Albus Severus is a quieter, lonelier Slytherin with Lily's green eyes; Lily Luna is the only one to get red hair, and, just like Ginny, is jealous she has to wait to go to Hogwarts (or, just like Lily, gets no personality while her brothers inherit the Map and Invisibility Cloak). I wish it was mixed up a little more.

Archie Frederick Potter: Archie means bold/brave, “a” for Albus, “ar” for Arthur, middle name for Fred

Percival is a nod to Dumbledore using his middle name and is also kinda a nod to the Weasleys cause well Percy. Cedric because I think Harry would want the name to live on and a way to remember one of the first victims of the second wizarding world. In my AU Fred survives (haven't planned exactly how though) so Harry would be less likely to name a kid after him in that situation but Fredrick would make a good middle name for Harry's kids.

A few years on and 'James and Lily Potter' are his children, and his parents don't even have their names to remember them by. Also it is frankly quite a creepy level of almost ancestor worship in using them for all of your children's names.

I can see Harry insisting on Sirius or Lily as a middle name at most, but not this whole mess of dead person jenga. Besides, one of the communal-fever-dream-children's name is a combination of the two people who raised him to be a suicidal child soldier.

Other than that, as someone else has mentioned, the middle names should be based on the parents' names for the firstborn of each gender, and then relatives or close friends for the other children.

Like, say, Evander Harry Potter for Harry's firstborn son and Jasmine Ginerva Potter for their firstborn girl.

*** I like Evander I've never heard that before might use it for another character. It's odd that Jasmine has little if any relations to Harry Potter yet I think it's been mentioned twice not a bad thing it's a great name it's just odd that it happened more than once.

**** A lot of people use Jasmine as fem!Harry's name in fanfiction quite a bit. Probably since it's both the name of a flower and it's similar to the name James. A lot of people tend to stay in the trend of flower names for girls and I'm presonally fond of using classic English names for the boys (not that Evander counts for that, mind). I figured that since a lot of James's ancestors had the name Henry, that I'd use that, and William after Ginny's favourite brother.

** Of the canon names of Harry and Ginny's children, the only one I really /like/ is Lily Luna - Lily's sacrifice does need to be honored, and I happen to think naming a child after a mutual friend is sweet. Plus, alliteration.

Other than that, I'd almost consider some of the crack names from "101 Names We Could Have Used" ( linkffn(12542863) ) to be outright better than Albus Severus. There's a few of them in there that'd be on-brand for Harry and Ginny to joke about at some point (but obviously not to actually /consider/).

I'd like to think that they'd be more creative than to just pull the names of dead people out of a hat, and also that Ginny would get more say in things (seriously, both James Sirius and Albus Severus show worrying signs of Harry picking all the names).

  101 names and the logic behind them that Harry and Ginny could have used, because if there's one thing most of the fandom agrees on, it's that Albus Severus Potter was a horrible name for Harry's second child. Names are Sirius, serious, and silly. *Complete*

** This tumblr post makes an amazing point! [[https://hunnybunchesofgoats.tumblr.com/post/128855669157/do-you-know-what-its-like-to-be-named-for-the]]

I feel bad for all of the children, being named for flawed people and not able to escape the expectations of your forefathers must be horrible.

James Sirius - named for bullies and reckless idots who let Harry down multiple times. While James and Sirius were both brave and amazing people they had their flaws and cast big shadows as war heroes. Whenver I see James written hes always a carbon copy of the original James and Sirius. Ladies man, loves pranks, a bit arrogant, a bit cruel.

Lily Luna - named for a woman long dead who sacrificed her life for her son. Named after the wife to her brothers namesake which is weird and a bit creepy imo. She seemed to be coded as the og Lily in fics. Fire-y, brash, warm, but scary.

Albus Severus - I feel really bad for him. Named for 2 complex and morally grey men who sacrificed themselves and others for a cause. Coded as neither of them in fic thank the lord. But is it coincidence that the only character named after a slytherin in the one who often goes there? I think not.

The only one im fine with is Luna tbh. Its an honour to be her namesake, shes also coincidentally the only one alive.

** Ok, to be honest, I've never really thought of their names /that/ much. I actually like them, as in if there wasn't other people named James, Sirius, Albus, Severus, Lily, and Luna, and Harry and Ginny named their kids what they named them, then their names would be cool. However, since we're talking about meaning and the like, I think that yes, these are horrible names for their children. I myself wouldn't ever want to be named after some dead person I never knew.

I don't know what I would name them if I could. I like everybody else's suggestions.

Also, ever since I read this fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4396574/1/The-Wendell-That-Wasn-t]] , I've had the head cannon where Ginny is the one who named all of their children. And since that probably isn't true at all, I have another: Harry James Potter is horrible at names, so he decided to use some of the ones he already knows. Bonus is that he gets to "honor the dead".

** Okay, this is going to be a looong rant.

I absolutely hate the canon names. The kids have no individually and their personalities are flat and predictable. Plus I imagine there'd be a lot of kids named James, Lily, Albus, Percival, Brian, Wulfric, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Neville in the next generation.

I like all of your ideas, but I'd do Brian instead of Percival. It's more common like Jacob and Ruby. And don't be afraid of giving Harry and Ginny more kids! JKR modeled the Potter kids after her own family but I always thought Harry would want a bigger family, maybe 5 kids.

Another idea is to use normal first names and an honor middle name. I.e., Daniel James, Patrick Sirius, etc.

No one in their right mind would name their child after Snape, except maybe Draco. However, Draco should've been in prison for the first ten years after the war. Scorpius would've been born post-2008, likely ~2012 and about the same age as Lorcan and Lysander Scamander.

Speaking of the timeline, I think the canon one is horrible. Using the birthdays of JKR's kids, JSP is born March 22, 2004 (David); ASP is born July 27, 2005 (Jessica; her father and JKR's ex-husband is a strong basis for Snape's redemption arc); and LLP is born January 23, 2007 (Mackenzie). This means that Ginny played Quidditch from July 2000, when she graduated, to July 2003, when she would have realized she was pregnant with James. That's only three years. The average career for a professional sports player is 8 years. I think Ginny would've played until she was at least 25, so her /first/ kid would've been born in 2007.

Okay, that's my rant of the day.

*** Yeah I'm definitely messing up the timeline a bit especially since I'm having them start hogwarts around 2020 though I probably won't include the pandemic or any current politics because let's be honest unless it's a specific AU that would really mess up the fic and it's not related to the story. I picked percival as a nod to both Ginnys brother (who in my AU saves Fred from death so he's a bit more important) and Albus and it just sounds cool so I think I'm gonna keep it but I was considering Brian for awhile. I never considered giving Harry more kids but now I might do that since I'm giving other characters more/less kids in different ages from their canon and whatever else I'm changing. I absolutely agree that the names take away from the kids individuality which is the main reason I changed them because I want original characters because that's what they should be and idk wtf Harry was thinking naming siblings after a married couple and the problem with Albus's name is obvious. Using middle names as honorary names does make more sense to me which is why Ive done it. The canon timeline is really confusing to me though part of that may be cause I never finished cursed child so I likely won't be following it at all. Nearly everything after the battle of hogwarts (and some things during the battle/7th book) should be different depending on how I plan it.

#+begin_quote
  I never finished cursed child
#+end_quote

Neither have I lol. I have no intention of ever finishing it.

But here's what we know of the canon timeline, so you can reference it:

- Late April 1998: Edward 'Teddy' Remus Lupin is born.

  - I personally place his DOB as April 21, 1998 because he and Victoire are the next Harry/Ginny, and Ginny's DOB is 1 year, 11 days after Harry's.

- May 2, 1998: Final Battle.
- May 2, 1999: Victoire Weasley is born to Bill and Fleur Weasley.

  - I place Dominique c. 2002 and Louis c. 2006. They're probably not the same age as Harry's kids because neither of them are mentioned in the Epilogue.

- July 2, 1999: Hermione graduates from Hogwarts.
- June 30, 2000: Ginny graduates from Hogwarts.
- December 26, 2002: Harry and Ginny get married.

  - This one isn't actually canon. It's based on JKR's own wedding anniversary.

- March 22, 2004: James Sirius Potter is born.
- July 27, 2005: Albus Severus Potter is born.

  - I place Rose's birthday as December 3, 2004. This is based on Ron's birthday, March 1. She's mentioned to look like Ron but in female form. I.e., she has a bit of individuality, unlike the Potter kids.
  - I place Scorpius' birthday as June 3, 2005 because he's meant to be Draco's clone.

- January 23, 2007: Lily Luna Potter is born.

  - I place Hugo's birthday as June 17, 2007, nine months after Hermione's.

- George is the only Weasley with children who /isn't/ mentioned in the Epilogue, so Fred and Roxanne were born post-2005.
- Percy /was/ mentioned. At least one of his daughters was born somewhere between 2000 and 2005. Molly and Lucy follow the naming pattern JKR uses for Fred and George, so they might be twins.

  - Obviously not the case in your story, but again, this is for reference.

- Luna and Rolf had children later than the others. If you accept JKR's writings on the Quidditch World Cup 2014 as canon, then Lorcan and Lysander were born after 2007 but before 2014.
- Neville married Hannah Abbott at some point. It's unknown if they have children, but none were mentioned in the Quidditch 2014 article.

***** Wow thanks for the timeline. I'm changing the kids ages around so most of them are at or close to going to hogwarts (though they probably will be in different years) to have most of them in the same school and because I forgot their canon ages. I'll definitely post about the fic when I publish it though I'm still planning so it'll probably be awhile. I don't have any intention on finishing cursed child either I know the basic story and that's enough for me. Honestly didn't know Scorpius was supposed to be a Draco clone that's kinda interesting always assumed scorpius to be the opposite of Draco for some reason not sure why.

****** Idk about Scorpius' personality, but the epilogue describes him as resembling 'Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry.' I.e., he likely has pale blond hair, a pointy face, and gray eyes. Canonically we don't know anything about James' appearance; Albus has unknown hair color (usually given black in fanfics, though), a thin face, and green eyes; and Lily has red hair.

That's another pet peeve of mine. I hate clones. Give the kids individual names, personalities, AND appearance.

You can give the kids some combination of:

- Hair: black, red, or brown/auburn as a middle ground
- Eyes: green (Harry), brown (Ginny), hazel (James/middle ground), or blue (we know Ron has blue eyes so it runs in the Weasley family)

  - A handy guide for kids' possible eye colors with green/brown parents:

    - Brown or hazel (50%)
    - Green (37.5%)
    - Blue (12.5%)
    - In a family of 3 children, 1 or 2 of them would have brown/hazel eyes; 1 of them would have green eyes; there's a /very/ small chance any of them would have blue eyes.
    - In a family of 5 children, 2 or 3 of them would have brown/hazel eyes; 1 or 2 of them would have green eyes; 1 of them /might/ have blue eyes.

I recommend against these combinations:

- Black hair/green eyes (Harry)
- Black hair/hazel eyes (James)
- Red hair/green eyes (Lily)
- Red hair/brown eyes (Ginny)

******** I think there should be one or two major differences, like Harry was with his dad.

This is my canon-compliant headcanon:

- JSP has brown eyes and a smattering of freckles but otherwise looks a lot like Harry. Light brown isn't far off from hazel, which is why I added the freckles. Also JSP with anything but black hair bothers me.
- ASP has light auburn hair and people genuinely forget he's a Potter, not a Weasley in name until they see his eyes. Once they know to look it for it, he's almost identical to Harry.
- LLP has hazel eyes and dark red hair. The red hair is canon, which makes it difficult to come up with a combination that doesn't resemble Ginny/Lily 1 too much. I've been toying with blue eyes for her, but it doesn't feel right.

Disregarding compliance, I have this headcanon for H/G's children:

- Jacob Sirius Potter: same as JSP.
- Brian Arthur Potter: red hair instead of auburn.
- Ruby Minerva Potter: dark auburn hair and brown eyes.

  - Remus has Teddy and Luna has Lorcan and Lysander, while Hagrid and Minerva have no children of their own. That's why I chose her name.

********* I definitely agree with Albus having auburn hair that was one of the first things I had decided when I started planning cause I didn't like how similar he looked or was usually described to Harry. I like giving dark red hair to Lily Luna I was considering making it black but red fits. Maybe I'll have her dye her part of her hair so she doesn't look too close to Ginny and give her a different style. James Sirius was the one I was having the most trouble with but I think I might give him freckles light brown eyes and black hair or something like that. Another characters appearance I want to change now is scorpius because I don't want to make him look too close to Draco either so I might go black hair instead of blonde or a darker blonde but I'm not sure.

If you give Neville/Hannah children, both of them have blond hair. We don't know their eye colors but I imagine Neville's as green (like Matthew Lewis) and Hannah's as brown (I think my inspiration for this came from fanart, but her actress has blue eyes).

Rolf Scamander is described as 'swarthy' in the Quidditch 2014 article, so I'd say he has tanner skin and dark hair. I imagine Lorcan and Lysander look a lot like him but have Luna's large silver eyes.

Pandora and Lysander are Greek names. Luna is Roman. Maybe other names with those origins? I think they would avoid direct namesakes, so no Frank Longbottom II but Lysander Frank is good. Also 'Girl-Alice, Girl-Pandora,' etc.

************** I've honestly never thought of Luna as a teacher, but now that you say it, I could see her being the professor for Care of Magical Creatures. In canon, she married a zoologist and she was good with the thestrels.

As for the names, maybe you could do it like Ron & Rose + Hermione & Hugo. Lysander Frank, Lorcan Pandora, and Nadine Alice. Boys names on girls promotes misogyny (it literally indicates girls can only get ahead if they act like men and suppress their feminine characteristics), but girls names on boys helps defeat sexism. Luna is just the type of person who'd break through that barrier.

(Sorry for the impromptu rant. My cousin just had a baby girl and I'm having to bite my tongue on the name.)

Would Harry be the DADA professor? I always thought he'd be better off teaching. In my headcanon, he retires from the Aurors in 2008, ten years after the war, and becomes a teacher. If you do something like that, be careful of having EVERYONE teaching at Hogwarts.

Side note: I also have Jacob born January 15, 2008. His birth gives Harry extra motivation to retire.
