The Last Stand at Osoweic Fortress is one of the most famous battles of the First World War, notable for The Charge of the Dead Men, where Russian soldiers charged at their German enemy, despite being on the fringe of death due to the Germans gassing the compound with various poison gasses, including Chlorine and Bromine. Unfortunately for the Germans, they had no idea their mixture, along with some vodka spilled on the floor during the attack, would create Inferni; sentient Inferni, in fact; the first of their kind. A new age had begun for the world, and Vladimir Kotlinsky and his men were in the middle of it.

well, I would dispute that (comparing to Verdun, Passchendaele, Somme, Caporetto, or Brusilov offensive), but still it is very cool history. Thank you.
