Can anyone recommend fics where Harry's given the Prefect position for his sixth year?


** Chapter 37 of Darklooshkin's "The random craziness file": Harry and Hermione become prefects. Harry thinks this is kind of being junior Aurors, and asks Moody to prepare them for the job. Hilarity ensues.

Good length, bit clichéd but it hits all the clichés head on so it's not bad. I really like it but it gets a fair bit of criticism.
