#+end_quote

I cannot, for the life of me, figure out what these "great things" (during the First War that are so widely known) could be?

Sure, we readers know of some things but what would Ollivander have heard of? I don't imagine he means “dude killed people,” and I'm sure Voldemort would argue he's far above some common criminal.

It's said vaguely else where that Riddle stretched the limits of magic... any ideas what this could mean? I'd put it down to early installment weirdness but similar things are repeated up until HBP.

Edited to explain more

**** He created more than one horcrux, a feat throught to be umpossible, unthinkable. His mastery of the mind arts was so great he was able to tell when someone was lying just by looking at them, unless they were some of the best occlumens possible. His magical power was so strong that he could go against the greatest wizard of the century, Albus Dumbledore, armed with the strongest wand in existence, the Elder Wand... And tie.

Not to mention his strategic planning allowed him to overthrow the government, twice, he put a taboo on his name, /twice/, and managed to rally almost all the dark creatures to his cause. */Twice/*.

From dementors to werewolves to vampires, giants and trolls, everything joined him. That means that he was far from a dumbass when it came to leading his troups.

***** The problem is that no one knows about these things because he's kept them a secret on purpose. It's not simply Harry having a limited POV.

Who knows about Horcruxes during the 1st war: no one. 2nd war? Dumbledore, Harry, Ron, Hermione- and they don't tell anyone. Voldemort certainly keeps that /locked down/ or kills anyone with the slightest whiff (Slughorn) of knowledge

Legilimency/Occlumency- who is confirmed to know this? Dumbledore, Snape, Harry (maybe Sirius?). No one else ever mentions Voldemort's proficiency with mind arts, and it's always couched in terms of Harry/Voldemort's mental connection.

No one knows about the Elder Wand

Overthrows the government- certainly

Has creatures/beings on his side and is intelligent- certainly

But both of those were accomplished, much more successfully, by Grindelwald across a continent scale within living memory.

Led a revolution is an incredible achievement, but it's not really “stretching the laws of magic to breaking/one of the greatest most powerful sorcerer's alive” kind of achievement.

**** In a nutshell: he wasn't, regardless of the average Brit's view.

There's a reason he was ignored by the ICW. Grindelwald was part of a world war. Voldemort was little more than an insurrectionist for one small nation.

It's why it boggles my mind how often people act like Voldemort would have totally ruled the world if not stopped. The only reason he went as far as he did is part of the ruling body of Britain agreed with him. Moles in the aurors told him where raids would be. Legislation supported him. And so on.

He'd have been overwhelmed the instant he really left Britain, if he'd tried, really.

People love, regardless of country, making their home-grown heroes or villains 'extra'.

Certainly speaks to society wide institutional corruption, but it just seems terribly overblown then if that's all there is to it. It's insidious but it's not paradigm shifting.

It's certainly believable that Riddle is an incredible wizard, Dumbledore talks about how he knew/accomplished things he couldn't do.

But I do wish we were /shown/ some of these things (that the Wizarding world presumably knew of during the First World War) instead of simply /told/.

Remember, Beauxbatons for example had a half-giant Headmistress and accepted Veela as students. I just cannot see Hogwarts doing the same. In general, Britain's society seems far more insular and bigoted than continental Europe's, at least in general - from what we see in the books and from what Rowling has said in supplemental works.

Voldemort's 'Pureblood mania' rhetoric would not have gotten him anywhere near enough following to work for him in Europe like it did in Britain.

That's not true. While Beauxbatons is certainly more open minded, there is always the point that Madame Maxime panicked when her status as halfbreed was in the opening. There has to be discrimination there too or she wouldn't have reacted like that.

And then we have Durmstrang. We don't know where it is located but it seems that it has a pretty large recrutement area. We know that Victor Krum from Bulgaria and Gellert Grindelwald from Austria (assuming he was from there because he built Nurmengard there) were both there. We also know that they are in the North. Neither Austria nor Bulgaria are northern countries - Austria is central europe, Bulgaria is one of the most southern countries in east europe. So we can assume they have students from middle to east to north europe - which would make them the biggest of the three schools... if it weren't for the fact that they don't take muggleborns. That's not openminded.

We also have to remember that the US is even more restricted in their muggle policies.

For all we know Britain is central if not progessive.

An important thing to remember here is that Maxine is a fully-accomplished witch. She has the skills to fight giants with magic instead of fists.

I think he would be fairly powerful. He was able to do a part-human transfiguration wordless. Krum also did a part-human transfiguration and was highly priced for it. Harry didn't learn human transfiguration during the first five years and only the first steps in six years. So part-human transfiguration is at least seventh year NEWT-stuff. And Hagrid did it without formal education.

***** Well Voldemort was not really flashy, unlike Grindelwald. In fact he was said to be extremely secretive even in his youth. In canon he doesn't send his Death Eaters on raids or something like that... people just disappear and that was a common theme during the first war too according to Sirius. When he returns no one but the Death Eaters are supposed to know, when he attempts to get the prophecy he mostly stays quiet, when he takes over the government he doesn't really place himself in any position of power but in fact lets people live in uncertainty and fear. So I think that the last thing he wanted was for the ICW to acknowledge his threat.

His main danger, frankly, would be exposing the Wizarding World to the Muggles. Not being a bugaboo who conquers the world.

I mean, even with the horcruxes, he needs someone to help him. Quirrel let him possess him and he was out of the action for /ten/ years up to that point. He needed Peter to do the ritual in the graveyard.

Deal with his minons strictly and even WITH horcruxes, he'd be a powerless floating wraith. Not fun.

We even know for fact that Dumbledore used extra enchantments on top of the usual ministry ones to prevent the DE from fleeing - so Voldemort doesn't only punches through the ministry ones but also those from Dumbledore, and he takes Bellatrix with him, when it is stated that side-by-side is more difficult than doing it alone. And he does all that after a fight with Dumbledore. I think that gives us a pretty clear picture about how incredible powerful he is.

Tom Riddle is just about as close to an equal as you can get to Albus Dumbledore and he did things with a wand that /stunned/ the examiners.

So maybe Riddle experiments a bit and shows off grand magic before he goes off the deep end.

And Ollivander searches for his ingredients himself. It's not out of the question he's privy to information that others are not. He may well have encountered Tom in Albania, or elsewhere.

*** That's definitely a really impressive list, it's just half of these things don't happen publicly/are secret (Horcruxes, never takes credit for COS, possession) and the “dark arts” is incredibly vague.

Fiendfyre is certainly impressive, but I think the only mentioned time is in the ministry against Dumbledore (with only Harry as witness)

It just seems with Grindelwald in living memory, why is Voldemort the /big bad/? I'm writing a Tom Riddle centered story, and really trying to figure it out because his character seems disturbingly... empty during the first war/rise to power

** I think that it's just that TMR was an exceptionally powerful wizard-a right prodigy, and the strides he made in magic is incredible, despite his orphan status. I will never condone what he did and I can freely acknowledge Voldemort is irredeemable but the things he acomplished, especially as a poor orphan ‘Muggleborn' was remarkable, and I am not one to deny credit where it's due

*** The problem is that no one knows Voldemort's real identity, it's a deeply hidden secret, so he can't claim widespread credit for this accomplishment. So the public has no possible way of knowing

** The guy created more than one Horcrux. They guy could possess people on a whim. The guy could break into your mind while being in the shape of a fetus. The guy came back from the dead with a potion invented by himself. The guy stood toe to toe with the man considered the most powerful wizard of that time while wielding the most powerful wand and the duel ended up in a draw. We don't have much more other information but keeping in mind the Weasley twins' statement that the average wizard could not cast a shield charm... that's pretty impressive.

** He made seven horcruxes. SEVEN! And still died before the weird deadly-animal-obsessed kid he framed for murder in highschool.

Thats a pretty great accomplishment, technically, but pretty terrible in the greater scheme of things.

*** No one knows about the Horcruxes, Voldemort is actively trying to murder anyone who even has a whiff of them. None of the public know so he can't take credit, and no one knows he opened the chamber either because he couldn't take credit.

** I have a head cannon about that lighting bolt thing he conjured after getting the Elder Wand. We all know that Muggle tech does not work around magic... Well if we apply the Dresden effect of tech, right around WW1 or WW2. don't remember thats when Electricity was really going in muggle tech. Maybe its not the fact that it's muggle tech. But maybe magic and electricity cancel each other out. Sort of a Base/Acid effect. So maybe the idea of conjuring and controlling something that is anti-magic in it's nature with Magic is a really impressive thing.
