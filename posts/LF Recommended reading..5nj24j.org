I rarely do LF threads /anywhere/ because I'm usually stubborn enough to find what I'm looking for eventually anyway. But in this case I feel like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel.

I just waded my way through Darth Marrs' works. I've exhausted my ability to reread jeconais, I've done to death classic authors like muggledad and classic fics like vox corporis. I've thoroughly enjoyed niche fics like blindness, Behind Blue Eyes (Harry/Catherine Earl (OC)). So on and so forth. I feel like I've run out of decent, well written, and engaging fics to read. There are plenty of recommendations out there, but I've got a few criteria, as most people do.

-> I rarely enjoy Harry/Ginny. Typically because I very rarely find a fic where Ginny is anything but a badass, or at least a total gryff who runs into battle at the drop of a hat. Oft times I prefer to read fics where Harry's partner is an emotional support, rather than a combative one. And to me Ginny as a fighter has always seemed either generic or forced, depending on the writer. If you can recommend a fic where she isn't a fighter, or it's done tastefully and not done in a tropy manner then I'll look into it.

-> No slash. That's no female slash, or male slash. Not into it.

-> Preferably no multiple partners. I grew out of that a while ago, I can tolerate it if it's written well, or not focused around sex. But the whole harem fic thing has gotten old, did when I was 16

-> Mature writing, not strictly sex, just... grit I guess. M rating is a minimum, and it needs to use it.

-> A decent amount of world building, or alternate plot. I've read plenty of recounts of canon with a different pairing or perspective.

-> Harry centric, or at least with Harry being part of the main pairing. (And a pairing really is essential)

-> I prefer long fics. My ideal length is 200K+ words but I understand good fics of that length are few and far between. I'll read just about anything mind, even if it's trash. I probably just won't enjoy it much.

NB: I read a LOT of fanfiction, I go through 100K+ word fics every other day or so. I most only read HP fanfiction so I've read what feels like the best the community has to offer.

That's about it really. If this seems a little greedy to beg for such delicious grains of fic among the roughage I'll do my part by reccing a fic I read recently; linkffn(I Still haven't found what I'm looking for by kathryn518)

It's a HP/Star Wars crossover that kicks off with Ahsoka Tano meeting Harry in a Coruscant bar (SPOILERS FOR THE LAST SEASON OF CLONE WARS ANIMATED SERIES) directly after leaving the jedi council after her trial.(/spoilers) there's a lot of discussion of how the Jedi Order is corrupt/useless as hell and Harry is a total BAMF, the real strength of the story is, as always, in the characters who are relatively IC yet believably evolve as people through the (still WIP) story. Definitely recommend a read, especially if you're a fan of the animated series of Star Wars. (Either of them really Ahsoka is a badass in both of them.)

Anyhoo... done I guess. Don't worry about trying to pick particularly obscure stories, just flood this thread with any you can think of that might be good, try not to repeat what others have recommended though, and I'll read through anything I haven't already done so, even if it doesn't strictly match my criteria. Unless it's slash. I abhor slash.

Cheers, LGreymark.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) is fun.

Linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) also fits your criteria.

Maybe also linkffn(Honour Thy Blood) for a bit of different flavour.

Err... I would also recommend linkffn(The Pureblood Pretense) which might read like slash but only because there's a girl impersonating a boy. It's the only fic with anything slashy in at all that I can read because I normally don't like it but the writing is just too good. And it's sequels are brilliant as well.

Linkffn(Contractual Invalidation; The Relucant Champion; Days to Come) are all good Haphne fics.

Linkffn(Amalgum -- Lockhart's Folly) doesn't have a main pairing but is worth reading just for fun.

Linkffn(The Closer You Look) should make you laugh and linkffn(Grow Young with Me) is a slow paced bit of fluff that you might not have seen.

And finally, linkffn(Muggle-Raised Champion) is complete and a bit interesting.

Any in there that you hadn't read?

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

  The day before Harry Potter was due to go to Hogwarts for the very first time, his aunt and uncle informed him that he wouldn't be going. Instead, he was sent to Stonewall High. Now, three years later, the Goblet of Fire has named him as a TriWizard Champion. What that means is anyone's guess, but to Harry, one thing is clear: he can finally get away from Privet Drive.

*** I just finished reading the latest chapter of Honor Thy Blood, which has been great thus far. Very neat portrayal of Abraxus. Grow Young With me started great but has slowed down somewhat. The author seems to be procrastinating the writing of actual plot movers and is filling the chapters with filler. I hope that improves soon. I tried to read HP and the Prince of Slytherin when it first came out but something interrupted m and I never got back to it, thanks for reminding me. The rest are fresh, it's worth noting I guess that despite the amount of reading I do the Fanfic community is unimaginably vast. It's nice to see there's still decent length fics I haven't stumbled upon yet.

EDIT: Contractual invalidation was a lot of fun the first time I read through it but I can't bring myself to reread.

** "Divided and Entwined", linkffn(11910994), is very AU after Year 4. Hermione became a resistance leader after Year 5, and things got really bloody in magial Britain. Dumbledore was strong, and Voldemort was very scary.

"Strangers at Drakeshaugh", linkffn(6331126), is a canon-compliant postwar fic. Very well written Ginny here.

"The Sum of Their Parts", linkffn(11858167), is my favorite AU postwar fic. The establishment betrayed Harry and Co again, and they decided to overthrow the old regime, by ANY MEANS necessary.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** Well, there's “Seventh Horcrux” but I think it's a classic and as such you'd probably already read it so I won't link it (not like it's hard to find).

Other than that, well ... “Hell Eyes” (linkffn(2686394)) is quite nice and has great world-building; “The Shadow of Angmar” (linkffn(11115934)), though unfinished, is a good read too; “Renegade Cause” (linkffn(4714715)) too is nice and fairly gritty at that although you might have already read it;

And that's it from me, I guess, mostly due to the “M or higher rating” one.

** I'm going to ignore the minimum rating thing, because my recs I'm fairly sure don't meet that. My two favorite fics are linkffn(Harry Potter and the Forest of Valbone) (which is essentially complete) and the WIP linkffn(Harry Potter and the Untitled Tome) by our very own [[/u/Ihateseatbelts]]. The former is a post-CoS fic that takes place during the summer that smartly expands on canon worldbuilding (and has what I think is the best enchanting in the fandom). The latter is a full-blown AU where Wizarding Society actually feels like a different culture than Muggle Society instead of canon's "Same yet barely Different" approach.

If dark is what you want, [[/u/ScottPress]]'s WIP linkffn(Lesser Evils) is actually dark and mature, unlike virtually every other dark!Harry fic.

** These are all Genfics, they seem like they are not recommended very often here, so I'm not sure if you've read them!

"Great Expectations" (linkffn(3980670)) is Harry/Ginny and deals with Ginny expecting for the second time with Albus, and dealing with Harry's job as an Auror. There's a plot here about Albus being special , but overall it's a good read focusing on the dynamics of Ginny's family and motherhood.

"Teddy Lupin and the Forest Guard" (linkffn(11251021)) follows Teddy's 1st year at Hogwarts. I really enjoyed the author's take on it, there's some mischief but it's not like there's a huge plot where Teddy has to save the world (like Harry had to!) But there are parallels between them, Harry had to struggle with being famous, and so did Teddy. There are other repercussions of the war too (Hogwarts reconstruction/rebuilding, few muggle born children, smallest class of Hogwarts). If you liked it, there are three more books detailing his 3rd, 5th and 7th year ... all drawing parallels as well to the canon books.
