:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I read a fanfic a while ago where Harry goes to a duelling championship, Sirius is alive and free and he meets a girl who is part Siren and her parents. Harry is not heavily affected by her charm, they start getting to know each other and date later on. I can't remember the name of said fanfic but the way it was written was amazing. I'd like to read it again so if you can help it'd be appreciated. Many thanks!!!

  Harry brought back Pettigrew at the end of the Third Task, changing the course of the war. With his godfather by his side, he learns the importance of having allies during turbulent times, even if they are unexpected. How will the Wizarding world react to this new, proactive Harry?
