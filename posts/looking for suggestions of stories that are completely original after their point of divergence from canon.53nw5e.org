So I started reading the Psychic Serpent Trilogy, and it being written before Ootp was even published means that we get an original fifth year story. That made for a very nice change from what I usually read.

I am looking for other such stories that are canon up to the point where the author picks up, but after that it is 100% thought up by him with no use of any crutches. For example, if the story starts at the end of the third year, everything canon after that point should not exist: no Tournament, no Umbridge in year five, not that prophecy we have read about 10^{n} times, no Slughorn, no horcruxes. The author makes his own story.

In essence I am looking for AU stories, but taken to the extreme.

Any suggestion is welcome with the exception of slash.


** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) and its sequel linkffn(Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time) is properly THE number one fic with your wish in mind. From the begin of HBP onwards it is completly AU.

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** I've written "The Dark Lord Never Died", which has a POD at Halloween 1981, which leads to Dumbledore and his allies going into exile in France. There are Horcruxes though.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

Not exactly completely original, but since Harry choses a completely opposite path to canon, it's refreshingly different.
