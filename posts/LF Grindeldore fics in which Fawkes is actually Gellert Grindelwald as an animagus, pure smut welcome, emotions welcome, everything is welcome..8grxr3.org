Did anyone ever write this?

My headcanon has always been that Dumbledore could only overpower Grindelwald, because Grindelwald did not want to kill Dumbledore, because he always had feelings for him and this being THE reason Dumblebumble believed in love above anything else. (I imagine Albus offering Gellert something like a life on his knees be his side or ruling a world without Albus in it or something equally over-the-top.)

Why would someone who else ever loved hopelessly and didn't receive any in return think that love would conquer all? - that just does not make any sense imho.

Anyway, Grindeldore with this specific twist would be highly appreciated.

Thank you!


** I can't imagine a Dark Lord turning into a beacon of hope overnight, but I do like your reasoning as to why Dumbledore has such a strong belief in the power of Love.

*** Dumbledore beat Grindelwald to get the Elder Wand, then used it and his prodigious transfiguration skill to turn Grindelwald into a Phoenix.

As a Phoenix, his physically light nature would drastically increase his empathy, making Grindelwald a good person.

Tell everyone you've put him in Nurmengard and boom! Your own personal GrindelPhoenix!

** Ooh, that's a possibility. A Grindelwald who believes in the Good in Greater Good, whose war to conquer the world was characterised by honourable conduct and just treatment of his subjects.

When his armies are undermined by a cabal of generals, subverting his soldiers to cruelty and malice towards muggles, Grindelwald and his remaining loyal soldiers (those who haven't been culled) turn to friends in magical Britain, including Albus Dumbledore, to try and halt the world-threatening plans of these Dark Generals, in a continent-spanning war that lasts for years.

Ultimately, though these Dark Generals are defeated, it's Grindelwald's name that's disgraced, as the man who built those armies and started their conquest; relinquishing the Elder Wand to Albus and going into hiding, Gellert hopes to return one day and set the historical record straight, clearing his own name...

Where he is today is a mystery, something that only Albus Dumbledore knows...all that's known for certain is that the day 'Grindelwald' (actually one of the surviving Dark Generals) was imprisoned in Nuremberg, a phoenix appeared by Dumbledore's side, acting like it had known the old transfiguration master all his life, and has stuck to Albus's shoulder ever since...
