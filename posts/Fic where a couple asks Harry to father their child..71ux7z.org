Maybe because the father is sterile or something

Or it could just be a girl asking him to do it. Doesn't have to have another guy involved.

** That's definitely a interesting request and wouldn't say no to reading something like that. The only people I could see him saying yes to something like that though are one of the Weasley brothers. Since that's a pretty personal thing to ask. If anyone knows anything like it though I'd definitely read it! lol.

  Harry Potter was not really ready for a family. Who is? This is not really a Harry/Harem story - he doesn't even get laid until the very end of things... But it's funny. I promise.
