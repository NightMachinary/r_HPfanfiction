I want Harry going back to first year, I want marriage contracts, I want fifth-year AU Dumbledore-bashing. I want all the most overused plotlines - but I want the best example of each. The creme de la creme.

** - *Superintelligent Harry: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality)* (Some people think Harry is too much of a "smartarse" for them to bear, but if that doesn't bother you, this fic is genuinely great. Be prepared for a lot of AUness, however.)

- *Overpowered Wandless-Magic Harry: linkffn(Core Threads)* (Boy, it does /not/ get any OPer than /Core Threads/. He's literally a god by now, and it's just Second Year. But what makes it not only bearable, but actually very /good/, is that it's always fun and light-hearted. Beyond the very first chapter, despite what the description might make you think, there's not a shred of angst in this, and no true bashing either; the closest you get is that Dumbledore's convoluted plans are made fun of, but not actually argued /against/, let alone presented as evil.)

- *Evil Dumbledore: linkffn(What Was Your Plan?)* (Can't really describe it without ruining the idea. It's a very good one-shot. Read it.)

- *Super-Duper Magical Trunk: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Dimensional Trunk)* (I'm halfway through reading it, and this fic has a /very/ good "canon flavour" thing going on. Harry is one of the most in-character canon-Harry I've ever seen, for instance. It has a fantastic Umbridge plotline.)

- *Super-Duper Magical Trunk, Honorable Mention: linkffn(Harry Potter and a grandfather's gift)* (Perhaps not quite as well-written as /Dimensional Trunk/. Still very good, although quite archaic in some ways. The Potter grandparents aren't Fleamont and Euphemia, but neither are they Charlus and Dorea. It shares with /Core Threads/ the fact that it has no conflict whatsoever and it's glorious.)

- *Arithmancy As Spellcrafting: linkffn(The Arithmancer)* (Very creative in the spells, and well-written as always with White Squirrel. Some feel it does have a bad case of Stations of Canon, however.)

**** ~glances at the blurb for that fic~

I just had an idea! What if you took a 'Harry dies, Death isn't happy with him and sends him back' plot and made it so that Harry's destiny was that he was supposed to be EVIL in all caps?

Like, he was supposed to be corrupted by the horcrux in his skull and become a vile super-genius bent on wreaking havoc on the world (Death's boss wants results like the World Wars, dammit!), but between the Dursleys stifling his academic ambitions and the Weasleys being good friends & role models and that dunce Voldemort believing in that prophecy, Harry ended up being a decent person and inadvertently stopping more death and destruction by beating Voldemort? Half of the trouble he wound up in each year being meant to help him snap and turn into a supervillain?

*** Harry Crow is possible the most unfulfilling thing I have ever experienced. I kept reading because it continually showed the potential of becoming an interesting story, but at almost every single turn it disappoints with bland shallow characterizations and boring resolutions of all the conflicts.

Then there's these scenes where the author has some girls sexually assaulted but writes it off like it's their fault for being sluts. Considering the whole narrative is about being progressive (or something resembling that) this gives me the impression that he things women deserve to be raped for being sluts, which is just uncomfortable as fuck to read on any day of the week.

Anyway so yeah this fic sucks don't read it.
