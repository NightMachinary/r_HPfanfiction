So like the title says I'm looking for Creepy Pasta Harry Potter crossovers. I've already read AO3s and the mythology crossover with Harry Potter on FFN. Can you all give me more. I've stumbled across them before so I know they exist.


** OP, I know you're the one requesting stuff from us, but I never thought about a Creepy Pasta/HP crossover, and that sounds really cool. Can you rec the best ones you've come across so others can enjoy too?

Thanks! :)

*** To be honest they all are not the best and in fact many could be called horrid :(. But the idea is so good I can't help but read them. Currently the one linked above is one of the best I've read so far.

**** Horrid as in poor quality? Or horrid as in scary? Because if it's horrid as in scary, I'm still interested. I'll check out the previously recommended one, though :)

***** As in very poor quality with ANs as long as the actual chapter every chapter.

** It is not tag as a crossover but it does contain many known creepy pastas. The summary is good enough to understand more or less what is going to happen but the writing is really good. I can't remember much else of it but I did enjoyed it

  Harry Potter's uncle goes too far and a broken, bleeding Harry is left in his cupboard. However, he is rescued and taken in by our favorite, faceless entity in a suit; Slenderman. How will Hogwarts deal with a corrupted Harry Potter? Harry Potter x Creepypastas. Dark-ish!Harry. Teen for general Creepypasta goodness and language. Manipulative Dumbledore and Weasley Bashing.

I read up to about chapter 55 and never got back into it because of slow updates but it is really good. It's got 800k words. There is currently 93 chapters.

I'd suggest reading it because when I was reading it I risked bringing my phone out during school to read it.

I'd love to try and get back into it but that would mean re-reading it and I personally cant read such a long book without getting bored and wanting something fresh.
