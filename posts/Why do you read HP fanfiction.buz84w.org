What the title says. Do you read it for the world, the characters, or both? Reading it for the world essentially means you look for the magic, Hogwarts, etc. without much focus on whether the characterization of characters are canon-compliant. Reading it for the characters means you don't care too much about what the world is like so as long as the characters are present, and accurately characterized.

Personally, I read it for the world. My first (and only) requirement for a fic would be that magic exists. While I prefer canon characters to be present, I don't particularly care if they are OOC.

** I grew up with Hogwarts, both the books and the movies. The music sends a significant shiver down my spine (oddly enough makes me think more of the lego games than the movies) and the mystery of that school has fascinated me ever since. The characters are the vehicles in which I explore the world. If the character is written poorly, it's a shaky ride and I don't enjoy myself. But if the characters are good, regardless of who they are, they allow me to immerse myself into a story of witchcraft and wizardry, of flying motorcycles and ford angela's, of thrashing plants and shifting staircases, and of a powerful secretive society of people far to insular for their own good. It's FUN to think about the world of harry potter. I don't need a comprehensive magic system, I don't need an epic that travels around the wizarding world, but I need that touch of magic and that sense of an eleven year old boy being given a ticket to a world he could never imagine, a world three quarters between everything else, a place he belongs yet never expected.

It's worth saying that much of Harry Potter and the [insert here] is idealised for me. I'm at that point where the fanfiction blends with the canon into this strange mix of communal ideas based on J.K. Rowling's work. I love it, I intend to be here for a very long time, searching for the next story written with passion and care while religiously watching those stories I want nothing more than to be updated.

​

I read Harry Potter Fanfiction for the unique feeling only achievable by thousands contributing to a communal story. I don't really know who Harry Potter is. Magic has changed so many times that I have trouble keeping track of what was and wasn't impossible as I switch fics. I don't remember if Ron was a good ron or a bad ron, but I do remember Ron, regardless.

** JKR is a great storyteller with an eye for adding whimsy. Not so much with the logic and the worldbuilding or deep/consistent characterization. Nor (like all things mainstream) does it offer much in the way of diversity (points for acknowledging that nonwhite people exist in the 90s/early 00s).

​

Harry is a fairly blank slate (typical of protagonists), so I like that fan fics give him an actual personality. Or when they try to realistically portray the consequences of his abuse.

** 1). To fix some aspect of the plot that I feel could've gone differently. For instance, I'm always on the lookout for fics where Harry doesn't need to be with the Dursleys, or fics where Harry gets more training than he did in canon, or Dudley!redemption fics. Basically wee!Harry is my bb and I want to see fics where he's happy.\\
2) To expand on the worldbuilding (well, I suppose, not so much expand on as to provide more worldbuilding).\\
3) It's a hell of a lot of fun\\
4) Grey Malfoys (more than canon gives us)\\
5) Mentor Snape, or Mentor anyone (I even read a mentor Tom the Barman fic)\\
6) Minor characters (esp. PoC like Parvati and Padma, Cho, Dean) 7) Indian!Harry (or half-Indian).\\
8) Considering that I lean heavily towards gen and ‘vanilla' or canonical ships in all my other fandoms, I'm okay with a lot of weird pairings. Like time-travel!Harry/Albus, Harrymort, Snarry, etc. I know that's not weird by HP fandom standards, but it is out of the norm for me.\\
9) Harry not being a complete dickhead towards the end of the series\\
10) Competent!Harry, but not Super!Indy!1111Harry. That's a really hard line to draw for me. If he's too independent and doesn't rely on anyone at all I just give up. I need my h/c and angst, okay?\\
11) Fics where Harry doesn't act like a complete dickhead and/or anything that can block DH from my memory\\
12) Fics where Snape and Harry aren't mortal enemies and Occlumency isn't mind-rapey.

tl;dr fluff and angst

1st favorite: A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles

e have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view. (Paired with an OC, but that storyline is minor.)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles]]

2nd favorite: The Long Road Home -- Snily

Voldemort chooses Neville but the Potters do not escape unscathed. Five years later, Lily Potter walks back into Severus Snape's life. Things are about to get complicated. AU Severus/Lily.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6613973/1/The-Long-Road-Home]]

3rd favorite: Too Deep for the Healing -- OC

This story begins where Snape's story ends in canon: In the Shrieking Shack. Severus Snape survives the war - but which Snape? Who is he in the new circumstances? Some things will never be the same again. Other things, however, do not change so easily.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7068580/1/Too-Deep-for-the-Healing]]

Miles to Go Before I sleep -- Snape/OC This story is AU. What would have happened if Voldemort had understood that defeat, not death, conferred mastery of the Elder Wand and did not kill Snape? And what of all the stray Death Eaters that JKR forgot to mention? Like Bella Lestrange's husband?

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8090116/1/Miles-to-Go-Before-I-Sleep]]

Severus Snape and the Art of War -- Snily After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13222016/1/Severus-Snape-and-the-Art-of-War]]

If Someone Cared Enough -- Snily

What if Snape had received some better guidance when he was young from people who cared enough to notice what he was going through and looked deeper than the surface? What if there had been Slytherins who weren't aspiring Death Eaters? Would their assistance be enough to help a few young and hot tempered teens? (Slow burn romance)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12481024/1/If-Someone-Cared-Enough]]

Who We Are -- OC, one shot

Alexis is a muggle who lives across the street from Severus Snape. (Chronicles their relationship throughout twenty years) Warning: Slight domestic abuse

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13265883/1/Who-We-Are]]

Cauldrons and Lilies -- Snily

"This train will take you where you have to be. Severus, listen to me, this is a rare occasion." Albus held his shoulders and he realized he was shorter than the headmaster. That couldn't be, he'd been taller than Albus ever since he was nineteen and finally stopped growing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10137876/1/Cauldrons-and-Lilies]]

Veritas Omnia Vincit

Lily and Severus reconcile after her marriage to James, beginning an affair that will have long-lasting consequences. Canon compliant until "The Half-Blood Prince". Eventual Severitus.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12437451/1/Veritas-Omnia-Vincit]]

Puzzle

Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world by ruled the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6622580/1/Puzzle]]

My own stories, available on AO3 as well:

Wormwood and Asphodel - Snily

Not only did Harry survive the attack of Lord Voldemort, but Lily did as well. While grieving over the loss of her husband, she reconnects with a certain potions master who vows to make amends. Enacting their revenge on Lord Voldemort, they find one another as they once were. They rekindle a love they never thought possible amidst a war that threatens to tear them apart.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13088244/1/Wormwood-and-Asphodel]]

Chronic -- Snily

Severus made a grave mistake by joining Lord Voldemort and he paid for it with his body. Lily lost the man she loved to the war, James Potter. With both of them missing pieces of their lives they find themselves relying on each other. Chronic illnesses, sick!Severus. Rewritten version of Missing Pieces

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13284124/1/Chronic]]

Missing Pieces -- Snily

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12969696/1/Missing-Pieces]]

Eagles and Serpents -- Snily and OC (OC is told in flashbacks)

Having made mistakes when he was younger, Severus now lives in Basilnell with his young daughter. Life in the Snape home is seemingly normal despite the war raging outside until a known death eater - Lily Evans - knocks on their door and foretells of a danger that's coming to get them.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13281424/1/Eagles-and-Serpents]]

For the Guilty - OC

Nagini had failed to take his life in the shack. By some miracle, Severus had survived, only to be faced with another trial, another dark wizard. The problem this time, is not everything is what it appears to be. Originally posted as "New Beginnings"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13272754/1/For-the-Guilty]]

Coming Back to You -- Snily

An unexpected reappearance topples everything Severus thought he know about the events of Lord Voldemort's defeat. Everything is put at risk, his position beneath the Dark Lord, his career within the school, and perhaps most importantly, his relationship with Harry Potter. Events in this fic are canon until Goblet of fire.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13218938/1/Coming-Back-to-You]]

Potions and Perennials -- Snape/Narcissa

Severus' life is filled with obligations: serving Lord Voldemort, protecting Harry Potter, fighting for the light, and now -- most recently -- watching over Draco Malfoy. Acting as a soldier for opposing sides of war, he has to fight for those he loves most and hope there's enough time to save himself in the process.

***** Oh, awesome. Thank you! I usually read Mentor Snape, Snape/Harry friendship and the very occasional Snarry, Snupin and Snape/Sirius

Snily is new for me.

Recs, in turn:

Blood Magic by GatewayGirl\\
The Definition of Home series - Oliversnape\\
Digging for the Bones by Paganaidd (TW child abuse)\\
A Place for Warriors - Owlsaway\\
Stronger than Hope - Alaunatar (Indy!Harry).\\
The Sum of their Parts - holdmybeer (Harry-centric, no Snape, but still bloody good). The Best Revenge - Arsinoe de Blassenville\\
Nocturne by Tiranog.\\
Growing Pains series - Tiranog (first friendship, then Snarry)\\
A Year Like No Other\\
And They Didn't Live Happily Ever After - Betz - one of the very few Snamions fics I enjoy

There is also another fic which involves Hermione becoming Snape's apprentice, but I can't find it.

Getting the Hang of Thursdays by Hayseed [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501]] [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/61047]] - Stone Cold Sober by Fabula Rasa. This is Snape/Lupin/Sirius

Most of these are well known in the fandom, so you've doubtless heard of some of them.

** The world is my primary reason, with characters being a close second. Nonmagical AU's kill me. I remember when I was trying to find Harry/fem!Voldemort fics on ao3, and more than half were nonmagical AU's. That completely ruins the sordidness that is the whole point of Harry/Voldemort pairings!

** To be honest,its because the books are lacking. Don't get me wrong. I love harry potter. Rowling did an amazing job creating a magical universe. But it lacked.......exploration I guess. The main story takes place only at Hogwarts. We don't get to see the rest of the world. In lotr we get to see so many new locations and the story stretches to all this magical lands. The world building is much more pronounced. Its something I find lacking in the HP series. Its the reason one of my favorite part of fanfic is when the author expand on the HP world with their imagination.

Oh and also the end battle sucked. Yeah definitely want something different than that.

*** I think a big part of why this works for HP is that it's somewhat grounded in basic myths... like Witches/Wizards wearing pointed hats, flying brooms and so on.

This allows a writer to pick up just about any semi popular/accepted older idea and simply say 'muggles got it almost right!' and it fits in...

** Characters first, I think. I read because I enjoy it, and I'm more likely to enjoy stories with good characterisation. Seeing how they react in a different set of circumstances is like having more of canon.

That said, quality worldbuilding can add to the story, definitely. But if you get the characters wrong, like making a Mary Sue, then it's hard for the world to carry the story.

** I read fanfic because the epilogue made me roll my eyes: I want to see different endings, and different takes on the story.

** I never read the Harry Potter books or watched the movies. They just didn't appeal to me, and I had LOTR to read instead. But because it was such a phenom to the people around me I knew what happened loosely speaking.

I was introduced to the Harry Potter world more directly and the fanfiction aspect through my sister who read a lot of fanfiction, but I didn't follow through with it until I got into Elsanna fanfiction and wanted to read more great works which led me to hp fanfiction, and now my only look into this world is via fanfiction. It is an amazing world full of little details and I just can't get enough, but I have immersed myself in so many AU's that I don't think I'd enjoy the source material.

*** You should give it a go! Philosopher's Stone is really good fun. CoS and PoA aren't bad either, if only because we get to meet Sirius and Lupin for the first time. GoF is interesting too.

And I say this as someone who soured on canon around OOTP, when I felt the books got too long and unwieldy and the characters unrecognisable. I also don't have a rose-coloured fan filter (that one's for LotR and Emelan, which I just can't be objective about because feels).

** The same reason I read any other fanfiction, or a new fantasy novel, or watch the latest season of a good show.

Because it's good, fun, interesting. I can't say there's anything specific I look for. I do love stories about intelligent characters, but I also enjoy emotional stories, or action adventures, or mysteries.

** Both but more often on characters because i do care about good chatacterization even in world building stories. But that characterization doesn't have to be canon compliant it just needs to feel like a natural progression based on the story. If the set up is changed enough then the characters will be too. If Harry was in Slytherin perhaps he wouldnt be able to be best friends with Ron and that would alter his personality. If that change feels natural then id still call that good characterization. If he immediately starts acting like a chess master archetype that is not good characterization.

I do like shipping even in hp. But my love for hp fic is being able to continue to explore the world and characters and prefer character and plot focused stories to ship focused ones. Its one of the few fandoms i know of where this is commom and its well written some of the best written fics are hp ones.
