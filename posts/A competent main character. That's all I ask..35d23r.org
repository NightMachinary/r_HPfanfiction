*** Yup! Don't get me wrong, I read FFN with actual plot/characters, but right now I just want fluff and wish fulfillment.

Also, I'd count Hogwarts Battle School as something that fits this, but Harry definitely faces challenges and is set back many times (Starts losing to Hermoine, whole house turns against him, Snape puts him in battles impossible to win), but I like that he's very, very competent throughout it, even while failing. He's also portrayed as a complex character with his flaws, but finds ways to hide them.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5201703/1/By-the-Divining-Light][By The Divining Light]] and it's sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5971274/1/Conlaodh-s-Song][Conlaodh's Song]] fits most of your criteria except for the fact the Voldemort has been made a bit more dangerous than in canon.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4438449/1/Path-of-Decision][Path of Decision]] has Harry that isn't very powerful magically and has to compensate for that by using his brain. He also has friends and supporters from all the houses who are ready to follow him into battle.

** It sounds like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8670912/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Gift-of-Memories][Harry Potter and the Gift of Memories]] would be right up your alley. Lots of friends from all four houses. Martial arts. Very powerful magically. Apprentices with Nicolas Flamel. Has like, a dozen girls all over him, including a vampire princess. You want wish-fulfillment, this has the whole nine yards. Fairly well written honestly, currently in-progress and over 500k words including the two sequel series: Heir of Slytherin and Ties that Bind

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8186071/1/Harry-Crow][Harry Crow]] fits all of your criteria. I think 11 year old Harry and friends are a bit too mature, but other than that, it's an enjoyable read.

*** Harry Crow is the biggest pile of shit I've ever tried to read. Doesn't Harry outshine McGonagall in his very first transfiguration lesson?

#+begin_quote
  Minerva had been a transfiguration prodigy and now held a mastery in the subject, an eleven year old goblin-trained wizard had just totally destroyed everything she held to be true. She was a powerful witch but couldn't even contemplate repeating the feat this boy just achieved when she was the same age. It wasn't just that though, Harry Crow just threw the transfiguration rulebook out the window. Where the hell did they go from here?
#+end_quote

/Fucking Hell/. But this is hardly the worst part -- there's the whole Dumbledore/Weasley bashing thing that makes me want to strangle somebody, preferably the author. And those fucking Goblins. The whole thing is a butchery of the /Harry Potter/ books. How on earth can anyone like such utter drivel?

**** Dude, he asked for fluff. Just because there's a group of people here that like to hate on Robst doesn't mean it's not worth recommending.

And is the anger necessary? How about you give your own recommendation instead?

**** Harry Crow is a pile of shit, but there's a reason why people like it. For the most part, people read fanfiction for wish fulfillment, rather than for actual enjoyable, fully-realized characters or a competent plot. If Harry's awesome, then it's good enough for them, and Harry's makes god look like a shitheel in /all/ of robst's fics, let alone Harry Crow. Better yet that it's H/Hr and filled to the brim with juvenile Weasley/Dumbledore-bashing, which is sure to bring militant Harmonians with a grudge against Ron out of the wood work. Robst's writing is grammatically competent and reads well, even if it is a bit soulless, and his stories are so chock full of fanservice and wish-fulfillment that the average FF reader would go hog wild over it.

You know, this is probably the best single adjective to characterize Robst's work in general and /Harry Crow/ in particular that I've seen to date. I've been using "banal", but yours is more poetic.

**** [[/u/PsychoGeek]] there's no reason to be so hostile.

My favourite thing about this fandom is that people are free to pursue their own ideal through different stories. I don't like TMR/HG fics. In fact, they go against almost everything I believe about Hermione's character. But I'd never tell someone that they shouldn't enjoy stories featuring that pairing or be a part of the fandom. Your comments cross a line for me.

Robst is well known for three things: extremely helpful goblins, very powerful main characters, and fluffy H/Hr. Don't like it? Don't read it. There are plenty of people who /do/ like those stories and I don't see any of them here shitting all over your preferences.

Oh, I wouldn't mind at all if people actually found fault with my reading preferences, as long as the criticism is legitimate. You see, thing is, Harry Crow is objectively terrible. It is a bash-fest from the beginning to the end, and I consider bashing to be inherently disrespectful to canon.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yes, and the first one contradicts everything we know about goblins from canon, the second one is bad writing and the third.... well, I refuse to recognize those ... those /things/ Robst writes as Harry and Hermione from canon.

Like I said, objectively terrible.

Besides, I do like to think I am doing people a favor. Someone actually recommended the story, and I just .... provided more information. And if there are people who don't mind long bash-fests with a Harry-who-isn't-Harry-at-all and who is more powerful than God, then they should actually like it /more/ now that they know what the story is about.

Meanwhile, anyone who doesn't like such shit (I was tempted to write /anyone with half a brain/, so I'm actually being generous here) can happily ignore the story and move on with their lives.

See, everyone wins.

***** I think that they have their moments where they shine, but overall I think that they are for a certain type of reader. This is neither a good thing or a bad think. It just it. I personally like Harry crow overall, but I will concede that he is overpowered from the beginning. I like the plot ideas more than the battle scenes.
