** I was reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and I got this strange thought in my head of what it would've been like if Tom Riddle and Hermione Granger had been at Hogwarts together at the same time. This thought progressed into who would win in a duel: Tom Riddle (not Voldemort) or Hermione Granger. (Of course, I believed she would've been no match for him but I thought it would be interesting to see what others thought). After a quick Google search, a story popped up titled Fourier's Flaw by SiriusBlacksGodDaughter. And that the first fanfiction I read.

I stumbled on this from I think a link in a random discussion I saw on somebody's Facebook and wanted to read it cuz I wanted to read a story about post-war and it led to me searching around a bit more. While I was still reading that it was Northumbrian's work that hooked me into FanFiction. linkffn(The Mind of Arthur Weasley by Northumbrian) and linkffn(Tales of the Battle by Northumbrian) were my earliest favorites. Absolutely loved them and still do.

** It was called "Order of the Phoenix" and I found it on either Morpheus or Kazaa when I was looking to download the 5th book as I lived in a small town with no book stores within about 50 miles.

It was a story where back in the day the Pitters had saved some Phoenix's so we're each granted a wish. Since they had healing powers, Phoenix's could bring back someone that had died. He wanted to bring back his mom and had to do this whole ritual thing on the Summer Solstice I believe.

I thought it was the actual fifth book and got into quite a few arguments online with people over the plot and who had died in the end. That was nearly 16 years ago and I haven't stopped reading fanfiction since.

**** Ha that was awesome, thank you for sharing!

I was so confused and since I lived in the middle of nowhere at the time I couldn't get my hands on the actual book for a free more weeks. Luckily my friend Kari had the book and we had a similar conversation on MSN messenger as those two had. She did give me endless crap for it though lol.

  Nineteen years ago, Harry told Ron he saw Hermione as his sister. Now Hermione is in danger and Harry's feelings for her begin to change dramatically, jeopardizing everything he once knew. An Epilogue compliant fic. Rated M for sex and language.

  Did you ever wonder what happened in the 19 years between the last chapter and the epilogue of Deathly Hallows? Or what happens afterward? Totally, completely, and eventually H/Hr, but we have a long road to get there! Rated T for language & sexuality.

** I don't remember the name, all I remember is that it was a time travel Harry that ended up with Hermione, converted Draco, had a mini-Order that the name may have been something about a Shield. Like Courage Bulwark or something like that.

** Girl that was 14 years ago, I don't remember!

If I accurately remember my 9-year-old self, though, it was super tame Ron/OC stuff. I had a HUGE crush on Rupert Grint! Basically every plot would've been the same. Self-insert OFC, 14 year olds blushing, blah blah blah

Early stuff was just things hosted on people's Geocities pages. (After a while I got into Quizilla. When that got bought by Nick, I switched over to FFN, HPFF, Silver Snitch...)
