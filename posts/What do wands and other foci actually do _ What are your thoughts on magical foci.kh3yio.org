My question is about this sub's thoughts on what wands (and other foci) actually do.

We semi-agree that wands (or other foci) allow the characters to cast magic, but I'm curious - what specific function do we think they actually serve? Like, do they 'tame' accidental magic so it can be controlled when you're young (like magical trainer wheels)? Do they control and 'aim' it so it hits one target instead of going everywhere? Do they 'focus' power into something that can manifest and be cast? Or is it just a 'key' to unlock magic or an ingredient in a 'recipe' for casting?

Do you think wands (or other foci) are necessary for magic? Why? If you don't think wands (or other foci) are necessary - also why? What purpose do they serve, if they aren't vital to casting somehow? What alternative would you suggest?

And feel free to add any other thoughts on foci that don't answer one of the above questions. I'm probably not covering a lot of possibilities, so feel free to provide whatever input you have on the topic. :)


** The term explains it. They're focuses for magic. There are other ways according to Rowling - Uagadou teaches it, where the wand is replaced with a series of hand gestures like a D&D mage, basically. I figure those gestures 'focus' your magic like a wand might, but take longer to cast spells.

*** Sure, but there is flexibility in the term. For example, are they controlling input (take a lot of accidental magic and make it usable) or are they controlling output (making sure your transfiguration spell hits one thing instead of changing everything in the room)?

** How wands and other foci relate to magic is one of my favourite subjects in Harry Potter. I basically hate them because almost all Magicals are unable to perform magic without them. I think they were originally invented as a way to make magic easier to perform and to give Magicals access to a wider range of magic. In modern times wands seem like a form of control by the government. A few examples - The Trace, Prior Incantatem, Wand Snapping. Can you imagine the Muggle equivalent of these. Horrifying.

For me wands and other foci are like using a computer to solve complex mathematical formulae. Input the numbers and the computer works it out for you. You don't need to know how it works just how to run the program(spell). Without a computer(wand) you're stuck doing it longhand and if you don't know how you're screwed.

TLDR: Wands make magic easier but they're a crutch and in modern times a way to control you.

*** Only in fan fiction is the trace dependent on the wand. Harry receives a warning after Dobby wandlessly uses the hover charm. Ministry personnel showed up to Private Drive after Harry wandlessly blew up Marge. I also don't think the Ministry is (typically) responsible for snapping wands. OotP seems to have been a special case.

Muggle equivalents are probably licenses that require mental and/or physical exams. But also, we have phones that map our location, our search history, and have fingerprint, voice, and face recognition.

Wands aren't a crutch. They make spells more accurate /and/ more powerful. I believe we even see this in the books: Harry would've fallen from his broom had Voldemort said the spell out loud.

Wandless magic is really just overhyped nonsense.

**** Out of curiosity, who would you say is responsible for snapping wands, if not the Ministry?

Very true on the Muggle equivalent thing, btw. We're getting pretty close to the Black Mirror-esque 'build an AI you out of your online presence'. :)

So, if you say that wands make spells more accurate and more powerful, would you say that they're a improved-for-convenience thing (the car vs the horse and carriage), then? Or would you still see them as a necessity? Not criticising, just curious as to your thoughts. :)

***** The headmaster/headmistress of Hogwarts. I get that it takes a lot for a student to be expelled, but I have a hard time believing they show up to snap a student's wand and don't even take the wands of actual criminals.

I'm just going along with what JKR said, but improved for convenience.

** Personally I headcanon that anyone that is capable of casting with a foci can cast without one.

As such foci are exactly that, a focus for the magic. To use an analogy using a wand is akin to a flashlight while (untrained) wandless magic is akin to a lantern. Without adequate training performing a spell wandlessly will essentially lead to a lot of leakage of magic.

This doesn't mean that the intended magical effect necessarily happens all around the caster, just that a lot of magic is wasted. With training a magical can be just as accurate as with a foci. But that's the rub. It takes a lot of training to get to the point of being able to cast even the simplest of spells without exhausting oneself. This means that only the most dedicated and/or powerful are able to cast this way.

Wands and other foci naturally bypass that initial step. With wandless magic being something seldom seen due to the effort needed to learn it. Where most wandless users at least in the western world only learning a handful of spells either for survival purposes (I can easily see an Auror learning wandless summoning, disarming and shielding) or due to heavy repetition (say a magical cleaner might cast the vanishing spell so often that they're eventually able to cast it wandlessly).

Wands and other foci are also kept around because it lowers the power usage/requirement for the average magical. A wanded spell will be more powerful (for the most part) than the same wandless spell because the wand will focus the needed magic easier and better than most wandless practitioners can achieve. This also has the advantage that, because less magical energy is expended, someone with a wand will have greater endurance by default.

Naturally the powers that be would also have a vested interest in using foci. While the down side for them is that there are more people with the ability to actively use magic; the benefit for TPTB is that 1. those magicals are less likely to have uncontrolled magical outbursts and 2. that foci now represents a method of some control.

*** I like the idea of them being sort of like training wheels for magic. You have the wands, the words, and the movements when you're young and they take care of most of the heavy lifting for you, then when you get used to things and are starting to learn how to do it yourself, you phase 'em out until you can go without them. :)

I think I've seen those last two ideas in a couple of stories, actually - wands being used to hide and control magic better, to keep up the Statute Masquerade.

** I like to think of wands as guns. Sure, you can hurl a bullet with your hand, and it might hit someone's eye and make them blind, but it's the gun that makes it strong.

**** Here's the passage from hp fandom:

â€‹

Wands are used by witches and wizards to channel their magic, making their spells more accurate and potent. Within cultures where wands are ubiquitous, only the most powerful and disciplined wizards and witches can perform wandless magic reliably. Transfiguration and charms are particularly difficult to perform without a wand. However, the wand is a European invention, and some cultures did not traditionally rely upon such tools for performing magic:

Native Americans have their own practices of magic that predate European colonisation, and did not require a wand; African witches and wizards only adopted the wand in the 20th century, and even today wands are not necessary for many of their practices.

***** Huh. So, it provides a mix of power-boost, reliability, and accuracy, but isn't actually necessary to cast spells. I guess that makes sense.

Does have an odd implication of non-wand user cultures having either unreliable magic or powerful magic-users, but that's probably just the traditional British Imperialism leaking through. :D

****** I think that different cultures practising different forms of magic are cool, but it's never expanded. What if Cho Chang can use some sort of 'Chi'? Or some western pureblood practising alchemy? What if the ancient Greeks wielded mythological powers? Did the Romans invent the wand casting magic? The spells are all from Latin.

******* I think that's one of the biggest complaints about Rowling's worldbuilding. It's a great sandpit to play around in and build your own stuff on, but what's there is very thin and unstructured. :D
