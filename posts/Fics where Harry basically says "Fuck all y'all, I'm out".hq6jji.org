I'm looking for stories in which Harry has finally had enough of all the shit heaped upon him by Wizarding Britain and decides that if that's how they're going to be, they can handle Voldemort themselves. After all, he's already suffered and nearly died repeatedly stalling Riddle's return and he's not even finished with school - /none/ of this is Harry's responsibility to fix.

I've already (repeatedly) read Escape, Hermione's Brilliant Idea, and Power of Paranoia.


** I can't remember the title but there was one where Harry just sorta fucks off to the muggle world... And then remotely starts a revolution. He gets the muggleborns to uprise and they become a secret society hiding in plain sight rather than behind wards. The purebloods are basically left to die. He starts bombarding people with random showers of papers about the truth(I think this is set the summer either before or after fifth year). He hangs up posters. He basically ruins the magical economy. It's amazing.

  What if Harry read the Daily Prophet all the way through after his fourth year and didn't like what he read and fought back by taking a page out of Muggle history books on propaganda? Independent Harry, who leaves the Wizarding World to fend for itself.

** And then he settles in a foreign country, drops his guard, and gets killed by Voldemort anyway.

We've seen Voldemort travel abroad in canon. That's not going to stop him from sneaking up on you when least expected.

Dumbledore was right in that Harry would never have peace from the persistent Voldemort.

** Dang, I can't remember the fic but there was one where Harry got wrongfully imprisoned in Azkaban (I know, I know) and when he was let out, he was somehow really powerful, and fucked right off to some tropical island where he spent his time living it up. And then the Order tracked him down and told him he had to kill Voldemort, he was the only one who could, and Harry was forced to make a Vow he would defeat Voldemort. But he didn't say when he would and said he would get around to it in like a couple decades or so. And they had to pay him big, big bucks to get to it early.

What I remember is that for a change, Ron wasn't bashed (but Hermione was, and had married Percy?)

** linkffn(What Does It Take To Make You Walk Away by phoenixgirl26). More of an "I have no idea how to find the horcruxes and how can a student kill Voldemort" start to the story, though.

linkffn(Fine Then! by Alpha-The-Omega). Rather sophomoric. OP!Harry leaves after being convicted over the dementor incident.

linkffn(Too Late to Apologize by JackPotr). Not bad, but not one of my favorites.

linkffn(From the Shadows by MK-ONE). Harry is betrayed, and leaves England to Voldemort. I think it gets silly in the revenge portion of the story.

linkffn(Missing: Presumed Missing? by Seel'vor). When his friends turn on him after the DoM battle, it's the last straw, and Harry leaves. Most of the (unfinished) story involves them trying to get him back.

linkffn(Nobody's Hero by epeefencer). I didn't like the way this started, so I haven't read much of it.

linkffn(You Can Have It All Revised by opopanax). When his friends turn on him after the DoM battle ...

linkffn(Deceptions by WolfMoon). When he's accused of killing Cedric, Harry leaves with Sirius.

linkffn(A Bad Week at the Wizengamot by DisobedienceWriter). After being convicted over the dementor incident, Harry leaves England. Kind of crackish.

linkffn(To Become a Muggle by lifebitten). Maybe not quite what you're looking for, but an excellent story. After the Tournament, Harry decides to give up on magic.
