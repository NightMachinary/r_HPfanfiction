  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Thrust between giants Harry has no choice but become one himself if he wants to keep on breathing. He might've found a way, but life's never that easy. Clock's ticking, Harry. Learn fast now.

  What is more terrifying? A wizard who can kick down your door or a wizard who can look at you and know your every thought? Harry's journey into the mind arts begins with a bout of accidental magic and he practices it and hungers for the feelings it brings. [Major Canon Divergences beginning Third Year.]

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

  The year is 1943. The Chamber lies unopened and Grindlewald roams unchecked. Neither Tom Riddle nor Albus Dumbledore is satisfied with the situation. Luckily when Hogwarts is attacked they'll both have other things to worry about.

** Does it specifically have to be Harry, or just the protagonist? The Peace Not Promised has Snape working closely with Dumbledore to bring the war to a shorter and cleaner end this time around.

** linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17475989/chapters/41157146]])

This expands more on a father-son type relationship than a mentor-student one. Dumbledore puts being headmaster on hold to adopt and raise Harry. A lot of it is light hearted, but the author doesn't avoid awkward conflicts and how the public affects Harry's and Dumbledore's relationship. Strongly recommend if you haven't read it already. Incomplete.

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19179952/chapters/45591217]])

This shows snippets of their canon relationship, mostly through Fawkes who is incredible the entire time. It kills me that this is gonna end up canon-compliant. Strongly recommend, it's pretty wholesome. Incomplete.

** linkffn(The Arcanist: Unspeakable mysteries) is one of the most well written fics I've read. Its a master-apprentice relationship and even though its a WIP its absolutely amazing.

  The largest threat to the Statute of Secrecy was not the wizards being found, it was the beings that went bump in the night that would drive you mad at a glance, the demons, the things that you can never unknow. So the Ministry made it all Unspeakable. Magic is Might. WBWL, Mentor!Albus, Master of Death, Gods, Demons, & the TWT in a way you have never seen. Alterate Universe.
