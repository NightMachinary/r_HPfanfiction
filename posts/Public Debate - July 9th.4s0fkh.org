** literature (n) - written works, especially those considered of superior or lasting artistic merit. [[https://www.google.com/search?q=define+literature][(Source)]]

Based on the above definition, FanFiction is indeed a legitimate form of literature because it is a form of written work, and there /are/ certain Harry Potter fanfiction stories, such as the Alexandra Quick series, which are regarded as of lasting artistic merit and even superior to some /published literature./ Now, that might not be true for all fanfiction stories or fandoms, but neither is it true for published literature. For example, the Twilight series or the Fifty Shades of Grey series (which itself started out as Twilight fanfiction) are not regarded as superior /or/ of lasting artistic merit.

Based on the standards of current published literature, I believe that we can, in fact, consider fanfiction true literature.

*** While [[/u/mikexcau]] makes an excellent point about a few HP fanfics being more technically sound than a few examples of modern literature, no fanfic is truly capable of charting new waters as it is irrevocably shackled to the original author's vision. No matter how polished the language or novel the concept in a fanfic, any derivative work follows conventions established by the original author. This limitation is the crucial flaw that will always cause even the most well-regarded fanfic to be derided as having less artistic merit than original fiction.

**** While [[/u/MacsenWledig]] also makes a good point, it is also possible to chart new waters with fanfiction. For example, take any "Alternate Universe" fic or the Alexandra Quick series. These stories only feature the very minimum amount of material from the original story needed to qualify it as a fanfic; for example, the characters, the settings, or the concepts developed by the original author. One could also argue that published literature also generally follows the same basic ideas- take the recent interest in dystopian novels or J.K. Rowling's series starting an interest in stories about magic. Lastly, the Fifty Shades of Grey series itself started out as simply, a Twilight fanfiction.

****** There are other examples, such as the recent interest in the genre of Dystopian Fiction books, which one could argue share many of the same ideas (oppressive government, resistance against that government, a hero rises up to overthrow that government, etc.). Fanfiction is the same thing, just sharing slightly more than just the same ideas, in that it shares the same characters or exact concepts as the original work. As fanfiction is largely the same concept as novels from one genre, why should it not be considered literature?

** If anyone contests the point I normally can't help but laugh at them, honestly - fanfiction is everywhere, much as certain grandparents, whiners and particular authors try to deny it.

Dante's Divine Comedy, a classic of honestly epic proportions, was self-insert RPF. All of Shakespeare's works were arguably fanfics, written as they were in imitatio, complete with their own dick jokes, ridiculous OTPs and pop culture references, and Paradise Lost, one of the most influential works in the past few centuries, was fanfic of the fucking Bible.

While I believe there are new and original approaches to stuff being discovered every day, I refuse to concede that some works are more valuable than others on the basis of their "originality", because originality's a thing we've made up.

Within the bounds of human imagination, you can't hold up originality as its own thing - it's like claiming that someone painted something green, and therefore you can't paint anything else green without being unoriginal.

The only colours we have available are the ones we can see, and painting with the colours, or even the colour combinations, someone else has used doesn't mean the thing you're making is less legitimate or less valuable.

The only real difference between fanfic from say, the 70s of Star Trek to the fanfic of now contrasted with the fanfic of old is the introduction of copyright law and the means in which it's written.

Applying the concept of "legitimacy" to any form of literature, fanfic or otherwise, is nothing short of bonkers.

*** [[/u/LocalDictionary]] has attempted to broaden the definition of fanfiction to include adaptations of previous works. So the question then becomes, do adaptations = fanfiction? I would argue that it's a bit of a blurry distinction, but ultimately it comes down to this: is the source material in the public domain? If so, then it's an adaptation. If not, then it's a fanfiction.

For example, Shakespeare as fanfiction? I honestly have no idea how he/she came to this conclusion. If they're referring to works such as /Cymbeline/, I'd argue that basing a work on an established folktale/legend is perfectly acceptable to do so long as there is no original, discrete author. If they're referring to /A Midsummer Night's Dream/ being a take on Ovid's /Pyramus and Thisbe/, then I'm inclined to agree (even though Ovid was certainly public domain by that point). That /is/ fanfiction, but it is inaccurate hyperbole to say that:

#+begin_quote
  All of Shakespeare's works were arguably fanfics
#+end_quote

There's simply no proof of this at all. Also:

#+begin_quote
  While I believe there are new and original approaches to stuff being discovered every day
#+end_quote

this is contradicted by the following portion of the same sentence:

#+begin_quote
  originality's a thing we've made up.
#+end_quote

By this logic, /everything/ is derivative and that's just silly.

** Alright I'll play. I'm against for the sake of argument.

On a purely subjective philosophical level, legitimate literature is a nonsense concept. Not only can it not be defined in any agreeable manner, but there are barriers that prevent people from grasping the full contents of the "Written" form of media. We misunderstand ideas and symbolism all the time and we distort the intended characters personalities due to our own bias. Things like this prevent us from truly understanding what the author "intended" to convey.

I mean if we are talking strictly from a technical stand point, then sure Fanfiction is legit and so are original works.

However since this media and all other medias operate on subjective interpretation of "the events" in the story and they wouldn't be understood unless you had a specific background or knowledge.

And since I consider the "intent" behind writing to be to convey an idea as you see it(generally), and it fails at that, then calling anything legit or not is like calling a food "tasty". Its a matter of subjectivity.

Its neither one on both accounts.

** Since there are already two very fine arguments in support, I'll raise one AGAINST (mostly as Devil's Advocate).

By being derivative, fanfiction is illegitimate. Our hobby should never be given pride of place alongside true wonders of literature such as /Vanity Fair/ or /The Count of Monte Cristo/, but that doesn't mean that fanfiction can't have value to the reader. In other words, it's entirely possible to love Dickens' /Nicholas Nickleby/ and Santi's Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived equally, but only the former has artistic merit due to its higher degree of originality.

Would you ever confuse /Neuromancer/ with Vox Corporis? Why not? They're both well regarded in their communities (science fiction and fanfiction respectively) for being superior to other works in the same genres. The reason is that by creating a new IP, Gibson was able to take bold steps in creating the distinct personalities of Cage, Molly Millions, and Armitage that authors of fanfic /cannot/ do as they are constrained by the source material. How often have we trashed fics on this subreddit for having a boring, materialistic Lord Potter von Gringotts or a Hermione-Sue who bears no resemblance to her abrasive, bossy canon counterpart? This devotion to the original canon is what removes any legitimacy from fanfiction.

** I am IN FAVOUR of the idea that fanfiction is a legitimate form of literature. We need look no further than the fanfiction that is already considered great literature.

The very definition of fanfiction is "fiction written by a fan of, and featuring characters from, a particular TV series, film, etc." This can mean anything from retelling the source material from a different point of view, to wholly original works that simply make use of existing characters. Alternate Universe fanfic often features an original storyline featuring characters and personalities from the source material. What If/For Want of a Nail fics can send characters tumbling off into completely unchartered territory. Frankly, one only has to look as far as the Next Gen section of Harry Potter fanfiction to see beloved characters being used to create entirely new and fresh stories.

Based on the definition above, we have so many examples of existing fanfiction heralded as great literature that it's difficult to argue against this view. For just a few examples, Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno are both, by any reasonable definition, fanfic of the Bible. The Aeneid was an unauthorised sequel to, and essentially filled in the blanks of Aeneas' travels that we hear about in, the Iliad.

What about basically any Arthurian story, most notably Tennyson's The Lady of Shalott or White's The Once and Future King? Hell, one of Shakespeare's most famous plays is based on The Tragicall Historye of Romeus and Juliet, first published in 1562 by Arthur Brooke -- and Shakespeare is basically the most renowned playwright in the world.

Now, there's an argument to be made that none of the above 'counts' as fanfiction as they tell new stories -- but that same definition /must/ be applied to all fanfiction, which it clearly is not. Colloquially, we understand fanfiction to be any work which uses characters from a published source material. By this definition, the evidence and facts point towards fanfiction being a legitimate form of, and having the potential to be a *great* form of, literature.

** Fanfiction is literature. As [[/u/HelloBeautifulChild]] said, literature is simply a written story nothing more or less. It doesn't need to be published or praised or even read by anyone, it simply needs to be a written story. The three definitions given on google (and I hate myself for doing that "the dictionary defines blank as" :P) are; quality literature, published word and leaflets. Fanfiction falls somewhere between the three and I don't think you can deny that.

Now i'm going to talk about bastards.

A child is legitimate if it's parents are married, illegitimate if not. Yet a child regardless. That's how I see fanfiction. It's illegitimate literature.

A normal author, lets say JK, comes up with a character, plot, story, writes it, publishes it and sells it to the public and then uses that money to fund research into making magic real and then when I change my name to Mer...anyway...

A fanfiction author just comes up with a plot and writes it. It's not published (unless it's super kinky apparently) and it's not bought or sold. It's lacking that something intangible that makes it so people won't say they read fanfiction as willingly as a book, it's seen as lesser, it sits in the corner of the internet, not allowed in a bookshop, not given praise and often the author doesn't even have a real name.

However, like bastard children this can change. As [[/u/signorapaesior]] rightfully points out Shakespeare, Dante and basically everyone who ever wrote an Arthurian legend has committed the grave sin of writing Illegitimate fanfiction. So what's the difference? To me it is not only that they put a unique enough twist on the story that no one cared but it is also that they managed to sell their work in a way that doesn't infringe on the original authors rights. In the above case because they were either dead or God. In a more modern example that i've already mentioned EL James changed her fanfiction enough that it could be published. Or in other words, legitimised. If you had told someone you were reading Twilight BDSM fanfiction you'd be sectioned. 50 Shades is one of the biggest novels of this decade. The difference? It has been legitimised by money and law. Much like a bastard.

TL;DR Fanfiction is Bastard Literature.

** I don't think there are enough arguments against, and since a bunch of people agreeing isn't a debate so much as a circle jerk(Which isn't nearly as fulfilling and only ends with sticky hands) I will argue against it as a legitimate form of literature. As one pedant already pointed out literature is defined as written works, generally those of quality or lasting artistic merit.\\
Though from that point alone we run into issues. We can't sweepingly declare it all legitimate literature, I'm sure no one wants to defend that Hermione/Snape scat porn story(Please dont.) However some stories do so well as to arguably transcend canon and I find myself thinking, "Hey if these stories were based on original characters and a unique universe I'd still enjoy this as it's own tale." This does happen, and when it does I often comment as such to the author. But we run into the issue that Fanfiction for the most part is a work of love/lust/creepy stalking of the fans. They shaped their own story. But did they create the character? No they built off what existed. Did they shape the universe? Sometimes. But only rarely in a truly landscape changing way.

So we're using pre made characters, and a pre built universe and just making our own story. Cool. There are no original stories any more but thats a literature snobs argument so I won't make it. (I like Stephen King, a snob I ain't.)

The point of this somewhat circuitous post is that of course its literature, written works etc. The question is whether it's legitimate. I would have to say no. On the grounds that for better or worse you're using someone elses creations to build your work. You aren't creating anything truly unique, (except for that aforementioned scat story).

Now there is a caveat to this. As with all things there is no simple black and white. I would argue that the fanfiction that qualifies as legitimate literature are the ones that do what the many authors(Neil Gaiman, Mark Twain, Dante, Shakespeare) did. They wrote stories that used existing universe to create something new that went truly beyond the original in quality and scope.

So in summation(again). Mostly no. Occasionally yes. As in life, most things are shit, and that serves to make the diamonds gleam brighter. But that doesn't make the shit any better. And sometimes the diamonds turn out to be broken glass shards.

** Fanfiction is a legitimate form of literature because it is a written story. There are not other check marks something has to reach to be considered legitimate.

Literature doesn't have to be published in a book, in fact many stories never reach printed page. It also doesn't have to be 100% original, romance novels, teen fiction, and other cliche writing proves that. There also isn't a quality requirement to be literature, you can read or write something that is bad and it still be literature.

The definition of literature is vague for a reason, as literature is a form of art and expression. Due to its vagueness and the fact that a story is a story, no matter the inspiration, fanfiction is a legitimate form of literature.
