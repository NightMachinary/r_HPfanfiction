There was a Harry/Hermione fanfic I'd read a long time ago, but can't seem to remember it's name. What I do remember was that it involves Hermione leaving Britain (don't remember why) and returning some time afterwards. When she arrives she had realized she was in love with Harry, but is dismayed to find out that he has had a child with Luna. As far as I remember Harry and Luna aren't in a relationship, they are just raising the child (I can't remember if it's a boy or girl) together, and Harry and Hermione pursue a relationship together.

If someone could help me find this fanfic, I'd appreciate it very much.
