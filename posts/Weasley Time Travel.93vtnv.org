Are there any stories out there where one or both of the Weasley twins go back in time. Whether it be accidental or intentional, I'd like to see a fic like that.


** There's a surprising amount of Fred/Hermione going back to Marauders time stories with varying levels of quality

There's a great fic of George Weasley continuously traveling back in time and losing his sanity. I'm linking it the old fashioned way, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]]

If you're interested in either I'll link them

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8479548/1/George-Weasley-and-the-Computational-Error][George Weasley and the Computational Error]] by pisoprano. The first chapter is really George being irrational going back in time to attempt to prevent Fred's death. However, as the story progresses it actually becomes a decent read. Overall, the story is a unique read. This fic really emphasizes the Twins differences and their bond.

**** Nice. Have you read the 2nd and 3rd book? They really have a different feel towards them. I mean an extremely different feel.

***** It got way too meta really fast. Then it seems like the author had nowhere to go with the story and gave up

****** Yeah, the 1st book has direction while the later books went way off tangent. I kinda wanted to stop reading the 2nd one at some point but I just kept going for the laughs. It actually entertaining by the 3rd book. Somehow I began to follow the story and the author still updates it.
