*** "Am I wrong in thinking that canon states that only Harry could kill Voldemort? "

You could read it that way I guess, but I've always read that part of the prophecy as being related to the Scarcrux more than anything. Voldemort and Harry can't die permanently while the other lives because of the Scarcrux. It offers both protection from the killing each other permanently. Hence why Harry needed to 'die' in DH like he did.

Remove the Scarcrux and the other Horocruxes, and I'd argue Voldemort is fair game for whoever can off him. There's no real reason it has to be Harry who has to kill him after the Scarcrux is removed.

OPs scenario is theoretically possible if you've gotten rid of the Scarcrux and the other Horocruxes.

**** However, couldn't he be killed just by any killing curse? Or does it have to be Tom's specifically, not just any old curse? Because it seems like the killing curse essentially sends the soul on to the afterlife. In which case, any should be used. Neither can live while the other survives seems to allude to enjoying life. Essentially it's a circle, Voldemort's fixated on Harry, Harry tries to defend himself, Voldemort's retaliates, and so on just repeated. As a result, it doesn't end until one of them is completely dead. This also the same reason why I hate how Albus Dumbledore believes that only Harry can kill Voldemort. It really just seems that the only reason that Voldemort's alive, is because of his shattered soul. Thusly, if all of them were destroyed, theoretically anyone could kill him.

***** Pretty much. I don't think it's necessary for Voldemort to be the one to kill Harry at all via killing curse. It could be anyone, but I suppose it made the most thematic and dramatic sense in DH. As I said above I don't think Harry has to be the one to kill Voldemort either. Remove the Horocruxes and the rat bastard is fair game to anyone who can off him. Dumbles was wrong about this one.

Rowling wound using a version of Campbell's Heroes Journey for her books though, so it was always going to be Harry to do the deed and face Tom. It could have happened a lot of other ways, but I tend to believe it was more about a specific story structure than anything.

" which case, any should be used. Neither can live while the other survives seems to allude to enjoying life.

Yup. The only way it ends if the other Horocruxes are destroyed and the Scarcrux goes bye bye. When that happens one can kill either Harry or Voldemort and complete the prophecy.

*** The Prophecy has so many dozens of interpretations. In this AU, Ron and Hermione could have called themselves the Left and Right hand of Potter. Or, Harry could have learned of the prophecy earlier than usual and named Dumbledore's Army "Hands of Potter" instead. Or he could hire people to do it.

He could lead it up with "Hermione! Make him stop, he's saying it wrong!" That means Hermione would be operating under Harry's orders, thus acting as his hand.

  While writing other Harry-after-DoM-debacle-gets-his-life-together story, I got this piece of conversation, which didn't fit anywhere. So, I am putting it here just as a separate one-shot. In my original story, they found out that Ginny is in fact a daughter of Lily Potter, Harry's sister. This story may very well be canonical (Hinny), but I haven't mentioned anything about their relationship, so it could be either. In the canonical world, it would be just that they were friends before they were more than friends (and Ms Rowling as usual forgot to mention any parts of relationship other than snogging).

For instance, after Harry survives Voldemort's attack at Godric's Hollow, he becomes Voldemort's main obsession afterwards (other than regaining his body of course). But Voldemort also survives the attack at Godric's Hollow, so for the rest of the series, Harry has to live in constant fear of when Voldemort will try to strike next.

*** Lol, I like to use canon to tilt the rules.

I could see the above scenario working though, unless I'm forgetting a vital piece of the prophesy. The prophesy stated that such-and-such kid had a power the Dark Lord knew not. Dumbledore theorized that power was love. Friendship is a form of love, Voldemort doesn't seem to understand friendship as he seems to have minions rather than friends. Granger would tutor anyone but her friendship with Weasley and Potter kind of gave her a captive audience whether they were fully willing or not. I don't think her friendship with Weasley would have been strong enough without Potter being the adhesive to hold them together at first. Therefore, With the two of them plus Neville, she has ample practice tutoring people without thinking about it. It becomes second nature to her rather than a one off fluke in first year.

That is to say, I think this scenario would work as long as the horcruxes were all previously destroyed. Otherwise, I feel Voldemort would go back to being a disembodied-spirit-thing again.
