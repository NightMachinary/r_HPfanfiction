Not such an Old Man with crinkles and a tired Body and possible illneses, but more like a Gray-haired harry who is still able to perfrom daily activities, but is just older in appearance. As for the Younger OC, no underage. Im looking for Fics that have a Young Girl gets the lover of an Older Man. Doesnt matter if they fall for each other or just Sex Partners. Maybe she is his assistant. I would find it good, if Harry at the beginning just see her as his Assistant or "Friend", but she gets interested in him, possibly seducing him and reawaken his Libido, after having been "dry" for so long Years.

Doesnt matter if it fits Canon, so if he is with Ginny or not.

It doesnt have to be an OC, if it fits, im ok with a Canon character.

** linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past by S'TarKan)

In which a creepy older widower (Harry Potter) with an unhealthy obsession grooms a poor pre-teen girl (Ginny Weasley) for later romantic involvement because of her physical resemblance to his dead wife.

This is exactly what you're looking for.
