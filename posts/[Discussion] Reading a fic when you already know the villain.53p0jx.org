What would you think about a fic that had a heavy dollop of dramatic irony through-out the entire story. I was talking with some people about the possibility of a fic where you already know who the villain is, with the plot leading up to the 'climax.' Thoughts?


** That's sort of what I did with my fic. Revealed the villain in chapter 10 and had the rest of the fic focused on the tension of the protagonists not realising how much danger they were in. I think it worked fairly well, lots of people mentioned that they were on the edge of their seat or had to put the fic down for a bit because they felt very anxious, but some people definitely felt I should have reached the climax quicker than I did, which is probably fair. I really enjoyed it from an author's point of view, but I suspect it was too frustrating for some people to read.

*** Yeah! I thinking viewing the plot from the most important angles, namely the protagonist and antagonist, would be interesting and more importantly, the right amount of challenge.

**** I think as long as there's extra tension beyond the characters simply finding out whodunnit, it works. For me, it was that one protagonist didn't realise they were in a close relationship with the villain, and the other was being will fully ignorant because he didn't want to face the fact that it could be a friend. The story has to take on a very human element above action for it to work. It's NOT everyone's cup of tea, at all, but the reviews I had for chapter 10 and the climax itself were just the best.

** If you have compelling characters, you can make it work.

*** Besides personality, is there something you've seen or think that makes them compelling?

**** The Villain Problem occurs when the villain of the story is more proactive/successful than the hero, who's reacting to whatever the villain does. The Problem is that readers may root for the villain, the guy who's actually good at what he does.

Interesting characters do stuff. They have a thing they're good at. It may not be the thing required to succeed in the plot, but they have something.

** It could definitely work, but the timing can be kind of iffy. It's really hard to strike a balance between revealing the villain to the characters too soon and revealing the villain too late. And even if you do manage to, from your opinion, you'll always get people who think otherwise.

That being said, I love fics like this, and it always keeps me in suspense. Unfortunately, I have a really hard time dealing with suspense like that so I usually skip ahead just to find out when the big reveal is going to happen haha.

** That can totally work, but then the tension from your story will need to originate from something else other than the "who's the bad guy?" question.

I think the best way would be to write your story in such a way that you really focus on selling the villain's competence and making the reader believe that he really might win. It would also go a massively long way to make him so sympathetic that the readers are torn between supporting his plans and actions and doing the same to the other side.
