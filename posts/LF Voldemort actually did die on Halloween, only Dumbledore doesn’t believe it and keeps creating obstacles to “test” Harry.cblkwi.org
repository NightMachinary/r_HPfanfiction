If that's too specific I'll also go for fics with just the first part of Voldemort being dead.

Edit: is “A Different Halloween” the only fic with this premise?


** Linkffn(A different Halloween)

Harry and Lily aren't at home on Halloween, Dudley BWL.

**** I never quite understood the hate for Robst. He's not the greatest author to be sure, but he's competent, he knows his material, and he produced a wide range of stories (though admittedly with a rather limited number of pairings), and did it all for free. I quite like some of his work, not all of it, but some of it, and I'm glad he made what He did.

  Could a chance meeting change history? What would a different Halloween in 1981 mean for wizarding Britain?
