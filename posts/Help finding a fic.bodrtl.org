:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that Harry was the grandson of Voldemort or something and Voldemort entered Harry's mind via the mental connection to tell him to become a better challenge I think? And Harry visits Ollivander's but ends up dueling Bellatrix in a very crazy fashion. I remember he talked to Blaise in the fic and was quite overpowered. I've been searching this for years so any help is welcome :)

edit: I'm not sure about the grandson part but everything else I remember. Also Harry was dark in the story I think. I remember he used dark magic against Bella and he reminded everyone of Voldemort? I think
