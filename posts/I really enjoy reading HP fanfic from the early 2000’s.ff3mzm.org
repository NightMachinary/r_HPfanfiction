Because those authors are truly writing their own endings and have quite a different interpretation of the series. I'm not saying that there isn't any good non canon fanfics after the last few books were published. It's just a different story and experience all together. Like Hermione ends up with Harry. Or Dumbledore doesn't die. Or Snape doesn't have his redemption moment. Because that is what was assumed from the first books. This is obviously the case in every fandom, but since there is TONS of HP fics, there is so much variety.

Edit: Oh dear, I'm probably not going to post any recs here, because I get really nervous about it. Its a weird thing to be worried about I know, but the last few times I recommended fics to friends, it didn't end well. But if you are looking for fics, you should search by published date prior to 2007. Maybe if I come up with a list I feel comfortable sharing, I might make another post about it again.


** The big issue with old fics is that quite a few of their themes and tropes have been overused, which makes them a chore to read. Like, a lot of the classics are really not enjoyable anymore.

*** Another issue is that many of the fans may have been super super young therefore their writing isn't good or they don't have a very fleshed out story

** I agree, I LOVE these fics, but I honestly don't know too many of them, but I would like to.

I think the only one I can remember right now that I've read is Book of Morgan le Fey [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1634421/1/The-Book-of-Morgan-Le-Fey]]

*** I loved this fic so much back in the day when it was on Checkmated. I found some old emails with the author not too long ago. I started writing my own stories between OOTP and HBP and I remember how thrilling it all was when the new books came out. Thanks for linking this!

** I avidly read HP fanfic in high school, I'd spend hours and hours on fanfiction.net and then one day I just stopped, the end of the series happened and in the 15 or so years since then I haven't looked at a single one. I was still a fan of HP but HP fanfic wasn't my jam anymore. Then a few weeks ago I was randomly thought about it, decided to check it out. I love the variety and choice of HP fics available but also... part of me misses the ones I used to read, for the exact reasons you said. I remember there was one where the golden trio left Hogwarts to defeat Voldie and publicly battle death eaters (before we knew anything about horcruxes) and there was explosions in train stations and it was all very exciting, I was convinced that's where the books were going to go. Anyway, I've gone down memory lane but just wanted to say. I agree.

*** Just wanted to say I love your flair. I read the books at 12 for the first time and denied being a gryffindor because I didn't want it to seem like I was lying. I bounced around all the houses except hufflepuff for years. Around age 15 I accepted my gryffindor-ness and I'm glad to confidently say I would've been sorted as an 11 year old and now. Meanwhile my friend is a ravenclaw now but claimed hufflepuff until last year! It's so amazing how we change (or don't!). Sorry I'm ranting but if you don't mind, what house where you at 11?

**** At 11 I probably would've been a Ravenclaw primary and Hufflepuff secondary who wants to be a Slytherin, but now at 19 I'm a Gryffindor primary and Hufflepuff secondary who proudly claims Gryffindor. Puberty did more than help me grow taller I reckon. It's a massive plot twist, I know.

** Im the opposite, most stories from before the series was finished bug me because they usually wind up being hugely AU due to "future" books.

If I'd been around the FF scene back then I'd probably have enjoyed then like I do for a few fandoms now, but having the full series available and then trying to read older fics sits wrong to my palate

** There was a different kind of creativity back in the pre-OotP days when the plot hadn't been narrowed down by the prophecy and the horcruxes that I really miss.

AU's these days are what-ifs with one point of departure from canon (eg. What of Hermione left the tent with Ron) or complete rehashes of JK's plot structure where some event (Sirius got out of Azkaban early, Harry got a missive from Gringotts and massive goblin help) provides the protagonists a way to zoom through the horcrux quest.

** One of my fave series is the Jennifer Craw series. Whilst there's a lot of original characters the world building that goes on is really good and the different takes on magic make them excellent books in there own right.

First book but there are 23 100k+ books, enough to keep you going for a good while. The first book is probably my least fave so well worth sticking with it as the complexity of plots and characters improve with each book written

** I wonder if I could make myself read these fics. For some strange reason I can't read the beginning of such a fic without going,'oh that's not what happened..' I should maybe break this habit. Though there are a couple of fics from early 2000s that I loved more than what Rowling said in post book pieces she wrote. Maybe it's a matter of style. I think I could read anything and enjoy it if I liked the writing style. You're lucky you love hthose fics. There's something nostalgic about them.

** What would be people's optimal breakaway from Cannon? Like everything from GOF and before? I'm sure most have a preference for when to cut cannon things out. For me GOF is a good cutoff if needed for cannon it seems to give authors the chance to bring in help from abroad or for others to escape to get there schools depending on how the story goes.

** Couple of recommendations from ones that were started pre-OoTP and show it via significant changes from canon:

- linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent) is a Hero's Journey story that manages to give Harry a significant Power He Knows Not that could actually defeat Voldemort without ridiculous levels of powering up or Phlebotinum (Elder Wand much?). It also fleshes out Moody's backstory and creates one of the cooler villains I've seen in HP fanfiction. Unfortunately unfinished and abandoned, but it closes out its second act strongly.

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Third Key: Reloaded) seems to take a lot of influence from D&D and traditional high fantasy. I'm honestly not a huge fan of this work, because it doesn't do a great job of actually showing character growth, but it was interesting enough to read through to the end and definitely does some things that I haven't seen in any other fanfiction.

** I'll mention Nightmares of Futures Past. It's still unfinished (not actually abandoned), but started before book 7 was published, so it has an unredeemed Snape, no Horcrux in Harry's head, etc. No idea what will eventually happen to Dumbledore, since it's only reached fourth year.
