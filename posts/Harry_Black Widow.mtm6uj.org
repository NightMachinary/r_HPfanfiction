Are there any good Harry Potter/Avengers crossovers where Harry and Black Widow are a couple


** Pretty much all of them?

I mean, she seems to be the go-to, which saddens me. While I like her, variety would be good.

Here's one of my favs, it has a very OP Harry.

#+begin_quote
  Harry finally defeats Voldemort, but only after the world has been destroyed. Harry has his vengeance, but gets pulled into Voldemort's ritual and is dragged with his body to an alternate universe. First Chapter sets up the first scene. You can skip it reasonably safely. - Complete - Now up on webnovel under my original author name, burnable.
