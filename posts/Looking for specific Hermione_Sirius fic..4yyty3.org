** Why?? Just... WHY?!

I always hated pairings like this.

It's pedophilia at its max. Sirius Black is old enough to /be in the worst prison in the world/ when Hermione /Isn't even in Hogwarts yet!/

*** Yeah no it's not pedophilia.

I love it in time travel fics, and more rarely when Hermione is a grown consenting adult (as in, not a student // over twenty, compared to both of them being the same age in time travel)

Why are you even in this thread though, if you feel so strongly about this ship? Honest question, I've been seeing this happen a bit lately and it's confusing.

**** The post says nothing about time travel- so yes, it is pedophillia. And even if she is a "Grown consenting adult" she is still old enough to be Sirius's daughter, as malebron pointed out.

And im on this because I like to talk about the things I don't like, and try to understand why people enjoy this.

***** Pedophilia is children. This request does not state how old she is. It doesn't even say she's a teenager. I understand the squick factor, but honestly, calling it pedophilia is entirely incorrect.

If it was Sirius with a ten year old, yes, I'd absolutely agree. But an age gap does not automatically mean something illegal or immoral. Tonks and Remus, a canon couple, had a thirteen year age gap, and very very rarely do I see someone complaining about that.

****** At the time of his death, Sirius Black is 37 years old. Hermione is a teenager. A sexual relationship with this much of an age gap, quite frankly, disgusts me.

******* My grandparents had an age difference of 20 years. Married at 20/40. Stayed married for close to 50 years, died within a week of each other.

I've got no problem with Sirius and Hermione starting a relationship post-war. Or once she's of age, if the war goes on.

******** I personally think it disgusting with the age gap between Sirius and Hermione, but I won't continue arguing.

*** I don't know why this is so popular. I love Sirius. I like him to get his end away too because the poor bugger doesn't get any in canon. But not with someone young enough to be his daughter.

Each to their own I suppose.
