looking for a fic where Harry grows to hate Ron because Harry loves Hermione and because of his life with the dursleys harry doesn't understand what love is or for some similar reason and because of this Harry slowly grows to hate Ron because he wants Hermione but does not realize it, endgame HHR.


** A lot of HHr has Harry hating Ron, but he doesn't grow into it so much as realise it during chapter 1 (with accompanying exposition). Since he's such a magnanimous guy, he gives Ron a chance all the way until chaper 3 before blowing up at him (with accompanying exposition) and Hermione realises Harry is wonderful and Ron is a dunderhead and cue the slow role to an incomplete WIP.

This really took me back to Freddy Got Fingered, in which Tom Green and his dad repeat "proud" to each other a half a dozen times.

*** Inquisitor! :( I think it would be an interesting change of pace to read a Harry who isn't exactly Mr. Perfect Two Shoes. Like James incarnate, or something, it would be a cool story.
