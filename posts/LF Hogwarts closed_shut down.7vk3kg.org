Fics where Hogwarts is closed or shut down for some reason. Bonus, if the students are transferred to a foreign school like Beaxbatons.


** I believe it was briefly shut down in linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) but I'm not actually sure. And I don't feel like checking lol whatever

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
