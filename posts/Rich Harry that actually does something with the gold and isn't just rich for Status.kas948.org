Maybe he creates a bunch of Magical charities so Orphans never suffer, maybe he builds a Castle and funds an army to take on Voldemort. Maybe he finds the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth and hires Yojimbo, and the power the dark lord knows not is Yojimbo using Zanmato. Maybe he learns the Gil Toss ability and beats Voldemort by throwing money at him, literally.

Harry being rich for the sake of it makes no sense. "Yep, he's Lord everything, but what does he do with the money other than act like a Preening Peacock" sort of thing. I want to see rich Harry use his wealth for something productive and interesting plot wise.


** A Place Apart - He buys a damned island and starts planning a new country. WIP, updating weekly (sunday night/monday morning ish). Obligatory warning for Super!Harry

The Little Child To Lead Him - Harry takes a business class (a new elective) and decides to start an orphanage. Also adopts his new cousin when Petunia dies in childbirth. There's some odd stuff in here, but it's a decent fluffy read with dad!harry.

A Brand New Start - Time travel fix-it fic where Harry calls himself Hydrus for some fucking reason. Uses his money to start an orphanage for squibs and normalize muggle tech in the magical world. Pretty over the top, but readable. The sequel is... less so.

Say A Prayer - Larger series with a very minor MCU crossover. Warning for crack-like heavy bashing in the first installment, but it'll mostly fade by part two. Not for people who like Ginny. The money thing starts later but he partially funds a +spoiler+ Wizarding Space Program A Very fun read if you can make it through the ridiculousness of part one.

  Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he'll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he's been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way. Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash. cross-posted on FFN.

So he buys a house and fills it with books, cauldrons, etc. then Plot happens and other students need a place to stay, and if we're all homeschooling ourselves maybe we should get a tutor, and before he knows it he's accidentally founded a school that's outgrown the house.

HPMoR is an AU where Harry was raised by Petunia and an OC, where he learnt how to science. It's pretty much just an outlet for the author to spout his views on the real world, what he thinks about religions, things like that. It's really not recommended to everyone, because while it is well written, the content is... not super interesting for everyone?
