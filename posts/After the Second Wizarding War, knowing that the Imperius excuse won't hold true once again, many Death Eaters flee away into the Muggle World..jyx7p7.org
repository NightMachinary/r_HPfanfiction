With the ability to Apparate (possibly cross continental), Obliviate and Confundo, any Wizard is a nightmare to track down. Identity theft is simple enough and any Wizard can lie low and settle down into a comfortable life in the Muggle World. Only by toeing the Statute of Secrecy will Obliviators be sent, and it is easy enough for a learned Wizard to silence all Muggle witnesses.

Ofc, 'lie low' is the keyword...


** Given that we know taboo's exist, putting a taboo on a rarely used spell like "Obliviate" would catch most of the ones that stayed in the UK/Europe. There's also the fact that most of them will have never interacted with the muggle world outside of attacking it.

As long as the story takes those points into account and explains them away, maybe following a couple that managed to do it successfully while all their associates show up in the paper that they occasionally steal from Diagon or Hogsmeade

*** Obliviate isn't a rarely used spell - there are Obliviator Squads after all. And even considering that I don't think you can put a Taboo on a spell.

  "...the name's been jinxed, Harry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance --- it's how they found us in Tottenham Court Road!... It was only people who were serious about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared use it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, anyone who says it is trackable --- quick-and-easy way to find Order members!"

Also, non-interaction isn't that much of a roadblock. Easy access to identity theft, mind control and memory editing makes it a minor, maybe even a skippable obstacle.

**** If putting a taboo on a spell was feasible, it wouldn't make sense that they don't put one at least on the Unforgivables.

We're getting deep into the area of headcanons now, so feel free to disagree with me here, but I think there was something specific about Voldemort's name that allowed the creation of a taboo on it. Perhaps he was able to do so because it was a name he created for himself or something.

**** However, they know who is in the obliviator squads, so they can eliminate anyone that's supposed to be able to use the spell. For other people it's only a minor inconvenience if an Auror turns up asking them about it.

** That would actually be quite interesting. I can see it happening, too. All the remaining Death Eaters meeting up and admitting that the 'Muggle lovers' have won this round, but they'll go into hiding and plot and prepare and come back when they least expect it - "If our Lord could wait ten years for his return, so will we." and all that.

Plenty of interesting ways to take it, too. I can half imagine a half PurebloodWank, half MuggleWank fic where the Death Eater Sleeper Cells use the MuggleWank style Muggle Governments as a front to hide behind and teach them some of the PurebloodWank 'Family Grimoire' type secret magic knowledge to help them fight the Wizarding World magicals - really put the 'Muggle Innovation' trope shoe on the other foot. That could be real fun to write. Definitely adding that to the ideas list. Good prompt. :)

*** it definetly would be interesting, but who would head the movement, because they don't have a centralized leader in Riddle anymore.

On the other side of the side, Harry is the owner of all three hallows, and if they manage to get away, i cant imagine him destroying the elder wand, he probably keeps it and we get a real OP Harry.

A post war hardened Harry would be terryfying in this scenario

**** They wouldn't need one. Hell, it'd be better for them not to have one. So long as they have a unified mandate - 'restore pureblood power' - then operating as separate cells would be the only way to guarantee that Legilimency doesn't take and ruin them all. Even if Legilimency only reads your immediate thoughts, it's not like interrogation is hard and very few people can resist the "Quick, don't think of a pink fluffy elephant" approach. But you absolutely cannot give up information you don't know.
