:END:
It's a crack fic really. Draco manages to beat Harry at Quidditch by the Grace of God, and Harry is so angry; that he goes back in time, does seven years in Hogwarts as a Slytherin, becomes loved by everyone, marries Narcissa Malfoy to ensure Draco is destroyed from existence, and then the two of them go back forwards in time.
