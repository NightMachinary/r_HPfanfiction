So I started writing this a few hours ago and just finished. If I don't publish now, it'll never get published, so it's completely unedited. That's why it's a bit weird, starting off with quotes from the book and then devolving into a quick overview of Ron's teen years. Anyway, I guess this is more of a prompt than a real fic, so feel free to take it and use it and develop it. I'm not trans, nor am I close to anyone who is, so I have no idea where the inspiration came from.

** I completely disagree with naming the first child "Willow or Wilma". It should be "Ginevra".

Then the last child, their first boy finally, would be named "William".

Weasleys seemed to name their children after ex kings or queens, so Anne, Elisabeth, Victoria were likely.

*** Yeah, I know. I thought about it - but I wanted to keep the names similar without completely just using feminine forms.

George became Gwen, which comes from Guinevere, which Ginevra also does. I figured Felicia/Felicity was plausable as a wizarding name. Charlotte's a nice name in it's own right, with plenty of history behind it. Persis - ok, I chose it only because it's similar to Percy.

  Peeves, though he was nasty about everything else--ickle firsties and orphan girls--got it immediately. For all six years of Harry's Hogwarts tenure, he dropped water balloons on the heads of anyone who misgendered her. Professor Binns never quite figured it out, but he didn't know any student's name. Nearly Headless Nick gallantly and somewhat awkwardly called her lady and tried to hold open doors for her, despite the fact that he couldn't open them. Snape called Harry "Mr. Potter" for all seven years that he was in Harry's life. Around year three, Ron stopped counting the detentions he got for his increasingly sarcastic responses to this.

** Just one thing.

Binding your chest down to make it flatter is the worst way of doing it. It may end well, but it often ends up causing medical problems. I'd imagine transfiguring them would do a safer job, if done by someone who knows what they're doing.

Also, I have a hard time believing that wizarding societies would be as adverse to homo- and transsexuality as muggle societies.

*** Yeah, I know. Ron and Hermione wouldn't though. It was the nineties. It's also a bad idea to take potions made by you and your friends, especially hormone blocking ones. I imagine a contraceptive potion that stops periods wouldn't be too hard for teenagers to do, but on the whole in my story, it was a little bit dangerous.

I think transfigering a human body at their level would be very dangerous. Hermione was right in that messing around with a growing body is dangerous, especially for untrained wizard and witches.

Really? The wizarding society is quite backwards in some ways. They still wear robes, for goodness sake. Wearing jeans or even trousers gets you looked down upon. Dumbledore hardly was out loud and proud. You get issues with changing your identity, too. Plus, there's the whole male line thing. How does the eldest son but not the eldest child deal with suddenly no longer being the eldest son? It wouldn't be a problem for the Weasleys, but imagine a 100 or so years ago.

I would think that messing around with any body is dangerous, which is why I stated that it should be done by someone who knows what they're doing. Also, consuming potions made by your friends is safe, if the're done right. Doesn't matter if they block or alter hormones. If the potion is made for that and functions this way, why not?

First off, clothing says very little about the /"progress"/ of a society. It only tells you about values.

Robes have very many different variants to it. In the real world robes have a spectrum from very closed-up and covering forms, to very revealing and freeing forms. However, Rowling described them as fully-covering, and Pottermore goes so far as to call the old-style robes a form of cultural rebellion against intruding muggle fashion (and therefore values). So, according to Pottermore it isn't so much "being backwards" and more "trying to preserve culture".

Because sexuality wasn't really a theme in HP.

#+end_quote

I'm not sure what you're referring to. Though I'd think that wizarding society would be a bit over-sensible with identity, given that Polyjuice and metamorphing is a thing. However, if you're referring to identity in terms of "I'm homosexual" - as in, defining traits of you, I don't remember there being any canon evidence for that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nope, there isn't the whole male line thing. The only "heir" situation we know of in canon is within the House of Black, and we know they were a bit hyper about their heritage, legacies and the like. Hardly something to base a definite statement on. Also, given how many women were and are in powerful positions in the wizarding world, I would assume it isn't as backwards in this regard as so many want to make it out to be. We have a Deputy Headmistress, a Director of the DMLE and an Undersecretary of the Minister, as well as the last Minister being a woman (Bagnold).

Bottomline, as so often any expansion is legitimate. But I would argue that a case can be made for a wizarding world that is, in its own way, more progressive than the muggle world of the UK in the 90s. In any case, it is definitely /its own culture/ and can therefore not be measured on the same standards as our muggle culture.

***** You make fair points. I guess my interpretation of the wizarding world is best described as a personal headcanon I guess?

I can't remember, but I think my assumption about the whole male heir thing was because if it were merely the eldest who inherited, gender aside, then that would mean they would have to keep the family name upon marriage. Otherwise, we wouldn't have so many names on the sacred 28 gone. As far as I know - the Black, Gaunt, Prewett, Crouch and possibly the Lestrange families are extinct in the male line, according to the wikia.

****** Then again, if we assume that traditional wizarding culture had the woman as equal, either a matriarch or a patriarch of a family could be valid. She'd just keep her name and make her husband take hers.

But I have to stress that this is all very much my own way of filling the gaps. I always assumed that Christmas isn't an old tradition with wizards. I always interpreted it as a counter-culture to the purebloods who celebrate Yule. It just never made sense to me why wizards and witches would celebrate a holiday of a religion that likes them on the stake, crispy on the outside. And its thanks to monotheism that we have/had such a harsh separation of woman and man in all monotheistic societies. If you would rethink the whole culture with the assumption that christianity hasn't played as much of a morally guiding role, you may end up with a much more tolerant society when it comes to gender-roles and sexuality.

  Well, this started off me exploring the idea of genderbent Weasleys - a bunch of badass Weasley women. Somehow it turned into exploring Ron instead. Names: Either Willow or Wilma, Billie for short. Charlotte, Charle for short. Persis, Felicia(Felix) and Gwen, Rhonda, and Reginal (Gin).
