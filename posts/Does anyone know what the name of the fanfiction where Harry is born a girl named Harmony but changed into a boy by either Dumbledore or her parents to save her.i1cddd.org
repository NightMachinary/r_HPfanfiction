:END:
This is a story i found when i was young and was wondering if anyone knew where i could find it again? its a rather strange story where the magic holding Harmony in a Male form wears off in fourth year and she has to use a potion to still appear as Harry but only her face. She will learn to be an animagus with Ginny, Luna and draco (who actually turns into a Ferrat) while being taught DADA by some handsome young guy.

I cant remember if it was every finished or not but any help would be appreciated.
