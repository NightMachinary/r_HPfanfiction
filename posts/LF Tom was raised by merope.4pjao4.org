Except the one where Tom ends up being the Minister of Magic and Harry ends up being some sort of anti-hero who kills criminals. (I have read that one)

** Another one I remembered is called "Rumpelstiltskin" linkffn(11255094). It also has a side story (though, it's not about Tom or Merope, really), but still might be worth checking out, called, "Guess my name" linkffn(11400505)

  He was all she ever wanted, and she knew exactly how she could have him - even if it would not be real. Then a stranger made her an offer she could not refuse, for a price that seemed like a joke at the time. Was it really just a teasing remark though? Or would her deal cost her more than she ever wanted to give up?

  Companion to Rumpelstiltskin. Marvolo Gaunt is released from Azkaban and returns home - only to find things very different from the way he left them.

  JK Rowling said: "If Merope had lived and raised Voldemort, he would have turned out to be much different, probably a better person." But just how much different? And how much different would Harry be if he was given a life without the expectation of saving the world? What if his hero-complex was still intact, but so twistedly dark, that he goes through desperate means to hide it?
