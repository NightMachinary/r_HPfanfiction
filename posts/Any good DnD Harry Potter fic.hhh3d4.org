Looking for any good fics where Harry uses the magic system from Dungeons and Dragons.


** Harry Potter and the Physical Adept by HaikenEdge, kind off all role playing games but I think it's primary d&d. Not a personal favourite because it's just dark for no reason and contributes nothing to the plot or character depth but I would at least give it a go.

** These are the ones I've got bookmarked.

Rose Peta-Lorum's series is pretty good, if a little dark in the later fics - [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6835726]]

Harry is trained by and becomes a D&D paladin - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9203082/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Knight-of-the-Radiant-Heart]]

Nat20 is the classic D&D HP fic - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/]]

These are real characters from Baldur's Gate - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12280256/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Ranger-and-the-Miniature-Giant-Space-Hamster]]

Harry is a Ranger. Obviously - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7513532/1/Ranger-Harry]]

Not terribly good, but alright - [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12246515/1/The-Bard-of-Hogwarts]]

*** I've read the Natural 20 already but I'll definitely check the rest out. Thanks!

**** Sure, Happy to Help. Rose Peta-Lorum is probably the closest to Nat20 in gaming terms, she's a similarly equipped caster, but the Giant Space Hamster is similar in comedic tone.
