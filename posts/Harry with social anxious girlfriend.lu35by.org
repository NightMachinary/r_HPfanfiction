:END:
I'm looking for fics similiar to the first chapter of this [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13814963/1/Rise-Like-Lions-After-Slumber]]

Where a girl (no Hermione, Ginny, or Luna! OCs are fine!) has a crush on Harry but is too scared and shy to approach him, thinking that he wouldnt want anything to do with someone like her. Bonus points if said girl is a loner, a loser and has little to no friends, low selfesteem and gets bullied.


** I kinda like this idea: the thought of an OC, a canon blank slate (see Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, Su Li, et cetera), or a canon character with little known canon traits (such as Katie Bell) actually being shy and not the gun ho political/confident juggernaut seen in typical Indie Harry fics is intriguing (especially in Daphne's case).

Is this good? I remember reading this a couple months ago, it's a nice story.
