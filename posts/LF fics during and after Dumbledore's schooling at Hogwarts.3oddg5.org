I've realized I've read NO fics during Dumbledore's schooling at Hogwarts... Anyone have a favorite? Included relationship with Grindelwald is a-ok and welcome.


** If you can see the DLP WBA, than [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=24398][The Last Stand by AlbusPHolmes]] is easily my favorite of that era.
