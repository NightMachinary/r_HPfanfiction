About a year ago I started writing ‘Emerald Flames,' a Regulus is alive fanfic, because I realized how tragic his story was. I'm not really an avid writer nor do I write as a hobby. However, I do write on occasion when I come up with something and this was one of my works I came up with.

Considering that I don't have a practice in writing or have a ‘writing style', I am certain there are grammar issues or holes in the story that had bound to slip pass me. There was some positive reviews so far, but I would like to know what more people think of it.

The official summary is very ambiguous, but I really did not know what to come up with.

Or if anyone prefers,

Edit: Also certain aspects were probably written somewhat forcefully, but I'll write them out if anyone else complains about it.

  Life is a strange thing. A child could be born full of potential to face the world that lay before them. They would go through life and see the world through wondrous eyes. They could take the world like a storm than cater their own history as time goes on. Or a child could grow to make their own story from the shadows than turned into a forgotten part of history. The untold legacies that are left within either a few or left the world along with their makers.Though, even hidden stories could sometimes be revealed again.
