This was a crack fic but I enjoyed it. Basically MOD!Harry was bored so he created a parallel universe of his first year at Hogwarts and pulled all the souls out of their current time line (reincarnation exists) to populate it.

So Harry and Voldemort (who is no longer insane) set up this universe and make a few small changes (due to being drunk) e.g the sorting hat is replaced with a kettle and Ravenclaw is now Ravenflaw.

I don't think there were any pairings.

Other things I remember:

- Harry and Voldemort trick Dumbledore into thinking Harry is Voldemort's son.
- Voldemort imperio's Dumbledore into giving him the DADA job.
- Sirius and Bellatrix are rescued from Azkaban and get their memories of their past lives back.

I can't remember much more but if anyone knows it please let me know.

  For Harry, the 'next great adventure' isn't really all that great. After two-thousand years of dealing with the whining souls of the dead, he decides to spice things up a bit...by returning to his first year at Hogwarts. Crackfic! MOD!Harry Darkish!Harry GaryStu!Harry with a twist. NO Bashing!

** Wow, that sounds like a literal fucking nightmare. Unintended existential horror at its best. I'd probably immediately slit my own throat if I learned I'm just a puppet of two insane gods who are bored.
