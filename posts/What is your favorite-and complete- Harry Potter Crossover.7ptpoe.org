*** It's recommended very often, do you think that someone could read and enjoy it without being in the Firefly fandom and maybe just reading a short summary?

** linkffn(It's All Relative on the Hellmouth by dellacouer)

HP/BtVS, Harry/Buffy (I think)

I remember this as the only BtVS crossover I actually enjoyed. Everyone is mostly in character and the romance isn't overbearing. Don't expect miracles though, this was written in 2007.

Author has also written a HP/X-Men story, that is my absolutely favorite crossover, ever. Unfortunately abandoned since 2011. linkffn(Harry Potter and the World that Waits)

  SG-1/HP X-Over If Isis hadn't died in the canopic jar, things could have turned out very differently. Harry goes to the airport at the wrong time. What will the wizarding world do if Harry leaves Earth? These three chapters will spawn two different stories.

** I didn't find Ascension to be remarkable at all. As for me, narrowing it down to completed fics only leaves a few. Perhaps Denarian Trilogy or Browncoat, Green Eyes
