I feel the urge to read some nice fanfiction featuring Blaise.

Please only *completed* stories or series!

Ratings: *ffn M; Ao3 E* (if it's a series it can start lower but should go up later on).

Any partner is fine.

*Creature!Blaise* is welcome.

No word count restrictions but long fics are more satisfying.


** This is the only decent fic I can think of with Blaise as the main character: linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6018171/1/The-Fine-Art-of-Poisoning]]) Longer one-shot.

You wouldn't happen to know a few good Blaise fics yourself, would you?

*** Gosh, finally! I actually lost hope to get any recommendations at all. Thank you!

Regarding your question, unfortunately not. He got a big part in *A very Slytherin Harry* series, starting with link ao3(Amethyst by geoffaree), (ongoing series!) which is the reason for my urge. It's well written with a great storyline so far and I love how they write Blaise.

**** Apparently I've no idea how to use the bot (I read the 'how to'). May be next time.
