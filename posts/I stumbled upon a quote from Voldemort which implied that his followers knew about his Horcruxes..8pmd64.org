“And then I ask myself, but how could they have believed I would not rise again? *They, who knew the steps I took, long ago, to guard myself against mortal death?* They, who had seen proofs of the immensity of my power in the times when I was mightier than any wizard living?


** They kinda-knew, kinda-didn't. Basically, he'd clearly, unambiguously boasted that he was immortal, but he hadn't let on just /what/ the "steps" were. This is how Regulus figured out about the Locket; he knew about Horcruxes some other way, heard the "I'm immortal" boast, and (through Kreacher) witnessed Voldemort going to extreme lengths to protect a tiny but valuable object, and so he put 2 and 2 together.

**** Yes, but why would he suspect Voldemort had one if he didn't know Voldemort was/claimed to be immortal? By the same token Bellatrix probably knew what a Horcrux was, and was evil enough to carry the ritual, but that wouldn't make you randomly assume she had one unless she let slip that she didn't have to fear death any longer.

*** We know from Hermione and Harry in DH (graveyard scene) that the name of their group is supposed to reference the fact that they seek to overcome death, so I think you're on the money here.

  Malfoy would have probably put two and two together and realized the super important book Voldemort told him to protect with his life was a horcrux.
#+end_quote

Maybe he knew, and that's why he got rid of it.

Arthur Weasley takes the blame, Ministry destroys the Horcrux.

Two birds with one stone.

****** According to Dumbledore Lucius did not know what it was:

#+begin_quote
  No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting too much upon Lucius's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his masters soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence --- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends. By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasleys daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke.

** It doesn't imply that they knew about his horcruxes. It implies that they knew that he took steps towards becoming immortal. There are several methods of doing so in the HP universe.

** I mean, the quote says that they “Knew the steps” he had taken, not just that they knew that he did take steps, or that they knew of the steps, but specifically that they knew them. That certainly sounds like they knew that he made horcruxes.

*** There's a different interpretation of that though. They may have known various bits of pieces of the process (that it required killing and possibly difficult magic) but not necessarily the whole overall perspective.

*** The text comprehension of everyone up top in the comments of this thread is kinda shocking. It clearly says that they knew the steps. Not very ambiguous.

The only way to get out of it is that Voldemort also took other steps (other than Horcruxes) towards immortality and his followers are aware of those, but he kept the successful steps secret.

**** yeah, it's exactly what I was thinking. How does anybody read that quote and then come up with any other explanation? Even says ‘proof'. Knowing the steps, and knowing the proof, sounds like they know about Horcruxes to me

** I would think that if any of them knew it would only be those closest to him, which seemed to be Bellatrix, her husband, Lucius and possibly Narcissa, and Regulus, Maybe Voldy leant towards the Black family for their Dark leanings and belief in the pureblood ways.
