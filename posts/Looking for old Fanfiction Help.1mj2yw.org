All I remember is when harry went to Hogwarts instead of becoming friends with Ron and Hermione her became friends with Fred and George and became a prankster.


** [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6518287/19/Growing-Up-Black][Growing Up Black]] by Elvendork Nigellus sort of fits the bill, 234k words, WIP (last updated April of 2013).

  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

What I remember of it: Harry grows up as Sirius's son and he and the Malfoys are close. He and Draco befriend the Twins on the train and are put off by both Ron and Hermione.
