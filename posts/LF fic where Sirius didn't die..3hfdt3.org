Looking for any fic in which Sirius didn't die in OotP and Harry is entering his sixth year. Preferably Harry focused.


** One question - how AU? Does the story diverge from cabin there, or could it split off earlier?

**** The first thing that springs to mind is Innocent by MarauderLover7.

linkffn(innocent by marauderlover7)

It's going to depend on exactly what you're looking for, but if what you're looking for is more Sirius and Harry, this has a lot of that. Sirius escaped azkaban early and went to check on Harry before living a life of an escaped convict. Upon discovering that Harry isn't happy with the Dursleys, they go live together. VERY long. Innocent itself--covering the time between Sirius' escape until Harry goes to Hogwarts--is like 500k+ words. The sequel, Initiate (pretty much Sorcerer's Stone) is also finished and we're almost at the end of Identity (CoS). Updates every Tuesday.

****** Try to prove sirius' innocence, for the most part. It also follows tonks and her auror training and other characters (Marlene McKinnon, for example). It's really more like one major plot (sirius' innocence) and then two other novellas afterwards. It's good one of my favorites! But loooong. . .

** I tend to have Sirius survive in my stories, but the only one where Harry is about to enter his sixth year is "Patron", and that started in Year 4, is quite the AU, and is just now getting closer to the end of year 5. Sirius plays a larger role though.

**** linkffn(Patron)

Sirius also lives in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Spygirl) (starts at the fight in the Ministry) and linkffn(Uncle Quentin's Spy) (starts before year 5), but those are crossovers.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. Unfortunately, it also painted a very big target on her back.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.

****** I've got a few ideas for short stories, tying up loose ends, but the main story is done. In order to continue it and avoid the "same story, different country" trope, I'd have to either make up some "ancient magics" to give the enemy a chance, or have the enemy use the same tactics - which need a similar society as well, which pretty much removes the most plausible reasons for a conflict in the first place. Neither solution appeals to me much.

******** I was originally shooting for 30 chapters, but it looks now closer to 40 or more. I tend to underestimate the length - "Uncle Quentin's Spy" was originally meant to take 7 to 9 chapters, and ended up with 20.
