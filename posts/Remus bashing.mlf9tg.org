People always like Remus but ever since I've read the part where he wants to join Harry and Co. On the horcrux hunt I hated him. He just got tonks pregnant and tries to run away, and let's be honest thats what it was. So here I am asking for fanfics where Remus is not universally loved

If anything, I think Remus is one of the most hated characters on this sub

*** Huh... Haven't noticed it like that I always hear that dumbeldore is evil or Ron and hermione are bad friends or somehow Snape being in love with lily redeems him of all his wrongs (don't get me wrong I like good Snape fanfics , as long as he is actually good and not just good because he loved lily)

**** Exactly. I've redeemed Snape not because he was in love with her but because he spent the rest of his life righting his wrongs. I haven't seen any Remus bashing before.

I think that this should've been explained in the books as Harry reminding him of "his greatest mistake and failure."

** I don't know any stories hope someone does because..

I don't like Remus at all I mean the guy is a complete coward. I mean he didn't meet Harry until he was 13, I know he lost two of his friends but he should of been able to pull himself together sooner.

Then he doesn't tell Harry who he is until the end of the year and then runs away.

Next is 4th year Harry gets entered in the triwizard which was in the papers so he would of seen it or heard talk of it. Does Remus send advice or a good luck in a letter? Nah, probably he's to busy moaning about how unfair his life is.

Next is the big one abandoning his wife and son which looking at his track record is not a big shock. Both him and Tonks should have stayed hidden till the war was done the battle at hogwarts would have ended the same had they not been there.

Making Harry godfather was the only good choice Remus made there's no doubt in my mind Harry would do anything to make sure he was raised with happiness and love.

*** Not to mention he knows the risk he poses to young children and still decide to take a full time job as a teacher.

I mean, I'm all for giving the guy a chance and that he needed to find someone to trust him to handle the job and all... But all that goes away when he forgets to take the potion and could have ended up killing a bunch of people. All that people feared he could do... Well he proved them right by forgetting the thing he wasn't in supposed to forget.

*** God yes. People hate on Snape for letting it slip that Remus was a werewolf but I digress. You can hate on Snape for many things, but not that. Lupin FORGOT to take his potion. I don't care if he thought he saw bloody Merlin, there was no excuse for that. He could have killed the students because of his carelessness. Snape did the right thing. His first duty is to the students and he did that.

** Linkffn(Faery Heroes by Silently Watches)

Bear in mind that this fic also bashes Dumbledore and several of the Weasleys too. But if you want the specific part about Lupin, you can switch to chapter 39 that features a conversation between Harry and Tonks.
