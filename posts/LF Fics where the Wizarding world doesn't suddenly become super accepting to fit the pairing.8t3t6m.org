** I think "gay" shouldn't enter into it. Homophobia in the Wizarding World is a whole different question. But you do bring up a very good point concering "veela-Draco".

*** The homophobia bit was "Prejudiced/old fashioned society. Homophobia was bad in the 90s anyway, but with wizards, you'd assume it'd be worse, given they're even more antiquated" but they always seem to accept Veela-Draco yet shun the female Veelas, it's weird and offputting

**** Well, y'know. The Wizarding World doesn't have sexism (female Minister for Magic way back in the 18th century), and doesn't have skin-color-based racism either as far as we can see. It's backwards and bigoted, but in its own way; it's its own culture with its own taboos and superstitions compared to the Muggle world. So combined with the fact that Dumbledore was gay and was considered one of the greatest and most beloved wizards in the world, it seems /reasonable/ to assume that the Wizarding World would be very accepting of LGBTQ+ people, even if it's not necessarily /true/.

***** And yet, they aren;'t even slightly accepting of creatures, and Veela Draco is always "OH YOU MUST MARRY HIM WE MADE IT LAW" when part of the actual lore of Wizarding Britain is WE HATE CREATURES. That was the main point. Most people didn't know Dumbledore was gay, admittedly. Dumbledore kept that hush hush.

****** About the first point: sure. Indeed, I think it might be funny to do a parody one-shot where the usual Harry/Veela!Draco drama unfolds, and then everyone starts shunning the two of them, and Muggle-raised Harry thinks it's because it's a same-sex relationship, and Ron or someone goes: "what? no, mate, what you talking about? It's 'cause he's a filthy Veela creature".

Do we know that for sure?

******* Accident. Was trying to edit. As for that, Dumbledore, he would have had to keep it hush hush, "Dumbledore was lovers with the dark lord he defeated" would have wrecked his reputation before Fudge ever had to.

And yeah, that'd be what i was looking for. Either parody or serious, where Wizarding Britain keeps its canon attitude towards creatures, and doesn't suddenly go "Oh it's malfoy k we love creatures nao"

******** Dumbledore could be openly gay without being open about his crush on Grindelwald. It's not like you'd randomly assume Bellatrix Lestrange had a crush on Frank Longbottom just because she was attracted to men. It's ridiculous.

********* Eh, it'd at least come up in talks. Only time Dumbledore being gay was mentioned was by... that old lady that wrote History of Magic. Even if they retconned it and put Dumbledore back in the closet in Fantastic Beasts (to an extent) it caused havoc, if i recall.
