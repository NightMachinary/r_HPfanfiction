From what I can remember, there's a lot of time travel involved, characters dying and coming back to life (.including Lily possibly?), and by the end they're in space. It's a very crazy fix but I wouldn't know quite what to search for. Anybody know which one I mean?

**** Once again, I must second and third this. Holy hell it is such a confusingly awesome surreal ride. Batshit crazy has never been so beautiful.

** Possibly the Hero Trilogy by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][joe6991]]? A lot of universe jumps and a super-powered Harry who goes a touch insane. I haven't finished it yet (I'm deep into book 2).
