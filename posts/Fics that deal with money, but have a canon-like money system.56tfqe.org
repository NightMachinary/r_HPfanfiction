Two things:

When I say canon-like, I mean that Galleons aren't thrown around like confetti. The weasley vault only had a few sickles. If that's enough to support a family, I really don't see Harry needing 400 vaults, and billions of galleons.

Two:

When I say dealing with money, I mean he is using his cash to do buisness. Preferably starting with a small amount of money, and working his way up. I liked how in "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" he was doing less than legal things, and getting cash.

Over 100k+ words please!


** You post so many threads people are starting to report them as spam, can you tone it down some?

*** Sure, sure! I'm just curious how it can identify as spam since they're all different .-.

**** They're all requests for stories, at a rate that most would not be able to post assuming they actually read those stories.

That makes people think that you must not be reading the stories. Combine it with the always added length requirement and people are getting tired of it to the point where it's easier to assume it to be a troll.

And it does not help that some people probably don't like you and are feeling vindictive.

***** Dunno. All his requests feel legit to me, not trollish. And why would you be required to read all stories that are posted? Sometimes none of the stories posted in response to a request are to your taste, after all.

****** If you think I am one of the people reporting him then you are very much missing the point. I /do/ know his requests are legit.

But there are enough people who only look at the title, go “great, another thread by this user”, and decide to report. And considering that there was a time period when the user this is about was very ... aggravating, on occasions, it is plausible for there to be people who don't like him and want to be annoying about it and really report because of that.

******** Shouldn't be. But do note that the whole thing started with a moderator asking him to tone it down, and I am sure that inane reports very much /are/ a hassle to mods.

Then he asked why, and I gave him the answer. That you or I do not engage in this inanity does not mean there aren't enough people who do for it to be annoying to the mods and for the answer to be true.

****** No. You are being reported because there's enough of your threads that people see you as a common poster, and when they assume you are a troll rather than check they may or may not report you. You are not being reported for reading a lot of stories, but for the fact that there is a lot of threads created by you.

Which is the very thing [[/u/denarii][u/denarii]] pointed out, and I really shouldn't have to point /that/ out.

******* I almost exclusively post fic requests. I post them a lot because I read through them a lot. So yes, I am being reported because I like to read a lot.
