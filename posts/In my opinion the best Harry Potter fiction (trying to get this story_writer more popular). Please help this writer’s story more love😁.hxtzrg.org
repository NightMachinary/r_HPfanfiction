A Ron centric but with different point of views and over 2.5 million words!

This is the description:

When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

*** Too true. There are some people who like more than one tropes. In that case it is easier to rank a fanfiction as best in a particular trope rather than best as a whole. Like best "harry centric" or "wbwl" or "fem-harry". P.S. I also prefer harry centric fics

*** That's the same for movies, book, dishes... And people are not banned from using the "best" there.
