A friend of mine is looking for a post, we were talking about it on FB, this is his question:

​

Trying to remember a fic I read where Harry gives Hermione some dragonhide boots with pointed or spiked toes. She later kicks either Malfoy or Ronald ‘between the uprights' and then McGonagall asks Hermione if she ‘delivered chastisement' with the boots.

​

Does anyone know this? I know I've read it before, but I just can't seem to find it again. We're pretty sure its either Harmony or Gen.
