:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that lily isn't Harry's mom, it's a Snape x James fic, with James being under a coma like spell or potion and lily has a son with after the second war who she abuses and Harry goes back in time but forgets a lot but still helps by getting James out, and I also remember Snape finding a cure for werewolves because they had rabies from raccoons (I think). Don't remember if it was a Weasley bashing fic or not but I do remember that the Malfoy were friends with James and Snape after they get back together and Sirius and Remus get together and have triplets girls (not completely sure about that) I think I remember them living on hogwarts grounds in cabins on the other side of the Great Lake but it was hidden with a charm from the students. I also think Harry was MOD, if you know the fic this would help a lot!!

** I guess it's this one: linkao3(14469255)

I remember it had Harry/Fred/George and James/Snape and it was the only fic on ao3 with those pairings.
