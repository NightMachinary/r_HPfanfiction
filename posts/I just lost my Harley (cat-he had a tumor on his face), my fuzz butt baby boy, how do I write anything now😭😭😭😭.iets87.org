He was my fluffy muse, how do I do anything at all? I had to put him down, he was gone as soon as they gave him the sedativeðŸ˜­ How will I ever write again?


** I'm sorry for your loss. Maybe try to include him in your story, recall all the fun times and write that down.

** How different would the story be if Hermione adopted your cat alongside Crookshanks? Would they catch Peter Pettigrew before he escapes? Would they join the DA and fight Death Eaters in the Ministry? Would they help finding Horcruxes?

There are infinite possibilities. Maybe you should write some.

*** I believe he would have smothered him to death. Harley was a big orange fluffy boy with Maine coon in him

**** Crookshanks was wery big because he was partly a Kneazle, so they would've looked somewhat similar.
