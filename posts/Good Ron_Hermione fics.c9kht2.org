** Linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

What if the Death Eaters didn't dissolve after Voldemort's fall and continued on as before, just with Malfoy as the new leader?

Skip some time ahead: Malfoy is the +orwellian dictator+ belovenent Minister of Britain, Pureblood supremacy is the law and Hermione and all other muggleborns are kidnapped and raised as brainwashed soldiers. Harry Potter, the Weasleys, Dumbledore and a few other Order members spent the last twenty years in France.

Now, after Ron graduated Beauxbatons, it's time for him to return to Britain as a spy to prepare the coup.

#+begin_quote
  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** Check out [[/r/HPRomione][r/HPRomione]] to get some recommendations. It's not a super active community but have a sticky with a long list of fics.

As for my personal novel-length favorites:

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=191950][After the Summer Ended]] was the first story and published pre-Deathly Hallows. The story centers around Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they Horcrux Hunt. Ron and Hermione get together really early in this fic and while romance it is not the primary plot, their relationship is a crucial part of the story. For a story written before Deathly Hallows was published, I am amazed at how accurate the author's predictions are. Honestly, it's the Deathly Hallows I always wanted because it featured my favorite ship +rather than so many pages on wand lore+. Spoiler>! in this story Ron and Hermione get married super fast which is 100% my headcanon and what I wanted in DH anyway!<

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=207276][Winter of the Dark Witch]] is the sequel to After the Summer Ended and features the gang all grown up with AU!children heading off to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione running a pub all the while getting up to the same shenanigans with Auror Potter. Ron and Hermione's son is a major character to this story and he is written like a proper child while adding value to the plot. This story only makes sense if you've read After the Summer Ended and is the most cannon deviant, but an absolute delight.

​

[[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=230148][The Onset of Autumn]] takes place after the Battle of Hogwarts and the year following as Harry, Ron, and Hermione start jobs at the Ministry. Admittedly this is my least favorite of all of the stories. I love all of the Ron/Hermione parts, but the plot feels secondary to the relationship development and honestly, the main plot gets downright confusing at times. There's also time travel which I think is my, personal biggest gripe and caused some timeline issues making the story longer than it strictly needed to be. It does have a proper, well written, in character Draco redemption arc (if you're into that kind of thing).

​

Recently Discovered/Favorite One-Shots:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19256362][seven]] linkao3(9256362) is a gritty/fluffy story immediately post-war for the couple.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10769166][Red Circles & Black Xs]] linkao3(10769166) older, smutty towards the end, about the pair's struggle to get pregnant.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18260225][Candid Conversations]] linkao3(18260225) the pair clearing the air in the space between HBP and DH.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14818256][the end came as a cold shock to a pocket full of rocks, to a mouth full of water]] linkao3(14818256) the only Cursed Child compliant story I'll likely ever recommend. It's the darkest timeline AU and excellent.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/234550][and yes i said yes i will yes (or: four weddings and funeral)]] linkao3(234550) Don't let the title deter you. This is a beautiful story that's more gen than romance. I love how Ron and Hermione are characterized in this story.

**** So, Romione stories are rare enough that you can easily point out the best authors. There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/8543501/bowtruckles][bowtruckles]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1146256/TMBlue][TMBlue]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4548380/Coyote-Laughing-Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly]]. I'm also fond of the plot-driven Romione story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4327485/1/Renaissance][Renaissance]], though honestly there's not a ton of romance in that and Hermione could have just as easily ended up with one of the writer's OC in the story.

I also just started publishing something that's sort of in the style of bowtruckles --- a missing moments story that feels like the books but that will also take some AU liberties: linkffn(13329796). I think it'll be about 10 chapters long.
