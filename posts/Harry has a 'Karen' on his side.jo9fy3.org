Well met, I'm wondering if anyone has any recommendations for good fanfic wherein Harry gains an ally, someone who is willing to go toe-to-toe with whomever is keeping him down. Someone who has that "let me speak to your manager" energy to the wizarding world and/or the durselys.


** That pretty much sums up /By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept./ Petunia unleashes her inner Karen, gets free of Vernon, and takes the wizarding world by storm.

I resisted it for a while, because I didn't think I liked Petunia stories. But I was wrong. It hasn't been updated in a while, but it's such a fun read that I didn't mind. And the author has returned after previous long gaps, so I wouldn't be shocked if it resumes.

  Petunia Dursley has trouble: she's lost her family, she's going crazy, she can do magic (but not always), her suitors are a mixed bag (operative word) & people keep trying to take her children away from her. They should be very afraid. (Not only a) Double Severitus. WARNING: Not what you expected.

**** I'm unsure. It's been forever since I read it, it just popped into my brain upon seeing your request.

Last time I saw it it was only...70 chapters? It didn't look like it was wrapping up soon. I didn't even realize it had updated recently.

  Petunia Evans always wanted to be just like Lily. The thought of learning magic would make her giddy with excitement. However a rejection letter from the headmaster of Hogwarts blew that dream out the window. What would've happened instead if the wife of the owner of Flourish and Blott's had taken a bit of pity and shown Petunia that you didn't need a wand to do magic?
