What is Harry's goal? To kill muggles and muggleborns or what?

Is Harry portrayed as the bad guy (or at least dubiously) or is the muggle genocide thing he does (I've heard) shown to be a good thing?

Secondly, how severely is Hermione bashed here? Is she merely the one fighting against Harry's agenda or is her character also bashed in the kind of way that usually happens with Ron?

This fic does have a good number of reviews and stuff but it's fairly long so I was wondering if I should read it. Any general comments on the writing itself are, of course, welcome. For instance, in the prologue, I noticed that there was a lot of stereotypical smirking and sneering on Harry's part --- that struck me as fairly OOC. Anyway, Thanks!


** Explaining too much will ruin the story and [[/u/Kadmeia]] was right, just read it.

However, for the sake of answering your questions - Harry's actions lead towards an open magic world and as a result conflict with the binding oaths that each Minister swears to the president/prime minister etc.

Hermione is similar to canon in that she relies too much on authority and as a result gets manipulated, furthermore she believes in her own superiority. Near the end she insults 'Harry Potter' about being a fat and lazy dictator ruling over a dark-ages society through tyranny, when she defeats him she flaunts her skill (having received training from Dumbledore's painting).

Some of the story only makes sense in hindsight but it's worth it to read all of it to the end and not to make too many assumptions.

** It's really two stories. The first is pretty standard "guilty pleasure" material up to the boss fight with Voldemort. Then it jumps the shark with the second story and turns weird.

His goals vary through the the story. The first half are (largely) to survive Dumbledore's and Voldemort's machinations.

He comes off as a self-righteous sociopath, particularly in the latter half of the story.

The story has her drift toward the negative in the first half of the story. An event happens not long after the war with Voldemort that jumps the shark with her character.

As has been said, just read it. And be prepared to abandon it when it gets intolerable.
