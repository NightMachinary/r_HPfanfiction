Hey, I've roleplayed various HP characters for the past few years now, as well as characters from other fandoms, and I was just wondering if anyone in the sub roleplays much.

I know there are options on Tumblr, as well as various forum sites, but I was just interested what people tend to roleplay, who they roleplay, and generally how long they've been doing it for, et cetera.


** I did some forum-based Potterverse roleplay for several years, but as they often do, the board died out as people moved on to other things.

I'd love to pick it up again, never tried chat-based RP. To be honest, I enjoy Potterverse (original characters, not actual HP/Hogwarts canon) more than Hogwarts/canon stuff, but I'll be happy to give it a try if you get something going.

** Omg I miss writing so much. I focused in particular on marauder era characters. Let me know if you're interested in starting something up!

***** I prefer to write James/Sirius but I can and will enjoy writing any. I've got a couple OC's, but they're from middle school so I'd need to dust them off.

** I love RP, and Harry Potter is one of my favorites. I tend to RP in email, but I use Iwaku to find RP matches.

I can't stand blog-RP, too annoying to keep up with.
