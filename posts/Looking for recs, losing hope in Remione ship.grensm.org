Reading during the quarantine: I really like the idea of Remus and Hermione romance but after browsing through the entirety of AFFO, FF.net and AO3, most of the completed multichapter ones with actual plot can be categorized under:

- Soulmate/Muggle AU (exiting HPverse)
- Werewolf mating (Hermione is his mate, Hermione turns into a werewolf, Hermione shagging the werewolf, etc.)
- Triad with Wolfstar or Snapin (I prefer no sharing)
- Time Travel where 90% of the fic is focused on romancing younger Remus, with one or two chapters where present day Remus gets over the time travel jump. I want at least the same amount of story on present day Remus.

Is there anything out there? Maybe it's because it's a rarer pairing but seem not as well-written in general compared to even Lucius/Hermione. If there's a recommendation of a completed fic that defies the above and decently written, please recc.

Or if instead you want to recommend me completed well-written SSHG (is that the reigning moniker for the ship? Or Sevmione? Grape?) fics where Snape is his dry, sarcastic mean self but not super dark (e.g. He gets off on torturing Hermione and she falls in love with him somehow because it 'reveals his wounded soul/dark desires etc.'+/eyeroll/+), I'd take that too.


** man i feel you on the remione part.

I'm currently really enjoying this WIP which is a siri-remione but focuses mostly on remus/moony (at least so far). The characterisation of the boys as their canine selves is brilliant and funny and its an incredibly different and interesting idea. Warning for mild ron-bashing. linkao3(23923633)

linkao3(21673126) is also a WIP but is an absolute masterpiece, it's made me cry so many times already and just feels so genuine?? Seriously cannot recommend this one enough,

linkffn(7860277) is a time turner fic but hermione doesn't go back to the marauders era, so we still get older remus. very well written and nice and long. complete.

linkffn(5134187) a bit sad and melancholy but complete

linkffn(3613160) posessive remus and a hermione who knows what she wants. complete.

linka03(23429608) hilarious little fic about the marauderers (via the map) giving Hermione advice on how to seduce Remus. very original, complete.

linkao3(5153249) cute original fic in which they develop from friends to lovers quite organically, due to spending a lot of time together recovering from injuries

linkao3(1932946) pregnant hermione, not remus' child but they fall in love anyway. also features snape so you might like that.

linkao3(810062) some shameless smut

linkao3(672598) this is on my list to be read but i havent got there yet, though it seems to fit your specifications.

I would put misplaced moony on this list but im assuming youve read it

  Just like all things unusual, this started with a moonless evening. Two canines were left on Hermione's doorstep, and now she has to find out why she only had them as their selves for one moonlit night. Nothing could be as unique or insane than her new lifestyle. What happens when someone pieces together the tale for her? What will develop when her new normal is changed for better or worse?

  After the war, Remus must learn to navigate his life without his wife by his side. Though she's always thought she knew what she wanted, Hermione struggles with the path her life has taken. A story about the aftermath of war, healing, and the long road it takes to get there. Initial Ron/Hermione. Eventual Remus/Hermione. Slow burn. EWE.

  It's bright, too bright, and in its halo, Noah looks 19 again, carefree and perfect. All the times they skipped class to chase waves come crashing back and Dan wouldn't trade the life he's had for anything, but he misses the hell out of those days.

  Hermione never saw Teddy uncover a small, featureless stone. She never saw the stone glow in his hands or his eyes squeeze shut as he thought his childish thoughts. She certainly never imagined that the will of a small child and the pull of ancient magic would bring Remus Lupin back to life.

  She mustn't be seen. It was the oldest rule of time travel yet one of the hardest to follow. Hermione is thrown back to the start of her third year and the professor who'd always been there for her. Now with Sirius escaped from prison and Remus' entire past before him again, can she be there for him? And what happens once the year is over? NOW COMPLETE!

*** Glad to hear it's a shared sentiment. I've read most of the completed ones except the longest ones, gonna dive into those when I have time.

Most time travel fics either get too complicated to follow or become inconsistent or don't give enough focus on present day which is part of why I have reservations about it.
