So on a previous post, someone recommend me to read to this and I did. I just want to add that the author who wrote this fanfic is very creative. This probably by far my favorite fanfic of all time. The way the author use some characters as expendables. What make this great is the last chapter. Like when you know a movie is great when you think on it afterwards, fanfic is are the same thing. This fanfic really made me wanting more.

***** Yes and no. There is some characters you have to know about to understand everybody's reaction. And some side characters you might not know if you never watch the show.

*** Clones and wizards. It Harry potter in Sorcerer's stone transported into star wars during the clone wars. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. There are some great moments.

***** It is and the relationship between Seefer, the clones, and harry are great. Also the origins of sith is great. The twists are so good and the author dies a great job with storytelling.
