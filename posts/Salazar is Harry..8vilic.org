Can't find this story, but Salazar took over for Harry, and lost his memory for a while. Also Godric was introduced later. That's sadly all I remember. If anyone can find me this story, or maybe one similar to it i'd be grateful.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...
