What we do in the shadows (a fake documentary show about a vampire house) but it's Voldemort and his squad

I just wanna see cameras following Voldemort everywhere, he's such a drama queen


** Lucius: Okay, so... I wanted to have a quick chat about manor responsibilities because... uh... guys, I think we're not all pulling our weight here. We're not just pointing the finger at you, Dolohov. You're a cool guy but you're not pulling your weight in the manor.

Dolohov: [whilst knitting] Well, I'm glad to hear that I'm cool.

---------------

Lucius: I went into the lounge the other day and there was blood all over my nice antique couch.

Voldemort: Which one? The red one?

Lucius: Well, it's red now, yeah. If you're going to kill Muggles on my nice clean couch, put down some newspapers on the floor! And some towels. It's not hard to do.

*** I would try Bellatrix for the second piece, a Voldemort that takes criticism without cruciating someone is too scary to consider... Lol

**** Everyone knows its rude to crucio the person who is letting you crash at their house.

Voldemort might be a genocidal manic but he has manners damn it

** Facing the camera in a confession manner: "it's hard sometimes, serving the dark lord. His expectations are just, way--"

A hiss cuts in /"Let me speak."/

"But master, you're not strong en--"

/"I have strength enough.... for thisssss."/

Quirrel unwrapped his turban and pivoted so the swollen disfigured face of Voldemort could face the camera.

/"Thiss guy's just being a dick for the camera. I'm actually pretty tolerant of my minionss many failuresss."/
