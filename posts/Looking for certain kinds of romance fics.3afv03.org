I'm look for fics where there isn't a perfect romance, and they have realistic problems.


** On mobile, but Little0bird'a five are pretty good. They're definitely more positive, but they do face actual realistic problems. Especially in the early ones, where they're still figuring out their lives. The First Day and Making Mistakes come to mind.

How real do you want these problems to be? Do you mean just not 100% fluffy or actually angst-y?

Also pairing preferences?

** I'd say some Harry/ Daphne ones are really good for realistic relationships.

** My favorite romance is exactly that: [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=296549][One and Only]] which is a Molly II/Teddy/Victoire. It's the only love triangle I've read that had realistic consequences to it.

The rest of my recs are oneshots:

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=327979][gladly beyond]], Rose/Scorpius told in alternating times. Present day Rose is dead and has come back as a ghost.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=333296][The Ages of Love]], Oliver/Katie in a complicated relationship to say the least.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=332461][the earth and the sky]], Draco/Astoria from courtship to marriage and after.

- [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=290281][Napoleon's Complex]], a sort of Albus Potter/OC that's hard to describe, but it has that unconventional indie movie feel. If you like that, you'll like this.

** I remember reading one a looong time ago about Hermione and Severus. I think it was normal people or something? I remember it being very realistic lol
