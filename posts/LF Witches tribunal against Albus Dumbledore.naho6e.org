Don't remember many of the details, but in the end of the story, a witches conven/council tries Albus Dumbledore for his "crimes". The witches all represent different parts of society, and features Hermione and Narcissa.

They ask him to list all the crimes his committed, and everything thing he has done for everyday of his life and leave a quill to record it all. In between rounds, they give him healing potions and continue to ask questions.


** "Narcissa."

  The loss of magic had started, as do many things like it, with good intentions. The past century, it was reasoned, had been overshadowed by two of the worst Dark Lords in history. What better way, then, to make sure it never happened again than to stop it before it started? After all it was a well-known fact that those with an affinity for Dark Magic were born with it, so why not tackle the problem at the source? The Department of Mysteries were set on the problem, and two years after the final death of the Dark Lord Voldemort, they released their solution into the world.It worked for all of two months before the magical disease began to mutate beyond their wildest nightmares.
