** Ron wouldn't have been as good. Harry had the world stacked against him. He was beat down and a proper underdog. Given his childhood he had your sympathy, his constant striving to do the right thing made him a good person. He was a hero who overcame the odds. Stories are driven by conflict, Harry has plenty, Ron has less.

Ron on the other hand, he's the most real of the characters. The one people would actually be friends with in real life. A prat with a good heart and your prat. He's too average, people wouldn't care. What is special about Ron? The Weasleys are special, exaggeratedly so. They're not just a large warm family, they're a huge loving family. Ron is meant to be average, he's meant to be the slight underachiever who knows he can't surpass his brother's deeds. He's too real and so he's not hero material in the same way.

Hermione would have been awful as the focus. Enough people, myself included dislike her already. Sure some love her but it simply points to her being a character that would drive a lot of people away. I would never have read past the first book if Hermione was the focus.

The girl was just trying to help you and you call her that? What's next, will you call her a mudblood (something Harry would probably not tolerate because of his mother!)? Leave me alone, don't talk to me - unless you have appologized to her!

*** I don't think Hermione (in how she's written in canon anyway) would make a good main character for this series. The whole story of Harry Potter is we explore this magical world hidden in our own and we learn about it as our main character learns about it. This doesn't work with Hermione because she already knows everything about the world as she's the character that they go to for answers and how can we learn about a world if our main character never asks questions about it?I hope my point is clear because I find it hard to explain

*** As in, Harry Potter from Hermione's POV, or Hermione as the Girl Who Lived? Because the first sounds fine; I wouldn't read it because I don't really identify with her and wouldn't enjoy it. The second one, I feel as if the stress would break her early on. In the first few years, she'd worry and obsess until she was a miserable wreck. I'm not sure how much Harry and Ron would be able to drag her mind away from it.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is a canon re-telling in a non-magic AU, with several major differences though. I like it more than the original Books.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

****** That's just silly. Would you like to cite sources to back up your opinion?

Look, I have no doubt that plenty of writers portray Hermione as prettier and more brilliant and more magically able than she is in canon. They do the same to Harry. They do the same to all the most popular characters. That doesn't mean there aren't perfectly decent portrayals out there, or that many readers don't love canon!Hermione exactly as she is, flaws and all.

For that matter, fic writers are only a small percentage of fandom, so the sins they commit in their amateur writing doesn't reflect how fandom and readers at large feel about the characters. Hermione is extremely popular. I will concede that if she happened to be the protagonist of a series, most male readers simply wouldn't bother. That has more to do with the fact that male readers, generally speaking, don't read books where the lead character is a woman (or in this case, girl).

ETA: To make this more relevant to the thread, I should say I love Harry. In fact, I love the Trio exactly as they are, flaws and all. I have some trouble with the way JKR writes them from time to time (plot requirements leading to repetitive stupidity), but their friendship is one of the major pleasures of the series.

******** To be fair, every time Hermione says something is a bad idea it is, in fact, a bad idea. She always finds the knowledge that they need just in time for them to use it, and only ever had trouble with one spell iirc. It's been some time since I read the canon so I may be editing somewhat, but I can only remember her being wrong about one significant thing, which is that the Hallows are not important. And frankly I wish she'd been right about that because they were stupid.

So she's definitely usually right, if not always.

The Firebolt she snitched to the teachers about!

Sadly Hermione IS A MARY-SUE, so we are kind of lucky that she's not an active Mary-Sue most of the time (as in bossing Harry around so he does everything she'd do if she were the focal point!) or the focus of the story :(

I have no problem with academically enclined female characters (I love Samantha Carter in Stargate and she's a soldier and also a scientist with an almost superhuman intellect!), but if they make no misstakes then the story is just boring :(

I almost replied to [[/u/herO_wraith][u/herO_wraith]] about that line, and lo and behold, it's being quoted, so I guess I'll respond to you instead. Basically that's illogical reasoning because it asserts that fans loving Hermione are proof that she's driving people away, i.e., is why she's unpopular. Whereas people loving Harry means that Harry deserves to be the protagonist. What?

However, for me the real issue is that most Hermione-haters are blinded by their feelings to the fact that most readers don't see a joyless pseudo-intellectual nag. Most don't see a sparkly genius Mary Sue, either. They see Harry's friend, a bossy, loyal, bright, swottish, brave, irritating, socially awkward, and magically gifted girl who does some morally dubious things in the later books. There's a ton of ridiculous fanon out there that ignores the nuances of Hermione's character, but that's true right down the line of all the main characters. So. /shrug It's cool if you hate her, but I don't recognize your version of her at all.
