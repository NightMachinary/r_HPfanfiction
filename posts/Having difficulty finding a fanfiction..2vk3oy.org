I'm looking for one of the earlier fanfictions that I read. I've tried google, browsing my web history and favourites but haven't had any luck.

What I can remember:

- Ron dies in a mission, Harry claims responsibility and leaves the wizarding world.

- Harry returns years later, as an investigator, to help Malfoy, who is framed for a crime I can't remember.

- The story is Harry/Hermione.

If anyone can help that would be greatly appreciated, thanks.
