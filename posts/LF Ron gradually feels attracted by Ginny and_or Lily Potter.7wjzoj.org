and he is concerned about this wierdness. Since Purebloods marry each other, as Sirius said, you could say its incest. So maybe it an old "Bloodline Curse" that Members of the same blood might feel (sexually) attracted to each other and he falls for it, either for his Sister or his Niece. However, if its the latter one i would like him to feel attracted and ashamed/guilty at the same time and he cant look Harry into the Eyes anymore. Maybe even Ginny knows about it and explains, he had to "let it free" to make himself comfortable. well, considering Ron/Ginny. Im not sure, if she would allow him and her Daughter, but mabe she would tolerate it for his "cure".


** Lol Ginny would hex his balls off in both situations

**** Actually, fanfiction's take on Ginny's resemblance to Lilly Potter and Harry being paired with her is actually pretty fascinating (to me anyway).

Some authors freak out over Harry's attraction to Ginny, because she's a redhead and arguably look a lot like his mom. Harry's actually an outlier though, because he has literally never spent time with his mother. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westermarck_effect][Westermarck Effect]], where you lose a sense of attraction to people who you have close proximity to during the age of 2-6 (usually family), thus would not affect him. This makes him a candidate for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_sexual_attraction][Genetic Sexual Attraction]], though since Lilly is dead, he's unlikely to encounter it with her. It seems reasonable that he might be attracted to people who display similar physical and behavioral characteristics to her though, like a fiery temper and red hair :P

Sorry to derail your well-crafted joke with theorizing, but I just couldn't resist!

***** *Westermarck effect*

The Westermarck effect, or reverse sexual imprinting, is a hypothetical psychological effect through which people who live in close domestic proximity during the first few years of their lives become desensitized to sexual attraction. This phenomenon was first hypothesized by Finnish anthropologist Edvard Westermarck in his book The History of Human Marriage (1891) as one explanation for the incest taboo. Observations interpreted as evidence for the Westermarck effect have since been made in many places and cultures, including in the Israeli kibbutz system, and the Chinese Shim-pua marriage customs, as well as in biologically-related families.

In the case of the Israeli kibbutzim (collective farms), children were reared somewhat communally in peer groups, based on age, not biological relation.

*Genetic sexual attraction*

Genetic sexual attraction (GSA) is a term for an overwhelming sexual attraction that may develop between close blood relatives who first meet as adults.

The term was coined in the US in the late 1980s by Barbara Gonyo, the founder of Truth Seekers In Adoption, a Chicago-based support group for adoptees and their new-found relatives.

***** But the OP is about Ron not Harry, and I assume the Lily in question is Harry's daughter not his mother, so in either case this argument is irrelevant.

****** I'd argue off-topic, not irrelevant. You made a joke about an incest fic being low brow and I wanted to point out that there is an interesting discussion to be had in there somewhere, depending on the situation :P
