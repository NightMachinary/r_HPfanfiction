I just posted chapter 15 of In the Bleak Midwinter. Tom Riddle Sr. has been eliciting sympathy from everyone, witch and muggle alike, by saying how much he misses his dearly departed wife Merope. In this chapter, a muggle friend tries to cheer him up by treating him and a couple of witches to dinner at the most expensive muggle restaurant in London. Since Tom's been presenting himself in the wizarding world as the wealthy heir of Riddle, Mrs. Prewett is trying to entice him to marry her daughter Tessie, even though by his own admission he's not a pureblood wizard. The Prewetts are impressed with Tom's ability to blend in with muggles on these pleasure jaunts. He always manages to do no magic at all. Here's an excerpt:

Mrs. Prewett and Tessie arrived at the Riddle House early, as planned, so they could meet Algie for dinner at Boulestin before their usual dancing. Once they'd applied the finishing touches to their muggle costumes, they apparated to London with Dobby's help.

Algie had suggested this restaurant, but he had not yet arrived, so Tom and the Prewetts got a table, admiring the circus-themed murals, carpets the colour of spilt claret and curtains of yellow brocade as they waited.

“Have you made any plans for the holiday?” Tessie asked Tom.

“Because if you haven't, we were wondering if you'd accept the hospitality of Shell Cottage,” said Mrs. Prewett. “We aren't planning anything too fancy, just a cozy little celebration.”

“I'd love to, but I already promised to spend the holiday at Malfoy Manor. I hope I can visit you another time,” said Tom.

“Holiday?” asked Algie, who had arrived unnoticed. “Is someone going on holiday?” He drew a chair and joined them at the table.

“The Ides of March,” Mrs. Prewett explained, to Algie's confusion.

“How does your family celebrate the Ides of March?” Tessie asked Algie with interest.

Algie blinked his pale blue eyes.

“Have you read any good books lately?” Tom asked Algie an instant later. Tom didn't feel that this had been one of his more inspired distractions, but it worked.

“Can't say I have,” Algie said to Tom. “You know me, I rarely read anything longer than a menu.” He picked up his menu to demonstrate. “Have you decided what you're getting?” Deciding their order and conveying it to the waiter took up the next few minutes.

Once that was done, Algie asked Tom, “How desperate for reading material must you be to ask me of all people for book recommendations?”

Tom shrugged. “You're the master of diversions. The evenings seem so long and dark these days, I've been reading novels to pass the time. I've been drawn to tragedies. Perhaps this helps me put my own troubles in perspective, to consider that others have it worse. Three authors were recommended to me.” He addressed the Prewetts. “Have you read anything by Diadema Vane or Nico Murgatroyd?”

“Oh yes, such edifying books,” smiled Mrs. Prewett. “They teach good morals to the young.”

“They are not to my taste,” said Tom.

“Of course not,” agreed Mrs. Prewett. “Terrible writing. Absolute rubbish.”

** Oh I love this fic! Especially the characterisations of the Riddles and Ignis. There's a lot of grey and it's great.

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
