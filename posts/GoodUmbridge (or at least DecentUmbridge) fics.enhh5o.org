Recently I've been craving some fics where Umbridge is more than just pure evil. I'm looking for some fics like this.

Basically, the Blood Quill can still be a thing, and so can all the terrible cruelty she imposed on her students, but I'm looking for a fic where Umbridge is only that way because she cares about the kids, and is likely driven by panic and desperation to her more cruel actions. Maybe something where she comes to their aid if they are attacked by Dark Wizards, or helps them with a personal problem if they bring it to her.

Pretty much, any fic where Umbridge shows her "caring teacher" side.

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay

** There is a super good fic where Umbridge raises Harry! :) She does good things and becomes a caring parental figure over the course of it, despite her intentions being political at first! :) It is so good but I do not remember the name. :(

** Unfortunately, linkffn(8490518) has not been finished and the metaphysical diabolical figure is probably a bad idea, but there are parts which is really good and perhaps unique.

  OOtP Mid Year. Every now and then throughout wizarding history, a pair of individuals very close to one another find that their magic has grown attached. A bond is formed. A Soul Bond. And may hell burn the idiot who ever thought having one was a 'good' thing! A Soul Bond story done 'right.' No bashing. A Harry and Hermione love and war story.
