Prof. McGonagall is not happy when - just a few weeks into the new school-year - finds a letter to a muggle-born, that somehow had fallen on the floor. Neither she, the Headmaster nor any of the other professor had time to introduce a muggleborn to the magical world right now. She takes the letter to the Headmaster's office.

The Headmaster is not alone - a few members of the Hogwart's board are there. McGonagall explains her problem, and a board-member promptly voluntairs Lucius Malfoy as the "perfect person to introduce a new muggleborn" (since he got erands to run in London anyway) - to the mutual horror of Minerva, Albus... and very much Lucius.

That afternoon find Lucius outside a nice muggle home, where he's greeted by a young girl with bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth (and holding a thick book). Lucius then meets Hermione's parents. Malfoy demonstrates some magic and ask if they never noticed anything strange around Hermione. Hermione's parents recounts a few incidents many years ago, but nothing for a long time. A blushing Hermione admits she quickly understod it was her, and that she had with her usual singlemindedness wrestled control over her gift - which she thought was PsychoKinetic or "The Force"... she had then practiced regularly until mastering it. She demonstrates her skill by doing wandless and wordless magic - levitating things, extinguish and lighting candles, making a candle-flame flame-up like a blow-torch, crushing something of hard metall together into a small ball, crashing something into the wall - and then repairing the wall. She may also zap a fly with fire, and/or kill a bird/mouse outside (something dark).

Mrs. Granger scolds Hermione afterwards, as all the "unexplainable accidents" that had befallen Hermione's bullies through the year, suddenly wasn't quite as unexplainable. Malfoy is intrigued - by Hermione's power and controll, but also by the glimpse of darkness.

Lucius takes Hermione to Diagon-ally to shop books and a wand. He decides to teach her wizard's (ie. pureblood) customs and their reason - as lack of respect for wizard-culture is one of his major problem with mudblood. He offers to let her practice with her wand at his manor - as well as access to the library.

- Meeting Draco and friends
- Invitation to celebrate Samhain and Yule
- Learning to fly (and Quidditch)
- Narcissa shows her how to tame her hair
- Dressing as a pureblood witch
- Shrinking Hermione's teeth a bit
- "Duels" with Draco & co
- Learning (and finding) some darkish spells
- Finding her inner slytherin (or accepting her)
- Competing with Draco in lessons
- Narcissa teach her proper stance and decorum &c
- ... ... ...

...And what happens September 1st, on the express, and at Hogwarts.

** Hmm. I also remember [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15315219/chapters/35532657][Granger Chrnicles]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Maerchenlaenderin/pseuds/Maerchenlaenderin][Maerchenlaenderin]].

Should cover most of the points, though the work is supposed to be a SI. Does not feel like one, though.
