Prompt: Flamel's Philosopher Stone was created using the same principles as a Fullmetal Alchemist one. We don't know how the old man created his, after all, and it wouldn't be the first time Dumbledore has collaborated with some less than ideal characters.


** Linkao3(The Colours of the World by MaiKusakabe)

Dumbledore is ashamed that Flamel created one and was mortified of the real prize when he learned it.

*** I LOVE this fic!! Its excellently written, it feels realistic. I would say it doesn't require too much FMA knowledge, so even if you haven't read/watched the series, you should be able to enjoy it!!
