Hey, I was wondering if anyone had any recs of stories with Hermione, Snape, Sirius or Remus as the main focus. I'd prefer something with a bit of a story but good smut at the same time.

Thanks


** Linkao3(Get Busy Living) is Hermione/Remus/Sirius. I loved linkao3(The Safe Word is Devils Snare) is Hermione/Neville, and I loved it.

** is this Hermione with any of these characters or just any of these characters in combination? If wolfstar is good with you, highly recommend [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10270061][The Other Side of the Wall (or Laundry Day is Every Day)]] - incredibly filthy but also really sweet.

*** Any combination, these are just the ones that I prefer stories about. I don't mind if it's Hermione/Bill or whatever, just they need to be a main focus of the story. I'll look the stories up, are they on ao3 or ff?

  When Hermione's magic pulls her away from her friends and Hogsmeade village to the top of a hill, the decision she makes will open her eyes, shining a new light on the world around her - a very hot light. With a lot of learning and some extra homework, she will learn that some people are FAR more than they seem. She may even find love in an unexpected place. **Slow-ish Updates** Set in Hermione's 6th year, beginning the weekend after her birthday. She is 18 at the commencement of this story. Just as you should be if you're reading it

** But I thought the whole point of "smut" stories is that they /have no substance/, because they are written for the sex stuff?

*** Well, yeah, but sometimes I want a story with my sex stuff. It's why Ms Figg is one of my favourite writers, her stories have both.

**** Oh okay. You confused me with Ms Figg because I thought you meant the actual character at first! But also yes now that I do think about her are there any romance or smuts about Ms Figg? :o
