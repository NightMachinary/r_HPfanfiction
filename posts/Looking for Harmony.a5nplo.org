Looking for any recommendations on a good Harry/Hermione fic. Prefer 100k+ length and later years, but not required. Slow burn ok, M ratings ok. Indifferent to multis but prefer just harmony.

Some I've enjoyed previously: Harmony bound End of illusions Harry crow Escape H J Potter Harry Potter and the rune stone path Healing Hermione

  What would you do if the only way to save the person you loved was to sacrifice everything else that you held dear? DH-Epilogue compliant, sort of. Some HP/GW and RW/Hr, but ultimately, epically, HP/Hr.

  Set the summer after OOTP. Hermione gets struck by Dolohov's Curse in the Department of Mysteries and that sparks a change in the relationship between Harry and Hermione. They help each other deal with the grief, finding solace in each other and, eventually, love. Rated M for mentions of child abuse, some swearing and mild adult situations.

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.

** Hmm. I don't necessarily mind reading Harmony, but I tend to find that I enjoy some stories /with/ the pairing, not /because/ of it.

Also, they normally involve rather substantial changes to either Harry's or Hermione's character. [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2004/10/28/dyou-really-think-theyre-suited-why-hermione-is-not-the-right-girl-for-harry/][In canon, he considered her brilliant and indispensable and loyal, but aggravating]].

That said, linkffn(Blindness) is... Interesting enough that I finished it. A very different Harry.

*** Yes Harry found her aggravating at times, but she was always there, they really only had one, maybe two, fight the whole series, and every time he had difficulty, it was her he turned to. Plus I'm pretty sure Hermione would kill Ron if they were in a relationship, so I find that one of the hardest ships to believe in. Thanks for the rec though, looks interesting

#+end_quote

Not quite true.

Academic difficulty? Sure. Puzzle solving? Absolutely. But emotionally? Nope, nope, nope. He struggles with something every year, whether it's wanting to see his parents in the Mirror of Erised, feeling angry over Sirius' alleged betrayal of his parents, or failing to learn Occlumency, but she isn't ever his confidante of choice. When he's forced to rely on her company in fourth year, because Ron is upset at him, he is very aware of the contrast; he would have much more fun spending time with Ron.

Hermione is very important to him, but 99% of the time, she is not relaxing. He needs a girlfriend who can help him to unwind and laugh; Hermione is as wound-up as they come.

#+end_quote

Eh, Hermione/Ron is a separate issue, and I'm more likely to agree with you there. Maybe it could work, maybe it couldn't. I believe JKR stated that they'd need counselling to even have a chance.

***** I'll grant you in the earlier years, Harry didn't turn to Hermione for emotional support, but he didn't turn to anyone for that. Yes, she can be a stress case, but she's also the first one to see beyond "the-boy-who-lived, the first to hug him, to kiss him (on the cheek). Yes he'd have more fun with Ron at times, but was Ron supportive? Not so much, he was more about ignoring issues. Harry was looking to escape, Hermione kept him grounded. At least that's how I see it.

As they got older, HBP and DH, you see both supporting each other more emotionally, if not necessarily effectively.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
