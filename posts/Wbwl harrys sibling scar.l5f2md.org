Harrys sibling getting a scar from a piece of glass/wood/mirror is the worst explanation ever. I mean like if it was a normal straight cut it would be ok but a lightning? V? Or i even saw a star? It would be possible if in desperation voldemort would cast a few cutting curses so they would think that the wrong child was bwl/gwl i even wrote short prompt:

Voldemort looked into the emerald eyes who were looking at him with hate

'yes, i feel it you are the one who is destined to defeat me, im sorry little one'

Voldemorts wand erupted with green glow that flew between the childs eyes

Voldemorts eyes widened when the light bounced back and hit him his own chest

'NO!!!' voldemort screamed when he felt like his blood boiled and bones turned into ash and his magic evaporating

With his last bit of magic he screamed' DIFFINDO DIFFINDO' the two severing charms packed with voldemorts last magic cut a V in the green eyed monster brothers forehead while also making sure that it wouldn't heal

'REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE' The muddy eyed boy screamed

While looking at harry 'they will think that your brother destroyed me, I WILL DESTROY YOU HARRY JAMES POTTER' voldemort exclaimed before he crumpled into nothingness , his wand and robe was the only thing that would show you that he was here


** I take it you're referring to Prince of Slytherin?

The “scar as a result of fallen masonry” is intentionally absurd and unbelievable. It's heavily implied that both Jim and Harry's scars were intentionally carved as runes,

*** It may have been intended to be absurd in Prince of Slytherin, but I've definitely seen other fics that use the same idea seriously.

** The v is actually the most likely from falling debris. But I can never imagine a star or a lightning bolt.

**** I was thinking the corner of a dresser or something. But X is also possible.
