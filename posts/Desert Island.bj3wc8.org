** Oh this is a neat one!

*3 Fanfics*

The Darkness Within, The Rewrite linkffn(5957714)

A Part of Me linkffn(3340621)

And this isn't even a HP fanfic but a South Park one (They have surprisingly good fanfics in that community.) [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/446370][From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell]]. It's not fluffy, in fact it's really dark and fucked up, but wow is it good. (Like a lot of South Park Fanfics, I cannot overstate how amazing some of these are.)

*3 Books*

Obviously these are gonna be from the HP universe... Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and the Half Blood Prince, and the Deathly Hallows.

*3 Movies*

Gonna need something lighthearted after those fanfic picks so...

Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Moana

The South Park movie, Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.

**** Right? But the crazy thing is that they do! That said, if slash isn't your thing then almost the entire fanfic community can be written off. Just from AO3 that I've read so far....

I remember the plot of a few others and some of these I don't remember /super/ well but they were all written well, at the very least. There's also a whole set of Eric/Kyle I refuse to go into (especially the one where Eric is a literal Nazi who meets Kyle in a concentration camp...) so those might be good too. Also, I haven't looked into any fanfics for this on fanfiction or anything else.
