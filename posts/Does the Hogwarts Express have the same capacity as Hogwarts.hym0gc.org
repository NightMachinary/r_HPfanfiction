Does every student from all seven years (barring illegal flying cars) fit in the Hogwarts Express at once? Could all the teachers fit in too? How hard would it be to sleep in there? Can they dedicate a few cars to high density hydroponics farms?

Can the Hogwarts Express do a Snowpiercer?


** I mean, it certainly seems that every student fits in the Hogwarts Express at once considering that they ride that train to school. Harry, Hermione, and Ron often had ample room for more people in their compartments and given spatial expansion and other magic, I have no doubt wizards could turn the Hogwarts Express into a completely self-sustaining environment. Of course, it begs the question, why'd they'd choose the Hogwarts Express instead of a building or something else. The snowpiercer didn't make sense, already, before adding in magic that makes an environmental failure a non-issue.

** Ok so I looked it up and it says that the express can hold up to 336 passengers. Assuming that there are at most 35 students from each year that would be about 245 students. That's without accounting for floor and apparition. Keep in mind that the train stops in Hogsmeade, a place where families can easily apparate or floor into. So I'm sure there is enough space. I don't know how to answer your other questions though. I am limited to research.
