So yeah, are there fics out there that are along the same vein as the prompt? Makin fun of fanon in fanfics is a special weakness of mine


** Obligatory recommendation for [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]] which is hilarious in general and has this exchange:

  She groaned, my wand clenched firmly in her hands. "/No./"

  "I can feel my magical core draining."

  "There hasn't been a theory of magic that even /postulated/ magical cores since the seventeenth century" - Hermione furrowed her brow - "I'm honestly not sure where you would have heard about them."

*** While not really related to OP's request, I want to recommend the completed Naruto equivalent to Seventh Horcrux by the same author that's only on a forum: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/sasuke-uchiha-and-the-power-of-lies-naruto-comedy-au.472801/reader][Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies]]

Oddly enough the author mentions this story on their profile, but they never posted it on FFN.

**** I mean, she writes on SB first and then transfers it over to FFN because SB is way better for serial, discussable content and FFN is better as an archive type system. She actually mentions that at the bottom of the first chapter of seventh horcrux on FFN. Guess she just never got around to editing down that story.

Thanks for wasting my Sunday with the link. It's good that I didn't really have anything constructive planned for today.

*** Its a bad clich√©.

Quite a lot of fanfiction includes magical cores which are somehow the source of a wizards magic. Usually they serve no other purpose than for Harry to have a big one to be more awesome/explain why a 12 yo kid can beat adults.

Seems like in most Lord Potter fics, Harry's magical literal reading is over 9000...

****** When Harry was born with 10 fingers and 10 toes, Lily and James were overjoyed. However, when Lily noticed he had webbed feet, she stared at James flabbergasted. "I thought that was just a saying about incest! He definitely didn't get that from my side of the family, Potter." "Aww, Lils it's nothing a bit of transfiguration won't fix, he's perfect! Hes just a throwback to my great uncle Scrooge on my Mother's side."

******* Harry brought himself down to his troubled son's eye level, placing a hand on the boy's shoulder. The crowd on the platform seemed to give them a bit of space, for which Harry was grateful.

"Launchpad Scrooge Potter," Harry began. "You are named for two of the bravest.... people I have ever known. One was a gifted flier and a war hero. The other was rich as fuck."

"But, Dad, were they in Slytherin?"

"Oh, honey, no they were ducks. Now get on the sodding train." Harry stood up, tousling his son's hair. "Don't forget to write to your mother."
