Don't remember how I found this fic (pub 2005) but I just read it through and it was surprisingly good. Very like the books in that there is a mystery for the trio to solve and not enough urgency given to it. No bashing. No romance (oh so like the books). Some good one liners dotted about the place. Anyway, linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse of Durand). Have fun.

** I just want to sing some praises for Curse of Durand. It does an excellent job of sounding like it was written by J.K. The pacing works well, it doesn't distract itself with romance or bashing and it doesn't drag itself out. Personally I think it deserves a sequel given the way it ends.

Thanks for recommending. If I find another like it I'll post a link.

**** I haven't found any specific mystery ones. There is a /Groundhog Day/-esque fic where Harry keeps reliving a period of time while trying to find the correct way to defeat Voldemort.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time)

I remember it being a pretty good read, and it has twists and turns like a mystery does. Only weird thing is that it's written in first person, which takes some getting used to.

There is a sequel that I haven't read because I haven't had time to go back to it yet.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Sequel to Wastelands! Time has all but run out for Harry Potter. There are no more second chances. No more desperate bids for salvaged redemption. The game has changed, and in the end Harry will learn that the cost of his defiance has never run so high.

** Excellent! Thanks for sharing. I get super annoyed at the bashing in most fanfics - either the author has an axe to grind with a character, or he or she is trying to explain how much more powerful and rich Harry would be if he just used common sense somehow. It's rare to find a fic that tries to keep the spirit of the originals.

(although I'm a big fan of romance... Oh well!)

*** It wasn't until I read this that I realized why I enjoyed books 1-2/3 in a different fashion than the rest of the series. 1,2, and ostensibly 3 are written from the prospective of excited kids involved in a mystery. This book really harkens back to those from early on and I greatly enjoyed it and am trying to find others along a similar vein.
