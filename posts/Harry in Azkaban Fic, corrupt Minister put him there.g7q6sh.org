So, I remember a fic where Harry was put in Azkaban by a popular but corrupt Minister I forget the name of. Spoilers for the story next, under a tag in case you haven't read it: He (Harry, not the Minister) falls in love with the residential healer brought in to fix the inmates after they're organised into target practice for the Aurors and eventually gets freed on a minor magical fluke of surviving the Dementor's Kiss that supposedly proves his innocence because it means he's pure of heart or something. He also gets brought out on release to help the Order with some stuff, but they all believe he's in there rightfully aside from one of them who's a friend of the healer Harry is in love with. I remember rather a lot of it, considering I can't find the title anywhere, huh? :D
