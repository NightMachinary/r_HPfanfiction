...which are surprisingly hard to find! 99.9% of the time I stick to canon-friendly fics, but I am a sucker for Harry/Cho. I would specify some preferences for the fics, but beggars can't be choosers. All I really ask is the writing is decent. Help please? I found a total of 4 on fanfiction.net out of 669K stories and none on mugglenet fanfiction...


** There aren't a lot in the fandom with that pairing, unfortunately.

Draco664's [[http://draco664.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#HarryCho][Betrayal of the Best Kind]] and sequel are about 200k words, complete. It's an old story, though perhaps worth a read.

Heather Sinclair's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4781173/1/The-Taste-of-Blood-is-Sweet][The Taste of Blood is Sweet]] is another worth note. 6k words, abandoned, I think.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter/#HarryCho][Jeconais]] also has a couple that aren't too bad.

*** No Good Deed was a very good find! I'm mainly looking for very short fics and one shot fluff and that fic was great

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=281651][All Over Again]] is by a favorite author of mine. Not explicitly a Harry/Cho--more of a Cho story, but it is light and sweet, good to canon, and her writing has never failed me.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5483499/1/Snitch-Game][Snitch game]] is the closest I've read to one. It's not my favorite pairing so I don't go looking for it but I really like the author so I ended up reading this one.

** I'd like to read harry/cho, purely for the 'what if' scenario that could have potentially happened. If harry turned around in the books and was like 'sod it', and repricated her kiss under the mistletoe..
