:END:
It was a hermione/harry where at the beginning of the story Ron shows up drunk (possibly) to a party at Hermione's parents house? Harry helps to get Ron out of their and also smooth thong over with Hermione's extended family. I belive he also rode a motorcycle?

** Picnic Panic is such a good story too. Her parents really like him and totally are the wanna be parents he needs. That little girl is a heart killer though. I don't even want to talk about the zoo.
