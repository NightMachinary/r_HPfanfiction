So Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, It's obviously an important character both in canon and in the world of fanfiction and there are many interpretations of him but I wanted to talk about the stories where he is bashed or seen as bad/insane and conspiring to control Harry in everything.

My main point is that often when I read a fic that bashes Good Old Dumbles it always ends up with him being this goofy, aloof and always conspiring with some of the Weaslys Dark Lord in disguise. This is fine+ seeing as fanfiction is a chance for the writer to put forward their vision of the world of whatever universe they're writing but to always have Dumbledore become the above mentioned Dark Lord... well it feels a bit overdone.

I feel that there aren't enough of the other versions of Dumble bashing or atleast the versions I would like to see, so I thought I might throw a couple of versions or more insperation out here on reddit and maybe it will give some aspiring writer out there and idea or two about their Dumbledore bashing.

1. My first Ã³ne is the competent Dark Lord in disguise where Dumbledore uses his genius and magical power combined with the political positions and connections from his different positions within the Magical world to really run things behind the scenes ofcourse it will then be up to whatever protaganist the writer chooses to stop him or what have you.

2. This is more of redemptive Dumbledore where he realises his mistake with they way he goes about certain things be it the second war with war with Voldemort or Harry's upbringing/education maybe it will be Harry who brings these things forward in an allout explosion of anger like we saw in the end OoTP where he highlights his upbringing with the Dursleys and the yearly dangers within the school, or it might come sooner than that maybe even before the events of the first book, again it will be up to the writer to piece this togeter. Dumbledore realises his error and sets out to try and rectify some of them.

3. Just go allout crack on this were he steals from Harry to pay for the order and Harrys friends he also has a horcrux or kept the philosophers stone to become imortal.

I don't know it seems like there is alot of potential within Dumble bashing stories other than what it usually turns into

BTW if anyone has any fic that fit some of the first two versions maybe drop the link to it

** I think the reason manipulative Dumbledore is incompetent is because he was in canon. In first year, he set up for Harry to confront Quirrel. He knew where Voldemort was and didn't even try to trap him or anything like that:

*âWell,â Hermione exploded, âif he did --- I mean to say --- that's terrible --- you could have been killed.â*

*âNo, it isn't,â said Harry thoughtfully. âHe's a funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could. ...â*

In second year, a 13 year old girl, with the same of information as him (he understood parseltongue), solved the mystery while he did nothing. In third year, he sent two teenagers to do his dirty work. I would go on, but you get the gist.

To make a competent Dumbledore, canon would have to be radically changed, so almost no authors write him like that

For the second option, it's much more feasible, and I have read some fanfics like that, but [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13320880/1/Phoenix-Insurgent][Phoenix Insurgent]] is the only one I remember. It can be very jarring and OOC though (since canon Dumbles was super manipulative and had no regrets about it), so I can see why a lot of people don't like it.

*** Eh... blame not the character, but rather its author, methinks. Seriously though, if Dumbledore solved every problem, then ickle Harry and his friends wouldn't have been able to go on their adventures.

**** Fair point, but most fanfics try to rationalize things, so for him, the supposedly greatest wizard alive, to not be able to figure out something a girl 100 years his junior can, that either means he's dumber than Hermione (which obviously isn't true) or that he's an evil man who would endanger children just so Harry can play hero and be groomed to be a martyr.

***** Yep. Well, there's also an interpretation that the whole thing is a genuine trap for oldy Voldy - a trap the failed spectacularly because a trio of precocious, well-meaning firsties blundered in and ruined everything.

But anyway, you know, I don't think I've ever seen a fic where the gauntlet from Book 1 was intended to be open for students. Like, it was a fun little enchantment that would create at least a few puzzles that the participants/players were good at (the rest would be a bit more generic). His speech at the Opening then, would end with a wink-wink, nudge-nudge.

The stone? Well, that's /obviously/ a fake stone - why would old Nicky ever part with the source of his immortality? Or maybe it's a shard of a lesser philosopher stone - something expensive, somewhat useful, but it's not like it would actually transmute lead to gold or grant immortality or anything.

But why, then, would the squirelly Quirel seek it out for his Master? Maybe oldy Voldy had created a ritual that uses it or something, or maybe Dumbledore hinted that the lesser shards were hooked up to an actual philosopher's stone, and that its protections would become vulnerable after the gauntlet was shut down or something.

T'would be fun, if nothing else :D
