Scenario: Riddle emerges from the diary fully formed, gets caught and arrested some short time later (less than six months), and is promptly tossed in Azkaban for murdering Ginny and attempting to kill Harry. Fast forward a couple of years, Voldemort is ressurected and goes to break out his loyal followers -- but what about Riddle?

I always imagined Voldemort as being deeply distrustful of absolutely everyone, and I think that would extend even to portions of himself. I imagine he would view young Riddle as a potential rival, a threat to his power.

So would Voldemort:

- Leave Riddle in the relative safety of Azkaban, ensuring he can't steal power from Voldemort and minimising risk of death and thus the loss of a Horcrux (downside: Riddle can be reached by the Ministry and Dumbledore for questioning and could give away precious information);
- Break Riddle out and keep him close, claiming they'll work together but doing his best to make sure Riddle doesn't get any real power;
- Kill Riddle, consider it a necessary sacrifice, and just make another Horcrux?


** I think he would possess the body and incorporate the mind back into his own. A teenage body would be very useful, no one would believe dumbledore saying some sixteen year old is voldemort save for those who knew him and those are mostly dead or not knowing the ever charming riddle was voldemort.

** I've read a few where Riddle opposed / destroyed the insane Voldemort, but not really one where they cooperated. I think they would cooperate if both are sane. As for them destroying themselves, I'm sure Voldemort would rather feed the Horcruxes Draught of living death than destroy a portion of his own soul.

** I think that a slightly saner version of Voldemort would see Diary Riddle as a couple things. First, another potential, easy body. Second, as a powerful lieutenant that he can more or less trust to act in their best interest (at least for a while). And last, as a rival that he will eventually have to put down, or as an heir he can groom.

At least if I were writing it, Voldemort would use his two halves to divide and conquer his foes in the short term. He would try to achieve at least the conquest of Britain, but then both halves would turn on each other. Their can only be one Voldemort on the throne, and both would try to make sure that was them.

*** Yes, Voldemort is specifically referred to by JKR as the "master soul". Even if he wasn't, however, I think it would be implied. The fact that the horcruxes act as anchors for Voldemort but do not anchor each other, and the fact that Voldemort's soul does not anchor the soul fragments in the horcruxes, demonstrates that the relationship between the horcrux and Voldemort is very much a subservient one.

**** Is that true, though? I thought the fact that they're basically impervious to destruction except from the two most caustic substances in existence implied that they DO anchor each other. Just the fact that the horcruxes are intrinsically tied to physical objects means that destroying the object destroys the horcrux.

The soul pieces themselves obviously still exist after the destruction of the horcrux. That's implied when Harry (as per Dumbledore) encourages Riddle to repent during the final battle, so as to mend his soul. That would be an exercise in futility if the soul pieces were totally destroyed.

This is a common misunderstanding of horcruxes in fanon. Horcruxes don't have default invulnerability. Something being a horcrux does not in itself grant that object any special invulnerability to damage. The Dark wizard creating the horcrux must enchant the receptacle to resist damage separately from the process of making it a horcrux.

Further, there isn't a default set of horcrux-protecting enchantments that all horcruxes possess. The wizard creating the horcrux puts the protections on the receptacle, and what things that wizard chooses to protect against depends on the wizard's choices and capabilities. Different horcruxes will therefore be protected against different things.

This is what it means to put a horcrux beyond magical repair (and thus destroy it): you put the horcrux beyond *that horcrux's specific ability* to magically repair, not beyond some abstract concept of magical repair in general. Basilisk venom, for example, does not necessarily put something beyond magical repair: if you have phoenix tears, you can repair the damage of basilisk venom. So the horcrux in Harry wasn't destroyed by basilisk venom in CoS, because he wasn't put beyond magical repair by it, but it does destroy the others because Voldemort didn't protect them against basilisk venom.

It's specifically stated, however, that basilisk venom is not some set-in-stone horcrux-destroyer, it destroys horcruxes simply because the ingredient necessary to resist it is so rare.

All of this was explained explicitly in Deathly Hallows chapter 6:

#+begin_quote
  "No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”

  “Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them.

  ...

  "From all that I've read, what Harry did to Riddle's diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.”

  “What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry.

  “Oh well, lucky we've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,” said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”

  “It doesn't have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently. “It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can't repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it's incredibly rare --“

  “-- phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding.

  “Exactly,” said Hermione.
#+end_quote

On top of all that, you're assuming multiple horcruxes as a default, when in fact Voldemort was the first to do that. The effect of multiple horcruxes can't be essential to the nature of the horcrux.

Finally, with respect to your second paragraph, I think you're making assumptions about the soul and the way remorse heals it that we just don't have a basis for in canon. We really don't know much about the precise nature of the soul in the HP world. We know it can be fragmented, but that doesn't necessarily mean that what remains is less for it (consider, if that is difficult wrapping your mind around, the fact that if you remove the set of odd numbers from the set of natural numbers, the size of the set does not change). It's possible that remorse can heal the fractured soul without the other soul fragments needing to be present.

Secondly, I think you're discounting the concept of "limbo" which is where JKR said Voldemort's tattered soul went after death. To say that Voldemort's soul and its fragments "exist" is true in a sense, but that doesn't mean they're still in the physical world or capable of acting as anchors.

The only interesting thing would be if the author allowed for Diary Riddle to actively fight the possession. If not, then Diary Riddle would probably be the best servant Voldemort could hope for - 100% controllable and already in the mindset that made Voldemort who he is.

** An interesting theory I read somewhere is that Voldemort /meant/ for his Diary self to eventually become corporeal, and would have had this younger self (for whom everything about his Hogwarts year is still fresh memories) become Headmaster of Hogwarts. The process, however, would only have started /after/ the total takeover of Britain, a plan that Lucius Malfoy completely mucked up when releasing the Diary in Second Year. Presumably, Diary Riddle would also fulfill Voldemort's dream of teaching Defense Agains the Dark Arts. All this would allow for Voldie to keep a direct handle on Hogwarts without having to personally give it all his time, which would be quite precious when he's the world leader.
