Take every single film noir and detective movie cliche, and parody it in the wizarding world, but only at Hogwarts. A butterbeer speakeasy where the /femme fatale/ Ice Queen sings lounge jazz, a burgeoning house-elf Civil Rights movement, the Weasley crime family and their rivals the Slytherin Syndicate. All the while, teenage sleuth Harry Potter must solve increasingly bizarre cases around the castle, somehow get over his love for crime princess Ginny Weasley, and make enough spare money to drown his woes in butterbeer alcoholism at the speakeasy.


** I'm currently plotting out an idea for this, but based on the 'Tom Riddle at Hogwarts' era. Not started writing the prose, but I'm definitely going to when I find the time. :D

Regarding the request element, I'm afraid the closest things I've seen are the 'Alcoholic, cranky old Time-travelling Harry kicks everyones arse' fics a la Wind Shear. Not really what you're looking for though. Sorry.

*** No worries. Shoot me a link when you start that, it sounds interesting.

**** Will do. I admit, it will likely be awhile as I'm still in the beginning stages of outlining so I don't have much more than the idea, a few plot points, and the title - "The Cold-blooded Murder of a Mud-blooded Soul".
