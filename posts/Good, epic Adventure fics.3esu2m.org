** Harry Potter and the Fifth Element - just finished, a bit more adventure than romance, and close to, if not at one million words.

*** I'm kinda in doubt of which fic I'm gonna read next and I want to pick HP and the Fifth Element but the reason I haven't start reading it is because of the length. I don't mind reading long fics but they often get boring after a while. Does this one have that too?

***** I never said that I can't read long fics, i just said that some of them get boring after a while. That's probably because I chose bad fics, not that I mind reading long fics. I've read several good, long fics that I enjoyed. It's just lately that I found some long fics that got boring and I wanted to make sure that this one didn't got boring.

****** I completely agree with you. I get very dubious of fics with 600,000+ words because the author typically is just writing fluff chapters after the first 100,000 words and then throws an ended on it.

Some of my favorites that don't follow that trend are Prince of the Dark Kingdom and The Firebird Trilogy

**** Yeah, I'm not really sure why you're on this thread, to be honest. Now, I personally don't think this story was boring, but I started following it fairly early, so most of the time I was reading it as it was updated over time - that's a different experience from reading it all at once.

**** Well, it's HHr, so if that's not your thing, stop there. However, it's not HHr throughout. It does a lot of world-building, particularly in terms of how Britain relates to other countries. There's also a heavy Goblin emphasis. Voldemort is clever. Dumbledore schemes for a reason. There's a lot of explanation of how particular types of magic work. There's a fair amount of description of sex, but it's not overly smutty - if you're from the US, think AMC instead of HBO or Showtime. This is also heavy on romance, but, like I said, there is still more adventure than there is romance.

**** It is the typical Portkey fanfic -- Harry is Hermione's bitch, Ginny plots with Malfoy to slip Harry love Potions, Ron is a caricature of his canon self, super helpful Goblins, evil Purebloods everywhere, twu luv etc. It has some interesting elements, like the Harry/oc romance, but is it worth spending a couple of weeks on? I think not.

***** Hmm, I wouldn't say that Harry is Hermione's bitch. I've read a few of the fanfics you're talking about, and this one is pretty decent when it comes to a realistic relationship between the two. Also, Ron is actually fairly close to canon in this, I'd say.

*** I read up to 22 and felt the rest wasn't going to be worth my time so I read the last two chapters and was right. The mere mention if a vorpal blade head me doing a Seinfeld, and the rest of the [[/spoiler][Neville/Ginny stuff plus Hermione essentially becoming a phoenix, then all the religious shit... it took 1.3m words for Harry to get his dumb head out of his ass. I was tired of it after 10 chapters. Then the fact that it's not even half over? I can't imagine what sort of bullshit the author is going to pull in order for them to defeat the entire fucking church then all of Voldemort forces, and finally take back the British government, nor could I possibly stand waiting another decade for it to finish, if ever.]]

** linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent by Sanction) is truly the best. My review [[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?p=814217&postcount=19][here]].

Others:\\
linkffn(Wastelands of Time) -- Almost 300k words.

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) and its sequels.\\
linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom) -- over a million words, /epic/ certainly fits it well.

  -BOOK 1/7. COMPLETE. Structured like original HP books. Series to be concluded in summer 2015!- Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all.
