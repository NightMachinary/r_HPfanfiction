So, what's the most obscure crossover you'd ever read? For me I suppose it would be a toss up between [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864150/1/Professor-Takamachi][/Professor Takamachi/]](which crosses /Harry Potter/ with /Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha/ post /StrikerS/) and /Harry Potter and the Sun Source/(which crosses /Harry Potter/ and a cult classic novel series called /The Destroyer/, which I'd never even heard of before reading the fanfic). Not linking the latter because I'm pretty sure it's against DaRulez, for all that the action in question happens off-screen and it's played for laughs.


** Harry Potter and Dr Strangelove

** Obscure is a bit subjective; anything you hadn't heard of before, you would consider obscure. /The Destroyer/ series of books had a movie, /Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins/ (they hoped to make it a franchise, as you might guess from the title, but it didn't make enough money), so I didn't find that obscure at all.

For an /unusual/ crossover, I've bookmarked a delightful but sadly unfinished cross-over with Labyrinth, and two amusing cross-overs with Bewitched (which would be unknown by today's youth were it not for TVLand).

*** Probably read both of those. Quite a few fanfic authors fell in love with the Goblin King(though who can blame them?).

*** And yes, I suppose it is subjective, but the point the topic was crossovers with IPs that aren't something that you'd expect everyone to be familiar with, or heard of.

I mean, just about everyone I know is familiar with, or at least aware of, /Star Trek/ and /Buffy the Vampire Slayer/. I can't claim the same for Remo Williams' adventures.

  First fanfic! After the JS Incident, Nanoha goes to Earth on sick leave, only to meet Dumbledore, looking for a new Defense professor. Set right after Strikers, and during fifth year. Sorry, not much on shipping, NanohaXJob.

** For a crossover to be really obscure it has to be something with truly little renown. Can't really be most series because most of the time that means they had enough viewers or readers to get a series. I guess there are a number of works that haven't maintained their place in popular memory, like The Destroyer, or more classic, Spoon River Anthology. In general though, the lower the budget the more likely something is to be obscure.

I can't name any truly obscure that isn't just faded from memory that's a Harry Potter crossover. However, in the Worm fandom, somehow one of the lengthiest and most controversial fics is Taylor Varga, a crossover with Luna Varga, a 4 episode anime series from back in the VHS era. It's truly obscure, outside of Worm fans I doubt even 0.001% of people in the US or perhaps even Japan have heard of it. Fascinatingly enough, I just learned that it has either a manga or a light novel series, from which the anime was adapted from. One article mentions a manga, but I can only find it tagged as a light novel, so someone must be wrong unless it also had an adaptation to a second medium. And that's even more obscure than the anime, at least here in the West. Maybe I'll go dig through Japan's interwebs later.

*** I'm aware it's rather subjective. But the point was more to bring to the fore crossover fanfics from media that don't get nearly as much attention as things like /Avengers/ or /BLEACH/.
