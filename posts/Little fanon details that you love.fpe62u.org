For instance, I don't remember where I read it, but one fic had Harry's scar be the rune of the same shape, which was then stated to be the wand movement for the Killing Curse. For some reason, I'd never bothered thinking about what that would actually be before that.

Another fic I read had Postal Owls be magical animals capable of a limited form of Apparition, which is why Hedwig wasn't bothered by it and why they were still in use even with floo portals being a thing.

Just small things like that.

** Galleons, sickles and knuts being not actually made of those metals and having protection spells woven into them so that they can't be forged, making them a viable currency and the protections validating why they are used in the magical world at all.

Genetic magic and gifts, that decay with inbreeding (and maybe dark magic? Has anybody done that yet?).

Expansions on Goblin culture: good, bad, indifferent as long as it has internal logic.

Expansions on basically any number of sentient magical creature cultures.

Objects that become sentient through being enchanted, especially Hogwarts itself.

Expansions on how magic is actually cast, although I much prefer the "channeller" archetype to the "cores".

Honestly, I like me a bit of character bashing. It's not always particularly well written but it gives me a sense of catharsis reading the inevitable comeuppance.

** - Harry is a metamorph - His hair grew back overnight after that haircut.
- Draco is Snape's Godson- It explains why Snape actually puts up with him. Draco is EVERYTHING that Snape publicly hates Harry for.
- Goblins actually having a magic system. Canon Goblins are boring as fuck. Giving them treaties and all that make them interesting.
- Department of Mysteries actually studying mysteries- This makes the DOM actually worth their budget.
- Magical Cores- It removes the "unlimited sources of energy" spammy-ness of canon magic. Seriously, if they really had infinite magic, Voldemort would have won four times over before Halloween '81. That, and it adds credence to the whole blood bigotry/inbreeding bit. Inbreeding makes cores smaller, muggleborn have bigger cores- this makes the whole "magic stealing" thing become somewhat marginally plausible to the purebloods.
- Ancient and Noble houses- Fits with the time period the wizarding world is stuck in, adds to the whole "pureblood" nonsense, and the Wizengamott being a house of lords ripoff. Let's face it, JKR couldn't backstory back then, this shifts things enough to actually fit. Notice I didn't say actual lordships.
- Arithmancy/Runes- Also being used for wards/spellcrafting. If they only did what Canon said they did, nobody would sign up for them. That's boring.

If you're going to do this you need to explain it though. Why would Lucius Malfoy choose a half-blood with no money, no family, no connections, etc to be the fallback caretaker for his heir? They were barely contemporaries during Hogwarts (Lucius is 5-6 years older than Snape), they had very different roles in both society and the Death Eaters (financier vs tradesman), etc. You /can/ make up something to explain it, but you shouldn't just throw it in a story without explanation.

**** In my fanon world Snape is a potions prodigy whose talents are overlooked by Horace Slughorn due to him being a penniless half-blood with no political connections. Lucius Malfoy or some other soon-to-be Death Eater noticed Snapes talent in potions & the dark arts, chose to invite Snape for a position within the Death Eaters.

With Snape climbing the ranks within the death eaters (delivering the prophecy, great dueler, brewing rare/illegal potions, acquiring rare/illegal potion ingredients, spying on dumbledore). After participating on raids with Snape, Lucius began trusting him enough to ask him to brew fertility potions, after all what happened to the heir & the spare?!

With Snape being hired as the Potions Professor & Head of House, Lucius decided he needed a teacher inside Hogwarts on his side. Thus he named him Draco's godfather.

***** Slughorn wouldn't over look him because he's poor, Slughorn desires talent over all, but he would prioritize someone who is charismatic or at least not repugnant and so his energy in the Potions front is target on Lily Evans, much like he quite publicly adores James Potter for his Transfiguration skills. I see Snape already falling in with the DEs in school and Lucius already looked around for other like minded individuals with talent sees this young Potions prodigy who while not the kindest of people (although who is Lucius to judge) he is smart and talented and respectful.

Lucius is Snape's contact Into the DEs and from him draws in Rosier and the others but the prize is Snape. Years of Snape doing as he is told and backing Lucius up deepens the relationship to a Friendship which leads to the Godfather roll, even though Snape goes states evidence he never gives up Lucius which furthers the bond.

But to argue against magical cores: I don't have an intelligence core that runs out when I think. There's no hard thought that saps me suddenly of all my thinking, it's all much softer than that.

Of course there is intellectual and emotional work that makes me tired, and after learning sth my brain is mush, but that's not because "my brain core is empty"

***** Yeah, I feel like magical strength should be more similar to a muscle you have to exercise, combined with your knowledge/creativity. The more you practice and use magic, the more powerful it becomes. The less you use it, the quicker you get fatigued from casting it.

It's a better system than Cores since you actually have to work for power rather than just naturally having a huge +dick+ Core, it allows there to be a reason for power imbalance other than just knowledge, and it can provide a limit as to how hard the characters can fight before reaching their limit and it can be improved as they grow (kind if the same as my first point but it's important). I feel like it's kind of how magic is supposed to work in canon, but since it's only implied at best and not stated anywhere, it's not clear.

And most of those magical core stories showcase that with the unforgivables. They power required scales with the emotions showed.

But, it's also a way for the purebloods to be weaker from the inbreeding. More of their core is used "fixing" all of the bad genetics from inbreeding. This goes on until squibs.

Generally when it pops into fics I've read it's either vaguely explain as the source of a person's magic, used to create tension/Deus Ex Machina (example: Harry somehow does a huge explosion if energy and kills the Horntail in a Tri-Wiz fic, then passes out and gets warned that he used up 99% of his core and needs to recharge), or it's used as an excuse for Harry/other main character(s) to be OP due to their large cores.

I wouldn't have a problem with a system including them that was well-written, made sense, was consistent, and affected the plot in some way, but my general experience is that most people just use it shallowly as shown above.

The good fics have the cores as the reason why they start Hogwarts at 11- Their core isn't stabilized enough for focused magic.

Then there's sometimes the addition that the core stops growing at magical maturity (17), so the people that skate their way through Hogwarts with minimum effort are actually hurting themselves and their "pureblood family". This usually equates to inbreeding + underdeveloped cores = even more fucked up cores = more squibs.

********* How would you feel if a magical system was based of something a little like cores/chakra but not exactly? Like you have you own internal magic which has it's own signature and characteristic based on the person, for example Voldemort's would feel distinctly insidious. But also including an external magic that flows through the world and combining both to produce spells. The more powerful the spell the more you channel both, the more you channel both the greater the strain on your body/mind is. Say if you were in a prolonged duel and the longer it last the more you strain your self so your movement/reactions are slower, brain is foggier so less concentration for more destructive spells etc.

Snape's also a terrible person and views Harry as the reason as to why Lily was killed, his eyes are a constant reminder. So while part of the reason is Harry is a constant reminder of Snape's own guilt, Harry is also the reason the closest thing he came to love died.

The sulfuric acid really gets rubbed in when Snape has to strike down Dumbledore, the closest thing he had to a friend/father. Honestly, Snape is a great character with so much nuance. Him and Dumbledore. Every re-read and you can just see the complexity and the thought that went into them.

Parseltongue is reviled in Britain, but respected in India and the Americas. Along with the greatly expanded uses magically and romantically for it.

Arithmancy and Runes having lots of actual uses instead of the crap that's mentioned in canon.

There being a vastly increased number of magic schools than in canon. Since it makes no bloody sense for there to be that few, and the language barriers alone would cause a lot of w/w to be without training. India has a population ~15 times the size of UK, but no magic school. China wiping out their magic community makes some sense, but India really doesn't.

- Impermanent Transfiguration- Besides outright ignoring the laws of physics, the societal impacts alone are scary in their own right. It outright makes the economy useless. Why buy something, when you can just transfigure your poop into what you need? Sure, change the shape of something, you aren't affecting the original item in any significant way. But the size, animate/inanimate, etc transfigurations completely wreck EVERYTHING. The laziness factor also factors into this. Why work at all, when you can make practically everything you need except food and just homestead the rest of it?
