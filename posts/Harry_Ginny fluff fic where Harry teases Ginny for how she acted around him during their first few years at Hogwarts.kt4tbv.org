I love the idea that Harry lightly makes fun of Ginny for her singing valentine, singing get-well card, constant blushing, all that good stuff. I realize this is probably one of the most common tropes in HP fanfiction and that I could find a fic like this in seconds, but that also means it'd be very easy to find bad fics so I'm turning to you guys to recommend good Harry/Ginny fluff that incorporates this trope

Thanks in advance, and sorry if this is a stupid post given how easy it would be to find this stuff myself lol


** It is important in many Hinny stories:

- I like “Reign O'er Me by cts” linksiye(3555), where it is quoted (the Valentine was actually written and sent by Fred & George as a prank)

- In “If You Can Help Her by witowsmp” linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2788096/]]) both Harry and Ginny actively create new verses on the same theme (most of them rather silly)

- It is mentioned in “Harry Potter And Fate's Debt by intromit” linksiye(11253) (the real authors were again Fred & George, it is a sould-bond story, so of course, Ginny wouldn't write anything so clearly idiotic), but I don't think it is further elaborated upon.
