looking for both " what Harry should have said/done in canon" fics and also au's, and both long fics and one shots. both big injustices (ie how different magical species are treated) and smaller (like snape and the house point system other personal points from harrys storyline). literally anything. any fic where harry stops and uses his logic and goes "wait, this isnt right/fair"


** You know, now I wonder.

Harry, eager for multiple perspectives on what Hogwarts is like (Hagrid just chuckles and goes 'you'll see when you get there'), goes and asks a goblin at Gringotts what Hogwarts was like.\\
Said goblin teller, pushes up his glasses, looks down at Harry, and says, "Goblins are not allowed at Hogwarts."\\
Harry: "What? Huh? Why not?"\\
Goblin: "Because /your/ kind say we are not allowed to use wands."

LF fics that start with that and go from there with civil-rights!Harry.

***** Idk bacon has to have a pretty good knowledge foundation to be able to convince so many people to get heart disease right?

Or is that delicious?ü§î

****** Not a fan of bacon myself since local stores here only sell no-taste or bad-taste bacon, but I guess, taking a look at the Americans, I can assume it tastes /really good/

******* Most regular bacon is just OK but there is some high quality bacon out there that I would ignore the risks of heart diseases for.

** I think it's more realistic for Harry to address those issues after beating Voldemort. With that existential threat hanging over him, he just didn't have the energy, influence, power, and resources to reform an entire society.

It's debatable how much Magical Britain has been reformed after the War, but if you buy what JKR has been saying in her interviews and on Pottermore ever since, I think the answer is ‚Äúvery significant‚Äù.

The fact that Hermione made it to the top already means major, fundamental changes there.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/30/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][A Well Groomed Mind]] addresses the injustice and abuse shown in canon, treating the consequences as serious as they would be in real life. Contains a very evil Dumbledore and belligerent Ron.

Topics woven into the story include: a baby abandoned on a doorstep (a crime), the Dursley's abuse of Harry, Snape's bullying, the Daily Prophet's libel, the abysmal student-teacher ratio at Hogwarts, declining population in wizarding Britain, prejudice against Parselmouths, etc.
