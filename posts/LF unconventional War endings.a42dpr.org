Looking for fics where Harry ends the war early by using the triwiz cup/contract, or any other type of silly gamechanging magics that the wizards have overlooked. EDIT: As we know from cannon that anyone can be enterred into a contract against their will with a confundus charm, there have to be fun fics where this is used to kill of the Death Eaters/voldemort.

  After believing that Harry Potter died in a house fire at the age of ten, the Wizarding world is shocked when he emerges, out of the blue, just in time to attend his seventh year at Hogwarts. They're even more shocked when he's Sorted into Slytherin.

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
