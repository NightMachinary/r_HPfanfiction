So someone said I should put this up as a prompt and I thought it was adorable so here it is. Harry takes Luna to Slughorns party because he actually likes her and wants to be Bf/Gf with her, Luna doesn't believe it at all and just thinks he asked her as friends. fast forward to her 7th year and Harry Potter has returned to Hogwarts for his "7th" year, but he seems to only be paying attention to Luna and blowing off his classes to come up with elaborate and sometimes insane ways to woo her.

** Funny idea. Would be funny to have Ginny's own plans to get Harry to notice her, then loads of people getting dragged into it. Everyone having their own plans, clashing with each other in ridiculous ways. Possibly even the [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveDodecahedron][love dodecahedron]] might be possible. I'd certainly read that.

*** That would be hilarious, Ginny gets Luna to help her get Harry. Harry is constantly failing to get Luna to notice him. Other girls get caught in the crossfire and think Harry and Ginny are recruiting for their respective harems.

**** Then everybody start dating the wrong person as a result (some wanting to make the other on jealous, some simply losing patience or some other crazy plot) and all breaks to hell while both Harry and Luna fail to notice a thing of what happens around them. This could make a very nice crack fic.

** If someone was gonna do this id direct then towards the thread about Luna being reverse-bashed in fanfics. It's like on the first page of most upvoates posts on this subreddit so it's not too hard to find.

In terms of specifics there should probably be some changes to what goes down at the Malfoy house during the book 7 shenanigans, it'd also be kinda interesting if Harry had been kinda keeping track of her with the map and slipped up and said something he shouldn't have known because of it. Also potential for some interesting interactions with Xeno because of the whole “Hey you betrayed me and my friends during the war and I'm now trying to sleep with your daughter.”

Regardless I think a very interesting twist to it would be to have a lot of it written from the perspective of characters besides Luna and Harry, or at least a few chapters.

There's also a lot of potential to use some of the drums do Grindelwald and Pottermore material to make some adventures and new beasties for the 7.5th year.

***** Very common, particularly during this time of day and with prompt posts - when it's a good prompt, there's rarely a response right away because it hasn't been done, whereas with requests, you can reliably find dozens of fics that meet a more general request.
