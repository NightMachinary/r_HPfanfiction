The twins patent all their products to have official names that are a prank in them selves. It would not look good for Filch to ban an item and wrote it on his list that is called "Filch's hairy bum hole" or some such. He can't write it as something else because that's not what he it is. Could you imagine him running theough the corridors yelling "Filch's hairy bum hole's are banned items, hand them over or you'll be hanging by your thumbs."

Definitely something I could see the twins doing just to complicate matters and make life hell for Hogwarts residence Party Pooper.


** Yes but then he could sue them because he never agreed to having his name used in a commercial product.

*** I personally believe the magical world illegally ignores muggle laws. Look at Skeeter, look at the HP kids books.

The mundane world is tolerating the magical.

***** The Harry Potter kids books /used/ to be fanon. Once they were sold commercially, they became evidence.

If it was any other person who was well to-do (and had someone actually looking out for their best interests), they would have that whole enterprise squashed like a bug. This is one of my beefs with Dumbledore. He could have squashed it. Whether it was illegal or not. He scooped up Harry for his protection, he should have looked out for his interests too. Putting aside the whether the Potter "fortune" exists or not, all it would take is one payment for a lawyer and the settlements and payouts would continue paying for the lawyer.

There's a few examples where Fudge had to explain the situation to the Prime Minister. Like it was vitally important to do so. That points towards the muggle government either being in charge of the magical government, or Fudge is scared that the Muggle Government would say "Fuck this!" and send in the soldiers to conquer it.

****** I'm confused by your assertion that the “boy who lived” books exist, and your assertion that magical law is equivalent to muggle law. I could also post my viewpoint on the “Dumbledore is eeeviiiil” mindset and why I think it's wrong, but I've done that several times already this week with little results to show for so I won't bother.

On Fudge: he is a politician and bureaucrat. If the rules say he has to notify the Prime Minister of certain developments, he's going to do it. Its less about who's in charge and more about working together to maintain the SOS. Fear of Muggles and their technology is not, nor ever has been, a motivation for any character in HP canon. Whether that is arrogance, ignorance, or a justifiable opinion is a topic of great debate in this fandom, but I digress.

The meetings do not point to Fudge being afraid of a Muggle invasion - they point to the opposite. JKR describes how the PM is frustrated that no one told him about the secret magical world, and Fudge then asks “Are you going to tell anyone?” Which he decides he is not. This heavily implies that the PM is the ONLY PERSON in Muggle government aware of the magical world.

Because if they didn't, butthurt muggleborns would be flocking out of the magical world in droves and complaining- SOS be damned. That's human nature. Spurned people would rather watch the world burn. And no government would allow a secondary government like that to arbitrarily operate like that. Because that's what the magical "world" is, a secondary government.

I disagree with this heavily on so many fronts. I don't care what canon says. When you have a bunch of muggleborn children between the ages of 11-17/18 randomly "disappearing" off the system for ten months a year and not getting any education? Nor paying taxes? No death notice? That's a pattern like no other. Someone has to know, at the very least to mark down "they are accounted for, see person X in department Y for any followups".

Those fics that have the Queen show up are exactly how I picture things.

Well then have fun in your fandom universe? If you flat refuse to believe that certain elements of canon (regardless of how unrealistic or illogical they seem) are in fact, canon, then it doesn't matter what evidence I can offer that contradicts your opinion.

*** Could he sue though? He is a squib and they don't seem treated well in the HP books. I'm not even sure if the laws cover defamation or use of likeness for squibs? Heck, they might not even cover that stuff at all based on the Harry Potter Boy Adventures books in the HP world.
