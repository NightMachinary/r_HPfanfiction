Looking for insanely long fics, I love one shots, but I read a lot and so its easier to have a very long story to get through.

*Must be completed*

I prefer canon compliant, but I don't mind things that stray a bit. Nothing insanely crazy tho. No crossovers, no slash, no extreme bashing.

edit to add that some bashing would be okay, I just am avoiding fics where bashing is a main theme.

Currently working through Serpentsorsia & I love it. (Slytherin!Harry)

I remember from a few years ago there was an anthology of insanely long Maruader era fics, but I can't remember the author or titles. I'd love to find those again.

And before you suggest it, I've already read everything from Northumbrian, Flo & Ronarro.


** Keeping it somewhat canon compliant is fairly limiting, a lot of the LARGE fics are wildly AU in my experience, but let's see...

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7523798/1/Stay-Standing][Stay Standing]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1504180/Windschild8178][Windschild8178]] is somewhat long at 246,294 words. It is about Ron after the war, he gets very sick and attempts to hide it from everyone. If you're a Ron fan I think you'll like it, it's a really good characterization of him.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2717445/1/Tears-on-the-Balcony][Tears on the Balcony]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/71431/ByeByeBirdie][ByeByeBirdie]] is 522,299 words. It's a Jily Marauder era fic and very popular for a reason. I really enjoyed it but if you've read any Marauders fics it's likely you've read it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3927882/1/Kisses-on-the-Balcony][Kisses on the Balcony]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/71431/ByeByeBirdie][ByeByeBirdie]] clocks in at 581,101 words, properly long. I /think/ it is canon compliant, it's been a long time, and is a Marauder/ Jily fic.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5048579/1/She-Said-What][She Said What?]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1283122/Zayz][Zayz]] is 313,283 words and another Marauder era fic with Jily. You're essentially reading Lily's diary.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/718757/chapters/1331941][To Know You is to Love You]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/BitterNovember/pseuds/Coyote%20Laughing%20Softly][Coyote Laughing Softly (BitterNovember)]] is 561,315 words. It follows Ron and Hermione through a unique, magical marriage counseling. Love it love it love it, it is post war and mostly cannon compliant.

Hope this helps!

That disqualifies "A Marauder's Plan" and so many other long fics.

--------------

Some very long fics that should meet your criteria:

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]: 660k words and if you don't mind non magical sci-fi AUs, you will love it. Its sequel [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-28614/DianeCastle+The+Secret+Return+of+Alex+Mack.htm][The Secret Return of Alex Mack]] has 1.177 million words, but unfortunately only features the Trio as supporting characters.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11910994/1/Divided-and-Entwined][Divided and Entwined]], linkffn(11910994): 643k words and if you like wars, you will love it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/Delenda-Est][Delenda Est]], linkffn(5511855): 392k words and I must say it's a very convincing Harry/Bellatrix in a time travel setting.

"The Animagus Series" by White Squirrel, linkffn(9863146;12076644;12088294), should definitely exceed 1 million words once it's complete, but the last installment is still ongoing.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

Can I please suggest you dive into Alexandra Quick despite it not being finished yet? The author is somehow still active and is in the middle of publishing *bi-weekly updates* to his 5th book in the series because he fully writes the books before releasing them, so you won't ever have to deal with a true cliff hanger for longer than 4 days. And since technically it is in the HP world and takes place after HPDH, it is technically canon compliant?
