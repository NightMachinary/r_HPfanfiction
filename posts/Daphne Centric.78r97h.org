Hey guys I'm fairly new to the HP fan fiction scene and I just seem to really like the idea of harry branching out and interactin/ becoming linked romantically with daphne Greengrass or someone of that ilk. Any suggestions??


** Daphne Greengrass got quite a fanon reputation in 'Ice Queen of Slytherin'. I personally don't really like this characterization, but there are still some good fics out there:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9095016/1/Betrayal][Betrayal]], linkffn(9095016), is the one fic I ship Harry/Daphne the most.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]], linkffn(11697407), is quite a fun read with a scumbag Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw][Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches]], linkffn(11574569), has Daphne as part of a harem consisting of her, Hermione, Ginny, and Luna. All 4 girls are fairly well written.

How so?

I never understood why people thought this way about him in this fic. He makes her go on like 3 dates with him. Oh no, the horror.

From what I remember of Daphne in this fic, she would /gladly/ abuse a betrothal contract to get what she wanted - and if this particular situation wasn't stacked against her, she would probably consider Harry a weak moron for not using it to his advantage.

****** During the Christmas ministry ball it is revealed that he has been manipulating events (and people) for a long time, in order to be essentially declared the heir apparent to the Director of MLE position. It is further implied he is the one originally responsible for the current Director's illness (and definitely responsible for it worsening during the ball).

Although the dating Daphne thing took a life of its own (and became its own reward), the original purpose of the dates was to showcase to the various old-school purebloods that he's not diametrically opposed to them, that he won't mess up their interests just because he can, that they can and will profit from their association with him - the clear example being how Daphne's family business prospers after she utilises Harry's contacts.

I dont know if R-dude intended it, but after reading this fic a few times, I started to see more than a few parallels between this Harry's moves and Voldemort's early rise to power. Old V too was supposed to be charming and seductive in his early days - and there are clear elements of fervent, fanatical loyalty in Harry's group of friends. Granted, Harry has proved his mettle again and again, but it's not so clear just /why/ he is so interested in increasing his power. There's a nice bit of ambiguity in the story, a sort of airy implication that of course Harry is always working towards the goal of "making things better for everyone", but my intuition cannot help but point out that his motives may be a little more sinister than that.

******* I mean even in canon, you don't become the youngest Head Auror without being ambitious, hardworking, manipulative, and successful.

As the Vanquisher of Voldemort, he would be a target regardless what he was doing, so he might as well create a loyal private army and use it to protect his interests and push his agenda. The only thing better than a Dark Lord was a Dark Lord with a badge.

  Daphne Greengrass had always been a background figure in Harry's life: someone he didn't know, or ever suspected he would know, that much about. But an unexpected encounter with her one winter's night, and the story she told about herself, turned them into friends. Five years post-DH, EWE, Harry paired w/ Luna.

  Daphne Greengrass isn't the person that she was at Hogwarts. She's changed for the better. However, due to her lifestyle changes, her day-to-day has become a bit mundane. Work, Study, Sleep is the never-ending loop that is Daphne's life. Until one day, while at work, she comes face to face with the least boring person in Wizarding Britain. Can he spice things up a bit?

  Daphne Greengrass is on a quest to be the main character of her own life for once, but that's easier said than done. Includes: conspiracy theories, evil plotting, broken friendships, mended friendships, a Slytherin revolution, and sassy Potter. OotP, HBP, and DH.

** The Legacy. AU starting 6th year. Novel length, unfinished but certainly an excellent read, and not abandoned as far as I can tell. A nice realistic slow burn that takes its own direction while still keeping true to various canon facts that occurred previous to the fic start, like Harry being a horcrux. Also darker than most but certainly suits the tone of the last three movies.

Has a fresh take on Hermione and Ron's personalities as flawed individuals with real depth rather than super genius and super slob.

Really centred on Daphne and Harry's perspectives. Pretty much my favourite Haphne story.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9774121/1/][The Legacy]]

Fair warning, this story ruined lower quality stories for me. I just cant find enjoyment out of the lower class fics now. Much like Game of Thrones ruins most other shows due to the difference in quality.

*** I second this. It's long which is the major complaint, but that's simply because it takes things slow for a change rather then rushing in.

However it is incomplete. The author has updated within the month (for the first time in 2 years!!), but I wouldn't count on it being finished.

*** I like it when the plot is moving or progressing, even if it's doing so slowly.

The part of this story I could not deal with was how often and in depth the magical theory and explanation was.

Also, the story telling dropped off for me when they became trapped in the same environment for many, many, many chapters.

That being said the characters are immaculately written, as well as daphne and harry's relationship imo.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.
