#+TITLE: Harry loved the photo album that Hagrid got for him. He stared at it throughout the train ride home. It did not survive the Dursley household long, however. Aunt Petunia saw it and shrieked. Uncle Vernon went a particular shade of puce, and the album ended up in a bonfire in the back yard.

** Harry hadn't learned much about the childhood accidental magic of normal wizards and witches in his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He hadn't learned anything about puberty, or human biological development or the rampant hormones that were coursing through his tremendously magical veins. He hadn't learned any fire spells of note, or anything that he could use in a fight with more effect than his fists. But when Harry saw the leather bound cover start to blacken and smoke, and the only pictures of his Mum and Dad he even knew existed were so cruelly destroyed, Harry also lost his patience and his temper.

Vernon immediately erupted brighter and hotter than the bonfire at his feet. Before he could scream his lungs had popped and he collapsed half across the lawn, and only seconds later he had turned to ash entirely and blown away like a side-alley snake oil salesman's tired fag.

Harry stood horrified, confused, and exhausted until the sun went down and the only thing left in the yard was a blackened circle where the bonfire had started, and a blackened buckle that had once held the photo album closed. He helped himself to something he couldn't taste out of the fridge on the way upstairs and tossed and turned in his uncomfortable bed until the sun rose.

Harry cooked breakfast for three as per normal, until the plates reached the table and Aunt Petunia stared at him, eyes wide and knuckles clenched around the silverware. Dudley was nowhere to be seen, and Vernon's heaping plate made its way awkwardly to the place in front of Harry.

"Dudley spent the night with one of his friends, some sort of welcome home thing. Vernon may have brought... upon himself, and I certainly can't just phone up the bobbies and tell them that you... So I will phone them tomorrow and report him a missing person, and we will collect the insurance from his work and our own affairs, and the house and the money will all be taken care. And you will continue to cook and to clean and to care for the garden, and if you even remotely think of doing anything like that to Dudley, well, they won't ever find you either."

Harry shrugged, and nodded, and started in on the plate of breakfast more than double too big for him. He had cooked nearly four times as much food as he and his Aunt could eat, but she paid no mind to the waste, or that he was eating across from her. The summer vacation had only just begun, and it had already proved to be just as wild as his first year at Hogwarts.
