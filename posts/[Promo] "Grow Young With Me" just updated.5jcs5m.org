** Wow, I can't believe I waited so long to read this! This is such a lovely story [[/u/Taliesin19]] and I so happy to read this charming little romance.

Your characterization of the children amazing, and one of the biggest draws for me. I've worked in child care for a year and seeing age appropriate children, with all their wisdom and big emotions and fleeting attention spans along with such loving parenting makes me so happy. Especially Lily. It's so rare to see an under 5, in any kind of writing, written like an actual 4 year old with all the intelligence and tantrums involved.

Also, the acuteness of Harry's grief took my breath away. The love for his children, his passion for Ginny. Just lovely, lovely writing. Heck, I don't even LIKE Ginny/Harry OR Ron/Hermione, and yet your writing bring about an affection for those characters I didn't even know I had.

I hope you have a wonderful Christmas full of love and happiness.

*** Wow, thank you for this wonderful message, it definitely brought a smile to my face :) I'm so glad you found the story! Even though I have a young niece and nephew, it's still been a trial and error process writing the kids, so I'm happy to hear you've enjoyed them along with the other characters.

I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and New Year, as well. Thank you, again!

** So I was browsing the sub and saw the tag "Promotion". I'd never heard of it, so I clicked to find out what it was. "Oh, it's just to let people know a fic updated, " I thought, "There's lots of comments. I wonder if it's any good..?" Little did I know I was about to lose myself in published-works-level writing for a good few hours!

The Harry/OC almost had me clicking away, but the context of the situation Harry was in and the great characterization of the OC caused me to stay. Thank you, [[/u/taliesin19]] !
