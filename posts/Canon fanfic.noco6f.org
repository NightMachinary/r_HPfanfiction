I'm feeling nostalgic and I wasn't having a good time lately. I have nothing to read at the moment so I wanted to revisit Harry in the magical world again.

Someone knows some fics I could read to spend my free time ?

I love a good well-written, characters driven , multi pov but with Hinny central and a well-thought plot fic.

Of course Canon, any era ( could be a time travel even) is fine but plus points if its just them living their life in their 20s.

PS. I hope its not necessary to say that with canon I mean all the SEVEN books.


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FloreatCastellum/pseuds/FloreatCastellum/works?fandom_id=136512][FloreatCastellum]]'s fics are canon-compliant. I really like her [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1344409][slice of life oneshots collection]].

** The Dangerverse linkffn(Living With Danger by whydoyouneedtoknow) is a great epic series with good world building that starts pre Hogwarts and goes all the way through. It's AU but it had that nostalgic feel when I read it.
