First of three stories. There's no confirmation Harry is dead on Halloween, but it's a tremendous shock to just about everyone when he is unmasked.

***** All romances and friendships seem to really take a backseat in this story. At best, reluctant friends and at worse acquaintances for the latter half of the book.

*** My favorite story. Have done about three rereads of the whole trilogy and it never gets old. The character development, depth and plot progression really is impressive.
