If you can help me find some of this fanfiction possibly during OOTP with Sirius and Remus there too and all Hogwarts.

I've read quite a few of this but they mostly go only a few chapters of the first book I want some who go at the very least to the third book

Thank you

Sounds like they want Marauder era fics though.

*** They're looking for stories set during OoTP where someone (usually Umbridge) finds the Harry Potter books and makes everyone gather in the great hall to read them.

#+begin_quote
  Umbridge finds seven books about Harry Potter from another dimension in the Room of Requirement and decides to read them aloud to the school in an ill-advised attempt to discredit Dumbledore. Hilarity ensues. Features an actual plot, realistic reactions, decent pacing, *and minimal quotations*.
