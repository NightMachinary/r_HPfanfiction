I'm looking for a specific fanfiction that I've read before. Harry and Hermione turn out to be extra powerful because they didn't lose their virginity before a certain point. Also I think Malfoy was turned into a werewolf and then Hermione cured lycanthropy later on.

It's not a very good fic, but it's really bothering me that I can't find it. So any help is welcome, thanks in advance.


** Linkffn(The problem with purity)

Hope I did that right.
