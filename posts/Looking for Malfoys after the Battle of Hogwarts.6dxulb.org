Hi, Hoping you guys can help me, I haven't read one before but just reading Dumbledore's Army and the Year of Darkness and am really interested in reading a fic about the Malfoy's movements after the Battle!

If you've got any in mind I'd really appreciate a link. Thanks for the help!


** I don't think this is what you want (trials, political maneuverings?), but it's the only one I've got: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/][Exile]] -- Draco doesn't like his post-war situation so runs away to live among muggles. Very well written. linkffn(6432055)

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

#+begin_quote
  The trials for suspected Death Eaters involved in the Wizarding Wars have begun, and Draco Malfoy finds himself trying to hold together what is left of his family and his fortune, while struggling to escape the looming, almost inevitable future of a lifetime spent in Azkaban. But there is one person who might not have given up completely.
