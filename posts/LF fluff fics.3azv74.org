Read some intense fics recently. Looking for some sweet fluff fics or fics where the plot has heavy emphasis on friends or family.


** I love MyDearProfessorMcGonagall's stuff. Canon-compliant and very well-written. Here are a few of my favorites:

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=297990][On Fatherhood]] by Singularity has Arthur talking to Harry about impending fatherhood.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=315682][Serenity Hill]] by Aiedail is a short and sweet Charlie Weasley family-ish fic, told in alternating times. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=293736][It's Called Adventure]], also by her, is a Hugo, Scorpius, Neville light friendshippy adventure.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=304128][Some Kind of Beauty]] by Celestie is my favorite rendition of the next gen Potter-Weasley family. Ensemble family piece.

[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=309456][With All Things]] by WitnessToItAll is a George/Angelina told from George's PoV postwar and Angelina's during Hogwarts. Incomplete but it's slice-of-life-ish so not a big deal.

  Weddings don't just happen, you know! They have to be organised, planned. Every little detail must be checked, it cannot simply be left to chance.

  When the past and present collide with the Potter/Weasley children... A bit AU with characters' names and some pairings. Family tree now posted on my profile page. 3/16/10 -- going back and cleaning up a few things; nothing major will change.
