Yes please see the title. I would love to read a fanfic where Harry and Neville are BOTH the prophecy chosen ones, and it means they are supposed to work together to defeat Voldemort, and they become best friends in first year and they are together all the time and then yes in seventh year they go Horcrux hunting together and then they work together in the final battle of Voldemort! :) Yes I think it would be so amazing and cool if you wrote their camaraderie and teamwork!!!!


** Yes, Neville was also marked by Voldemort in [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12212363/1/][Harry Potter and the Iron Lady]], linkffn(12212363). But don't expect canon plot to repeat. This fic is only the first installment of a planned trilogy and ends around halfway through Year 3. Once the author is finished with his current project, its sequel “Nymphadora Tonks, the Last Auror” will be posted.

  Even muggles notice thousands dead, and Margaret Thatcher had the help of one Sergeant Prewett of Her Majesty's Special Air Service. Harry Potter is taken in by a loving family, and raised to become the hero of both worlds. Even as he enters Hogwarts looking for friends, he is confronted by the darkness in the wizarding world. First year complete, second year starting April 2017.

**** Yes, but I don't really mind since Purebloods were saying ‘god' more often than ‘Merlin' in canon anyway.

Besides, that was an one time thing after Ron was badly hurt and barely made it out alive.

***** Eh, I say god all the time but I'm not religious. It's just a saying. I don't think religion has been mentioned once in canon, so it just felt completely out of place, especially when you think about it; Jesus was likely some wizard who transfigured some water into wine, or performed some switching spell.

I'm honestly surprised the fanfics with religious characters are so rare.

The canonical novels are filled with religious themes and allegories, to the point where several books have been written about it.
