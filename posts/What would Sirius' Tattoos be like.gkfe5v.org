I am working on a fic about Black's inked Body... I ahve some head canons about it.. Like he runs to ink himself everytime he gets tortured by his parents or when he's happy , he has the moon cycle drawn on his back Can you guys help me with some more?


** I never really thought about it, but there's an artist called UptheHill, who've made many digital drawings of Sirius and his tattoos.

It's a NSFW link with many of her XXX pictures (get ready for some boy/boy pics) of Sirius:

Another one with the family-friendly stuff, but his tattoos are not really visible here:

Just as I think of it he might have a lion for Griffindor, a symbol for each of his friends (or maybe a werewolf rat with antlers or something). Something for Hogwarts, since that was his true home. Wizarding sports tattoos like balls or brooms, maybe a Quidditch team logo. Manish magical creatures like dragons, goblins or dementors... which would be too ironic. :]

I'd add that he wanted to ink his whole face until Remus or James convinced him not to. It depends on the era you write about, but he might get something for Harry after he borns, like a baby deer or an H.P. initials. It's pretty unlikely, but he might get a lightning bolt prison tattoo in Azkaban after learning about Harry's scar or two tattoos for James and Lilly.

*** Hey...Thanks..a lot for the NSFW link. It pretty worked. Though I was all charmed by Sirius' handsome face in it.

And I loved the idea of dementors. Gonna make a one shot for Sirius trying to ink his whole face. - it's such a Sirius-ish thing!!

I had this thought , that he would engrave 'TRUE FRIENDS NEVER BETRAY. on his skin in Azkaban.

I also have some ideas like... -He has it inked - 'All Blood is Red' when his mother tells him to be friends with pure blood only.

- When he got to know about Reg joining Voldy , He got a tattoo of a dark mark and stroke it off mutiple times..

-He has it a tattoo GODFATHER written in bold with a bolting scar sign -He has a lily flower on his wrist with initial- L

-He has dog paws impression on back of his hands.

-It's inked over his chest-I 'M A REBEL... What do you think??

**** Sounds great. What about him writing 'Friends never betray" first and after thinking about it for a moment, he'd add the word "True" to the text? He'd do it with only the "F" in friends being a capital letter, but after that, he'd write true with a capital "T", so the whole thing would look like "True Friends never betray". Imperfect and messed up, just like their old gang, with one that doesn't belong there, one that now lost its right form because of it, and the last two being overshadowed by the wrong relation between the first two. Also, it seemingly doesn't matter anymore, so why even bother?

I had two more not so serious ideas:

A text that is jinxed to be unreadable. Just for pure trolling, so people will never be able to read it, no matter how they try.

I'm not sure if it's possible, but could he hide a tattoo with a fidelius charm? Let's say he tattoos "I hate you" on his face, but he makes it a secret, with him being the secret keeper. This way nobody will see it, but if he tells people he hates that he literally has the words "I hate you" tattooed on his face, that way they would see it any time they look at him.

Send me a link if you write the story! I'm interested what you'll come up with, even if I'm not really into the whole prequel era.

***** Now these are some damn good ideas! I'm definitely gonna write one shots about all of them , and then pile them together.

Oh I so thought about Sirius , persuading other marauders to ink one each. And James would be such a kid , all pale on the very sight of a needle. And by surprise , Peter would be the first one to ink bravely.

I also plan to add some wolfstar element in one of them.

I'll send you the link , once done.

Would you mind if I nag you, asking for more suggestions later?

** It always bugged me that he HAD tattoos. Yes, I get the idea, prison therefor prison tats, but even in prison tattoos are generally done by someone ELSE. That is hard to manage when you're stuck in a one-person cell for 10+ years.

** Maybe Snuffles pawprint? I also kinda love the idea of him getting the outlines of a Lily-flower and a stag after James and Lily die
