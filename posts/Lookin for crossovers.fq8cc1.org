Hey guys send me your best crossovers, prefferable with Harry going to other world/universe.\\
Some things i would like to be included.

-NO Slash\\
-NO FemHarry\\
-Master of Death Harry would be very much apreciated, but it's not necessary.\\
-Imortal Harry(Don't age or die trough time) i would also like but as i said it's not necessary.\\
-Im okay with OP Harry.\\
-Im okay with crossovers with any universe, but there are somes that i would preffer.\\
-MUST be well written\\
-I would like something somewhat long or completed\\
-No one shots.

The universes:\\
-A song of ice and fire (Game of Thrones)\\
-Supernatural\\
-Marvel (Cinematographic would be better than comics universe.)\\
-DC (Any of them, i never found a good one)\\
-Twilight (I know, the books sucks, but some time ago got a fic that was a Harry/Rosalie pairing, and was great and very well written, so if you have any NO Slash good twilight crossover you can send me.)

As i said im okay with every universe, so if you have a well written crossover with anything you can send me.

  Angels, demons, and Winchesters have made it to the top of Harry's black list, but first impressions are rarely right, and a glass of scotch can soothe anyone's temper. Starts mid season 3 and spans several seasons. Rated T for coarse language and mild violence. Now completed.

  Hat Kid was a simple girl, finding her way back home with all Time Pieces in hand. But a nearby planet had other plans for her. Join Hat Kid as she journeys through a new world. Making new friends and enemies, exploring new places, and trying on new hats. Rated T just in case. Basically a narration of the game, but with some extra details to add a bit more to the story.

** Brown Coat, Green Eyes

Harry is MoD who now does his own thing in the Firefly â€˜verse. Very good, only downside to this rec is that it is always in these threads and you may already know of it.

** Try Harry Potter and the Illusions of Reality. The one and only HP/Matrix crossover! Very well written, has a mystery vibe to it. You don't need to be well versed in Matrix lore at all either.

  Harry Potter faces a boggart that doesn't turn into a Dementor or even Voldermort, but into a horror from his childhood. Now the boggart isn't even a boggart anymore. There's no imitation. That which holds the image of an Angel, becomes itself an Angel.

A really interesting Stargate/Harry Potter crossover. I'd love more in this 'verse. But what there is feels complete as the set-up of a great adventure.
