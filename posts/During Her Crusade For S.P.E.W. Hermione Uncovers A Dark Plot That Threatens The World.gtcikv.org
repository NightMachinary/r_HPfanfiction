House elves are all sleeper agents of the ancient Elfin Empire. They are the reason why purebloods are so irrational, as they poisoned their minds by putting potions in their drinks for generations. Their purpose is to weaken magical humans from within, as they take the forms of unnasuming servants.

They engineered the rise of voldemort by showing fake compassion to the outcasted innocent slitherin, molding him to an evil monster that will remove the biggest roadblocks against their vision of Elfin world domination.

Now they are after Harry, Hermione and Ron for they are the only ones knowing the truth. and they must be silenced at all cost.


** I've read this idea. It was Tom tho, sort of a crack fic but not really. All I remember is that Tom Riddle had some man on his head named jerry and they were pretty much a psychopath together, a smart psycho

**** Yeah! That's the one, to be honest I thought the elf plot line was a bit much. It would be better as a main conflict. In the end Jerry and Tom finding out about it as like a final plot twist felt a bit rushed and anticlimactic all the same, with the thing with the mind control virus they had going on.

  Villains always make the same dumb mistakes. Luckily, Tom Riddle happens to have a rather dangerously genre-savvy friend in his head to make sure that he does this "conquering the world" business the RIGHT way. It's about time the bad guys won for once.

** Actually, it turns out that the house elves are all sleeper agents for Malekith, providing a distraction for Thor.
