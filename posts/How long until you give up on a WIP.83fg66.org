I tend to go through cycles with my fic projects, and I've not updated my HP fic in a few months - I expect it's going to be at least another three before I come back and update, but perhaps longer as I focus on fics in other fandoms that I just have more interest in at the moment.

The series only has 1500-2000 followers between a few websites, but I'm not sure how much that's likely to tail off with a gap like that.

How long do you leave a WIP before you unfollow/unsubscribe?


** I am not sure what is the point of unfollowing. If it's not updated, you don't get notified, so unless you are using your follows for some other purposes than, well, following, no harm done in just keeping it there.

** NEVER.

A fic I love got updated after 4 years of silence.

I mean, if something doesn't get updated for more than 6 months I won't have much hope, but I won't completely give up until the author says it's abandoned.

** If a story hasn't updated in a year, it gets put in my "abandoned?" folder. If two years pass without an update, it gets moved to the "Abandoned!" folder.

** 8 months to a year. Even if it was updated after that time my interest in the story has decreased to the point I wouldn't want to reread it. Nor have faith it would keep being updated to warrant a rereading.

** Depends on the story/author. There's three tiers. If I trudged through your fic just to finish what's there of it, I'll probably never return to it. But if the story was memorable: I'll read the next update for it (though if it's been so long I can't remember what's going on, I won't continue following updates. Caveat is if you keep updating and I "rediscover" the fic later, which has happened to me a bunch of times). The last tier is for the author/stories was I /love./ One of my favorite authors has a story she hasn't updated since 2013, and she's recently said that while the fic isn't her first priority she promises to update eventually, and I'm still totally eagerly awaiting the next chapter.

TL;DR: if your story's top notch, take as long as you need

** I had my heart broke by a brilliant story early on in 2004. After only a few more unfinished/abandoned ones, I stopped reading anything incomplete. I don't think I've started reading something that was done in at least 5 years.

** Depends on how often was it updated before.

But usually, I consider everything that has more than six-month break "hiatus", and one year "dead" unless author states otherwise.

Still, I never remove such fics from "follows". Why would I? They may get an update after all. Just recently Toaru fic that I've read years ago updated and finished.

** As long as I can see they're still active, I won't automatically abandon anything, but how long I back-burner is related to how good the story is and how consistent getting SOMETHING is. I follow two that are updated only twice a year, but the authors admit up front that updates are slow and so it doesn't bother me.

** Stories that have received no update for 6 months, i mark in Calibre as "paused". After 12 months they get the mark "canceled". However, every few months I let FanFicFare check for an update. It's surprising how many stories get an update after more than 12 months.

** I honestly aim to read stories that are either complete or abandoned. I rarely read WIP. I realize that is not what authors want to hear, but it's the honest truth.

When I read something, I read the whole story in one go. And then I start the next. As long as I am aware that a story is abandoned before I start it, having that expectation in mind, I will read them.

Stories that have been updated within 6 months are bookmarked. If they pass the 6 month mark, then I may consider reading them. Stories that are updated after I read them are tagged. It might be a year or more before I return to them, because if I read an update, it's because I'm rereading the entire story.

(Edit) I will however follow a really good story indefinitely. If an author has a habit of long gaps between updates, it can be worth it to keep an eye out. I don't believe I've ever unfollowed a story.

** It completely depends on the author's update schedule. I follow a few stories that only update every few months, so when they haven't updated in a while, I know it's not that unusual. But if the story is updated regularly, and there's a couple month long wait for a new chapter, then I'll give up hope.

I don't think I've ever actually unfollowed or unsubscribed to a story that I was interested in however.

** I guess I am in the minority.

Three months. If it was a great/memorable fic, I might give it longer.

If I have to go back and re read a fic to remember what the hell was going on, I am apt to delete it.
