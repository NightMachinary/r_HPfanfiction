Haphne is one of the few ships I really like. Is there a subreddit for this ship?

If not, someone should make one. It would be great to have a subreddit dedicated for this ship where people can discuss about them and share the stories they've read or written.


** there is [[/r/Haphne][r/Haphne]], but it's more of a shitpost in subreddit form than a serious subreddit
