I get the whole house pride and all that but sorting 11 year olds based in their perosnality traits is just the worst. No one is the same as they were when they were 11, my perosnality flipped every year until I was fifteen.

Its asking for bullying and segregation, ' unite all houses' you fucking dumbass hat your the one that encourages the sterotypes and created the devision in the first place. Its just so incredibly stupid in actual practice it makes no sense and urgh.

Don't get me wrong I loved the magical feeling of belonging when I was younger about being with people like me but as I've grown up it's just so stupid.

'Not all Slytherin's are evil' no fucking shit their kids.


** I always thought it was the old 'You're sorted based on the attributes you value, not the attributes you have'. The idea being that you'd grow into what you wanted to be, surrounded by people who valued similar things to you. Not that that would be any better, but it's how I always saw it. The Hat is a thousand years old (possibly-ish) and only gets brought out once a year - chances are there's a lot of misconceptions about what it does.

**** Tru dat. Though, someone could make an alternate argument that it just takes your wishes into account when it needs to make the numbers in each house more even, or when you fit requirements for more than one - ie. It won't sort someone into Hufflepuff if they have no Loyalty, but if they have Loyalty and Intellect, then it'd let them choose - and I'm sure there'd be direct or interpreted evidence in canon to make it seem viable.

************* The relevant idea, I think, is that the Hat sorts in the Founders' image. So take the Hat away: Without it, a group of kids is presented to four people, each of which pick the ones they want to teach and raise. Of course by and large, those children will then follow the values they have thus been raised with, after seven years; in fact, if they don't, they arguably were a bad pick. They are -- and are supposed to be -- disciples of the Founder they apprenticed to.

The Hat does the same thing; it picks you for the House whose Founder would have wanted you. Your house then becomes your family, and if you weren't already, you become what you were sorted into.

I dunno that there's much wrong with that, tbh. Usually, your influence on what kind of family you have is zero. Here, it's a lot more than that, even if you only get the choice once.

The /only/ thing that's a problem is when there is not enough appreciation and tolerance for the respective other three Houses, that is, their traditions, values and ideals.

** I have stated this before, but I will reiterate my previous statement:

The point and House system is essentially a way of psychologically conditioning the student population of Hogwarts to:

1. Obey the rules, you are rewarded. Break the rules, you lose points, this hurts your house.
2. Do well in class, learn magic, act the way the teacher wants/expects during class, you gain points.
3. Compel students to excel in academic and extracurricular activities (i.e. quidditch, possibly other clubs and organizations) without asking them.
4. Encourage the other members of each house to ostracize anyone who costs them in these activities, hurts their house's image, or loses points for whatever reason. This requires less participation on the teachers part and compels the students as they grow to behave in the way they /think/ everyone else in their house should. This is why so many of them end up gravitating towards each house stereotype.

The gist of this is that the system is much like the modern public school model, i.e. go to class for an hour, bell rings, rotate position, repeat. In the 19th century, this was designed to create factory workers. Hogwarts system is designed to compel good behavior and academic excelling. It has a specific purpose beyond the pale.

Additionally, the point system allows the teachers to manage a student body that outnumbers them more than 50 to 1. They can't give out detention for every transgression - their aren't enough teachers - and corporal punishment is no longer tolerated at Hogwarts since the 1950s.

The system is designed to create obedient citizens, where the population naturally seeks to not appear different from their social group (i.e. Houses) and for the students to discipline one another to compel obedience. They naturally carry these tendencies into the greater world once they leave school.

But that makes sense, just like it did with the boarding schools in Europe Rowling based Hogwarts off of.

Hogwarts was founded before the Ministry, before any form of magical government really. There effectively were no real laws on magicals, with the declarations of kings and feudal lords being irrelevant to even low-skilled wizards/witches. This system /indoctrinates/ graduates into being upstanding citizens and trying to appear normal: if someone commits a crime, the rest of the magical world in Britain will ostracize them and treat them as pariahs. Its rather Orwellian in its nature actually.

In some schools the organization of these events were class based. Every class was given a topic or event to conduct the assembly on and then the students along with the help of a teacher organized, conducted and performed poems, Plays, Speeches and the like.

In some of the other schools each of the house was given responsibility to organize the assemblies for a period of time and any event that happens in that time was their responsibility.

The Chaplin of that church would give speeches once a week during these assemblies, although I don't remember those to be religious, they were more random snippets of his life experiences or other stories.

Nope, nothing for either of these, or anything not Christian. There were special assemblies before Christmas exams as christmas celebrations, but they usually happened in late November.

As for how the schools themselves were like...most students (at least the ones in my social circle) didn't care for most of these things, and most teachers didn't either. They just paid token respect towards these things and went about their days.

** I remember from when I read HPMOR that the author talked about what was sufficient for people to form groups that were in opposition. Apparently the study suggested that group formation was, in itself, sufficient.

Now... I spent thirteen years going to schools with house structures and I can honestly say I don't think anyone cared overly much, with the exception of sports days and, at primary school, the end of term where the winning house got chocolates (Freddo Frogs, when my house frequently won anyway). But, then, these weren't boarding schools with five years of house-based classes. So... perhaps the result mentioned in the study that my memory of HPMOR says exists would hold out.

But, then, you've got to remember that Hogwarts is a small school in a really small society. People would rapidly learn peoples' personalities anyway (unless they were like Harry who I've come to see as having a particularly small circle of friends). So I'm not entirely sure we'd see anything overly different. It's really just Harry, his father and Hagrid who seem to have particularly strong dislikes of Slytherin as a whole. Possibly also Ron but I can only think of Epilogue!Ron. The Slytherins we meet who seem to intensely dislike Gryffindor... well, that's the least of their issues.

** I suspect the Hat sorts based on the culture of the house already in place, and how well the kid will do there. I know Hufflepuff House is said to be kind and loyal and such, but that's not strictly speaking the reason people are sorted there. Hufflepuff said she would take anyone the others didn't want. She saw value in them; SHE was kind, but her students weren't necessarily. Someone who was cruel, unambitious, cowardly, and dumb would still go to Hufflepuff, and would hopefully emerge at least as someone KIND, unambitious, cowardly, and dumb.

On another note, there's a really good essay here on the founding of Hogwarts and the origin of the House system. Basically the Sorting once actually made sense.

** I sometimes think the four founders would be horrified if they saw the extreme effects that their 'simple enough in theory' house system caused. The isolating of the Slytherins is hardly consistent with inter-house unity, and doesn't help them to thrive in a wider, more diverse group of people.

*** I always thought that each house once had their own tower (the astronomy tower, the divination classroom etc.) but over the decades since Hogwarts was built some of these got destroyed in wars and what have you and students were relocated elsewhere temporarily, which became permenant later when money or ability couldn't be found to move them back. It makes sense that the Slytherin common room was originally the actual dungeons or similar and the Hufflepuff was where the house elves (or possibly originally the servants) stayed, especially since both of these common rooms aren't guarded by portraits like the other two.

** Personally, I think that the best way to do it if you keep the system would be to resort every year or two.

Also not letting the yet to be sorted see the sorting of the ones before them, seems like it could influence them quite heavily (like HP who ended up in the red house because he didn't want to go to the same one as DM).

The much stronger reason was that Hagrid told him Voldemort was sorted into Slytherin, and it was the "bad house."

** I think sorted by years makes more sense.

Years 1 & 2 in Hufflepuff so they can be closest to classes/great hall/kitchens. So the firsties can have help from kids who were just in their same position (and not be intimated by upper classmen).

Years 3 & 4 in Slytherin.

Years 5 & 6 in Gryffindor.

Year 7 in Ravenclaw for more study areas and less people to distract them during NEWT levels.

The name of the houses could change as it truly wouldn't matter, I'm just saying where their dorms would be.

*** I like this idea :) it'll have to twist how the houses came to be in the first place:

/Said Hufflepuff, "I'll teach them first, introduce wizard traditions."/

/Said Slytherin, "I'll show them next the right path to their ambitions."/

/Said Gryffindor, "I'll teach the older to be chivalrous and daring."/

/Said Ravenclaw, "I'll teach the eldest, for their real life preparing."/

** The problem is that each personality traits have been pushed to their extreme. And that render it absurd because in extremal version they can only divide. But it is the entirety of the Britain social system that is creating a divide by blood status and political alignement. Even the pairing in the fandom reflects it by their statistics: Harry is always paired with someone from a light or neutral family. Never paired with someone with political aims that contradict those of the BWL. Your life is decided by this. The Light heir go to Gryffindor or in a extremal case Ravenclaw. The Neutral will go to Ravenclaw or Slytherin, with Very rare exception to the two others. And the Dark will go Ravenclaw or Slytherin. And the blood caries the personality trait so Harry will go to Gryffindor even if he wasn't raised by his Gryffindor parents. But I do think the sorting by personality traits possessed or to be developed is a good one. But it is the social divide of Magical Britain the problem.

** I remember reading a discussion or prompt once that suggested every student get sorted every year. Now, maybe after spending a year in one house you'd be disinclined to switch, but I think given some of the wild happenings in Harry's years, it's entirely possible that students might grow away from their original/previous house and get resorted into another one. I think that could help house unity more than anything, because you'd still have your friends even if they were outside your house.
