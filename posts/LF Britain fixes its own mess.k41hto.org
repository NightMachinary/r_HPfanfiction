Any story where Harry does not get involved with the Second War, at all. So Wizarding Britain is forced to sort itself out without him, or Riddle wins but Harry still doesn't get involved by the end. Whichever works.

Either Harry is considered Missing, or he doesn't care to get involved. Hell, maybe whoever has guardianship doesn't want him involved, like in Linkao3(8374798) Reclamation of Black Magic.

Thanks.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Update: May 2020 --- This story has been getting a lot of new readers lately, so I wanted to let you know that, yes, this story is currently on hiatus. As with many writers, I struggle with mental health issues, but I am working on them AND working on getting back to this story as soon as I possibly can. I sincerely thank you for your sweet comments and patience*

** Linkffn(8560964) A one shot where harry is attacked at privet drive and assumed dead . The Wizarding world is enraged and promptly gets it shit together. More comedic then serious.

  What will the Wizarding world do when it's reported that Harry Potter is dead? The answer might surprise you. (Based off an idea by Rorschach's Blot, and written/posted with his knowledge.)
