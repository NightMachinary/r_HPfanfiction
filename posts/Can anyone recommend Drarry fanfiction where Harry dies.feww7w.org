I'm in the mood for a sob fest.


** There's a time travel/AU one where the Alternate Harry dies and Canon Harry is summoned to Fill the Prophetic Gap. Alternate Draco is very weepy. Can't remember the name though, but it's one of the SilverFawkes/Dial-a-Hero era of tropes.

*** I think this is [[http://dacro.livejournal.com/137821.html][The World in Pieces]], but H/D is not the pairing since it's unrequited by canon Harry. Gen with a bit of mentor Snape.

**** It isn't? Maybe I'm getting it confused with something else then - I remember one where he's summoned and does get with Draco.

** You might have better luck on [[/r/HPSlashFic][r/HPSlashFic]].

[[https://fictionalley.ikeran.org/authors/plumeria/TPB01a.html][The Park Bench]] by Plumeria is short and sobby.

[[http://archive.skyehawke.com/story.php?no=4517][Our Tree]] by Frulie (AKA Dacro) is longer and sobbier.
