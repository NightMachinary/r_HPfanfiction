I am the kind of person who enjoys romance or comedy because even if i am having a horrible day they can always cheer me up. What are some stories that make you react notciably in public? Doesnt matter the reaction as long as people notice!

  Petunia performs a bit of accidental magic. It says something about her parenting that Uchiha Itachi is considered a better prospect for raising a child. Young Hari is raised by one of the most infamous nukenin of all time and a cadre of "Uncles" whose cumulative effect is very . . . prominent. And someone had the bright idea to bring him back to England. Merlin help them all.
