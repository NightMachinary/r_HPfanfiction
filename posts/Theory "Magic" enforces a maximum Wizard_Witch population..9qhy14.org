Most people know at least a layman's amount of information about evolution and, more relevant to this theory, natural selection works.

*Natural Selection*

1. Offspring is born and is below average or excels at specie-relative important skills. Either by generic mutation or... "practice" for lack of a better word.
2. The differences are either desired or repels possible mates.

3a. If desired, that specimen mates and gives offspring which, hopefully, carries those genes.

3b. If not desired, no one mates with that specimen and its genetic code dies out.

With enough Natural Selection over a very long time eventually a specie must be classified as something else. This line is typically arbitrary and difficult to pin down (typically, though, it's at the point where they can't breed with their ancestors), but eventually that specie is reclassified as something else. Thus, evolution.

Now, if you look at Wizards and Witches post-Statute of Secrecy, their much lower population makes sense. They're isolated, they're socially behind the times, etc.

But, before that... well, to be completely honest, Wizards and Witches just would have been /obviously/ superior to normal humans. They had similar social beliefs and shared the same level of technology, but Wizards and Witches live longer, have access to physical laws-defying capabilities and, from what we've seen in canon, seem physically sturdier. They also have the ability to /breed outside of their species/.

With what we know of Natural Selection, Wizards and Witches would have been seen as /far/ superior mates, thus creating more and more progeny until, eventually, like the homo sapiens did to the neanderthals, they would have just... usurped them. Homo sapiens would have gone extinct, minus the off-chance of Squibs.

So... why didn't they? We know Wizards and Witches were around for a /long time/ before the Statute of Secrecy, so how is it that the obviously superior mates didn't breed more often? How could their numbers have stayed so low? How could humans have been so outnumbering that they posed such a threat that Wizards and Witches felt the need to isolate themselves?

My theory is that Magic enforces a maximum population of magical users. Of course, there are a LOT of other possibilities. The title (and this theory) fit, of course, but I'm much more looking forward to the ideas of you guys.


** Wizarding population makes perfect sense. Look at Germany, Japan, or really any Western nation. With a high quality of life comes a low birth rate. Wizards just went through the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition][demographic transition]] before civilisation even got off the ground -- thanks to magic, they don't need sophisticated social structures, industry, technology etc. to achieve the quality of life necessary to make excess children surplus to requirement.

Evolution is not survival of the fittest. Evolution is survival of the species that reproduces the most. And wizards have good reasons to reproduce less than Muggles.

*** I'd argue that you are correct for any civilization that exists and has a significant enough population of wizards that they can form their own demographic group. I'd also argue that you are /incorrect/ when it comes to pre-civilization groups of humans and any situation where wizards are uncommon enough that their society/culture is critically dependant on muggles.

The key here is infrastructure. Even wizards can't do everything, so they rely upon other people and other people's creations to fill in the gaps. Wizards that can rely on modern wizarding infrastructure don't need to breed so heavily and will naturally go through their demographic transition. But if they're relying on a purely muggle infrastructure (or don't have one at all), they're in the same boat as muggles.

Worse, wizards are /critically/ reliant on their education. Alone and uneducated, a wizard is merely a durable human that can occasionally explode things when threatened - great for survival as cave people, not so great for doing everything else a civilization requires. But educate them and grow their population and they can each fill a vastly greater number of socioeconomic niches than a muggle could.

The limiting factor is not food or available mates, it's territory in the social landscape. They literally run out of metaphorical space for people in their societies faster than muggles do. But at the same time, when they die off, they free up space faster too.

I bet you that in cave-man times, wizards were extremely plentiful, probably more so than muggles, because primitive wizards could barely do more than a muggle. But, as society as a whole advanced, especially wizard society, muggles that could fit into smaller niches outbred the "bigger" wizards, shifting the population towards the mundane side.

I also think that the Statute of Secrecy was the worst thing that ever happened to the wizard-muggle demographic. Society kept getting more advanced, making individual wizards bigger and bigger in the socioeconomic sense, but wizards had just severely limited their amount of contact with the muggle world, "shrinking" the size of their social landscape considerably and stunting their future population growth even further.

Just food for thought.

*** If wizards underwent the demographic transition of low average birth rates a few hundred years ago, their society should be radically different.

Over a few hundred years, wizards descended from those who chose to have larger families (like the Weasley's) will come to make up larger and larger fractions of the wizarding population. Average family sizes should be getting larger and larger since there's no (or very few) limiting material conditions on wizarding fertility.

Natural selection still operates with a low infant mortality rate.

** I never bought the excuse that Salem Witch Trials precipitated the Statute of Secrecy in 1692. It was obviously a fan service by JKR to appeal Americans.

In 1692, Salem was pretty much an insignificant colony town of a medium sized European country. Why should Wizards in China, India, Ottoman Empire, Russia, and Safavid Persia give a fuck about that place in the middle of nowhere?

As for witch hunts, the scope and intensity were much higher on continental Europe in the 1500s. JKR's explanation made zero sense here. If the wizards were as powerful as she depicted, they should have little trouble keeping those medieval Muggles in check.

No, I think there had to be some existential threats that forced ALL Wizarding authorities to realize a separation was absolutely necessary. These threats would be supported by their seers and prophecies. As for what those threats were, it could indeed make an interesting discussion.

There had been about a century of near-constant warfare across Europe at that point, with every warzone having an outbreak of witch-hunting since the wars were either started by, or got used as an excuse to pursue, religious differences (and suddenly the Inquisition, with their attitude that magic wasn't a problem, were no longer the only player in town).

The big show, the Thirty Years War, had ended in 1648, but 1688 saw the first global war, the War of the League of Augsburg, break out. Which is about the right timing for a whole lot of meetings and politicking to produce an international agreement in 1692 to separate from the nonmagical world because "Damn it, the muggles're at it /again/!"

*** I never personally thought that wizards were ever in danger. It was more like making the transition from huts to modern houses in my head. They were just covering up the holes animals could get into. We can kill these animals easily but they're not even a real threat. In the same manner, I've always thought that wizards were just getting irritated with looking over their shoulders and whatnot.

Though I do like your idea of a bigger threat being present.

I don't think so -- or at least, not solely so. JKR originally had the International Statute of Secrecy signed in 1689, the date of the English Bill of Rights in which Parliament established once and for all its supremacy over the Crown. This is a nice parallel - governmental upheaval in Muggle and magical worlds.

She then later added that it came into force in 1692, most likely to coincide with the Salem Witch Trials, in (I suspect) an effort to make magical history less English-centric. It was less fan service for Americans and more a concession to the existence of a world outside England.

With respect to your post in general, I think you're forgetting a few things:

- You're talking about going into hiding as if it was a great inconvenience for the wizards, and thus requiring an existential threat. But in fact wizards are barely inconvenienced by secrecy at all.

- On top of that, we know that wizarding secrecy was /de facto/ in place for centuries before the Statute was passed, again emphasising how un-revolutionary it was. While the odd wizard like the Malfoy family had strong ties to the Muggle elite, most wizards kept to themselves, and wizards already had their own separate governments (e.g. the British Ministry, MACUSA) as well as distinct territories (wizarding Britain predates the Muggle Acts of Union by at least 500 years).

- We know that it was a debate in the wizarding world whether to a) enact secrecy or b) conquer the Muggles. Wizards /chose/ the first option, they weren't forced into it.

- With respect to the supposed insignificance of Salem, you are forgetting that wizards consider themselves to be part of a global, unified community of wizards before they consider themselves to belong to any specific nationality. We see this multiple times in the various "country vs kind" debates, in which wizards consistently choose loyalty to wizards before loyalty to their country (American revolutionary war) to the point that wizards engaging in war with other nations is actually illegal under the Statute of Secrecy (Crimean war). The only time it seems to have taken place, post-Statute, is the First World War, and even then involvement was strictly speaking illegal. We also see it in the high coordination between wizarding governments (HBP re-arranged phone call), and in the EU-like international harmonisation of regulations that is ongoing (international standardisation of cauldron bottom thickness).

*** There's some finagling here for JKR. The Inquisition could also be mentioned, but it was mentioned that wizard-Muggle relations had been strained for ages before the SoS. The Salem Trials were just a sort of a turning point that left wizards with two choices: destroy or enslave the Muggles, or hide. And it wasn't even just those events. On Pottermore, it mentions how wizards (especially aristocratic families like the Malfoys) begged the English royal family to stop the persecution but they refused, so those two options were basically all they had. Given all of those, I can see why the SoS was done. An appeal to the better angels of their nature, as many wanted the violent option that was clearly viable, as you mention.

***** What I'm saying by pointing out three huge instances of anti-wizard activities in addition to general persecution by Muggles is that it was a problem worldwide for wizards. Presumably other regions had their own issues.

We learned that as soon as wizards came to America, far removed from Europe, the Puritans were already attacking and persecuting them, and willing to kill other Muggles on flimsy assertions that they were secret wizards. There didn't appear to be any safe zone to this sort of thing. You can see it in some African and Middle Eastern nations today, aspersions of witchcraft leading to execution.
