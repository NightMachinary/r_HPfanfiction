I know Pertunia is not a good person but It doesnt stop the me from likeing her and the possibility of her being a great Aunt. So I really want to know if there are some story where she is a prominent character. Or any where Snape get along better with her.

If there are any where she doesn't marry Vernon. I know that years ago I read one where she dates Sirius. Are there any like these. It doesn't really matter who she's just as long it's not vernon.

Prefer it not to be Harry centric at all.


** "By Baker Street Station, I Sat Down and Wept" is a great Petunia-centric story. She gets divorced from Vernon early on, but doesn't like Snape.

I've written "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider" where she is a squib and doesn't meet Vernon but becomes a tomb raider for Gringotts instead.

** linkao3(To Make an End by JackieJLH) A short AU where they become friends after Lily's death. Believable, but bittersweet. She does marry Vernon but ends up leaving him. Warning: not a happy ending.

  At first she didn't quite believe her eyes. Severus Snape here, on her doorstep, was so far outside the realm of anything she'd ever believed possible that she couldn't fully comprehend what she was seeing for a few seconds.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.
