Is there any evidence that there is an actual muggleborn orientation where muggleborns and their families are brought to Diagon Alley, or is that just fanon based on McGonagall visiting the Grangers?


** Fanon, but also a reasonable assumption. They have to do something to preserve the statute of secrecy. Unless they get super creepy with the mind magic the first year muggleborns seen way too calm to not have gotten some kind of orientation, not to mention not crying hysterically about being kidnapped and having their parents' memories erased.

**** Sorry, I wasn't clear. I was suggesting the only alternative to having some sort of muggleborn orientation that would preserve secrecy would be mass obliviation.

** Fanon along with "booklets with basic information on magical world" I think.

** Fanon based on the assumption that Dumbledore would want to acclimate muggleborns to his school. No evidence either way, but it can be assumed that other muggle-raised witches/wizards get a guide through Diagon Alley like Hagrid guided Harry, at the very least.

*** Guides who presumably tell them how to get onto the fucking invisible platform.

**** Would've been funny if there was 20 other kids just milling around Kings across trying to find the freakin' platform. Then the Weasleys show up and start a trail of wizard kids walking through a wall. I know the muggles can't see them go through, but imagine how panicked security would be when all these kids just spontaneously disappear from view within a minute or two.
