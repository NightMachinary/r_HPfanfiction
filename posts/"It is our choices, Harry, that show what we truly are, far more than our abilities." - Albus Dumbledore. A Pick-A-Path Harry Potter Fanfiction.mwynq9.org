A bit of context before we begin: see, a few days ago, as I was scrolling through Youtube, I got the trailer for the remake of Tsukihime in my recommendations([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psufM6QaQws]]) and it piqued my interest, especially the opening that I keep repeating because I'm a fucking weeb and holy shit, that animation is gorgeous. I mean, look at this: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vxlbtzI1bc]] That puddle at 0:03 has got to be the sexiest anime puddle I've ever seen.

Since I am a big fan of the Fate series and Tsukihime was made by the creators of Fate(Type-Moon), I thought "Why not?" and I dived in. I read the 73 chapters of the Tsukihime manga(very good, by the way, a solid 8/10) in a day and went on to watch playthroughs of the Visual Novel on Youtube because I'm too lazy to download it.

Anyway, as I then went back to my beloved Harry Potter fanfics to see if one of the countless stories I'm following had updated, I started to think "What If..." What if someone wrote a Visual Novel-Like, Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Harry Potter Fanfiction with a choice at the end of every chapter and the readers, are the one who decide where the story goes?

Will Harry go to Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Slytherin or Ravenclaw? Will Harry decide that Hagrid raising a dragon is not his problem? When Mcgonagall tells him not to worry about the stone, will Harry think that she is right and leave the third corridor alone? Will Harry accept Voldemort's offer to join him? And which girl -or boy- is our hero going to end up with?

And if you've got BIG BALLS, you can even include choices that will lead eventually lead to a bad end later on. In one of of Fate/Stay Night's bad endings, Shirou is torn apart by Berserker before Illya proceeds to curse him so that he cannot die or lose consciousness unless his head is destroyed, and then takes his head so that she can torture him indefinitely. Ouch.


** To be honest, I think it's a great idea. I'd read that easy, and if someone does write it, link me. The problem I see is actually having a full fleshed story, with valid choices would be a lot of writing. I mean, even just looking at the examples you gave of Harry being sorted into 4 different houses. That's four different stories just from the start. I could imagine something like that would run to a million words or more, and I've seen few fics that long. Great idea though ðŸ˜Š
