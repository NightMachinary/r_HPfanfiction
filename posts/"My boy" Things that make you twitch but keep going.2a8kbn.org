Somebody please tell me if Dumbledore ever uttered the words "my boy" in the books. Because they seem way too condescending for book!Dumbles, who made it a point to humblebrag while at least making a show of treating others as equals on some level. I really like him in the books, but when I read these words in a fic I can't help but wonder if the writer missed the point of his character. The only exception is when manipulative!Dumbledore is important to the plot, and therefore had to be tweaked a little bit, though I still find that kind of lazy.

It's not as grating as "Mione," but still irksomely common.

What are some little things that won't necessarily make you stop reading, but you wish would stop anyways? Might be useful for those of us that are working on fics ourselves.


** - Sirius and Remus referring to Harry as 'pup' or 'prongslet', especially if no attempt at becoming an animagus is ever brought up
- Speaking of animagi- Harry's animagus form being anything magical. I can believe he'd have more than one form, at least while Voldemort's soul piece is still stuck to his head, but they would be mundane creatures
- Most variations of Hermione that aren't spelled 'Hermione'
- Dobby's speech pattern resembling Jar Jar Stepin-Fetchit

*** Oh god, prongslet is horrible. I know one of Sirius's biggest faults was seeing too much of James in Harry, but that's just removing his uniqueness. And Remus would /never/ in a million years consider doing that, and the only reason Sirius had that line of thought was because of twelve years of constant psychic torture.

Agree with all the rest, but the first one is just so wrong on so many levels.

A similar thing happens with quotes. People are not content with using "said" all the time or just leaving the bare quotes. So they have their characters snickering, sneering, smirking, chortling, opining, answering, and querying for all their words instead of just saying them.

If they just used "say", I'd skip over it (except for noting who said the thing). But instead they're drawing attention away from what people are saying.

This means that someone exclaimed "Get back!" and subsequently someone (probably but not necessarily the same person) started shouting something the author didn't care to tell us. I can ignore it if it happens once or twice; people don't always have the most thorough editors available. When it's consistent, though, it's grating.

Women as decoration and as sycophants, a year ago, would have qualified. Now I can't reread a lot of the stuff that I previously liked because Harry's special and the ladyfolk all must bow to his whims and become his slaves and have no semblance of goals beyond helping him. Perhaps not quite slaves, perhaps no bowing, but there should be more to them than their mode of speech, physical attributes, and a little bit of flavor in how they approach helping Harry. They should be real people with real goals.

** Any use of the word Quim. Its like the feminine form of throbbing turgid member.

I also dislike Americanisms, like any character referring to trousers as pants (though I can let the misplaced u's slide).

The worst though is any character barring Hagrid drinking a pint of mead. There are several different strengths of mead depending on how its made but the most common is a tiny bit stronger than wine (about 13-15%), and the next is more like a dessert wine (17-20%). If you drank it by the pint, you'd fall straight over.

*** As a side note, there's one that annoys me much more not because its common in fan fiction, but because its theme park canon. What goes in pumpkin juice? The juice of a pumpkin damn it! Not sugar and cream and cinnamon and everything they can think of to make it taste nothing like what it is, just the damn juice of a pumpkin.

Also butterbeer. Like it or not, this isn't something Rowling just made up, its a Tudor drink make with small beer, butter, eggs, sugar and a tiny bit of spice if the maker was rich. It would have been about 1% alcohol (small beer is already no more than about 2%, and you heat it to make buttered beer) and in those days would have been seen as perfectly suitable to serve to children. I know these days people get upset if you give kids alcohol at theme parks, but that doesn't make that thing with cream soda and less wrong.

Incidentally, I reread the books recently and had forgotten how much they talk about food. Never read them on an empty stomach (or while on a diet).

*** I drink it by the pint, more or less. I believe the cup is 14 ounces, so close enough.

I also only drink to get drunk, none of this buzz stuff.

Anyway I haven't seen the word quim in a long time, but it was almost always accompanied with "quivering." Which is just odd.

Would anyone believe that three highly intelligent people like James, Sirius and Remus would truly take a liking to Peter if he was only there to be a punchline to jokes?

Also, James ruffling his hair in every Marauder-fic gets annoying. Yes, we know you've read one line in OoTP, now move on.

*** In the one I'm reading right now, Dumbledore is always calling Snape "my dear boy" in private conversations and frankly (it's /sort of/ AU), it makes a lot of sense and seems natural enough. I can't even remember if he did that in canon when it was just them, but I think it largely depends on the context.
