I mainly read fanfics about these ships (since I'm on them): Harry/Hermione, Harry/Daphne, Hermione/Harry/Daphne and Harry/Fleur.

However, I have two guilty pleasures: Harry/Pansy and Harry/Bellatrix.

How about you? Do you have guilty pleasures?


** Harry/fem!Harry, because I like when Harry has someone who's been through terrible shit too and has also managed to get back up each time they get beat down. I greatly dislike pairings where the girl is just a pretty face who can't do shit. Part of why Ginny is good for Harry is because she's been beat down by Voldemort, too, and still stood tall afterward.

Also, incest.

**** Given that it feels like half of the Blacks have first cousins as parents, it would be more akin to continuing the family tradition. I like the admittedly cracky headcanon that Sirius and Narcissa were having an affair before her marriage just to spite everyone else.

***** I find the idea of some Bellatrix/Sirius stuff interesting now that you bring him up. Always thought it was odd Bellatrix and him seemed to be toying with each other during their duel and not going after each other very hard and that Bella seemed to fire a shot of red light(stunning spell) at him instead of avada kadavra. maybe if he hadn't stepped in front of the arch and got knocked in he'd be okay. anywyay i find the idea that Bellatrix didn't full yhate him despite what she says to add excellent character depth to her and maybe his being a Black counted for something to her after all.... very very deep down.

****** Yeah, I doubt that Bellatrix was planning trickshots. And Tonks also came out of duelling her knocked out and not mutilated or a vegetable, which adds credibility to that theory.

Then again, my headcanon is that Bellatrix and Andromeda kept getting along even after one of them became a Death Eater. Just imagine Tonks coming home after the Azkaban breakout only to find her mother and Bellatrix having tea.

You get a lot of negative feedback when you write scenes where the girl saves Harry, even is she has way more combat experience. Because heavens forbid if Harry doesn't pull Mission Impossible style escapes every time someone has a wand to his neck.

** When it comes to pairings? Nah. I like what I like. I may enjoy certain pairings more than others or in a different way, but I don't consider any lesser or more indulgent.

The same cannot be said for fic. There's a very specific kind which I'd liken to a romance novel. Imminently readable, on the light side, and mixed with just the right tropes or characterizations. Given the proper mood, I'll eat those up with a spoon, regardless of any other flaws.

** I really like smart evil characters as protagonists:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10677106/1/Seventh-Horcrux][Seventh Horcrux]], linkffn(10677106): Harrymort is evil, without question. He even admitted that "murder was a great stress reliever". On the other hand, his thought process, his actions and their consequences are totally hilarious.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929): Grindelwald, although having a noble goal, really struggled in not committing some serious atrocities. Despite his 'restraint', he and his followers compiled a huge body count, and spread chaos and wars all over Europe. Harry and his friends really profited from all that mess.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12614436/1/Hermione-Granger-Demonologist][Hermione Granger, Demonologist]], linkffn(12614436): This Hermione is definitely evil as she considered Voldemort an ally and furthered his and the devil's cause, but she's so adorable at same time.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11858167/1/The-Sum-of-Their-Parts][The Sum of Their Parts]], linkffn(11858167): Ok, maybe this Harry is still only a vigilante, but he and his friends are getting progressively more brutal and ruthless as the story goes on.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]], linkffn(8192853): Despite his murders and creepy relationship with Tonks, I do enjoy this fic and its Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6160345/1/My-Slytherin-Harry][My Slytherin Harry]], linkffn(6160345): Maybe they are not evil yet, but this Harry/Ginny pair really likes to torture their enemies.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10972919/1/The-Evil-Overlord-List][The Evil Overlord List]], linkffn(10972919): Tom and 'Jerry' make a superbly evil duo.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I am Lord Voldemort?]], linkffn(12980210): A new fic I recently found in which an SI replaced Tom Riddle. Still extremely evil, but at least this person's evil has much better purposes.

** You almost have my preferred ships down perfectly. Including Harry/Bella as a guilty pleasure. I also try to read Harry/Tonks but sadly it's very rarely good. Especially stories during Hogwarts tend to come out lacking in that regard (only good one I read in that regard was a great Teddy time travel shortstory).

As for guilty pleasures I like Hermione/Fleur, Hermione/Bella, Hermione/Narcissa, Hermione/FemHarry. I'd also like Hermione/Daphne but can't remember ever encountering that pairing (besides harem/multi fics). At this point I'm not even sure if it's a guilty pleasure anymore to be honest.

I'd say harem fics are an occasional guilty pleasure, but they are often of dubious quality and more likely than not someone enters the pairing that I don't like.

IMO, the most inovative AU : Harry Potter cannot use a wand, but he can use his joystick. Harry-multiple; Harry against males ( actually take a look at the author other fics- the true daughter of the Blacks has also a very interesting A.U and Bill Weasley is the bad guy there)

Literally laughed my ass off...the will reading is a work of art. Did not like the middle as much, but the ending is also fine.

  Harry snaps at the beginning of the first task, and stops caring about anything, including whether he lives or dies. The Goblet decides to take matters into its own "hands". Toss in a mildly depressed dragon, and things get very interesting very fast. Didn't start out as a crack-fic, kinda turned into one.

That's definitely my go-to guilty pleasure. It's fun, funny, and a masterfully executed "OP, time-travel, ass-kicking Harry just kicking ass left and right." It's roughly novella length and knows not to overstay its welcome or over-do the jokes (my major complaint about the other two well-regarded comedies - A Black Comedy and Seventh Horcrux).

But, it's not very good as an actual, dramatic story. Plus, its got this disquieting vibe of misogyny and a heavy dollop of assholery. I /shouldn't/ like Harry as much as I do (sorta like how you're /not supposed to like/ Walter White in Breaking Bad). So yeah. Guilty pleasure for sure.

**** linkao3:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15842229/chapters/36893670]]) this fic pink and blue is what got me into hermione/luna really long(maybe the longest Luna/Hermione fic ever written not sure) mostly fluffy cute fun for ages but got a plot later on and is going a tad dark now bellatrix is a character also a tad smutty at times.

linkao3:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990/chapters/5726924]]) then theres the famous crazy little things probably the most loved Luna/Hermione fic in the tiny amount of fics there are but the longer pink and blue goes on the more it may take the crown.

​

linkffn:([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7693287/1/]]) This is a good Pansy/Hermione one imo

​

linka03([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6623722/chapters/15156934]]) fond of this Hermione/Pansy one as well

​

linkao3:([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6339199/chapters/14523508]]) This Pansy/Hermione is a fav but it starts as pure smutty but gets a tad more romatic with plot as it goes on

***** I'd love a story where Bellatrix gets together with Hermione without torturing her or killing Sirius. Sadly, the Bellamione community seems to be in favour of making their relationship as problematic as possible instead of doing what is common in Harry/Bellatrix and consider a decade in Azkaban as sufficient punishment (or they write out her crimes altogether, something which I am not a fan of).

** My guilty pleasures are multi ships (usually Snape/Harry/Draco, Harry/Draco/Lucius, or Hermione/Draco/Lucius) or a Lucius ship with Harry or Hermione. Even better if Snape and/or the Malfoys are still arrogant pricks (though not to Harry/Hermione).

I also don't mind a good super powered Harry or time travel fic (even better if you put the two together).

** Well, I don't have any when it comes to ships, but I do like stories where the main character gets magically (or whatever) changed into a girl and the story then proceeds to pick up the pieces. Although really I just like stories where the main character is a girl but at the same time want them to not be too out-of-character from the get-go, and it's quite common for people who write stories where the character has always been of the opposite sex to end up making the character in question too different.

Also, stories where the main character provides a lovely commentary about anything and everything, such as “Seventh Horcrux” ... or Haruhi ('tis a Japanese thing), because in the light novels Kyon snarks at everything like 110% of the time.
