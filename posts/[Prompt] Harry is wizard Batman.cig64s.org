#+begin_quote
  Amy "don't call me Amaryllis" Potter never went to Hogwarts, but the Goblet of Fire makes her a compelled competitor in the Triwizard Tournament. Will three years of tutelage by the Dynamic Duo see her through the treacherous tasks? Will being Batgirl help her beat the villainous Voldemort? And what's with that bewitching yet bothersome, bushy-haired bookworm? Tune in to find out!
