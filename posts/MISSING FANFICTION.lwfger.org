Pls help me finding that one

Little Harry was chased by Dudley, but then teleported. I remember that he was also in the hospital and some wizards finds out who he is,? and that he was abused? not sure. Anyway they adopted him, Harry has different name and goes to other wizards school. Some day Dumbledore finds out where he is and go to him. I also remember that he met Cornelius Fudge and go back to England. I remember that there was mentioned something about Â¿harry's friend and phone? Harry also has different name. I think that he also traveled to England with aurors and they mentioned Sirius Black? Also Daily Prophet was mentioned (they find out that harry was found) PLS HELP ME <3

Also sorry for bad English
