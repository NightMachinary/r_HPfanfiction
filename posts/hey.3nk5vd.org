** I've been looking for this story myself, but haven't found it yet. Hermione is the girl who lived in this new world, and has the scar and tragic life. And Harry's been a git to her.

** Normally I'd try some old fashioned googling to help you out, But i'd need for information. Besides that, Hermione as the girl-who-lived, that's a new one to me, sounds interesting.

*** I'm usually good at finding fics, but that one keeps eluding me. I don't remember exact quotes, just the gist of a few scenes. Harry seeing Hermione, with the scar, looking exhausted and thin, in the Great Hall. He tries to talk to her, and her friend - I think Ginny - keeps him away.
