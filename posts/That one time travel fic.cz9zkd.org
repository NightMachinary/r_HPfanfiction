The fic starts along the lines of Harry has been obliviated and is living in Australia before Hermoine and someone else come to bring him back?

I know it's not a lot to go on but thanks in advance.

#+begin_quote
  Harry and Rose Potter faced everything together...until the Ministry ripped him away from her. Now, finally, Rose - with the assistance of Gabrielle Delacour - has found him again. They've got a plan to fix what was broken; and maybe get a bit of revenge along the way. Pairing: Harry/OFC/Gabrielle (twincest).

** Sounds like You're My Density by RobSt - linkffn(11033616) although I don't recall if Harry was in Australia.

P.S. A brief skim seems to show he was still in Britain.

  Just Suppose Harry hadn't heeded his godfather's advice, and actually lost his temper at his trial? Time travel fic and title is 'Back to the Future' joke.
