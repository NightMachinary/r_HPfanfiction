** I've heard Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a good series to start, apparently there are 7 books and the author moved away to start writing plays (we'll see how that goes). The abuse isn't the main part of the plot but it is there and definitely messes up Harry psychology (no spoilers but that epilogue is just disturbing!).

*In all seriousness though I don't know of any but good luck :D*

*** Yeah, I don't get how the OP can't find a fic where Snape is abusing children - that's his normal and canon characterization.
