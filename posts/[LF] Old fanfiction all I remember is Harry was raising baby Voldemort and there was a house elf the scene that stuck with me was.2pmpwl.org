the house elf said she would protect the baby with her life harry was about to say no but then he realized he would want her to give her life to save Baby Tom


** I think I know this fic. Does it involve dimension travel, Harry, Tom and house elf moving into a house with a kid ghost near the Weasleys and Lovegoods?

Edit: I'm sorry, but I don't think I bookmarked/saved it at any way at all. :(
