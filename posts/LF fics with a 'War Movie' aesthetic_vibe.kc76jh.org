I'm curious if anyone has actually pulled off the big World War vibe in a Harry Potter fic before. Trench warfare, dying in No Man's Land, desperately depressed yet hopeful letters home, that sort of thing. Not sure if it's possible in this fandom, but that's what I'm hoping to find out. :)

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** And the Wolves All Cry by monroeslittle

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8809533]]

30k words, Marauder fic. AU where Voldemort does not learn of the prophecy until years later. It is not trench warfare bc most is written from Lily's perspective, but you do get a strong WWII vibe from it.

*** Thanks for the rec - I poked through the first few 'sections' (not sure what to call the things between the linebreaks) and it looks pretty good. Not entirely sure if it meets my request yet, but it's interesting enough for me to keep reading and find out. :D

** Part of the problem is that open warfare kills off characters too quickly for the story to last long, there are really not that many wizards. From memory linkffn(6291747) sort of does it from Hermione's perspective stuck on the home front, but is probably not quite what you are looking for.

linkffn(4881348) Unbroken Universe set of four, has the war never stopping in 1981 and grinding on, so gets quite grim.

Very true. But I do imagine magic would give them a bit of a leg-up in the survival aspects, at least. And hey, there aren't that many wizards now. After a world war, there weren't that many muggles left either. Maybe there were more beforehand?

Yeah, I poked through Isolation a little bit and I'm not sure if it is quite what I'm looking for. Might get the vibe a bit more when I sit down and actually read it properly though - the hopeless optimism of the homefront is more of a slow, passive thing than the active warfront, after all. :)
