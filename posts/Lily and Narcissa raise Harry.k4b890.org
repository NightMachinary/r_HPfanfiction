:END:
Been trying to find a story I read once for about a week now. I dont remember much but I do remember a few things.

Harry somehow gets brought to a parallel universe where Lily is still alive.

James is dead I think.

Lily is dating or married to Narcissa and both consider Harry their child.

I dont remember the name but every search I've done cant find it.


** This one doesn't completely fit your description, but it has a few elements so I figured I'd suggest it linkffn(the return of the marauders by TheLastZion)

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating

** James isn't dead in it, but otherwise, it sounds rather like linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wand of Uru by alienyouthct). The author used to go by a different name, and the story used to be longer.

  After slipping diagonally through time and space to a familiar time in an unfamiliar world, Harry finds himself fighting to save a future that's not quite what he remembers. Crossover between Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with pre-Fox acquisition X-Men elements and reimagined Inhumans. Polyamorous Harry.

*** Not the one I was remembering, but thanks.

The one I'm thinking of had Harry walking in on Lily and Narcissa making out on the kitchen table and when he leaves to go out into the back yard, he calls them mum and mother.
