90% of Azkaban Harry stories are "Harry is found innocent, but got some kind of godtier power that oneshots Voldemort whilst in Azkaban, and then is somehow shoehorned back into Hogwarts where he endures bullshit from everyone and doesn't just say "Fuck off Dumbledore" and leave everyone to die.

Veela Malfoy fics are where the overly prejudiced halfbreed hating wizarding britain bends over backwards for a filthy dark creature to force Harry into a creepy relationship (I can't ever see Harry/Hermione/Anyone on the Light being a submissive to a racist bigot who supports Voldemort and only got off because his Mother lied to Voldemort) I've never seen a Veela Malfoy fic where Wizarding Britain has gone "And why should we subject our saviour to a filthy dark creature?" and that sort of thing.

People often add GreaterGood!Dumbledore into tags, but have very rarely had Dumbledore go on a killing spree, burn Azkaban to the ground the moment he knows Voldemort is back so he can't get back his elites, make Malfoy "Suddenly poor" or "Suddenly dead" so he doesn't manipulate Fudge, you know, ACTUAL Greater Good, rather than "I AM EVIL BUT AUTHOR JUSTIFIES ME BY LETTING ME KEEP FAWKES. I R GREATER GOOD" because stealing from a child, binding his magic, setting him up to be abused... He actually makes Julian Ainsworth from Fate Kaleid seem like a Nice person in those fics.

Just fics that use Tropes like that, but don't write the exact same fic with different words. Azkaban Harry could start the same, but when Voldemort attacks "Hey Tom, if you let me go, the Prophecy says we're both Immortal if we don't kill each other, Get me an untraceable Wand and a Portkey to America and Britain is yours" just want to read something new.


** I believe BajaB did a fairly good Azkaban HP story. Can't remember the name though.

There's Rent a Hero, which has the best Divination I've ever read. Divination actually works in that fic instead of being reduced to "imprecise magic that we can't really do, but prophecies are legit lol" garbage.

Rise of the Wizards has the best misguided Dumbledore I've read so far.

  A 'Harry goes to Azkaban' story. Convicted for releasing the Basilisk from the Chamber of Secrets, Harry is put into a cell next to the most feared wizard in the world, Sirius Black. AU 3rd year, canon pairings, no Deathly Hallows.

** There's very few fics that actually manage to transcend beyond the cliches they're built on. A lot of them are usually a victim of themselves, despite claims to the contrary. But I will say that "Out of the Night" by raining ink manages it.

** -Two fics that treat marriage contract differently than most of the fanon linkffn(Contractual Invalidation; The Legacy by storytellwer)

-Though its a small point and not at all important to the story, there's the idea that a "quarter-veela" doesn't have any powers and everyone are just dumb to think so, and Fleur plays up the charade. linkffn(Vitam Paramus)

-A great fic with "daughter of DE trying to leave her horrible family by becoming Harry's girlfriend" with a few twists. linkffn(The Lies that Bind)

-Actual good use of Time Turners, Unicorn Blood, Original Creature, "Training Montage" and a great Dumbledore that is doing what he can to win, and overall fantastic fic. linkffn(Eclipse of the Sky)

-An actual Dark Harry where Crucio is just a "boring" spell and he's really really evil and fairly insane without any of those "my friends betrayed me, nobody loves me -angsty shit that people do" with a Mentor Voldemort. Its a 6-part series. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming)

-In my opinion, the best actual GG Dumbledore, where he's doing anything, and sacrificing who he needs to(even himself), so they can win a war that's been going on for far longer than in canon. link(Imprisioned Realm)

** I'm writing a "Black family" story with some Wizengamot politics which has pretty much no impact on Harry, who is just happy to have a loving family. The "political acquaintance" is just a lady with a baking addiction who visits occasionally and brings cake. Harry does not even get the "Lordship". The treatment of the Dursely abuse does not turn Harry into the Hulk/Arnold. The "training room" filled with melee weapons is used once to have some fun dicking around with swords and maces. Harry ditches Divination with Hermione but takes Muggle Studies instead of Runes or Arithmancy. The overall tone is pretty much a slice of life fic.

It's actually a pretty nice change from your typical soul bond fic.
