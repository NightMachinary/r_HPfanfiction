Apparently Godric's Hollow was one of the most famous wizarding villages in the country, with many witches and wizards living there (and muggles too). I don't know if the Potter family mainly resided there before the war, but one thing is sure it's that the cottage was theirs during the last months before their death. I don't know if they were originally from Godric's hollow (the peverells were and one peverell daughter married into the potter family ) but anyway, someone must have known the cottage was James and Lily's (neighbours etc..)

So what would happen if they wake up someday and then the cottage isn't there anymore ? Wouldn't it have been better if they took a plane to some other country and just laid low with 0 interaction to the wizarding world?

  The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.

Number Twelve was only put under a Fidelius between books four and five. So the neighbors must have completely forgotten that it existed.

  (AU) In 1979, Regulus Black vanished with horcrux in hand, obscuring himself and destroying the locket. When the risen Voldemort calls his followers once again in '95, Regulus makes haste to the home he left behind half a lifetime ago, reconnecting with his estranged brother and settling on a very different side of the conflict. The Order of the Phoenix is reborn from the ashes.

Yeah, but wasn't that the whole problem with them staying in there once the war heated up?

**** The way I understand the charm's description, the area around 12 Grimmauld Place under it would be removed from their perception.

Not even as a hole in space, but the space around it would knit together seamlessly. So that they'd know their cousin's house was/should be "there", probably even that it was under a Fidelius; but they can't access it no matter what they do, and if people in the know Apparate within the charm's radius, they too will be impossible to detect.

If I'm right, this would also make trying to besiege a suspected or even conclusively deduced Fidelius location from outside impossible and dangerous: the hidden people inside might be able to attack with impunity (even if they have to poke their wands out of the charm's space), while any return fire would never be able to get inside the charm's range because as far as the besieger is concerned, everything inside the Fidelius charm is intangible.

Edit: So Narcissa and Bellatrix would still know what and where 12 Grimmauld Place is, but might as well have forgotten, because they couldn't do anything useful about it.

*** No the Fidelius lasted until at least book 7. There were just more secret-keepers after Dumbledores death.

I think the reason why muggles didn't know about the existence of #12 is because, as Sirius says, his father used every precaution known in his time to avoid interacting with muggles. The house disappearing from their sights was merely a symptom (or the goal) of one of those spells, but it wasn't hidden for wizard folk until Dumbledore cast the Fidelius charm. Perhaps the spell goes back even further, given that it (edit: the house) has been in the family for a long time before that either.

*** The house wasn't the secret, the fact that the Order's headquarters was there was. As I said in the other comment, I see no reason not to take the description by Flitwick literally, i.e. that a /secret/ is hidden, not something that is common knowledge. So the charm doesn't make people forget, it makes people unable to find out if they want to know -- so you have to make sure few people know about the secret (i.e., that it is a "secret") /before/ you cast the spell.

As for #12, Sirius says there already were lots of spells on it, and I always assumed those were the reason the Muggles didn't know about it (the house).

It's quite easy to change one's appearance, move out and stop using magic. It would take them YEARS to find them again. Harry was living in a tent in the middle of the uk and was never found (if it wasn't for the taboo).

No, he would have to ask Peter Pettigrew. Or find Sirius. Both of whom would know exactly where they were and, without the Fidelius Charm, it would be a hell of a lot easier to get that info.

But also we see Voldemort hop from location to location trying to find Gregorovitch and the person who disarmed him. We know he hunted Karkaroff down. We knew Slughorn was hopping from house to house trying to escape. We know he found Harry pre resurrection and attempted to break those spells.

Cutting ties with everyone and relocating somewhere else isn't that easy to find in my opinion. The golden trio managed it in their seventh year (without the taboo accident) and that was just inside of the uk.

I don't like how the fidelitus charm works, where they chose to cast it and there being a secret and secret keeper makes it way too dependent on a tierce person. And puts the 3rd person even more in danger.

** As was pointed out, this is not how the Fidelius Charm works.

Perhaps more generally, this is not how magic works in HP. In this case, the Fidelius hides a secret so that it can't be told. This requires two things: One, magic works on insubstantial things like "secrets". This means you can forget about considering physical constraints like "what about the building". And two, the spell requires a "secret" to begin with. "Hiding" something that everyone knows conceptually makes no sense, and consequentially won't work magically.

Hence, the likely sequence of events is the Potters moved to the cottage in Godric's Hollow to hide there, then performed the charm, and afterwards, people would be unable to find out they hid there. In practice, the cottage remained a cottage, all the villagers would know about it, but /not/ that the Potters were inside.

To that extent, the charm is foolproof. And this is why there was no reason at all to try anything else and more complicated ... except of course that Pettigrew told Voldemort, which they couldn't have known.

This was the part that confused me to be honest :

- The cottage remains there, but does everyone forget who it belongs to ? Or do they forget who lived there before ?

- There was a spy in the order so Voldemort eventually knew they were using the fidelitus. Now assuming they chose Sirius. Wormtail would only tell Voldemort there was a fidelitus and who the secret keeper was, he couldn't actually give him the secret. Voldemort would then have to either find Sirius, or try to find the potters. Would it have been possible to attack the cottage from outside, or even the whole village, if he knew the potters were hiding under fidelitus there ? ( and this is why i asked if people would remember the cottage's existence and who it belonged to/used to live there before)

**** Hm. I don't quite see what you're getting at or why the first is even relevant. It's hiding, only with magic.

Perhaps it becomes clearer if you forget about the magic part. Assume the Potters moved to the cottage in the dead of the night, and then hid in a secret room in the basement. Now what does it matter what the villagers know about the cottage? Some may remember the people that used to live there, others perhaps know that it's empty etc. -- the point is that no one knows the Potters live there now.

And all the charm would do it prevent them from figuring that out. They will just keep thinking whatever they thought before, they can't tell the Potters are now inside. Just as if they were hidden in that secret room.

As for the second, I don't think it was common knowledge how they hid. That seems to be something they talked about only with Dumbledore and Flitwick, which makes sense, too, since they already suspected a spy in the order. Of course, this is also not too important, because Voldemort is clever, and if he couldn't seem to find the Potters, he was going to suspect something was done magically. Presumably, that is why they switched to Pettigrew, as Sirius would be the obvious next person to pursue to find out more.

But it would have led to nothing either way -- Voldemort would have been literally unable to figure out they hid in the cottage in Godric's Hollow. Your "he knew the potters were hiding under fidelitus there" doesn't work. That is the precise thing he was never going to know. And since he was never going to know, the question of "attacking the cottage" also doesn't arise, because he had no reason to do that.

From Voldemort's perspective, it'd be like attacking any random building in the country in the hope the Potters are inside. Unless he burned down all of the UK, the Potters were safe.

"We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us, and who dotes on Harry... Bathilda drops in most days"  

So this must have been in August, 3 months before the attack. Meaning people would know that at a certain point James , Lily and Harry were at Godric's Hollow. The only way the charm would be foolproof would be if it removed that knowledge from everyone's mind. So that they would forget the Potters were there in the past (wich is just some weeks before not really a long period)

****** Yes, this goes back to what I said about "secret". The best secret is something no one knows. Something that everyone knows is not a secret at all. Everything else is in-between. So I dunno that the spell /has/ to remove anything.

It's possible it does, I suppose; that it just makes people forget and not think about it anymore. It's not something I'm opposed to on magical grounds. But conceptually, as far as I can see, it works just fine if Bathilda knew before and knows after, but can't tell anyone anymore. The secret remains a secret, and Voldemort is not going to learn of it.

It'd be more curious if they put up a sign in Godric's Hollow saying THE POTTERS LIVE HERE, and then tried to perform the spell. I'd argue it'd fail, in that case. But since it didn't fail, and in line with the "very quiet birthday", we must assume their place of residence wasn't common knowledge, but a secret amongst a few close acquaintances, already before the Fidelius.

******* That makes sense. I guess it would be something like that : Bathilda remembers the potters, Bathilda remembers having tea with her neighbours, but she can't make a link between the two in her mind.
