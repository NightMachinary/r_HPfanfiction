Im looking for fics where Lily returns from her death/the past/whereever, finds out how Harry is treated by the dursleys/dumbledore/the world, and is absolutely livid and starts raising hell.


** So if you replaced "Lily" with "Dorea Black-Potter" (James' mum), I have exactly the fic for you.

Linkffn(12058516).

Dorea was placed into a coma to protect her from Dragon Pox, and she comes out of it when Harry is five and abducts him from the dursleys. Some smut, and a little wolfstar slash if I remember correctly.

  Harry Potter's family isn't only at Number 4 Privet Drive. Unaware to even Dumbledore, an upheaval is approaching. The Ancient and Noble House of Black is reclaiming their power and changing the future of the magical world. *Updated Sporadically---Not Abandoned*

  Dumbledore is of the Light, Voldemort is of the Dark, and both consider the Boy-Who-Lived to be the linchpin to all their plans. What neither had ever considered was a lost and very bored Darth Revan taking the boy under her wing to train him as a Gray Knight, just because she could. Bastila is of course fondly exasperated, but at least HK-47 finds the entire situation entertaining

** I've actually been toying with a plot bunny that's essentially this, but in this instance has Lily spend nearly a decade on Azeroth as a Paladin. Let's just say that, upon arriving back on Earth, she'd spend most of her time in Ret spec (possibly swinging around a not-yet-depowered Ashbringer).

*** I thought that that series started off strong and interesting, but quickly dropped off of a cliff.

- Ginny dyed her hair black and purple and put it into dreadlocks, when canon Harry is specifically attracted to long straight hair.\\
- Venus and Serena Williams are Quidditch beaters.\\
- They're not the only celebrity cameos.
- Astoria Greengrass is younger than Ginny Weasley, but somehow looks so much like her that Luna Lovegood thought she was using Polyjuice potion when they first meet.
- Which never becomes plot relevant, and Astoria is then killed off.
- Harry starts sermonizing about homophobia.
- Harry and Co. are the fanfic cliches of young characters who speak out, hector, lecture, and run roughshod over adults.
- I'm not kidding about that, it's in every scene of every chapter.
- Lily Potter starts fucking Bill Weasley even though Harry is desperately pining over a Ginny Weasley who rejects him.
- Oh, and there's an actual, legit, Goddess lurking about. Which removes all sense of dramatic tension.

The first story or two in the series is fun, but then it gets real shit, real fast.

  A pre-Hogwarts tale that will be the first of eight books retelling the tale of Harry Potter. An exploration of the Many World's theory where changing one thing changes everything and at the same time changes nothing. HPMD sets the stage for a different Harry as he embarks on the journey of a lifetime. Rated M for language and later content.
