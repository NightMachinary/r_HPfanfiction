:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi, so I've been having a rough time tracking down this HP fanfic I read about two or so years ago after I had read Antithesis. Here's the thing, since I read so much on both Ao3 and FFN I cannot recall which site I read it off of and since it's been a while I'm a bit foggy on the details. I read exclusively on those two sites though.

Here is what I remember:

-The author said in an A/N that the song they were listening to was Death Zone by Apocalyptica at the climactic ritual that Harry performs to enslave all muggles. I am certain the song is correct because they either titled it or linked it in their bio(?) which is how I first heard the song and how it became a mainstay for me.

-Its a Harry/Voldemort or Tomarry fic (but I believe the former more so)

-It is a dark/evil harry fanfic where harry is discarded for his sibling (who I believe is a brother) who is the WBWL.

-Harry is god-like in his abilities but I cannot recall if he is the Master of Death or a general necromancer. Hence just labeling him as god-like.

-I think he attended Durmstang primarily but attended during the Tri-Wizard Tournament but don't remember how he placed or anything about the Tournament in particular. I also do not remember how he came to be in the situation- like if he was dumped at the Dursleys or at an orphanage.

-He is god-like in my memory because the one thing I remember clearly was the fact that he worked with Voldemort to take over the Ministry (with maybe a cult of his own followers) while also enslaving all muggles in a monumental holiday celebration (Yule?).

-He dies (assassinated?) but Voldemort has him reincarnated through I think Bellatrix serving as a surrogate for Harry using the remanents of the Potter parent's DNA so that he would be functionally identical in appearance to his original body.

-He killed the Potter parents too. I think his relationship with his brother was rather amicable but he really hated his parents and wanted to hurt them and the resentment for his brother was still a thing.

-The last chapter was an epilogue wherein muggle slaves are brought before Voldemort with toddler Harry in his lap before they are killed.

-Some chapters may have song titles in the rock/alternative music genre for chapter titles. Very Evanescence, RED, Seether, Three Days Grace, etc.. in terms of music besides the already stated Apocalyptica.

I can't think of anything else at the moment. Please let me know if anyone has heard of this story. I keep thinking about it and I've been trying to find it for months to reread.


** I have been trying to find a fic too, I know the fics name and it was complete last I saw, I was just too young at the time to appreciate it, and now it's gone. So I'm just sympathising with you, no clue about the fic you're trying to find.

** Hey, I'm not sure if you found the fic but, was Harry a black in the story ? Because I read one where Voldemort and Harry went to Hogwarts together but instead of being a potter he's a black and born a necromancer with glowing green eyes, It's tomarry but he's married to Pandora Malfoy who then Married to xenophillius lovegood and is luna's mum,

So when Voldemort makes horcruxes Harry does a ritual to ensure that he's reborn in 9 months as a child , But when he dies and doesn't get reborn within 9 months, Voldemort becomes insane and starts killing everyone but then his lover is reborn as Harry Potter with the memories of what happened in his previous life, but cannot recognise that it's him and so Voldemort tries to kill Harry as a kid.

If this is the story you're looking for or want to read the story I'll post the story link here

Harry's name is Ophiuchus Black And here's the link to the story:
