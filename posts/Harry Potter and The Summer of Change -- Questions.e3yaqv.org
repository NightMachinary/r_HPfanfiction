** Not sure about a sequel. But Summer of Change's storyline is probably the most common plot in HPFF history...

1. Depression after Sirius dies
2. Re-study all textbooks
3. Practice wandless magic
4. Buy contact lenses, jeans and a super trunk lol

There may not be an official sequel, but there are plenty of other fics with the exact same storyline, so you can start from there I guess

*** Actually, points two and three are replaced by unspeakable training montages which ruin the fic.

I mean, you could vastly improve the story by cutting out a third of what has been written. It serves no purpose other than a powerwank.

**** Seriously. It may have been a good fic way back when it was published, but it has /not/ aged well.
