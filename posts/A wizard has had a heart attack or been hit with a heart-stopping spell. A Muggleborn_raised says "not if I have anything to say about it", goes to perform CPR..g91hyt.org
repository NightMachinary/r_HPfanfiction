All the Wizards are like "wtf is this dark necromancy" after the wizard has been resuscitated and the muggleborn/raised will sit there like "is called CPR, it's a pretty normal thing in the Muggle world"


** "Heart? What is a heart" asked wizards, because it's not lile they have superior medicine and longer life spans.

** I've read a couple of stories that had that happen. In one of them, if I remember correctly, Harry died to get rid of the horcrux, and Hermione resuscitated him. After that, Ron didn't believe it was Harry anymore, because, once you're dead, you're dead, so his body must have been possessed by an evil spirit. I can't remember the title of that one.

And in [[https://crys.fanficauthors.net/Chattel/index/][Chattel]], by Crys, Harry is resuscitated with CPR after his death in the final battle, and it has legal consequences for him.

** I've wondered for a while what would happen if someone tried CPR on a Killing Curse victim. There's really no way to know because we don't know the exact means by which the Killing Curse kills- only that no one but Harry has ever survived it. I suspect if anyone asked Rowling she'd say it doesn't work, Killing Curse victims can't be revived. But there's no way to be sure. Modern CPR is a fairly new discovery, most wizards wouldn't know it, in all likelihood, and it rarely works without additional medical support. So it may simply be that no one has attempted it on a Killing Curse victim- or that one or two tried it, and failed, and it just affirmed most wizards' assumption that no one can survive the Killing Curse.

** Or another wizard performs the counter curse, or perhaps a heart starting spell?

*** I can't remember the name right now, but I've read a story in which Harry uses Crucio to restart Daphne's heart in the Hospital Wing.
