#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** Commenting so I can find this again later. But I doubt it the world of Harry Potter isn't really built for that type of story. But it it exists with good execution I'd be happy to read it.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined) has like 4-6 different factions, some allied and some not, with complicated politics between.

Voldemort is back, but doesn't do any attacks yet as long as Fudge does appeasement.

Death Eaters in the Ministry try to sabotage it once the Ministry starts moving against Voldemort.

Dumbledore's Order has to stay deniable and he can't have any ties to Hermione's group going public or he'd lose all influence in the Ministry.

Hermione's group is secretly supported by Dumbledore and Sirius, but they're hunted by both the Ministry and Voldemort, although they only attack Death Eaters they're more feared than Voldemort amongst the purebloods.

The French help the Order, but they're limited in what they can do without risking political complications between France and Britain.

The Avengers are a rather complicated and spoilery story.

Then there's the Jamaicans...

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

** I think HPMOR was heading in that direction in the beginning, but the author purposefully steered it off a sprawling plot, feeling that he had to close as many plotlines as he opened to keep a constant amount of disorder.

I haven't read ASoIAF, but enormous complication is something I think I like.

** On the one hand, the problem with that lies in the singular power of an individual wizard or witch makes the idea of blood rule somewhat moot (it helps Voldemort to claim Slytherin decent, but in the end it matters more that he is the /strongest/ and champions the cause they support). On the other, the kind of violence in ASOIAF necessitates a lot of people, and there really just aren't that many in the Wizarding World. A few good examples though:

linkffn(Incorruptible: A Dementor's Stigma): a zombie AU, heavily focused on back-dealing and politicking in a fairly believable manner.

linkffn(The Firebird's Son) and its sequels have quite a bit of family maneurvering and political machination, and brutality that honestly gives ASOIAF a run for its money (seriously, this can be dark).

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

  He stepped into a world he didn't understand, following footprints he could not see, toward a destiny he could never imagine. How can one boy make a world brighter when it is so very dark to begin with? A completely AU Harry Potter universe.
