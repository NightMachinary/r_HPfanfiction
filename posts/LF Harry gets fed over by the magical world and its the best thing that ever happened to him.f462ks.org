Basically something where magical britain goes too far in their belief that Harry is entirely theirs. After all the shit they put him through he either leaves of his own accord or is forced out somehow and it turns out to be great for him. Harry really flourishes outside of the toxic enviroment britain made.

  What would have happened if Harry had been convicted by the Wizengamot after defending himself from dementors before his fifth year at Hogwarts? Humorous! Followup stories on Sirius Black plus Cornelius Fudge's attempt at becoming a dark lord.

*** The first one was funny, and I was able to jump into it no problem. The second one has a massively overpowered Harry and that generally annoys me.

** I gotta be honest: I was expecting a trope subversion request than just a request for the same old stuff.

Like, Dumbledore arranges a marriage contract for Harry... and the girl he picked out is pretty much his dream girl, and is keen on him. Harry's not complaining.

However, the gains Dumbledore hoped to get out of it, be it votes or influence per the trope, backfires on him in a "be careful what you wish for" monkey's paw kinda way, and he's left juggling a massive cluster-fuck.

Hermione sells out Harry for the Potter Library, or something along these tropey lines? She can't read the books, is cursed, or, even worse, becomes possessed (becoming a prisoner in her own body e.g. Goa'uld) or has her body stolen by an old soul jar from some forgotten, long-dead witch.

Since everyone is wrapped up in their own subplots, no-one notices the Grand Theft Me and that "Hermione" is acting differently.

Weasleys get wealth from Harry's vaults? They're still ostracized or have to pay a ton of tax that they weren't bothered with before, since they were too poor to be even considered.

Some crafty pureblood family pulls a reverse uno on them, now that they're wealthy/prestigious et cetera and has Ginny or Ron marriage contracted off, or calling in old debts that used to be useless.

Harry, in the mean time, coincidentally avoided some hefty penalties because the gold is no longer his (loopholes -- gotta love them).

Anyway, the subversion is that Harry's fine with these machinations because he benefits from them -- unfortunately for everyone else and unbeknownst to him, everyone else has it all backfiring on them.
