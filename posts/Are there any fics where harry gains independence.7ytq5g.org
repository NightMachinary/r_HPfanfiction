It should de at least 40,000 words. If you could could it be like Rage or something similar. Harry going to America could be cool to.


** No, but there are loads of fics where Harry becomes an arsehole, which apparently many writers equate with independence.

*** Now I want to read a fic where Harry declares independence and builds his own country, maybe similar to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Sealand][Principality of Sealand]].

** Hey there,

so this request is basically a request of a massive trope (massive in terms of stories published), and most of them aren't well-written - so there is some aversion to those fics in this subreddit.

You might want to try stories by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/%7Erobst][robst]], he is massively popular. (see Taure's reply)

An alternative might be linkffn(Harry Potter: Junior Inquisitor).

Also, everything that has "takes control" or something similar in the description will probably satisfy you.

--------------

Now, there are stories that don't fit your exact premise, but aren't /bad/, and some of them are:

- linkffn(A Black Comedy by nonjon) Harry is definitely independent here, and knows how to have fun. A truly enjoyable read.
- linkffn(Seventh Horcrux) another fun story.
- linkffn(Deprived by The Crimson Lord) Harry is also independent here, and definitely doesn't know how to have fun :) Either way, it's a novel concept

  Before the start of fifth year Dumbledore changes the plans. Unfortunately he didn't bother to inform Harry. At his trial, Harry realises that it is down to him to save his own skin. To do so his Slytherin side must come out to play, and once it's out it sticks around turning life at Hogwarts on its head. Warnings: EvilDumbles, SheepOrder/Staff, GoodGuysDontGetEverythingTheirWay
