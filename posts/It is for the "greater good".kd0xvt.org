I don't know and I have not read the books in a long time but is there even one instance where Dumbledore gives the excuse "It is for the greater good". I don't remember it. So why in fanfictions does Dumbledore say "I placed you with abusive relatives for the greater good" "I stole your money for the greater good" "I made plans for you to die so I can take the glory of killing Voldemort for the greater good" "I kept you from your inheritance (which by the way is more than the combined net worth of me who is the holder of three prestigious spots the CW of the Wizengamot the SM of the ICW and the headmaster of Hogwarts for many years) so that I can steal it from you for the greater good" "I created an illegal marriage contract with Ginny Weasley for the greater good" "I payed your friends Ron and Hermione to befriend you and spy on you for me for the greater good".


** Dumbledore perhaps coined the phrase when he was sixteen, but canonically (see chapter 35 “King's Cross” in DH) his whole life mission was to redeem himself from doing so. He was as likely to use it in his adult life as General Patton was to use “Arbeit macht frei” in serious manner.

Yes, every leader in a war is sometimes in the situation to decide which way to send a truck whether on the rail where it kills five people or the one where it kills just one, but particularly that phrase would be as far from his lips as possible.

** "for the greater good" was Grindelwald's slogan which was originally coined by Dumbledore in a letter to Grindelwald when they were friends.

The tribute to Dumbledore in the Prophet written by Ephilus (sp?) Doge says "he died as he lived, working for the greater good."

Most fic writers who use it use it to imply more clearly that Dumbledore hasn't quite really moved on from the opinions he had as a young man during his association with Grindelwald, but there is of course evidence in canon that he does believe in a "greater good," just not the one that he and Grindelwald originally believed in. Dumbledore has a political agenda, even in canon. But I agree that the way it's put over in bashing fics is ridiculous.

** Because “for the greater good”, is a philosophy/ideology that Albus Dumbledore (and Gellert Grindelwald) came up with. And he does still subscribe to that philosophy that some things must be done “for the greater good”, even if his approach is no longer the same as it was with Grindelwald. You can look up the history of the phrase on the Harry Potter wiki if you like.

** Because the writer said so.

Honestly.

** Because some fanfic writers hate Canon Dumbledore's actions and like making up shit to get mad about. And honestly you can sub Dumbledore for just about any character and that statement would probably be right every time.
