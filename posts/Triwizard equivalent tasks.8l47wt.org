I'm writing a fic set at Castelobruxo for a year. It's my OC Carlotta Alves' last year (1990) and they hold their equivalent to the Triwizard Tournament with Ilvermorny and the Japenese school participating. My OC's boyfriend Sergio will be a contestant and unfortunately die.

But since there's no Dark Lord that we know of in Brazil/the Amazon how could he die? I had an idea for one task dealing with Herbology since Castelobroux is known for their specialty in Herbology.


** Before Dumbledore (tried to) reform it, the Triwizard Tournament was famous for being /hilarious deadly/, with, IIRC, several historical Tournaments ending up with no winners because all three contestants died. Which is why they'd stopped holding Tournaments for two hundred years until /GoF/ happened.

So assuming your Castelobruxo equivalent is similar in that respect, just have something go horribly wrong in the last task. One famous case we hear about from canon was the last Tournament, where the Third Task's maze contained a cockatrice who escaped and killed a lot of people.

** - An rainforest tribe who has not ever seen civilization and decide to defend their territory

- Poisonous snakes

- A task involving magical creatures from Aztec, Maya or Inca mythology

- Muggles who are destroying the rainforest (like in the movie Avatar)

- Death by Snu Snu

- A teacher from a different school sabotaging a task to take out the competition

- One of the safety spells backfiring spectacularly

- Potion related mishap

- Accidents involving human transfiguration

- Magical Piranhas

- Getting lost in the Amazonas

And that's just what I came up before getting annoyed with typing on a tablet.

************ Two things. First, it would be the perfect stepping stone for your OC to go into Potions because she wants to prevent anyone from sharing her suffering.

As for the pregnancy, I am not sure if her finding out about it after her boyfriend died would be so great. Because in all honesty, that's one of the most fucked up things I can think of. I mean, rape, torture and genocide are bad, but on a personal level, finding out that you are pregnant from somebody who just died in your arms is... Beyond fucked up. Losing someone is bad enough, especially since it would probably be the first close person your OC lost, but then only finding out afterwards makes it even worse.

You have to be careful not to cross the line between tragic and distasteful humour because at a certain point things become so unlikely that your protagonist is reduced to fate's punching bag, and those passages are always horrible to read through and tend to feel unbelievable because the protagonist gets shat on beyond the believable, even if there is someone who had that bad luck in real life. You want your readers to feel bad for the OC, not roll their eyes because another bad thing happened and they already ran out of fingers to count them three chapters ago.

And there is only one valid name for the child; Ladislaus/Ladislas, after this guy: [[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislaus_the_Posthumous]]

**** ~has no idea what a Pukwudgie is~

A Lethifold is basically a living shadow; resembling an autonomous black cloak, it glides around at night looking for humans (and presumably other sapient prey) to settle on and asphyxiate before digesting them whole. Because it can fly and completely devour its prey, it's impossible to track, and like dementors, it's nearly invulnerable to attack, only being affected by the Patronus Charm.

They never appear during the main Harry Potter series, only showing up in the Fantastic Beasts book (not the movie).

I wonder; if dementors are meant to be representative of depression, what would that make lethifolds representative of? They're dark, flit around, suffocate and swallow you, only repelled by the Patronus (happy thoughts), only attack at night...maybe they represent fear of the dark?

** A insular cult obsessed with the Greater Good and the reputation of their school could detach a stone gargoyle from a tower that falls down and crushes him in a gruesome way. Their motivation is, obviously, that his grammar was atrocious in interviews giving everyone at the school a bad name by association.

More seriously. There are a thousand ways someone could die in a magical tournament. Asking for suggestions on it just points out that you haven't really planned or thought about it that deeply.

He could be mauled by any type of magical creature. He could be choked out by a Devil's snare. He could be impaled by some ancient Aztec ghost. He could drown. He could fall. He could be eaten by a gigantic snake. He could fall down a flight of stairs. He could be slashed to death in a flower shop by a man in a black cloak while buying gifts for both Carlottas (Alves's not Alves').

Hilariously it's probably a more interesting story if he dies outside of the tournament rather than the cliche of dying during it. Something utterly mundane after a great success would be one hell of a twist.

If you want the character to die then the plot should fit that. It's on you to make a tournament where there is such a realistic mortal cost associated with the tasks at hand. Design a task where failure is a distinct possibility and then have them fail.

Planning the Minutia of the story is on the author. So plan it, detail it, and then come ask for a critique rather than throw up a question that implies you don't see how someone could die during an athletic competition.

As a whole you should be more concerned with the plot relevance of the death than the specific manner of the death. IE: The Death should suit the plot. So you should already have some idea of tasks and how they could be fatal. And then, as such, make one fatal.
