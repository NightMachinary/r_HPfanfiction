How do you work chapters into your writing? I have a story I've been writing for a while now but I naturally write without chapters. This might sound a rather strange question but the storys still growing at 26000 ish words. I'd like to start sharing it sometime soon, but I'm hopeless with where to split chapters into things!


** I would suggest breaking off at what I call points of inflection, i.e. points where the story takes a break in flow but is anticipatory in terms of content.

A cliffhanger is an extreme case of this, and in my opinion should be only used sparingly.

Try to study the endings and beginnings of chapters from whatever books your fandom has. It will give you a clearer idea of how to proceed.

Try to write an outline for your existing story. Something like

- A talks to B bout Y
- Something happens Somewhere
- A and C fight
- Aftermath of fight

Now you can break of chapters along the boundary of these points. Since these points will have different lengths, you can combine them appropriately into chapters

As far as chapter length is concerned, decide a word count and set a varying limit of 75% to 150% of that word count. For example, if you choose 3000 words, your limits should vary from 2250 to 4500.

This allows ample flexibility and still feels coherent. I've read fics where the word count would shuffle from 3000 to 12000, and it felt confusing to read

** Somewhere between every 3000-6000 words. My shortest chapter is 2500. I pick where it breaks naturally--the scene ends, the connecting thread unravels, themes change, there would be a cliff hanger, etc. Any of those provide a good breaking point. Keep like with like, and try to keep the like between 3000-6000 words. Anything more than that in a chapter and readers would likely tire of it before the end of the chapter. Anything more than that, and the chapter could likely be split in two.

Just my two cents! There are more experienced authors here who might give you different advice.
