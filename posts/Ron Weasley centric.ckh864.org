Looking for any fic with POV Ron, any length is fine but preferably those over 16k

I feel like Ron is a generally underappreciated character, especially in fanfiction echochambers.

Cheers

**** You did!! This may not make sense, but I love the Gryffindor-ness of the story. Tying Ron and the sword of Gryffindor together in the way that Slide did was just perfect. He really is a true Gryffindor.

***** My thoughts exactly! Ron with the sword makes way more sense than Harry & the sword imo; the way Slide chose to write him makes him even more so a true Gryffindor. Also the Harry-save-the-day part in the end was perfect too lol. Another thing worth noting with Slide is her capability to construct a romance; the relationships in her stories are closely intertwined with the main story arc (drama, adventure etc.), which in my opinion makes the whole romantic side of the story more real as opposed to those (usually) sappy romances.

  AU: The first friend Harry Potter made on the Hogwarts express wasn't Ronald "Ron" Weasley; it was Veronica "Ronnie" Weasley, first-born daughter of the Weasley clan. And all of a sudden, the future looked very different.Join the newly-formed "Potter's Gang" (consisting of Harry, Ronnie, Hermione and Neville) in their first year at Hogwarts as they get into all kinds of misadventures, and maybe have to face a certain Dark Lord before they're ready for it.First novel in the "Weasley Girl" trilogy. Fem!Ron, but not a romance, and not a canon rehash.

  [Trans!Ron; Ron/Hermione, various pairings] He learned his lesson a long time ago. Boys are boys, girls are girls. And Ron, Ron makes a good boy. He's tall, sturdy, manly, not like some of those long-haired Slytherins he sometimes mistakes for girls when they slink in the dark corridors with their robes floating behind them. He plays Quidditch. He loves Hermione, with a little too much intensity and adoration for a boy his age, but that's what constant brushes with death do to you. He shaves; he doesn't jerk off, granted, but apart from that, he's pretty much the poster boy for healthy, honest masculinity.So why is it, then - why is it he can't believe it, not for one second?

  How far would Ron and Hermione go to save their best friend? Where would their choices lead them - to doom or salvation? This is a look at what those two of the Golden Gryffindor Trio can and will do in a world darker than canon: their choices, their journey and the result.

#+begin_quote
  The war is all but over, and the wrong side won. Worse, the Wizarding World's hero and Ron Weasley's best friend died in the fight. When Draco Malfoy offers Ron a way to go back and fix things, he jumps at the chance. But can he anticipate how his changed moves will affect the board? How long can a king masquerade as a pawn? [Trope stew: read the authors' notes.]

** One of the best fics pit right now, Ron is the nest character and those proves why! It's also helps that it updates regularly and has a rare pairing for Ron so far and I cant wait to read more! Did I mention it is over 1 million words and not complete yet?

#+begin_quote
  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Char bashing, no Mary Sues.
