(spoilers for the plot!)

so it goes like james plans a nasty trick on snape which is to make him fall in love with him and then dump him at the yule ball but they accidentally fall in love with each other and it's fucking awesome, does anybody recognize this plot??? i was able to find it once before when i was looking for it but now looking through every fanfic website i have not been able to locate it at all. it was hurt/comfort/romance and it ended with aged up james doing snape over a kitchen counter which was dope af so i absolutely need it i've read it so many freakin times


** YO I FUCKING FOUND IT NEVERMIND LOOK
