I've been a huge Harry/Oc but i'm open to anything at this point thats good. Preferably finished or currently being updated still.


** I'm following these stories, ranked by order of interest:

*Divided and Entwined*, linkffn(11910994): my favorite WIP fic. It's a significant improvement over [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2548648/Starfox5][Starfox5's]] previous work *Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution*, which also features the theme of Muggleborn resistance/uprising. The plot, characterizations, writing quality, and realism are much much better. I especially like the fact there are good and evil people on both sides of the conflict. The pairing is still unclear, as Hermione is agonizing over whether to engage in romantic relationships with both Harry and Ron.

*The Animagus Series*, linkffn(9863146;12076644;12088294): the first part, *The Accidental Animagus*, is finished, and I like it a lot. Both good and bad guys are smarter and more powerful. Dumbledore is not ineffective, Voldemort is not overly psychotic, and the Ministry is not too incompetent. The pairing should be Harry/Luna, Hermione/Neville. The third part of the series, *Animagus at War*, was posted yesterday.

*[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]*: non-magic, sci-fi AU. Excellent writing, characterizations, and plot developments. The kids are a lot smarter and ruthless, Dumbledore is a brilliant strategist, but the Ministry in this story is far more pro Riddle than in canon. The general tone of the story is fairly light, but a few chapters are truly grim-dark. The author also goes into great technical details, even describing various computer hacking techniques.

*Blindness*, linkffn(10937871): very unique story as it explores lots of magical theories. Harry is overpowered, but he is also trying to solve complex social problems where his power is not necessarily effective.

*The House of Potter Rebuilt*, linkffn(11933512): the title is a little misleading because the fic has little to do with 'Lord Potter' trope. Dumbledore is killed off early, and the story takes a very different path right off year 1. It's a great example of logical plot development.

*The Changeling*, linkffn(6919395): I like this Ginny even more. Year 6 is absolutely brilliantly written, and Ginny & Snape interactions are terrific.

*Escape*, linkffn(11916243), is a story about Harry/Hermione running away from a marriage law in year 6. Interesting premise, smart characters, and logical plot developments. Hermione is not flawless, and Harry will stand up to her if he thinks she's wrong.

*Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water*, linkffn(12076771): AU postwar & a little crossover with Kantai Fleet Girls. Voldemort was sensible enough to use one insignificant rock for his horcrux, which he dumped into the Atlantic. Unfortunately, that piece of rock got too close to the sunk Bismarck and corrupted the ship's spirit. The BismarckMort was thus born, along with all the firepower and defenses of the original battleship. Fortunately for our heroes, HMS Hood also rose from the depth of the Ocean in form of another Fleet Girl to do battle with her old nemesis one more time. Harry, Hermione, and Ron started off in a three way romantic relationship. [[/spoiler][At the end chapter two, BismarckMort demolished Azkaban, found Narcissa Malfoy, and turned her into a destroyer!]]

** off the top of my head only linkffn(child of the storm; a trek to the stars) come to mind and technically child of the storm's potential love interest is more realized in the sequel and is a marvel character. And my story's love interest is based off rachel riley but vulcanized. Sorry i don't have better at the moment.

  New Mexico was not the first time Thor had been a mortal. It was only a refinement of the technique. What if James Potter had been Thor, incarnated as a memoryless newborn? On his death, Odin removed his memories as James, due to grief. In Harry's Third Year, a (mostly) reformed Loki restores them. Harry now has a father, a family and a heritage that is going to change the world.

[[http://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][a year like none other]]

#+begin_quote
  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.

  It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.

  And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.

  A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.
