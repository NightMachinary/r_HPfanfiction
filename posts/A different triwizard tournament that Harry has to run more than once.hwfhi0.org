One of the tasks is a race along a gorge, the first rendition showcases fleurs ability with racing brooms along with an end where they must steal an egg from a Roc.

Second rendition due to ripples have caused the finishing monster to be replaced with much more dangerous swarms of like harpies or mini griffons or something

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project.

Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
