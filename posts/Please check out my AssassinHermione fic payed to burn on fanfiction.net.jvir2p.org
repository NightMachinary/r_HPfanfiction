It's called paid to burn

Apparently the Ministry is a racist, unfair institution. What a surprise. When Hermione Granger finds out that in order to get the internship of her dreams, she'll need to pay for the expensive tuition for them to, in their words “justify letting a muggleborn into the Ministries /esteemed/ program,” she needs to find a job that will pay quick. Unfortunately, there aren't many jobs open to muggleborns. Fortunately Hermione would do anything to get the best results. Anything.


** Are you able to fix the title? "Payed" is not a word, you're looking for "paid".

Good on you for putting the effort out there.
