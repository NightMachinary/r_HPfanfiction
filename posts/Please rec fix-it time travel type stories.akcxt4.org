I love time travel fix it stories and have read a lot of the ones on AO3. What are your favorite ones? Maybe ones that you re-read? Prefer complete, but if it's good, I'll read it even if it's ot. I'm open to just about every genre and pairing.


** There's a bunch of good recommendation at [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanficRecs/HarryPotterPeggySue]]

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again]]) You've probably read this one (everyone has) but adding it for prosperity.

Linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter]]) Less time travel more do-over, Harry gets the chance to relive the last few months every time he dies. Death is not treated like a slap to the wrist though, less "darn I thought it was going well" more "OH GOD I JUST GOT HIT BY A TRAIN /silently weeps/"

  So maybe everything didn't work out perfectly for Harry. Still, most of his friends survived, he'd gotten married, and was about to become a father. If only he'd have stayed away from the Veil, he wouldn't have had to go back and do everything AGAIN.

So many Peggy Sue and SI fics (which are basically Peggy Sue since the SI is getting inserted at a point in the series where she has knowledge of future events) are just awful. More awful than your average fic. Although that may not be true in HP, where the real stinker category is the Lord Potter Black Peverell Slytherin Crow nonsense.

***** Hey so I thought it'd only be fair to actually give real feedback after being a big jerk about it. Here's the very start of the fic:

--------------

Harry Potter looked out from behind his round glasses to his small apartment in central London and offered a small, wistful sigh to no one in particular. To any outsider they'd believe the now eighteen-year-old boy looked mildly depressed, strange considering it was the boys' birthday.

--------------

/Right from the get-go you've got clunky, bad sentences that sound like they were written by an ESL student or someone very young. Assume your reader is familiar with Harry Potter, since they are. Why, then, did you tell us his glasses were round? When you use "looked out" it sounds like you're about to tell us something specific that he's looking at, but you only mention his small apartment./

/Next, you start with the phrase "to any outsider" which means if you're using idiomatically correct English, you should then say something like "the young man would appear to be..."/

/The weirdness here is that this sentence then says "they'd believe..." but that's talking from the perspective of the outsider, but the word "outsider" means you're not speaking from their perspective. Idiomatically, the construction should be "To X, it would seem Y" or "To all of the X's in the room, it would seem ABC."/

/Next, you've got "the now eighteen-year-old." Why did you say "now"? That implies that the reader has been following along with the story and you're updating us to where we are now. That sort of makes sense in fanfic, since we all followed Harry's canon journey, but it still scans really weird./

/Next, boy is singular here so it should be "boy's birthday."/

/And why is it strange that he's depressed on his birthday? Holidays and birthdays are often very depressing (suicide rates spike around Christmas) so the fact that he's alone on his birthday would be reasonable, not strange./

/So let's fix this. We would get something like:/

/On July 31st, 1998, Harry Potter turned 18. Were he still a muggle, the day would mark his transition into adulthood. The wizards granted him that lofty status the year before, but to Harry, he came of age years earlier in a graveyard in Little Hangleton. He groped blindly towards the nightstand for his glasses, shaking his head to clear the cobwebs of sleep from his eyes and mind. He settled the round frames on his face and flopped back onto his lumpy pillows. The wistful sigh that left his mouth reached no ears but his own./

--------------

But today also marked the start of something else, the first year starting where he wouldn't be in constant fear of Voldemort. A life lay ahead of him pregnant with possibility, open to him and his war hero status.

--------------

/Start of something else? What else? The previous paragraph didn't mention the start of anything. The start of his birthday, maybe?/

/Also, this is a run-on sentence. You've got A LOT of those. Grammarly is your friend. Hell, even Microsoft Word's grammar check function is your friend. You want your readers focused on your ideas and your story, but they can't do that when the grammar is all shitty./

/"open to him and his war hero status" makes no sense. A status isn't a person that has a future open to it. Maybe you meant to say "open to him, given his war hero status" or "open to him, with his war hero status." The point is, by using the word "and" the sentence says that the future is "open to harry and also is open to his status" which is weird, illogical, and ungrammatical./

/Okay, so let's fix the grammar problems but keep the idea of this year being the start of something new:/

/Today marked not only the start of Harry's 18th year, but also the start of the next chapter in his life. For the first time, he faced the year without the threat of Voldemort looming over him. Without fear lurking behind every day or death hiding around every corner, Harry could finally embrace the possibilities open to a celebrity and war hero./

--------------

In a few short weeks he would begin his Auror training with Ron and the chance to change and evolve the Ministry into something good. Something that brought everyone together instead of creating division.

--------------

/Again, the construction of your sentences creates or implies meaning that's weird and illogical. "being his Auror training with Ron" makes it sound vaguely like Ron is the one running the training. Like you'd say something like "I'm starting my potions mastery work with Professor Slughorn," meaning that it's Slughorn that's overseeing the thing. You mean to say something like "In just under three weeks, Harry, along with Ron and Neville, would be entering the Ministry's new Auror training program."/

/Next, the logic of the paragraph is weird because it makes it sound like his entering the training program is going to evolve the Ministry, which makes no sense. I think you mean to say that this would be the first step on a long path, but then you've got to actually say that./

/Don't say "change and evolve." In this context, those mean the same thing. Don't be repetitive! Don't be repetitive! Don't use three adjectives when one will do. Or better yet, don't use any adjectives at all when word choice gets the point across more directly. (Quick example: Don't say "He quickly fell to the ground hard and with a big impact" when you could just say "He thumped to the ground.")/

/So let's just clean up the logic of the sentences here so that we get:/

/The first of those possibilities was fast-track placement in the Ministry's new Auror training program. His casual comment that he was experienced working with Ron and would feel more comfortable training alongside him let his best friend join him in the program. To Harry, this was less about law enforcement, and more about taking the first step towards reforming the entire Ministry. With neither the threat nor the excuse provided by Voldemort, the Ministry would have no choice but to reshape itself into something better./

--------------

He should be excited, shouldn't he? So then why wasn't he? It was this thought that finally dragged his lean body out of bed as he yawned, stretching a bit until a satisfying popping sound emitted from his back.

--------------

/Why is the thought that he's not excited dragging him from bed? Those two rhetorical questions are a great start to the paragraph, but they sound kind of defeated. If anything, he should be getting out of bed despite his boredom, not because of it. Why is cracking his spine "emitting" from his back? That's a really weird word choice. "Emit" sounds... I dunno, scientific? Clinical? This is a simple, normal everyday pleasure and should be described that way./

/Harry blinked several times, staring blankly at the ceiling's peeling, off-white paint. He should be excited, shouldn't he? The Auror Training Office had provided him with tons of pre-work to do, and he should be energized. Raring to go. Tearing into the packet of work with passion and commitment. And yet... And yet he just continued to lay there, staring at nothing. Eventually nature's demands dragged him from bed. He zombie-shuffled towards the bathroom, a huge yawn cracking his jaw wide. A lazy stretch sent satisfying pops down his back./

--------------

I'm not claiming to be a good writer. My own fanfic is pretty aggressively mediocre. And I'm not saying the suggestions and edits I put above are somehow great literature. But what they are is mostly logical, with the sentences actually conveying the ideas they mean to convey. The reader doesn't get to see inside your head to figure out what you meant.

Ok I can't lie haha. I'm just a flowery writing, run on sentence mess !! I really truly appreciate this insight and I'm most assuredly going to 1 - go back and re-edit all my previous chapters and 2- keep all this genuinely helpful advice for my future chapters. I think I don't ever know a good place to stop a sentence and I need to edit myself more.

{Oh and I'm not ESL or super young so that comparison did in fact make me laugh out loud. Note to self: get a grip on the run-on sentences !!}

** Time-travel fix-it is my favorite!

Well, if you don't mind the "fix" being "we're going to kill everyone who ever pissed us off", you might check out the recently completed [[http://keiramarcos.com/2018/12/darkly-loyal-chapters-1-5/][Darkly Loyal]] by Keira Marcos. Harry/Hermione/Draco. She also has a Harry/Draco, That Old Black Magic.

If you like Reptilia's challenge fics, I like linkffn(harry potter and the last chance by lequin), and linkffn(reboot by kallanit).

Linkffn(hindsight by loralee1) only has the time-traveler stick around long enough to give a few hints and instructions, but a helpful Snape was a nice change of pace. And most stories don't manage to fix everything in first year.

If you didn't come across it on Ao3, linkao3(how to save a land by amber and ash) was very different. All the way back to WWII, and the concept of "living lands" that have awareness and a link with their owners. Dumbledore bashing. Not very nice to the Weasleys either, but they're only in early chapters.

Also on Ao3, linkao3(future's past by darkseraphina) has girl!Harry with inadvertent time travel - she intended to fix something in the past, but not personally - and she ends up working on an even more major fix. And linkao3(mischief revived by dreaming_of_a_bright_sky), which is mainly Hermione/Fred, with a side of Harry/Draco. Fair amount of Weasley and Dumbledore bashing in that one. And linkao3(the road less traveled by alinora).

Linkffn(came out of the darkness by jcs2014) is abandoned, but worth it for the "chaos nights" at Hogwarts.

Also unfinished/abandoned is linkffn(back again? Siriusly? By manchester), but I've found so few with Sirius, and it's got some really good ideas. Sirius using the full resources of the Black family is something.

That the price for that change is all that she is, including her life? There's always a price.Merlin showing up and telling her that the price of her actions isn't her death? Not part of her calculations. Changing the past is surprisingly easy. Living it might just be harder.

  When Harry first joined the wizarding world, he did everything he was supposed to do. He sorted to Gryffindor, he was part of the Golden Trio and he was willing to die to defeat the man that had killed his parents. Unfortunately all that got him were seven uncomfortable years leading to an even more uncomfortable conversation with Dumbledore after he had apparently died. But while Harry was still considering his options between staying dead and Dumbledore's suggestion of somehow returning to finally defeat Voldemort once and for all, a third path was presented that would give him the chance to choose a different road to take on the day he'd first learned that Magic existed.

** linkffn(12188150)

By far the best take I have read so far. Superb depiction of friendships, a balanced protagonist (not OP), limited future knowledge which leads to creative solutions and a protagonist who struggles with her identity and how to make impactful changes.

The one negative thing I have to say is that most of the romance happens off-screen after the get-together, but is adequate for a sideplot.

Once again arrived at King's Cross, he is offered his rightful seat on the Onward Train, but, in that one split second between Life and After, he discovers that though one can take the horcrux out of the Boy-Who-Lived, the crotchety, intensely private family man and world-renowned Auror who grew to take his place is not quite immune to fear-of-death by association. Not quite time travel, it's yet a trope... But... Not. An epic tale of love, hope, renewal, second chances, revisited priorities, and thoroughly buggered plans and plotlines... None of which are nearly as accidental or incidental as one might imagine. Part One recommended for context.
