I'm currently trying to write a story where Dumbledore is manipulative but he's not full on Evil!Dumbledore who tries to drug Harry, pays the Dursleys to abuse him, and has Ron pretend to be his best friend. I've already had him do minor stuff like subtly mention to the Weasleys that taking the muggle entrance to Station 9 and 3/4 would save them money so that Harry would meet the Weasleys and develop a pro-Gryffindor and anti-Slytherin bias and had Hagrid pick up Harry for the same reasons. But also he did so because he thought the Weasleys and Hagrid are lovely people and it would be great for Harry to meet them. Furthermore, when his plans fail and Harry is sorted into Slytherin, rather than losing his temper and not knowing what to do when his For the Greater Good Master Plan! has been foiled, he decides to move on and adapt (which I think shows the signs of an actual master manipulator than Manipulative!Dumbledore we see so often in fan fiction). I was just wondering whether anybody had any ideas for how to make a master manipulator but good Dumbledore without descending into bashing territory.


** The problem is that you try to make him manipulative, but you do this by modifying the same tropes that bashers use. Don't make him fight tooth and nail for his greater good master plan if it isn't immediately and obviously a good outcome (like ridding the world of voldemort forever with very few casualties, or something). A master manipulator would not drop hints, rather, you'd expect to see a series of /very/ subtle coincidences that pile up. Also, you have to understand: if Dumbledore is a master manipulator, then Harry Potter would /fall for it/, regardless of the circumstances he grew up with.

What you've told me so far seems to be indicative of this, but be careful not to define yourself with the things others use. Who says Dumbledore is controlling the Weasleys or Hagrid? I mean, his parents seemed to be pretty chummy with the two of them.

Also, go just a little bit deeper. Write conflict that doesn't exist in the books. Set up trials and quests that take place instead of the ones that take place in canon. A different, better Dumbledore wouldn't use the same stupid puzzle that Rowling thought was sufficient in a children's book.

Seconded on this one. Even if you avoid all the tropes and crappy aspects of a "manipulative Dumbledore," you have to, have to, have to set up new obstacles. Canon rehash is probably the single most uninteresting plot you can write and honestly makes zero sense, because if you start changing key aspects of the stories, the future changes too. Canon is a set of interlocking plot-threads and changing a major character means that you can't wind the threads back together again without the story seeming completely contrived. So, you need to build up a plot from scratch that doesn't follow the stages of canon, but also doesn't diverge so far as to break the reader's belief in the events that are happening.

**** It's also necessary if you have a tendency to bash. Often, I find that fic authors take the character's motivations and traits and misinterpret them, and even if they don't /try/ bashing, they end up making the characters do something stupid. The best advice I could give someone trying not to bash in a story is to make the characters into something we can like, and that means creating adventures that expose different sides of them than we see in the book.

*** He's not controlling the Weasleys so much as subtly encouraging them to be in the right time at the right place. If he told Molly or Ron something along the lines of, "Hey, I need you to pretend to be friends with Harry Potter so I can manipulate him into dying for the cause and in return you get the Potter fortune," their reactions would have been complete horror and disgust. I'm generally thinking that the Wizard-raised use the Floo to get to Station 9 3/4 but Dumbledore mentioned that going by the muggle entrance would save them money and would be easier than apparating with five children who would need to be side-along apparated. And let's be honest, Hagrid is very easy to predict and to get him to do what you want to do.

** Can you elaborate on your plot? Its hard to judge whether or not a manipulation is good, if we don't know the ultimate goal.

In general you /have/ to get rid of the influence of normal manipulator!Dumbledore fics.

For starters, if Dumbledore wanted to shape Harry, he would have raised him himself. Its just that simple. First rule of Control is: If you want something done right, do it yourself. So if Dumbledore has a goal in his mind when he decided where Harry should be raised, he would consider something very close to himself. In the role of Grandpa Albus, he'd have the biggest chance to set Harry on a path of his choosing.

Also, if he truly is a master manipulator, Dumbledore would not include wildcards like the Sorting in his plans. Its just that simple. Easy plans generate reliable results. So in any of his plans, Dumbledore would include the possibility of Harry in any of the four houses.

Also, he wouldn't have Quirrel around. He gains nothing from it. Dumbledore has to know that one can easily break into Hogwarts, so laying a trap for Voldemort doesn't have to include the wildcard of his employment. If the plan doesn't require it, you cut it out.

** Your problem is basically this: Dumbledore is as powerful as Voldemort, but also has two advantages that Voldemort does not:

1. Everyone thinks he's good.

2. He has direct access to Harry.

All this means that you can't really write a Dumbledore who bears Harry ill will. Well, you can, but it would be a really short fic. There's nothing Harry can do. If Harry even manages to become aware of said ill will he's already far exceeded what you'd expect of him.

That's why evil Dumbledore fics are all bashing fics. The only way you can write evil Dumbledore and have a story is to seriously downgrade Dumbledore's competence i.e. bashing.

** I think a manipulative Dumbledore would know that the best course of action was to be open and honest with Harry. Tell him that his father couldn't stand Slytherin, that Voldemort was a Slytherin, that most Slytherins hated his mother and considered her a mudblood, and that the current head of house Slytherin hated his father with a passion, that both his parents and their best friends were Gryffindors to the core, and then see if Harry has still any desire to join the snakes. Show him pictures of his parents in the Order, and point to the Weasleys, Molly's brothers, and the Longbottoms, and see if he won't feel a connection to Ron and Neville.

If he doesn't want Harry in Slytherin, Harry shouldn't be in Slytherin, unless Dumbledore is inept. He just has to tell him the truth, and Harry will probably rather leave Hogwarts than share his dorm with Draco and co.

** Well, first you have to detach yourself from ridiculous tropes like "Dumbledore wanted the Weasleys and Hagrid to prejudice Harry to Slytherin". Ask yourself what Dumbledore actually wants to achieve with his manipulations, and whether it actually aligns with anything he did in canon.

I think Dumbledore was manipulative in canon, but not much towards Harry - if you want a manipulative Dumbledore that is still good, make him be manipulative towards the Ministry, Lucius Malfoy and other enemies, in ways that are beneficial to Harry. You can say that Dumbledore tries to manipulate Harry to accept death, but that's something he already did in canon.

So answer me, /why/ do you want to write a manipulative Dumbledore? what's the point?

Exactly this. If Dumbledore were to actually act like an experienced statesman, he wouldn't have alienated Fudge so badly by insisting that Voldemort had returned. He would know, or at least suspect, that Fudge would deny it and act accordingly.

** I will probably echo many earlier statements, and some of my points are rather obvious but here we go.

1.  Dumbledore needs to be competent.
2.  If you make him competent, it may be good to change some earlier canon.
3.  There should be reason to his actions.
4.  He should have some antagonist, make Lucius, Cornelius, Umbridge competent.
5.  Use backgrounds of characters (Dumbledore's guilt, Cornelius' past in Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes, Malfoys' family history).
6.  Do not immediately reveal plans to reader, let him think that those are coincidences, and then reveal truth.
7.  Use narration to misdirect reader.
8.  Plan your story, so there will be long-time plans.
9.  Think what you liked and what not in other renditions of Dumbledore.
10. Crucial to all fics, do not slavishly follow canon plot, circumstances are different, so story will be different.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - and Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** A thing that i wanted to see in HP fiction, but never did is a logical way for Dumbledore to leave Sirius in prison all while being a nice fellow.

So imagine being Dumbledore and seeing that all these evil, evil Death Eaters bribe their way out of jail, and you have one that would get custody of HP. The same DE who would get custody of HP is also thought to be the right hand man of Voldemort.

So what do you do ? Seal the will, make sure Sirius doesn't get tried (nothing to bribe) and hide HP far away so nobody bad can harm him. (Security by obscurity)

It would also play right into why he directly never visited Harry as a kid, Dumbledore is an important man, and most probably under constant watch. So he leaves this to a person he trusts (a squib) and places his faith in the connection between Petunia and Harry (because they are family).

Also, Mrs.Figg may be a bit senile, but even she had to notice the outside differences between Dudley and Harry. Clothes, weight,... . And it just makes no sense for Dumbledore to /never/ check in on harry in over a decade over his contact.

If we ignore the fact that Rowling needed a story, so she made it so, then we have to conclude that, at best, Dumbledore is horribly indifferent to the well being of Harry, even if he cares about his survival. A caring Dumbledore would eventually see the problem with letting him stay at the Dursleys. At the very least he would've investigated after being told so in Harry's first year.

A very good manipulator Dumbledore might try to limit abuse by making sure there are regular CPS visits and inspections and good school budget. A *really* effective master manipulator would make sure that Harry grows up in a neighborhood with several other muggleborn kids so that Harry will have friends and a support group even at Hogwarts.(How to arrange this ?

** The best way to do it is to write Dumbledore's thought process out for the reader - he wants to achieve some good end (and make it obvious it is some good end that he is trying to achieve, please don't say the words "greater good"), but show debate with himself on how to go about achieving that end while still maintaining the illusion of choice for whoever he is trying to manipulate.

This is what is done poorly in manipulative!Dumbles stories and what make me give up on them so often. A truly manipulative person plans in such a way that /everyone/ thinks they have a free choice in the matters at hand. Writing Dumbledore as anything less than a master at manipulation is lazy writing and a poor attempt at the trope.

A "good/light/benevolent" manipulative Dumbledore would be playing off the good qualities he sees in people - courage, self-sacrifice, and love. He would plan around those qualities of people to both get them into the situations he wants and to achieve the outcome he wants. A little setup and behind the scenes help from him is a plus as well, but it must be very subtle - not like dropping a sword in a puddle and using a patronus to lead someone to it.
