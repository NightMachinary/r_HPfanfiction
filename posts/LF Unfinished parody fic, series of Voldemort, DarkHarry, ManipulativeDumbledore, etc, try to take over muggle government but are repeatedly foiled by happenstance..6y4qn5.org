One occasion had Dark!Harry replace all the guards with his followers and Imperius half of the assembly before gloating to the Prime Minister about it, but one of the Stunned members of the audience had a hidden camera and microphone and his buddy outside the building got everything on tape.

And another had Rookwood just quietly Imperius a bunch of the House of Commons, but pretty much everyone he bewitched gets voted out of office in the election.

And Hermione Granger tries getting various muggleborn minions voted /in/, but opponents kick up a stink about bits of their documentation being missing or fabricated, and an incident on live TV has that chapter ending up with people believing the muggleborns are alien doppelgangers.
