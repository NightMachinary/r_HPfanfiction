**** Oh you wanted /good/ crossovers? Then I am most certainly not the guy you want to talk to. I have almost no taste in fics. As long as they're complete I'll usually read them at some point.

**** If you look under Crossovers/Cartoons/X-Men Evolution there are a bunch of HP/X-Men crossovers that you might like.

linkffn(A Third Path to the future) is one I recently read and thought it was good. It is a Harry/Multi pairing but he's in his 20s.
