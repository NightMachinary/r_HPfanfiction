** Ell Roche/Ellory has done at least two one-shots iirc. There's [[https://saelethil.wordpress.com/2015/12/31/pureblood-roulette-something-hallowed-something-true/]] along with the rest of her work. Then there's linkffn(11576074) thats on FFN as well as the aforementioned website.

Edit: There's also this one [[https://saelethil.wordpress.com/2015/08/12/of-heartbreak-and-approbation/]]

Idk of any others, though I am interested.
