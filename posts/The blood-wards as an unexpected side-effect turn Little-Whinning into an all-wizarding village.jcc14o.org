So, the blood-wards were made by Harry's mother and them having an additional effect in his life beyond a Voldemort-proof childhood is a concept often played with in the fandom (though admittedly, this effects are generally negative in nature) and that got me thinking, what would be a good effect that fit with what we know about the wards and Dumbledore could reasonably not see coming (I am against bashing, but love to read about situations that leave cannon-Dumbledore absolutely gobsmacked).

The idea I came with is based on the assumption that the wards try to protect Harry /the way him and to a lesser extent his mother would have wanted/, so, while the protections can't do anything against the Dursley's (as they are tied to them) they instead started protecting Harry from loneness by sending away /all/ the neighbors who don't understand him on Pivet Dive and attracting in their place people he can relate to, namely: wizards and squibs a la the defense post curse Voldemort cast.

The result is that as Harry is growing up the town's citizens are slowly being driven away by unlikely coincidences and in their place move in muggle families with muggleborn and half-blood children (both Hogwarts-age and younger), recent Hogwarts graduates taking advantage of the absurdly cheap-prices of the houses to move out of their parents houses, purebloods (the Blacks lived in the middle of London and the Weasley's/Lovegoods/Diggories in an essentially muggle village, so not as farfetched as it may seem, Hell, it could be a good way of introducing the Tonks family) and some squibs, plus maybe making sure every child who is born from the remaining muggles in town is a muggleborn. Maybe even have some magicals moving in/back to Britain from other countries.

Can't decide if it would be funnier having the Dursley's deep in denial from the progressively more obvious magic (up to and including magical shops popping up everywhere, a juvenile Quidditch league, obviously magical plants - devil-snare, Venomous Tentacula... - being planted on backyards and front-gardens, the local hospital being completely converted into a magical one, adult magicals charming themselves jobs at the local school and substituting the subjects for magical ones - eg. Math becomes basic arithimancy, runes is now a thing, science is completely substituted for potions and Astronomy...) or having them be all too aware of this and trying with no success to move out while grinding their teeth's and making nice with their unwanted neighbors so they don't suffer some ‘harmless' pranks.


** I read one a bit like this linkffn! (No Competition by Evilgoddss) where it has to do with the horcrux rather than the wards, but that's a really interesting idea.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

*** Eh, author decision mostly. Realistically chances are that the wizards around would recognize him and either let slip the secret thinking he already knew or just outright tell him noticing he didn't. Hell, if this happens fast enough Harry could probably grow up already knowing since everyone around him (except the Dursley's) would be casually using magic to the point of some theory being even taught at school (the city-conversion would start at the time Harry is 15 months old - when the blood protections would arguably be at their most powerful - and the conversion of the school from muggle to magical would be the kind of thing that just starts with an annoyed parent taking over a “useless” muggle class at school because their spouse didn't let them educate their child at home - or even because the parent just plainly needs a job - and memory-charming all the faculty in letting them do as they please with the curriculum, them other parents take up the example and it just snowballs from there to the point the new teachers decide that it would be easier to just memory-charm the remaining muggle faculty into leaving town and either taking over, doing away with the positions or substituting jobs with enchanted objects).

** It took a few years, but the new magicals living in the town soon learned that humans were not the only creatures effected. Magical creatures of all kinds are either flocking to, or being born in, this strange little town.

When a panther escaped a zoo in the next county over, no one expected it to set up shop in Little Whinging. Even less did they expect it to harm no one save the local pest populations and eventually birth a litter of reborn legends, panthers capable of entering and exiting the shadows at will. In a stroke of luck, the mother seemed to herd her cubs through areas where magical children played, and when the cubs found a child they liked, she permitted them to take her offspring home.

No one thought the kneazles born with two tails were anything to worry about, until a lunatic tried to hurt the child that looked after them. No one is quite sure what happened to the man's soul, but the screams were telling. As was the sudden increase of ghosts in the neighborhood.

Near-human creatures thought extinct have begun to resurface, their distant decedents awakening long dormant genes. An infant girl born on Privet drive nine months after Harry arrived bore long ears, blue skin, and golden, glowing eyes.

A boy born three years after Harry moved in had a smattering of scales on his skin, strong magic, and the eyes of a predator. He was two years old when he started to exhale smoke.

The first Kitsune born in a thousand years have been seen rampaging through the playgrounds, pranks and laughter in their wake. A little girl with blood red hair, fox ears, and a busy tail has glued herself to Harry, and refuses to leave his side.

Speaking of Harry, he found his familiar at age eight. A white snowy gryphon, appearing to be a cross of a snowy owl and a white tiger sought him out as soon as it was old enough to leave its nest. The creature, that the boy named Hedwig, is protective and unusually calm around children, and seems to enjoy delivering mail and packages. It does not like the boy's adoptive family, and this has created even more scrutiny upon them. When Harry was four, his family was 'convinced' that he really ought to be treated more like a loved member of the family than an unwanted outcast, for their own good.

**** When Harry was nine, a disgruntled Hogwarts graduate managed to copy the information in the school's Book of Names and began inviting muggleborn to live in or attend school at, the magical community where he was going to begin teaching at the local school. Hermione Granger and her parents were visiting when every single one of the two-tailed cats descended on the playground where Harry Potter was playing with his familiar and other children.

​

A child with feline ears and tail translated for the adults, keeping the panic to a minimum as the cats surrounded Harry and began to channel magic into him, more precisely, his scar. It bled, both normal blood and what looked to be black tar, as slowly but surely a spirit was pulled from him. The terrified boy screamed loudly in pain and fear as a dark wraith was torn from his scar. The spirit spoke, possessing enough power to thrash and scream as the cats with two tails slowly drug it into the middle of the nearby street, even as the street buckled and roiled. In the end, as the spirit gave its final threats, an overwhelming scent of sulfur permeated the area as the spirit seemed to be *grabbed* by something below the earth and *pulled*.

​

Understandably shaken up, the Grangers gathered to listen to where the cat-girl was translating for one of the two-tailed kneazles. "The kitty says they were repaying a kindness, and that the 'parasite/dark thing' had to come out. The "boy-who-is-kind-to-cats" will be much better now."

​

All the visitors got a lesson that day that magic was full of both wonder and horror. Oddly, after the boy had his face cleaned and a gentle healing poultice applied, he was back playing with the other kids in less than two hours, saying he felt better than he ever had before. Hermione Granger made a friend that day, and left with a two-tailed kitten of her own, an orange tiger striped cat. If her parents had known the actual species or how large it would grow, they would certainly have denied their daugther her new pet.

​

All across England, a roving reporter for the Daily Prophet had shown everyone what occurred. There was a sudden shortage of alcohol in the land that night, and hangover potions in the morning.
