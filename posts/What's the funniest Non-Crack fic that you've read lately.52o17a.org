  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** Linkffn(The Amplitude, Frequency and Resistance of the Soul Bond) has a lot of humour, it's sweet and not super serious but I wouldn't call it crack either.

Also I can't help but mention linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) because its just full of hilarious moments and quotes. I don't understand why the description of this fic makes it sound so dark though when it's not any darker than most voldemort stories and manages to be quite humorous at times.
