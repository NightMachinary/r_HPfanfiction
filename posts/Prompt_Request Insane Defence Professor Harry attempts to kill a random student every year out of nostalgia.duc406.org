Exactly what it says on the tin. Bonus points if everyone just rolls their eyes and goes with it. Extra bonus points for a side of Harry and Teddy father/son fluff.


** "For your fifth-year DADA class, I will not be teaching you directly. Instead, you will need to meet in secret to teach yourselves---and I'll be trying to uncover your meetings. Those who are caught will fail my class and don't get to take OWLs. Those who don't practice will fail their OWLs. However, I may issue pardons to some of those I catch---typically to the first ones to betray their group---letting them take OWLs anyway."

** Insane? Every good educator knows that life-threatening danger is an important part of a young wizard's development. Why do you think Quidditch is so valued? How else is their magic expected to mature?

Just ask Dumbledore. He made Hogwarts into the greatest magical school in the world by instituting a programme of regularly threatening his star students' lives under (mostly) controlled conditions.

Such a pity that the modern Hogwarts has been run into the ground by all these new Muggle ideas like "health and safety" and "parental consent". Have you seen the way it's plummeted down the league tables? The average Hogwarts graduate of today could barely muster a decent Stunning Charm, never mind leading a successful revolution against an immortal Dark Lord.

Without adventure in their lives, today's Hogwarts students barely count as wizards at all. Kids who once may have developed into the Dumbledores of the world are now fostered into Percy Weasleys.

Sure, maybe under the old system you'd lose someone now and then (RIP Sally-Anne Perks), but that was the cost of excellence.

  "This place is /awesome/," he said.

  The amount of XP he could get just from random encounters /in the school grounds alone/... it suddenly made sense to him how such a school could be an effective way to gain power. This place was clearly, really, incredibly, obviously, /brilliantly/ dangerous. With all the adventure and monster fighting that must be happening between classes, not to mention the magical brawls that naturally occur when you give an eleven-year-old untold arcane power in a practically unsupervised environment (it would take a staff of thousands to keep an eye on all of Hogwarts at once), these kids would be leveling up like /crazy/.

And remember, nobody in Hogwarts knows about D&D, so they have to be taught though exposition, and we, the reader, also get to benefit from that.
