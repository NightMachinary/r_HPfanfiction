Hello all - I'm a little new to the group so apologies if this sort of question has been asked before. It is regarding the use of polyjuice potion.

I'm going to posit a hypothetical with random characters from HP but feel free to substitute your own choices.

So, if Draco Malfoy uses Polyjuice and has sex with Hermione disguised as Ron and Hermione gets pregnant as a result of it - would Hermione's child get its genes from Draco or Ron?

We've seen in DH that when taking polyjuice everything is transformed - Hermione even mentioned that she found Harry's eyesight was very bad because using the polyjuice made those biological changes - which means DNA would take on that aspect as well.

Anybody have any theories


** With your example, the child would be Draco's. I don't know if the Polyjuice can change the DNA or not, either for the body or the sperm, but it doesn't matter.

After sex, it can take up to 6 days for the sperm and the egg to join and form a fertilized egg (and then several days for it to implemant itself in the uterus), while Polyjuice only last one hour. I don't see any reason why the transformation of the sperm should last longer than the rest of the body (if anything, being separed from the body should reduce the time of the transformation). And I find it very unlikely for the fertilization to happen less than hour after sex, even ignoring all the time spent between the consumption of the potion and the ejaculation (and I say unlikely because I don't want to say impossible).

So, by using your example, even if we speculate that because of the Polyjuice, the Sperm is Ron's (which is already far from sure), it should already have turned back into Draco's sperm by the time it fecondates the egg.

*** I don't know about that. I think the closest we get to someone leaving behind body parts while polyjuiced in canon is Mrs. Crouch's death, and she apparently kept Barty's appearance past the hour mark. Unless the dementors handled the entire process, but that seems unlikely.

So I think at least possible to justify the sperm staying in their polyjuiced form.

** The easiest possible solution to a hypothetical Polyjuice pregnancy would be that getting pregnant because of or under the effect of Polyjuice is impossible. That being, any eggs or sperm produced under the influence of the Polyjuice potion is non-viable.

While I think the Polyjuice potion has a genetic link, that alone isn't enough to turn someone into a replica of another person as they actually exist. If the Polyjuice potion was purely based on DNA, then the person they would turn into would almost certainly look different than the original, thanks to the innumerable environmental factors that the original would have lived through that the effective clone of the Polyjuiced would not have. In this case the genetic link is simply that, a link to the original, so that the potion can 'know' what the target is that it needs to replicate (this is somewhat supported by the fact that Crouch Jr didn't kill Moody while impersonating him).

So in your hypothetical, the best (or worst) case scenario is that Draco's sperm cells would be unaffected. But more likely I would go with non-viability, or more realistically Hermione would miscarry.

** Technically, I believe that only the visual appearance changes under the Polyjuice Potion not the genetics, so Draco Malfoy under the Polyjuice would still have DNA of Draco Malfoy whatever would be his look.

  A response to WhiteTigerWolf's Pregnant Harry Challenge. After Harry saves her Dad right before Christmas break Ginny realizes exactly how she feels for him. And, luckily for her he feels the same. Knowing just how hard this year has been for him she and Hermione plan a Valentines Day treat... What do you mean potions don't transfer through Polyjuice... Uh oh. HP/GW F/F Pregnancy

  Harry hasn't always had things easy. But with the defeat of Voldemort, maybe he can finally get some rest. But make no mistake, it has taken a toll on Harry. He has grown tired of being the famous Harry Potter, only to discover there may be other options.

** It's a free for all since there is no canonical mention of it but my guess is that since your body changes only for a limited time, then even though Ron's sperm cells would be penetrating Hermione's egg, they would still revert to Draco's eventually. And thus the baby would have his features.

** Polyjuice does not use DNA. It makes a magical connection between the drinker and the subject. DNA simply does not have the information required to create an impostor on its own.

** My vote is for the changes the sperm undergo when the effect of the potion ends inhibiting fertilization.

In other words, conception is simply not possible as a result of sex in conjunction with polyjuice.
