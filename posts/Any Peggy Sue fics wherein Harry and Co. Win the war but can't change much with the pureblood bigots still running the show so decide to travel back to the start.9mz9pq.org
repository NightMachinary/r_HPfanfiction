** Do you mind bashing? Because a lot of time travel fics involve either bashing or the time travellers shipping the kids (getting Ron and Hermione together is a big theme in Harry/Ginny time-travel, alternatively Ron/Luna).

Whom should your time travelling group include? Because the larger the group the fewer stories remain in the running.

*** Not OP, but is there one where the time travelers are just Harry/Ron/Hermione? I've read a bunch where it's just Harry, and Backwards with Purpose is Harry/Ron/Ginny, and I even saw one that was Harry/Ron/Hermione/Ginny/Neville/Luna, but for some reason just the trio seems rather rare.

Preferably no bashing, don't care one way or another about romance/shipping.

**** There is the "Bonds of Time" series (Harry and Ginny), but I would not recommend it despite being a million words long and decent from the technical side. And there are two good reasons. The Third "book" (years 5-X) is abandoned and you would, therefore, invest a lot of time in a series with no payoff. And even worse (and the main reason I hate it) is that the trainwreck that happens before the abandonment.

Basically, Hermione goes on her first date with Ron, gets attacked by Dementors and comes home to her lifeless parents. That is the set-up for the romance. It's one of the few cases where I say that Ron/Hermione was done even worse than by Rowling.

Also, the story has the official subtitle "Age of Consent", so there's that as well.

**** Pretty sure the Amulet of Time series linkffn(amulet of Time) is Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny if that works. I remember it being pretty good, but its also been more than ten years since I read it so take that with a grain of salt
