Perhaps it could be the process of Harry and Ginny raising James, Albus and Lily together, it could be wholesome or NSFW I'm open for any of them :)


** Have you browsed Northumbian's works?

linkffn(8465313) is one of my favourite stories. Its really rather mundane but its just nice. It doesn't try to set the world alight nor does it risk cutting itself on its own edginess like so many other fics do, its just really nice. That being said, the author has written almost 90 stories which are actually one larger collective work. Every story happens within the same universe which, until recently was tied as closely to canon as possible. You might need to read some of the other stories to understand the characters mentioned in this one. Also, the fics will be listed in update date not in the order they are intended to be read. The author's profile page has further details on this.

  When Annabel meets someone she hasn't seen in many years, her life takes another unexpected turn. How many surprises can she take? Do people really change? Has James Sirius Potter finally grown up? Whatever happened to those brave adventurers, the Drakestone seven? Warning: Language, and some smut.

*** Hi! Which platform are their stories on, and if Reddit, would you mind sending a link?

**** If you look below my comment FanfictionBot should have replied providing a link. the command Linkffn (...) will link a story based on its id number. The FFN bit of the command tells it to look on Fanfiction.net for the ID.

** It's recently been on another post of this subreddit, but if you've never read linkffn(Grow Young With Me), it has a ton of interactions between Harry and his children, and in my opinion, the author manages to characterise everyone amazingly, including the children.

If you haven't, then seriously, just read it.

  He always sat there, just staring out the window. The nameless man with sad eyes. He bothered no one, and no one bothered him. Until now, that is. Abigail Waters knew her curiosity would one day be the death of her...but not today. Today it would give her life instead.

*** Also, don't be put off by how sappy the summary is. It doesn't really do the fic justice.
