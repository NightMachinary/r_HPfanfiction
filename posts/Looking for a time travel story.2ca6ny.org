Hey,

I'm looking for a +time travel+ story. It had to do with Harry going +back in time+ by himself. The parts I remember (and am hopefully not mixing stories)

Harry starts to use the chamber as a place to hang out/further his studies

he's friends with draco, and him and draco can change into dragons

they can enter and travel through paintings

I think there was a pendant involved with this, which lets harry teleport around in the castle.

I think that's all I can remember, I don't remember if there was slash or not

[[/u/rozn]] found it. it's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4324404/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Pendant-of-Slytherin][Harry Potter and the Pendant of Slytherin]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1588584/Neednotknowtheirname][Neednotknowtheirname]]?

*** I don't think so, the description doesn't look right, and the little bit of reading I did doesn't seem right. thanks for your help though
