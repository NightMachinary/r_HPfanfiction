I /think/ I saw the idea in a fanfic called “The lie I lived” and one other that I don't remember the name, and have to admit that it has some potential, so looking for other stories that have it, either as a side-plot or as a major plot-point.

The idea is that since it is a immortal sentient object that not only was created by the founders but also passes most of it's time around the portraits of some of the most knowledgeable wizards of their time plus the occasional conversation with the other professors it would know a lot about magic if someone bothers to seek it's help.

** You have that, not during the whole story, in "More than equal". linkffn(11764057) Warning it's abandoned/unfinished, but you still get the whole sorting hat thing

  After the events down at the Chamber, Harry decides to become the master of his own destiny than to let others decide his fate. He learns of a different connection that he shares with Voldemort; and magic that will make him a more than equal to the Dark Lord.
