Alright. So. Imagine - Harry Potter works 8 to 6, he's dead tired from work but he think's the work he's putting into the Ministry is worth it. His life pretty much went past him in what felt like hours, and his kids don't believe the stories that are told of "Harry Potter, the Savior". - One day he snaps. He packs up his kids, writes a letter to his wife and is off to some adventure to get himself and his kids back on track.

I really want to read something along the lines, but whenever I try to find something I end up with Slash-Incest =/

Does anyone of you know of any fics along the lines?

  As Harry Potter stood by the train leaving for Hogwarts, it suddenly occurred to him that for all his childhood adventures, he ended up being just another worthless soccer Dad. As he waved goodbye to his children, he thought to himself, “I should have fucking killed myself when I had the chance.”

I'll never forget this quote.

** Nothing like you describe but the closest I can get to it is linkffn(Breakfast in New York). But that's more his children not knowing their father (and vice versa) and after meeting him not immediately realising who he actually is.

  Hermione left to find her parents and was never seen nor heard from again until years later when an old friend stumbled into her at a hotel in New York. They would both learn things about each other neither had expected and found a life neither had.

  James Potter wants to be a Weasley. His mum, aunts, uncles, and grandparents tell him why it's pretty cool to be a Potter, too.
