Hi,

I'm looking for a few fics I used to read when I was in highschool (more than 10 years ago) and can't seem to find.

1. What it cost to save the world? it's a Harmony, with a really tragic ending.
2. This fic where there's this girl reading harry's diary from hogwarts. it talks about depression, also a Harmony, it gets kind of sexual and culminates with a failed suicide attempt. I don't remember the name.
3. Match by mental. can't find it, but also want to know if it was ever finished.

  Match. by mental Ze Meridian has a serious problem: despite the skirt, everyone seems to think she's a boy. Desperate to prove that having short hair, a bloke for a best friend, and a serious obsession with sport does not mean she's *full summary inside*
