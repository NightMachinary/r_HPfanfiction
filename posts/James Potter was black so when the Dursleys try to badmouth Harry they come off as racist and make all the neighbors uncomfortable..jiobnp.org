The Dursleys are fine upstanding citizens taking in their nephew out of the goodness of their hearts. Harry is already seen as scum purely based off that without race coming into it and people absolutely wouldn't question it. So it's possible but unlikely as you would hear a lot worse from Vernon if race was involved imo.

The Dursley's only met Shacklebolt the one time canonically, and how ecactly they got along with him isn't stated, though Vernon assumed he was probably the best possible wizard bodyguard you could get since he was the Prime Minister's security.

******* I agree, it's a class not a race thing. The Dursleys were pictured as narrow minded, but for their neighbours and not noticing what the Dursleys did to their nephew... honestly, classism is as much a problem as racism and sexism. People see what they want to see and have prejudices against kids from poor families, especially if they have only their own perfect little world in front of them. I never had problems to believe that the neighbours didn't see anything wrong happening in Privet Drive. Harry the poor orphan from drunk driving and unemployed parents = trouble. So if he has bruises and torn clothes? Surely it's his own fault.

Classism exists. There are even empirical studies that teachers give children from poorer backgrounds unintentionally worse grades because they expect them to fail. Heck - look at the fandom and see what they do with the Weasleys... and the Weasleys aren't even really poor, they are lower middle class.

** Correct me if I'm wrong but I remember the Dursleys being more devious, they may have called Harry a freak to his face or to Marge (who was family) but I doubt that was what they told their neighbors.

Remember when Dobby levitates the cake Vernon tells his boss "my nephew is very disturbed" not "he's a freak" and if they told neighbours his parents died in a car crash and that's how he got the ugly scar, or implied Lily and James didn't work and were wasters. A lot of neighbours would come to the conclusion Lily and James were druggies and got themselves killed by being high or drunk while driving and Harry has ptsd from the crash and various issues from being a drug baby.

Under those circumstances it would be easy to dismiss the fact Petunia and Vernon often leave him behind when going places with Dudley or the weird stuff that happens around Harry as being due to his issues. The neighbours don't know he sleeps in a cupboard or doesn't get fed enough after all.

What the absolute living hell are you talking about? I've seen white Dean more often than I can count, I've seen Seamus being called "british or english" even more often too (though the british question is a political one I won't get into).

I haven't seen many people make angelina white, because well, she was described in the books, but I've certainly seen people make her everything from mixed race, to French to African.

Do you want to talk to the Patils? Because I've seen white Patils very very often. Like more often than I've seen Indian James if I had to take a guess. Or if you've got a thing for asian characters want to talk Cho Chang? Because while yes the majority of people land on Asian I've seen her be called chinese, vietnamese, korean, japanese and even as being from the phillipines once.

I fully agree that Black Hermione has its issues...the major one for me being that the reason "mudblood" is supposed to hit hard is because it's the first time she's made to feel lesser due to who she is and if she were black or mixed race in 1980's britain it wouldn't have been the first time. But don't pretend it just happens to hermione (and ocasionally Harry/james). It affects everyone.

I've been in this fandom long enough to remember how Blaize Zabini was thought to be a white marble italian girl with greek/roman descent, a true blue blood in a way. Then HBP came out and ...oops!

****** Seamus being described as British I can understand if the writers are American: you'd be surprised how many people confuse Irish with British because of Northern Ireland.

White Dean? I haven't come across any stories with that, surprisingly. Most stories make a mention of his dark skin or just presume that the reader thinks of the guy who played him in the films. Then again, I avoid certain genres out of disinterest, so maybe they're more typical in those?

Thing is, JKR was directly involved with the movies' castings -- she was basically the judge, jury, and executioner of at least the major actors/actresses (that includes secondary characters and not the NPCs in the background used to fill seats in the Great Hall, for example). So, even if a character weren't directly described as being black or Asian in the books, the casting choice nails them down as what the characters look like. This is also why I laugh at the Blackmione supporters: JKR was looking for someone like Emma Watson in initial casting, and the books have numerous passages describing Hermione as being white (such as "pale face"). Then, she drops a bomb saying that Hermione "could have been Black" for social brownie points (which massively backfired) years and years later on Twitter, and because stage theater often has colour-blind casting (which just gets bloody confusing when different ethnicities are involved with characters), there was a black actress playing a white character. Therefore, in certain people's minds, Hermione was always black. Yeah, you can see why this "logic" of theirs makes me sigh in exasperation.

Hell, a background actress that played Lavender (in PoA as an NPC) that had one or two seconds of screen-time was black -- when the character had a major role in HBP, JKR directly looked for "blonde and bubbly", and picked Jessica Caves (Oh god, I'm having "Won Won" flashbacks :X), and the black actress was basically dumped. That canonically set Lavender's appearance and personality in stone due to her major role in things, even if a stand-in black actress played her before (and it'd be vice-versa too, if the background actress had been white but her replacement for when the role was fleshed out was black, Lavender would've been canonically black).

Most fanfiction writers come from being fans of the movies, too: when they write a character, it's a guarantee they're thinking of the actors/actresses that played them in the films, so there's no need to describe a known black character as being black because of the film e.g. Angelina. Personally, as a fan of both the books and films and having been following both since they came out as a child, I'm like that, too. I think of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert G as Ron.

So, yeah. Angelina is black, Cho is presumably Chinese-Scottish (due to her/her actress' accent) or of an Asian descent of some type -- I don't know which area of Asia, but there's no doubt she's of Asian descent (even if she were raised in the UK -- given that there's a massive Chinese-British population over here, it wouldn't surprise me if her parents of great grandparents were from Hong Kong, or something), and characters played by actors/actresses of those ethnicities? Those characters are black, white, Asian, mixed-race, et cetera, canonically. The exception to this, of course, would be if the books openly stated a character is, say, black but the films cast the role to a white actor/actres: in that case, I'd go with the book canon that the character is black (I think Star Trek calls this A and B canon, where so long as B doesn't conflict with A, it's what is, but in reverse with the movies taking precedent over the books).

Blaise was a special case because, up until HBP, he was thought of a she and Greek/Roman because of the name being from that area of the world (and for some reason they liked to ship an OC girl with Harry) because all everyone had was a name. HBP cleared that up pretty much like dumping a tank of water on a burning matchstick -- therefore, Blaise is black, male, and... kind of a bit of a twat, IIRC his characterization from the book?

If a new HP film came out and Daphne Greengrass was a character, and she was a black girl with ginger hair... well, she'd be a black girl with ginger hair canonically (even though that wouldn't make much sense unless she's a half-sister to Astoria, since Astoria is shown in the DH#2 Epilogue, but that's just an example), despite the beloved Ice Queen Elsa stereotype.

James being of Indian descent? It's built on shakier ground than a canon Harry/Draco relationship, and IIRC it was originally started by Indian nationalist fans of HP by using one of their festivals as an excuse/vehicle. XD So, yeah.

Also, white Patils? I'm honestly shaking my head at that. Yes, you can have pale-looking girls on the Indian subcontinent (mostly found in north-west India, closer towards the Middle-East -- genetics can be a funny thing), but the actresses who played them? One was from Bangladesh, for crying out loud (IIRC one of them was also beaten up by her father and brothers for some reason).

If Harry had been played by a black dude in the films and not Daniel Radcliffe, I'd be just as annoyed if people were trying to retroactively push hypothetical Harry as being white, Asian, or a Martian.

I get that its fanfiction, and people can write/do whatever the hell they want (actually, a DC What If? kinda round-robin would be kinda cool -- they had all sorts of batshit insane things in those stories kept separate from main canon), but what people need to understand that Desi Harry or James? Blackmione? They're not canon and actually go against established canon on the level of making Snape a woman, are not even realistic, and they're on the same levels of, say, Hedwig being a secret animagus or Madam Rosmerta being Morgana. But they try to push those as being what always were and will be on the flimsiest of "evidence".

That, I think, is what truly annoys me.

******* Here's the thing I don't think of the movies as "canon" in anyway to the books. Sure do they portray intent on what J.K Rowling probably thought the characters to at least look like? Yeah, but then they miss the mark so often that to take both the movies/books into consideration is an exercise in frustration.

Most people coming from the movies and not the books is why, I'm convinced, people think Snape isn't as bad as he was. When he straight up bullied, harassed and pushed kids in the books, like that time he saw Draco had curses Hermione's teeth to grow and when she complained to him he said he "didn't see a difference" or that time he threatened to kill Trevor. Hell Ron has probably hit worse, as he was made far less loyal and far more useless in the movies.

Because let's be honest. Snape was 38 when he died, and having alan rickman playing him does the books ' canon any favor. Because Snape was so "old" in the movies they had to age up the characters. Sure Lupin and Sirius had lead rough lives, but being played by middle aged actors when they were meant to be 32/33 when harry first meets them?

Hermione was supposed to be white in the books, I feel, but I get there on the groudns of her being described as "tanned" after holidaying in france for the summer in POA, not because Emma Wattson is white.

The movies make no impact in how I picture or write characters. Because to me Hermione will always be the bushy haired kid whose hair looks so disheveled it appears to grow twigs out of, and Ron will have freckles and be too tall for it to be comfortable. Not whatever the heck the movies go with. Or to put it another way Slughorn has to have a magnificent walrus moustache.

Hell, I'd read Desi Harry if I found the story interesting enough.

My issue is that certain people try to push these things as canon, as in they have and always have been, especially if there are alternate motivations behind their actions. Hermione is not black. Harry is not of Indian descent.

  Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that --- that school --- and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only one who saw her for what she was --- a freak!
#+end_quote

That's at the very least strongly implying that he's a freak too (on virtue of being a wizard)

#+begin_quote
  “Today's your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come you haven't got any cards? Haven't you even got friends at that freak place?”
#+end_quote

(from CoS)

#+begin_quote
  “You're not allowed,” Dudley said at once. “I know you're not. You'd get expelled from that freak school you go to.”
#+end_quote

(OOtP)

And not to Harry, but there's also this beautiful exchange, outlining where Dudley got his language from:

#+begin_quote
  “--- you think I want to be a --- a freak?”

  Lily's eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away.

  “I'm not a freak,” said Lily. “That's a horrible thing to say.”

  “That's where you're going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special school for freaks. You and that Snape boy ... weirdos, that's what you two are. It's good you're being separated from normal people. It's for our safety.”
#+end_quote

I dunno man, I think you may be wrong on that one. It might not be on the pages, but it's written rather clearly between the lines.

** Ah, fanfiction. Where you can have mutants, wizards, and aliens in the same fic and no one raises an eyebrow. But having middle-class neighbors in England in the 80s (or whenever) who are uncomfortable with what looks like overt racism is absolutely too ridiculous to contemplate.

Speaking as someone who grew up in a middle class neighborhood in the 70s and 80s, admittedly on the wrong side of the pond, someone who was overtly racist in public would have been side-eyed at best to socially shunned at worst. Racism was fine, but you couldn't be crude or blatant about it where everyone could see. (Jokes excepted--after all, it was just a joke, don't you have a sense of humor?)

** I feel like there would be a lot of also racists in the neighbourhood, but I did read one fic where they badmouthed him in an fancy restaurant and basically this happened. There was a well to do Desi family eating nearby and the Dursleys were interpreted to be racist AF because of Harry's obvious heritage

** You are talking about a country of people who four years ago voted themselves out of the European Union because they couldn't stand Eastern Europeans, and Eastern Europeans are white. You are talking about a country where people openly express dislike for the families with roots in their former colonies nowadays. You are talking about a country where white people in their most progressive city yell to black people to go back to their country and wonder why Hitler did not get around to exterminating the gypsies. And that's all in the last 10 years. I doubt that people in that country were more enlightened 30-40 years ago when civil rights movement was for most white people a nuisance.

**** Why?

A huge theme of Brexit was that British didn't like Polish, Romanians and Bulgarians.

There were quite a few famous videos recorded on tfl of white people harassing people of color without them doing anything.

The last part was literally told to me by some guy in a pub.
