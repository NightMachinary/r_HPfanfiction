I usually read on FanFiction.Net but I've decided that I prefer AO3 recently and want to know what fics are your favourites from there. The best writing and the best plots, whatever you've got!

I don't mind slash as long as it isn't Drarry or Harry/voldemort(or Tom riddle) or Harry/Snape.

Thanks :)


** There is a pretty good one where Harry wants to and eventually becomes a potions master despite Snape's attitude . I'll be damned if I can remember what it is called though.

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

** Linkao3(To Be A Magical Boy) follows Dean and Seamus through the years. It's actually amazing, even if not centered on the main characters.

Linkao3(Professor Black by Haunted_Frost) is a really good Regulus lives fic where he becomes potions master instead of Snape.

Linkao3(A shrike (to your sharp and glorious thorn)) Is also a Regulus lives, but sent back in time to hopefully stop Voldy.

I'm on a Regulus lives kick so linkao3(He Comes Out of the Black Lake Quite Mad) is another fantastic one I've read. Oneshot though, and linkao3(As the crow flies) is also quite good, a Professor Regulus sitiation.

Linkao3(Ron Weasley and the Philosopher's Stone) is also a time travel fix it.

Linkao3(Golden Bullets) is just fucking good. I can't say any more cause it's just good.

Linkao3(Chaos, Imperium, Scientae) is also quite good...Dark! Trio with OP characters and time travel to Lord Voldemort's time.

Linkao3(stay ahead and stay alive) is also really good, follows Slytherin Ron. Oneshot

Linkao3(Back to Back We Face Ourselves) is another Ron time travel fic. It's so good though. Like astounding.

Linkao3(Recipe for Disaster) is a Dudley redemption Drarry romantic comedy that's gold. You will not regret this one.

Linkao3(The Long Way Home) is a George grieving for Fred fic and him trying to find his way after Fred dies.

Linkao3(The Ousting of Umbridge) had Draco redemption! Harry and Draco friendship, and a different way fifth year should go.

Linkao3(A festival of traitors) is a time traveling Percy Weasley fic where he fucks himself up and tries to protect everyone.

Linkao3(The Arrangement) is a hilarious Draco/Ron rom com.

Linkao3(Playing Snape's Part) is a oneshot where Ron comes back from summer after something terrible has happened to him.

Linkao3(Dudley Dursley's Most Unexpectedly Fortunate Flower) has Dudley redemption...and his daughter is a witch.

Linkao3(Stand by Me) is an amazing post hogwarts fic in which Ron and Draco have a lot to do with. Draco redemption, Ron and Harry friendship, Ron and Draco friendship.

Linkao3(Just Another Nancy Boy?) Is Dudley redemption in which he is kicked out of his home for being gay. We love Petunia and Vernon.

Linkao3(boy with a scar by dirgewithoutmusic) is incredible. A series of what ifs, with 16 works, each about 8000 words.

Linkao3(Crimson Torment) is a poignant Ron whump fic. Oneshot.

Linkao3(Silhouettes by nauticalparamour) is my last recommendation on Ao3. It's an incredible Theo/Hermione time travel fix it to the 1970s when Voldemort wins in their time.

Hope you enjoy! I hope the fanfiction bot actually gets these links.

  What happens when you rewrite a modern fantasy epic to star the brightest witch of her age? Mayhem, magic, and a girl taking charge of her own story as she grows up in an increasingly volatile world. Through twists of the plot and her wand alike, Hermione endeavors to figure out who she is, and maybe also save the world along the way. After all, life as the Chosen One's best friend is far from easy. Book One: Hermione Granger is eleven years old when she receives a letter telling her that she has been accepted into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, catapulting her into a realm beyond her wildest imaginings. As she adjusts to her new life, she must learn to navigate the struggles of making friends, fighting evil, and, scariest of all, growing up.

  Kreacher's unending loyalty has allowed Regulus to survive the Inferi. In order to destroy the horcrux and ensure Voldemort's death, he goes back to Hogwarts, this time as a Potions professor. Years at this position give him new insights, even as the papers rave about how both the Blacks were traitors to their sides. When Sirius gets loose from Azkaban, Regulus knows one thing: he is not going to let his lunatic brother hurt his students. Inspired entirely by this tumblr post.

  Regulus Black comes out of the black lake quite mad, very much his mother's son. Hogwarts will keep him safe, says Dumbledore, who offers him the post of Charms professor.But Regulus hasn't stopped drowning (lungs saturated with water, mind torn apart) and the face of Harry Potter, who looks too much like James, makes him realize the war is never over.

**** Linkffn(Heart over Mind by Regann) IS JUST SO SWEET AND AMAZING. slow burn that kills me in the best of ways and just amazingly done.

Linkao3(Black Magic by Mysticalpapaya) I love this one so much! Is really sweet and mature, Hermione is older and coming back and is just a cool and normal relationship with no extreme shenanigans like magical bonding, contracts, potions and etc. Is just natural and amazing.

Linkao3(Teaching Miss Granger by OracleObscured) Porn with plot, not for the faint of heart and kinda problematic in some ways? was rly skeptical about it, but ended up loving it after so many people reccomended, is better not to judge based on the first chapter tho.

Linkao3(Quartet by OracleObscured) Also porn with plot, but just so effing amazing and not problematic(lot of kinks, but not problematic in a sense that everything is very explicitly consensual)

Linkffn(Presque Toujours Pur by ShayaLonnie) Dramione. Just gold. Really. The plot is so freaking amazing and I love the Regulus sub plot.

Linkao3(A Kiss for the Netherfairies by Zaubernuss) Chamber play but so cute!!

Linkao3(Getting the Best of the Gloomilows by Zaubernuss) Sequel to the previous one, very amazing.

Linkao3(Cloak of Courage by WendyNat) Haven't read it yet, but everyone reccomends a lot. Apparently very dark.

Linkao3(311126) Second Life Amazing, amazing, amazing!! I found it to be a great introduction to the pairing.

Linkffn(2290003) Is just every sshg shipper favourite. Not my favourite but still an awesome fic rly.

Linkffn(7170435) Not for the faint of heart, but one of my favourites rly. Dark premise but soooo amazing. Is a wip and I only read complete fics as a rule, but that really got me.

Linkffn(The Problem with Purity by Phoenix.Writing) Really amazing, thick plot, there's drarry as subplot, but they are just amazing, the war efforts are great, the lycantropy issue is just 10/10 and is somewhat dark. Love it with all my heart.

There's more I can't recall now but if I remember I'll come back here :D

  Post-war Hogwarts. One evening, 7th year student Hermione Granger seeks out her Potions Professor in the dungeons. She has an important question to ask. Before, explanations are given, confessions are made, secrets are revealed, forgiveness is asked, memories are shared, truths are being told. In the end, Snape has a decision to make. Could this be a beginning? SS/HG, mostly canon (except for the fact that Snape lives, obviously ;) ) -COMPLETE -

#+begin_quote
  Sequel to "A Kiss for the Netherfairies": After their life-changing encounter, Severus is adamant that he and Hermione keep their distance until graduation. But how can he turn his back when he finds that Hermione is suffering? Can Occlumency help? A story about healing & finding new perspective. M-rated for adult themes, descriptions of violence, mild PTSD and sexual content. Though the sequel is less of a chamber play and has a little bit more 'action', you will once again find Hermione and Severus in lengthy discussions... about how Hermione managed to obliviate her parents and what became of them, the fine and subtle art of Occlumency and Legilimency, what's really behind the pureblood ideology and what the Hogwarts librarian has to do with it. Furthermore, those discussions reveal how Draco feels about Harry and Hermione now, how Harry's relationship with Snape develops and the concern Luna has for many Hogwarts inhabitants, who are suffering a severe outbreak of Gloomilows. You will also learn about Bluedrags, Whotnits, and Weapknats and the truth behind Lemon Sherbets.Please note that this is entirely focused on SS/HG; all others will only be minor roles.
