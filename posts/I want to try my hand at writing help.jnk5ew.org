I love writing in general and have been reading fanfic a lot recently and decided I wanted to try. I want to start by writing something where I'm in the story(I'm not gonna post it[unless someone wants to read:)]) just to see if I'm any good. I wanted to see if anyone had ideas as to what was a better idea. Should I put myself into the story or should I replace Harry or another character with myself? If there are any writers who have done either or both, what would you say is a better way to start? Also, I'm not super active on this sub so if this post doesn't belong here or isn't flaired appropriately, let me know and I'll change it. I appreciate any help in advance!


** The main question you have to ask yourself is “how would the story of Harry Potter be different if I was in it?” And, for the story to be good, “what additional complications would that cause that would would take months or even years to solve?”

** Reading the book by Ray Bradbury (one of the best writers of stories I know about) [[https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Art-Writing-Releasing-Creative/dp/0553296345][Zen in the Art of Writing]] I see two conclusions:

- the only way how to learn writing is to write (see also [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Writing_of_Speculative_Fiction][Heinlein's Rule of Writing]])

- start with short stories (aka one-shots) to learn basic craft of writing: building of plot, character writing, character development, good dialogues, etc. Bradbury claims that he wrote his first short story where he really managed to write what he wanted only ten years after his first story was *published*.

*** *On The Writing Of Speculative Fiction*

"On the Writing of Speculative Fiction" is an essay by Robert Anson Heinlein, considered one of the key Science Fiction authors of the 20th century. It was first published in 1947, also appearing in Writing Science Fiction & Fantasy: 20 Dynamic Essays By the Field's Top Professionals in 1993, and The Nonfiction of Robert Heinlein:

** [[/u/Hadsta][u/Hadsta]] Here's Atomic Armadillos guide to writing like a pro! :)

It's not actually that hard! You just have to have ideas and a plan! I've written a couple of stories and really it's quite easy; if you have an idea, write it down and plan from there, plannings the somewhat hard part but here's how I do it.

First I make an overview of what I want the world to look and be like, so like write down landmarks and country's you want to include. Then you write a miniature summary of the world's history so you can reference it later.

Second is the characters (personally the fun part) come up with a name and background and try to work out how they will fit into the world, it doesn't have to be much but it has to leave either a positive or negative impact on both reader and character. (Like uncle bens death, try to create a lesson out of said impact and have the character learn and grow around that lesson)

you should probably come up with what I call the ‘end' personality this is what you want your character to be and how they act; what would they do in this situation? How would they act when they have to face consequences?

This is what they will act,think and be like at the end of the story (character growth is Important) then back-track until your left with your characters ‘core' traits like strong, compassionate, wise stuff like that. This is the ‘Start' personality which from there you slowly add your ‘End' personality's traits over the story's duration so you'll eventually end up with your ‘end' personality instead of the ‘start' personality.

Once that's done: design, watch a couple drawing videos and do a couple of rough sketches, get an idea of what exactly you want your character to look like: male,female,eye colour stuff like that.

Not much left!

Here's number 3, Implementation

Your going to want to have a basic grounding on how your character interacts with the world and people around them.

Are they kind and loving towards their friends? Violent and aggressive towards family? Better with animals than humans? And interest's: this is the MOST important part. You screw this up and your story will fail.

It sounds simple but sometimes it can be a nightmare. First your going to decide if you want any romance or not, but you probably do as it gives more leeway for character growth.

Your going to have to decide who are friends and who are enemies, who are important to the plot and who aren't. It's easier if you draw a table and decide who you need or not.

Now you need to think about how the characters interact, who says what? Are there certain things that need to be said during a key scene? Simplifying this part is basically you just need to forge strong emotional connections between characters.

Part 4: Theme: many think themes are stuff like, horror and fantasy, but it's not that's Genre. The theme is a central topic, subject, or message within a narrative.

Themes can be divided into two categories: a work's thematic concept is what readers "think the work is about" and its thematic statement being "what the work says about the subject”.

So basically a theme is a moral or lesson you take away from the story for example; in Macbeth it is the destruction wrought when ambition goes unchecked by moral constraints.

(This is gonna be pretty long) Macbeth finds its most powerful expression in the play's two main characters. Macbeth is a courageous Scottish general who is not naturally inclined to commit evil deeds, yet he deeply desires power and advancement.

He kills Duncan against his better judgment and afterward stews in guilt and paranoia. Toward the end of the play he descends into a kind of frantic, boastful madness.

Lady Macbeth, on the other hand, pursues her goals with greater determination, yet she is less capable of withstanding the repercussions of her immoral acts.

One of Shakespeare's most forcefully drawn female characters, she spurs her husband mercilessly to kill Duncan and urges him to be strong in the murder's aftermath, but she is eventually driven to distraction by the effect of Macbeth's repeated bloodshed on her conscience.

In each case, ambition---helped, of course, by the malign prophecies of the witches---is what drives the couple to ever more terrible atrocities.

/phew/ thank god That I just so happend to be doing an essay on Macbeth.

Part 5 - Detail,

You need to make sure you have lots of description, without it your story is just a bunch of speech stacked on top of each other.

The easiest way to describe something is to make comparisons, so for example

“As I rushed home from school I braced myself against the howling winds that ripped at my ears making all other sound nothing more than than a harsh breath. Snot trickled down my nose and through my sweaty pores as I ran through the terential rain flooding the streets, Garbage Bin's puking out last nights feast, lampposts hunching over to get shelter from the storm, cars blitzing by at incredible speeds, finally I could see it in the ever-growing distance, an nice cozy cottage on the hill with beautiful flowers of all shapes and sizes leading up to a smooth hard oak door, finally stepping inside, my mussels relaxed and I slumped to my knees, lungs racing to see which could breath the most air, but it didn't matter why? Because “I'm home”. And not running through the rain.”

See how much a description can do? I just pretty much wrote an entire short story only using one line of speech.

Part 6- The End

Not yet... I have to keep you prisoner for a few more moments. You see apart from implementation this is the biggest part.

If you give a bad ending people will hate you forever, for instance if you had a brilliant story with 67 chapters and then had a horrible ending, you just wasted hundreds of hours combined on reading your story.

The key to a good ending in my opinion should kind of do a small loop but with a major difference.

Harry Potter and the PS has Hermione as a rule-abiding, almost snobby bookworm but at the end, she returns home to her parents... different she is more willing to break rules, doesn't criticise others for not being as smart as they could be.

That's all for now unless you need more help. As for self-insert vs OC's they're both pretty good but I mostly prefer OC's as you don't constantly read things you barley understand every 5 seconds like [L/N] [E/C].

So now that you've kept me up past midnight, enjoy yourself and have a good night.
