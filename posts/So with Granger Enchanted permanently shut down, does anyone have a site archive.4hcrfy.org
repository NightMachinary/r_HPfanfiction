So many of the fics there were not available anywhere else, and I fear we've lost them forever. Anyone?


** As far as I can tell, it's [[https://www.facebook.com/Granger-Enchanted-201065189925399/?fref=nf][gone]].

*** Sort of a bit dumb not to have backups of the site from literally any point in it's history...

** If you have bookmarks or can find the old URL, wayback and potentially google cache are your friend. Go through asap and download or save as PDF what you can.

My issue is that wayback will pull up certain search results, but not the stories themselves. I know there was a userscript that would allow you to pull up successive Google Cache links (so if you view cache from the google search results, clicking a link on that page would take you to the cache for *that* link if it existed). But I can't find the script.

** For that matter what happened to restrictedsection.org? I found the second version of the site that says the original is still around but none of the pages are loading for me.

** Oh, no! I've been living under a rock finishing my thesis and didn't realize this had happened! :( Gonna see what I can find with the Wayback Machine.

** All I can suggest is googling any pen names and/or story names you remember, in hopes they posted them somewhere else.
