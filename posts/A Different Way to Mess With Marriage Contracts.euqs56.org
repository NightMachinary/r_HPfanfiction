TL;DR: Two romantically-incompatible people in an unbreakable marriage contract make the best of things by exploiting the hell out of every loophole they can find.

We've all seen the fics where somebody, usually Harry, discovers that they're in an unbreakable (or at least unbreakable without intolerable consequences) magically-binding marriage contract with someone else that they either don't know at all or aren't in a relationship with. Almost invariably these fics use this as a way to produce a desired pairing, with the two growing to love each other, possibly with help from the magic of the contract (which is all kinds of scary /nope/). The rest of the time, it seems to be about finding a way out of the contract, or forcing the other party to break it off.

What if neither party wanted this marriage, but neither can get out of it without suffering horribly? What if they're both able to realize that, while they could respect each other and maybe become friends, love just isn't in the cards? What if one or both is already madly in love with someone else?

What if both of them decide to start exploiting loopholes in the contract to live happily?

For example, perhaps there's a clause that imposes harsh penalties for infidelity, but it allows dalliances if the spouse permits them; it was added by one of the families so that their son could go on sowing his wild oats, but the other family made sure it worked both ways.

The overall idea would be a comedy, as various provisions and loopholes are thoroughly abused and put to wildly different purposes than the stuffy Pureblood aristocrats that wrote the contract intended. Bonus points for creativity in both what the contract says and how the "couple" twists that to their benefit.


** One thing they almost never explain in "Harry is in a marriage contract with Pureblood Princess Greengrass" is: What despicable scumbag agreed to the contract, and why the fuck didn't it get completed until Harry? How could James marry Lily, but Harry suddenly has to marry 1-4 purebloods?

Honestly, there are much less rapey plot devices to get two people who dislike each other together than "fuck or die".

*** There's a reason I'm not a fan of the standard Marriage Contract fic. If you want to get Harry together with some girl that's not close to him in canon, then Step One is "give them a reason to interact". Plenty of fics do this in much less rapey ways, like being partnered for a class project, and let the relationship develop organically. Using forced marriage (whether by contract or by law) is taking things out of order and inherently makes the relationship feel much more artificial.

**** While this is just an assumption, I think the reason Marriage contracts became as prominent as they are today might be due to someone, somewhere, issuing a fic challenge, sprouting a lot of decent fics (after all, it had never been done before, so the fics at the time can't really count as "tropey") within the restrictions. This inspires others to write it, and so on, and we end up like today.

***** Arranged marriages, especially via contact and/or under threat of death, are a blight which should be purged, not something that should be romanticised in fiction.

They are popular because authors can't be bothered to write a decent get-together when even "we got drunk and woke up naked together" would be more romantic or because they realise that the pairing would be impossible without a rape-y pretense, and a rape law or contract can be blamed on someone else while normal rape sticks to the offender.

****** I have little interest in Marriage Law fics (which Marriage contract fics are basically a subcategory of). I read one, figured it was okay, and then didn't really have much interest in reading further ones.

But clearly a large group of people enjoy them. While my post was mainly targetting ship shaming, and not the Marriage Law trope, I can definitely see where you're coming from. It is a rather disturbing premise if you think about it for a bit.

However, with this said, why go out of one's way to say how horrible something is, using outright hostile language, rather than just leaving people who care about it to their own? Flaming is not a good part of this community. I consider it far worse than whatever "odd" tastes some people may have.

Because people might not realise how horrible something is. If you want a more cheery example, look at soul bonds. Undying love, feeling the emotions of the other side, non verbal communication... Sounds good on paper, would be a dystopian nightmare if you really think about it.

Mate, that ain't hostile language. The only people who have a right to take insult are the ones who practise or defend such customs, customs which are rightfully outlawed where I live. Saying that an illegal practice should be stopped is not hostile.

I'm fine with not having them where I live, but "arranged" doesn't always mean "forced," you know. It can just mean that the parents took the initiative to investigate the dating market and set two people up, rather than the individuals doing it themselves.

On the one hand, there may be valuable lessons learned by taking the initiative, which this would miss; on the other hand, parents have more maturity and experience of what makes a marriage work, and might therefore choose more wisely. I don't think it's appropriate to just outright call the whole concept a "blight".

Attempting to compel children to marry for economic or political advantage, that's a different kettle of fish.

** Usually, the contract demands for offspring within a few years. And infidelity is punished by death, as is any other kind of "exploit".

I've thought about subverting that canon concept a few times, but usually they are pretty watertight because the authors want to ensure that the outcome is "fuck (frequently) or die".

The only real subversion you can do without ending up with a dystopian/horror fic is void the contract through a technicality (eg if the demand is "a virgin daughter of House X", you make sure she has sex with someone else) or block the person from entering a contract marriage by marrying someone else BEFORE the contract is applied/activated. Or by arranging an "accident".

Or you can write an arc similar to Andromeda's where one party runs away, basically elopes and thereby denounces their family or is cast out.

I think that there even was a fic where the trio hired some kind of assassin/mercenary who ended up purging half of the purebloods until they called the whole thing off because they thought it to be some kind of curse.

*** That fic's on my Favorites list on ffnet.

Anyway, my concept is that the contract is inescapable but not so perfectly well-written. The hubristic inbred Purebloods who wrote it made a lot of assumptions, and thus left loopholes that could be exploited if both parties wanted - they simply couldn't imagine that their two scions would be willing to so shame their families. Maybe one might be less than enthusiastic, but the contract would give the other the power to force the issue as necessary. Too bad for them.

Alternatively, Muggle technology might be the workaround. "An heir must be produced within five years or the marriage shall be annulled. Neither participant may be infertile, nor may either use any spells, potions, poisons, enchanted items, or other magic to prevent pregnancy." Okay, then they'll use a condom for five years of mandated no-strings-attached sex. The wording of the infidelity clause doesn't account for IVF or artificial insemination, allowing both to start families with their chosen lovers without technically violating the contract.

The whole point is "stupid/arrogant/bigoted Purebloods left loopholes in the contract because they couldn't imagine both parties rejecting it and/or because they underestimated how creative people can be when pissed off and desperate".

** Ok it's not MLC and it totally does become a romance for my ship, but your request reminded me of [[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=824&i=1][A Snape is for Life, Not Just for Christmas]]

As Hermione explains to him in chapter 1:

#+begin_quote
  “And everyone would be really horrified, and just think of the fun we can have with that. If someone is really annoying you, you could signal to me and I would come to your rescue. The faintest sign of affection between us and most people would be running for cover. And you could do the same for me.”
#+end_quote

If you're not opposed to this ship, I think I have also read some that were more like what you've asked for, way back at the original 2003 MLC challenge at WIKTT. But it's been so long I'll have to dig them up. Hoping to get back to you tomorrow on that ;)

*** I have a massive objection to almost all Snape/Hermione fics, since they tend to take place while she's still at Hogwarts. Sexual/romantic relationships between a teacher and their student are /seriously not okay/. Even if said student isn't still a minor (which adds a whole other layer of "oh fuck no"), they are profoundly unequal in power.

Fics where Hermione is an adult and no longer under Snape's authority/tutelage deal with that issue, though it would still require one or both to be hugely OOC to work.

**** Boy howdy Kamerad, are /you/ in for a journey. You're in a community that likes pairing Harry with his parents' murderer, to the point where there are writers who make that their entire spiel. Like, they call themselves "tomarry" writers (who even comes up with these fucking things) and everything. Then there's the various Snape pairings, most, like you said, with children, the discussion surrounding one of which (in this subreddit, my seventh sense for disgusting fics is well developed, so I don't click them) has actually, physically made me vomit once, and of course the generally liked Malfoy pairing. You know, Malfoy, the lad who constantly calls other people the wizard N-word, who led a band of terrorists into a school full of children, who willingly joined the dark lord, who used the enslavement curse on the nicest woman in all of canon, who tried to curse, poison and eventually couldn't find the resolve to cast the murder spell on Dumbledore.

This community is massively problematic, that's for sure. There are sentiments at work here which I'm very much afraid to unspool, things have been written and put into words which equal the seven plagues of egypt in literary form, there are seriously emotionally deluded people present here ("hate can easily turn into love", I've heard a lot, used to justify some of the vomit-inducing pairings), and the community's general obsession with "romance" (as much as you can call this 'written by an alien possessed by a demon' type shit romance) is seriously disturbing to myself as an AroAce person.

***** You make Tomarry sound as some kind of cult (name-wise it's simply just a typical shipname -- fused names of the participants in quesetion). While I really don't care for the pairing, and would rather stay far away from it, I prefer to not judge people for what they like. Ship shaming is easily the worst part of this community, and mostly just drives people away, whether their particular ship preferences are judged or not.

You don't have to enjoy it, I for sure don't. But don't insult people's preferences. Nothing good will come from it.

FWIW, while I don't have an unconditional objection against SSHG (I can see it happen in certain circumstances), the vast majority of SSHG fics are teacher/student (or nearly so) fics, which I find disturbing. But I'm not going to shipshame anyone for liking it -- it's just not something I have any interest for.

****** There are only two things I will object to in a ship:

1) It makes no sense. This can be fixed through use of character development or alternative versions of the character(s) involved to make them compatible.

2) It's unethical or otherwise massively problematic. Incest, adult/child, young children, teacher/student, superior/subordinate, abuse, coercion, rape victims coming to love their rapist, etc.

For #1 I'd just suggest that the author put a bit more work into making their ship plausible. For #2, while there's nothing wrong about innocent fantasy or roleplay (not gonna kink-shame), there's something to be said for not promoting unhealthy or unethical relationships (I'm looking at YOU, Stephanie Meyer and E.L.

Power play / dubcon is one of the most common kinks on the planet. I like how we can explore what makes Snape vulnerable by using that contrast with a much younger student.
