:END:
From what I can remember, Draco read the communist manifesto, Pansy formed a feminist group and all of Hogwarts ends up protesting in the Great Hall. Pansy and Ginny work together. I just have completely forgotten what it is called!


** I think it is The secret language of plants series

*** It is, and those things happen in the second book of the series, /The Meaning of Dandelions/ (the whole thing is one of my all time favorite series I just didn't want anyone to read the first one and think it wasn't what they were looking for)
