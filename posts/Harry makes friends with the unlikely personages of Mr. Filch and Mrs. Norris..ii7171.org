This would require Harry to have a more Hufflepuff mentality than he comes equipped with in canon, or, failing that, OCD tendencies that would drive him to offer Mr. Filch assistance in cleaning and neatening the castle (I have no idea how OCD works, so don't murder me if that is unlikely).


** There was one where Harry try be as normal as possible to not antagonize the Dursleys and when he comes at Hogwarts, he's not aware of the money he got from his parents (don't remember, maybe he didn't went with hagrid) and so he thought he was still poor and approached Filch in order to do menial jobs and have a bit of money. That gives him some leniency from the caretaker since he's hard working and reliable

*** Sound a bit like /Magical Relations/. Duddley get a Hogwarts letter, So Vernon takes Harry and Duddley to get their school supplies (though harry is told he'll have to pay back every pound spent on him). Because of that, Harry never learned about his vault, and asked Filche for a job working with him to earn money to pay Vernon back and buy subsequent school supplies. It's a pretty good read, I'd recommend it.

**** That's the one. Then when his housemates (Slytherins) find out, they're like, 'LOL Dude... you're filthy rich.' Harry keeps the job, part time. Always handy to have Filch actually like you.

*** But how can Filch be the one solving mysteries when he's a caricature of a Scooby-doo villain?

Oh, there's a fic idea. One of those "Dumbledore realizes Harry's being abused" fics where Filch takes him in. To entertain a small child, Filch does mystery games with Harry, who solves them with Mrs. Norris. Harry spends the entire plot of PS thinking the teachers are getting in on the game.
