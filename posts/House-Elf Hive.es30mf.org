We is the House Elves. You will be assimila- assimiliae- you will be joined up with us. Yous bio-mo-logical and magical distinctiveness will be added to ourses own.

Someone said something that made me think of this in that recent thread about house-elf slavery and now I want to see fics where the House Elves are just the Borg from Star Trek. Perhaps they're cursed, perhaps it's been a plot they've continued through the centuries, perhaps it's just a demon taking over their minds. However it happens, the House-Elves are rebelling and they're a hive-mind that wants to eat/assimilate/murder every living thing that isn't a house-elf.


** I think it would work well if the hive mind turned out to be their natural state. If you free a house-elf, that's fine, because they still have their lifetime of cultural and psychological conditioning. But, if, say, Dobby and Winky reproduced, their offspring wouldn't, and would begin to revert. After a few generations, you'll get your hive-mind, seeking +cleanse+ clean the world.

I guess what I am saying is that Bellatrix's knife-throwing skills saved the world.

If I were to write a fic, I'd probably frame it as a horror story in which Hermione encounters a colony of free house-elves, who are friendly and helpful but also very insistent that she not disturb the order they have imposed on their part of reality---which is ever expending.

*** Dang. I really want to read that. Sort of a Jonestown-esque vibe where they're all secretly Borg. Sounds brilliantly creepy.
