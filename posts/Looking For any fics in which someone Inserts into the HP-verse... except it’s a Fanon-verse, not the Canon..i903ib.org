Is a SI into a fic by Robst... in which the SI is inserted into Evil!Ron and Hermione&Harry are doing a Peggy Sue.

disclaimer: the SI gains access to a !Gamer power, but it does not actually take over the story^{from what I remember}... the story also crossovers into Naruto just before it dies.

  Based on Robst's fanfic "In this world and the next" where Harry and Hermoine get betrayed by their best friend, Ron. After dying they get a do over, sent back to their 11 year old selves. But this isn't their story. A guy from our world where Harry Potter canon and fanfic exists gets plopped in Ron's 11 year old body during H&H's do over. Now he's thrown in the deep end.

*** I barely consider it an SI into a fanfic. The fanfic "drama" ends in like six chapters or something. It was incredibly short, and then it becomes this gamer-y thing, with universe portals and a new badguy.
