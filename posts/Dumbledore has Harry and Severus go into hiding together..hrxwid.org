I am somewhat sure that its a Snarry. As the title says it starts with Dumbledore having Severus and Harry go into hiding together. Later on Harry takes what I think is a phantom pregnancy potion (prob not what its called) because he wanted to know what its like. Draco and Blaise also come to stay for a while. The others (Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore etc.) occasionally visit every once and a while. Ron and Hermione also have a baby girl in the fic as well. Please help me I cant find it.
