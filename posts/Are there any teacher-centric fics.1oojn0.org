I want to read something about the Hogwarts teachers. Maybe one-shots set in the staff room before/during/after staff meetings, teachers pulling pranks on one another, discussions about the last DAtDA teacher to leave and debates on the next one to come, conversations between Muggle Studies, Arithmancy, and Ancient Runes teachers about how they're secretly glad /not/ to have Harry Potter in their class, ganging up on Dumbledore to try and get raises... Just anything that centres on the teachers.

- Any pairings
- Any rating
- Any genre, except PWP, with a preference for humour
- I'm expecting one-shots, but if you've got longer then great, though preferably nothing more than 50k words

#+begin_quote
  A VERY long Tuesday in the life of Minerva McGonagall. With rampant Umbridgeitis, uncooperative Slytherins, Ministry interventions, an absent Dumbledore and a schoolwide shortage of Hot Cocoa, it's a wonder she's as nice as she is.
#+end_quote

3 chapters, set across a single day in the midst of the chaos of Umbridge's short reign as Headmistress. A great portrayal of a great character. The appearance of Emmaline Vance is a little sobering, because she dies offscreen a few months later between OoTP and HBP.

** Goldilocks and the Four Heads of Houses

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3732804/1/Goldilocks-and-the-Four-Heads-of-Houses]]

#+begin_quote
  This is a plain silly humour fic about the events of Valentine's Day in CoS. Lockhart makes a pass on Snape, who would rather face the basilisk instead. Minerva has a word or two to say about it. A little slashy, a hint of MMSS, and a lot of pink confetti

** Since you said any pairing and any rating, I'm going out on a limb and recommending a Snape/Harry fic (even though I know many, if not most, of you guys dislike slash, especially that of the Snape/Harry variety) that is set post-series, when both of them are professors. It is a two shot, under 8k words, and is fairly amusing. There are numerous scenes of interactions between and among teachers.

"Writen for Snarry a thon 2010, Harry and Snape teach at Hogwarts - Harry begs Snape to pretend to be in a relationship with him to keep the new teacher in town who doesn't seem to understand 'not interested' off his back. Pretending becomes reality." Rated M

EDIT: OH MY GOD I can't believe I almost forgot one of my favorite humor fics. It isn't exactly what you're looking for, but I think it's near enough that you may enjoy it. Neville is Professor of Herbology and Harry is Head Auror, and they get together and complain about students/aurors while getting drunk at the Leaky Cauldron. It is side-splitting, seriously, I never fail to crack up when I read this fic. It's fairly gen, but there are mentions of canon relationships (i.e. Neville/Hannah and Harry/Ginny).

"After the war, Neville and Harry meet up to mock people and get drunk. It's a good life. Post-DH oneshot crackfic."

** The only one I really know of is [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5386877/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Veil-of-Mystery][Harry Potter and the Veil of Mystery]]; first of a completed trilogy, though sadly it's far bigger than you say you want, the first book is 400,000 words, because of the author's tendency to stretch things out.

Occurs during 6th year; Harry ends up in the DADA position after no one else qualified applies, and the fact that all the members of DA in 5th year got O's in their Defense OWLS.

Harry continues only the classes he'll need to become an auror; (6th and 7th years getting taught DADA by Albus, (Nothing's mentioned about the Cannon Slughorn/Severus teaching positions other than Severus continuing to teach potions)); the rest of the time spent teaching.

  [ One Shot ] Their laughter didn't fade, no matter how much it hurt Minerva McGonagall to hear it. Memories of the Marauder era, from someone who knew them better than they realized.

  There was one table in Professor McGonagall's classroom that had the words This is the table of Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs carved into it. This is the story of that table.

These are just two one-shots of McGonagall remembering a long lost class.

  Archibald Penrose had a rubbish job: poor students, low levels of respect, high causality rates and some degree of amusement (depending on how you look at things).

  Why the hell would anyone want to be a muggle studies teacher?
