I've seen so many fics that bash the Weasleys, but just looking for recommendations for the best Weasley family and Harry to warm my heart while we're all in quarantine.

Preferably completed, but I don't have any preferences other than that..

Bonus points for Harry and Arthur having like a father-son relationship. There's nowhere near enough of these.

This one's super heart warming, it's about Mrs. Weasley giving Harry her brother's watch.

[Harry Potter would never regret running away as a child, but two years living on the hard streets of London had taken its toll. Now almost thirteen, Harry is still struggling to survive when a split-second decision gives him a chance at happiness. But will he take that chance, or will his past haunt him forever? AU story.]

** /Like A Red-Headed Step-child/ is about the most pro-Weasley story I can think of.

Though I should point out that it's quite cracky. [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] doesn't do subtle.

  Harry Potter was born with red hair, but the Dursley's always treated him like the proverbial red-headed stepchild. Once he enters the wizarding world however, everyone assumes he's just another Weasley. To Harry's surprise, the Weasleys don't seem to mind. Now written by Gilderoy Lockhart, against everyone's better judgement.
