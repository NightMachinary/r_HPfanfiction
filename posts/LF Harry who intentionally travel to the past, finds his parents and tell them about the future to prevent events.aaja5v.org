I don't care if this is one shot or long fic, but is there anything like that?


** Damn, there was one, where he showed up at his parents' doorstep while they were in hiding and told them(or maybe just James?) who he was. I think after that he and James were researching something. I will try to find it, but maybe someone here knows it:)

  Rita spouting lies, branded as a Dark wizard and goblins in a rage; Harry's had enough. So, he seeks to jump back in time to save himself from a life of misery and fickle loyalty, maybe a little revenge and mysteries along the way.Time Travel! A Harry raises himself fic. Non-epilogue compliant, non-slash.

  Sequel to A Brand New Start: Time Traveler Harry Potter/Hydrus Black once again travels to 1981, hoping this time he can save Harry's parents along with Harry. Having saved Harry once, this time should be much easier with his past experience. If only things would go as he expects they should... a bit of mystery, some romance, no slash. Time Travel! Up for adoption.
