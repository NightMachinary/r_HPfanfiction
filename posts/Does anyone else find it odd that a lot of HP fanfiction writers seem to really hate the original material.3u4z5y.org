It's like the reason they write fics about it isn't because they want to add more to the story or to change details to make new ideas, but instead to show exactly how they think it should have gone. Which often results in it being almost unrecognisable from what the fics are based on.


** I don't really think that writing a fic that is almost unrecognizable from the source material necessarily indicates that the writers didn't like the source material.

I mean, if the implication is that someone like joe6991, who wrote linkffn(Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time) doesn't like the original material because his fic is essentially HP in name only (and it's freaking awesome) then I would think that he would just not have written it.

There's this strange trend I've noticed, where people seem to discard stories that veer too far away from canon. I come from the opposite camp--I read canon and loved it, and it inspired me, but I don't feel like reading it again. The more inventive and different a fic can be, while maintaining the essence of the characters and themes that I loved from the original, the better.

**** I'm kind of what you describe. Not as bad as what Pashow is talking about with the whole Hitlermort stuff, but I do genuinely dislike so much about the HP universe.

The reason why I write fanfic for it though, is because of my love for the idea, the concept. Not just the idea for the plot as a whole, but all the little things from minor characters to the different branches and disciplines in magic.

Essentially, I write HP fanfic because I feel HP could have objectively been so amazing, and it would hurt me more to not try write what I personally consider to be better, than to complain about it and do nothing.

On the one hand, I consider myself to be a lover of HP fanfic, and I certainly enjoyed the HP films and books (though to a lesser extent) the first time round, I can't stand them anymore. I can re-read my favorite parts, sure, but as complete texts I can't stand the original books anymore. That sounds to me a lot like hatred.

But in the same breath I can see that they are objectively reasonably good. There are positive and negative aspects to how they were written, and a lot of what I look for in fanfiction is based on a desire to weed out the bad and improve upon it. This seems to me like criticism.

So... I can't really remember what my point was. But I both hate, love, and criticize the original HPverse.

Yeah, this can be the reasoning of a lot of people. Sometimes it's valid, sometimes it's not. At least they're trying to "fix" it and not just saying LOL this sux. Better something than nothing, even if that something is crap.

Personally, I'm so glad JKR wrote what she did, as well as how she did it. The Potterverse is large and amazing and open-ended. But I also have a problem with how she wrote it, namely it being so open-ended. The more I reflect on it, and talk with other people, the more it seems like JKR did only what was necessary to advance the plot, and no more. She didn't try to world build more than necessary, she didn't try to flesh out the magic system into something more, well, systematic. I can understand why the there /are/ holes and problems; she didn't expect it to be so popular, and it was only meant to be a younger kids' book at most. But it still seems lacking in a lot of areas, no matter how great what she actually wrote was.

That's my problem with it, at least. She did a lot, but she could have done so much more. Maybe she didn't enjoy it enough? Who knows.

*** Ah. JKR didn't think it was going to be a younger kids book, at least, not entirely - the plot for the end of the series was very obviously planned out (and very obviously /not/-kid-friendly). I think the first three books were extraneous -- that is to say, they were deliberately used to establish a loyal, young fan-base, and to elaborate on the world just enough to get people invested. You can tell, for instance, that a lot of the elements that would define her later books were only introduced following or during the fourth book. Harry's character arc (including the canon pairing) was only really determined by the fifth book onwards.

These are just the things I've noticed. That being said, your point is very valid in that she never elaborated more than possible. As episodic as it seems, it's more like there's one episode per book rather than one episode per chapter - consistency and scale are determined around that. So the books have never had a focus on the everyday or creating a new status quo (at least, not a status quo based on daily life).

That's really not the same as hate, and frankly there wouldn't be much fanfiction if people weren't trying to tweak the original to improve it (at least in their minds). There's a very, very limited scope for sticking rigidly to canon and doing nothing but adding little bits like decorations.

Are the "Percy Jackson" stories evidence that Rick Riordan hates Greek mythology? Not at all; if anything, they are a sign that he loves the source material. If he didn't, why would he spend so much time working with it?

The same is true of much of the AU fanfiction, whatever the fandom. Taking the source material and doing new things with it is a sign that the author likes it a lot, even if they disagree with some of what JKR did with it.

What's more, I would argue that it is only /flawed/ source material (self-contradictory, incomplete, vague, etc.) that is suited to such work. If it were all complete and perfect, there would be nothing anyone else could do with it - nothing to add, nothing to improve. JKR's works are flawed in many ways. Those flaws give us readers more to think about and debate. Those flaws inspire some of us to become writers to rework the material into new forms.

The horrible cliches and repeated storylines in a lot of 'canon' fics probably result in some very bored readers, and fanfiction allows you to try out new ideas and concepts that might seem ridiculous. I know how frustrating it is to have an idea and not be able to write it, so it's no wonder people end up writing fics that only have a very slight resemblance to the original series.
