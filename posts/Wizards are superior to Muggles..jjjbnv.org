Muggles certainly aren't useless, and what they have done without magic is impressive.

But compared to wizards? Next to useless. Voldemort alone with fiendfyre could kill hundreds of thousands of Muggles a day for sure. All of them working together would destroy us easily.

Technology is impressive, but compared to magic it is nothing. Magic's mere presence is enough to make it malfunction, in high concentrations but still.

I know we want to believe we could fight wizards if it came to it but please stop going on and on about how superior technology is compared to magic. It just can't compare.


** There'll never be a war though.

Wizards literally rearrange muggle leaders' phone calls at a whim, put portraits in their offices that can surveil them, tell them what to do, and only give them cursory information about wizarding events without allowing for any input from muggle leaders, and place employees into their offices at will. Wizards literally rule the muggles by proxy; they just don't want to do the day to day.

In Goblet of Fire when Fake!Moody suggests the goblet was confounded, no one contradicted him. Implying that everyone there believed it was at least possible.

And if you can confound non-human 'minds' like the goblet, then the confoundus charm mustn't require a human brain to work on. Which means it would probably work on computers.

More generally, unless the confundus charm is special, it suggests most spells that affect minds don't require the target actually have a brain or human thought patterns.

** I agree, you would have to be willfully contrarian to argue that muggles have even the tiniest chance against Wizardkind. Even if you ramp up the effectiveness of the ICW to an absurd extreme, claiming they ward off Muggle military bases, have sleeper agents meant to watch out for magical anomalies, scour the planet's media for leaks regarding magics, have mass obliviation capabilities...

The reality is that the level of logistics needed to fully secure the Muggle world against even one, rogue wizard is impossible to reach. Simply apparating on ships carrying oil and sinking them would destroy the Muggle world. And the more muggle technology advances, the easier it will be for wizards to subdue them, not harder like some claim.

And as for wizards being literally superior to muggles... I reckon that depends? If you go for a soft fantasy where they are just 'people that can use magic', then I would say no. But if you go any more in depth and go on about genetics and wizards being a new sub-species of Hominid... then yeah. I know it's not a pc thing to say even in fiction, but a demigod isn't equal to some regular, frail homo sapiens.

** There been literal essays of discussion about this on this sub alone, takeaway is that wizards cant take on muggles in the same way Russia cant take on the US. Nukes exist and can decimate entire continents from nearly a mile up in the air. And fiendfyre can decimates towns and the such pretty easily. Muggle technology can be messed up by magic but most wizards cant even cast a shield charm let alone fiend fyre. In summary, if wizards were competent they could easily take on the muggles, but the ministry in power while harry was growing up would be destroyed. An important reminder that dumbledore and Voldemort are considered abnormally strong, most wizard literally couldn't dream of even lifting the water that Dumbledore could manipulate with the elder wand.

*** Goyle wasn't particularly powerful, or even competent for that matter, and could cast Fiendfyre, he would even had survived if he had a portkey or if he could apparate away before the fire got to close, assuming that every aurors know how to cast it (come on, they are the ministry's main fighting force and a seventeen years old dunderhead managed it on what is assumed his first try) they can do a big amount of damage, though it was never said if it could have any permanent effect on the place it is cast.

Botton line it comes back to if magicals can negate the aftermath (since we know muggles can't) of both whatever are the aftereffects of this kind of spells on the surroundings and the nuclear fallout, not only survive, but be able to live in the resulting world.

Were led to believe that aurors are a small group, definetly not going over a hundred, and yes they are the best the wizarding world has to offer, most employees can barely cast most of the stuff they were taught in school. And also what makes you think magical could negate the after math, Dumbledore struggles to lift some water I highly doubt however many survivors that could remain could rebuild everything, especially since theyd be doing it on radioactive ground, and considering that Arthur, the muggle interested person, cant pronounce electricity, I think their a fair ways off from understanding why their children are being born with a random number of parts.

***** Yeah, Dumbledore had some problems containing a highly powerful magical capable of wandless magic since his childhood inside a big sphere of fast-moving water (don't wanna hey into the physics, but trust me when I say that at a certain amount or depth water can carry an enormous amount of force), give the guy a break, he was dueling with the most powerful dark wizard of the age for some time at this point after participating of a rescue mission (potentially having interrupted him in the middle of some other thing) where he infiltrated the ministry and promptly crumb-stomped all DE around, heliterally reconstructed a house soon after with barely any effort while cursed and incinerated an army of inferi underwater using fire (normal fire doesn't work underwater, the thing would have to be ridiculously hot to instantly boil the surrounding water into gases it could use as combustible) after being heavily tortured while the curse was at it's worse.

Hermione theorized that Crabbe had only seen his parents casting it before, by her account (which is pretty much JKR's) that was the first time he was actually casting it, the rest was learning the unforgivables and some miscellaneous bits of dark arts (blood-boiling, bone-breaking).

The Aurors are arguably the best the ministry can raise, however the order and Voldemort both raised enough as to have armies at the end (even after the probable genocides organized by Voldemort during an entire year), the actual amount of battle-able fighters just in Britain is definitely higher than the number of Auror, even more so if the gloves come off and Dark magicals are counted too.

The quote I suppose you are using to base your assumptions about the Auror's general competence level is the one about the hats? Cause those weren't just for the Auror Department (which could use it as a safety measure in case someone curses them in the back or when unaware), but also for the paper-pusher core of the ministry. And even this points to a greater fighting ability of magicals, if those shields can protect against bullets than most long-range muggle weapons just became useless /even/ when the magical is caught unaware.

They can literally time-travel, teleport, repare almost anything, manipulate souls, expand space, create living creatures... really, their powers are all over the place, no reason to not think they could revert the fallout. At it's core the fallout are the radioactive remains of the bomb being too small to see and getting into everywhere, it could be either transfigurated or outright vanished, while the exposition to the ionizing radiation could cause problems magicals are said to be resilient and able to overwrite harm caused by muggle-means, potentially they could just spell or transfigurate it away. Honestly, the nuclear winter resulting from the high amount of smoke sent into the stratosphere blocking sunlight would be more harmful to humanity as a whole since it would kill off the overwhelming majority of the plants and animals fit for human consumption, and even this wouldn't affect them to the same degree because of the Lumos Solen spell.

They can teleport as long as they sont accidently kill themselves while doing it from being distracted.

The animals they can make ar elike barnyard animals and the like.A cleanup job using a vanishing spell would mean a nations worth of crust having to be disappeared, and again that's thinking they understand radiation to beging with. Its literally stated crabbe was taught the spell from the carrows.

******* About the average magical's ability to repare... I highly recommend the Fantastic Beasts movie, the second was pretty WTF and fabricated conflict at times and the ending is something that got most of the fans scratching their heads, but the first is a masterpiece that among other things give us a better understanding of an adult magical's true ability without being seen/judged by the lens of a child's perspective. Plus, Ron was able to knock the troll out by levitating it's cub and beating it with it, levitation is a no-brainer for most magicals, the ministry's entire communications ability is literally based on animating flying airplanes, the average skill of a magical is much higher than you give then credit.

The point I was trying to make is that it wasn't that levitating water was difficult for Dumbledore, what he found difficult was using that water as a prison for Voldemort that was at least close to his level in power and skill and had already shown himself capable of wandless magic before Hogwarts, we have to take the context in mind to understand just how difficult it would be.

Can't really remember anyone even having the opportunity of saying that the spell was taught by the Carrows, what I remember was Hermione speculating just after they escape the room that Crabbe must have never used the spell before, only seen his parents using it, she was commenting that she knew about it's capacity of destroying Horcruxes, but thought it too dangerous to try for fear of losing control. Plus, supposing you are right then we would instead have /at least/ an entire year knowing how to cast the spell just after of Hogwarts, the overwhelming majority leagues more competent than Crabbe (admittedly, while it wouldn't be /impossible/ for the Carrows to have chosen only him to teach the spell I personally can't think of any reason for them to do so), which is still enough to wipe out many cities, particularly so since the concept of a magical having a limited amount of magic with which to cast spells is purely fandom.

JK hasnt specified how it works beyond that so that's all we got to go off of. Also what the kost impressive thing we saw in the Fantastic beast movies, we saw a bunch of wizards working together could prepare small scale damage but beyond that I dotn rmeber that much being impressive beyond maybe credence fight with the fake auror type guy.

********* I guess we just disagree in our interpretation of the amount of damage done to NY, to me it seemed like Credence had caused a frankly enormous amount of damage to the city and a few Aurors were able to casually fix everything up without any significant effort, with a single Auror managing to fix an entire building by him/herself and this were average aurors, not even Mad-eye/Kingsley level, so not even close to Dumbledore's.

About levitation... to be fair we never really had a character be put in a situation where lifting something as/more heavy was the logical path, and Dumbledore's use of water is really not a good comparison point since he was also trying to trap Voldemort at the same time, making it potentially infinitely more difficult a task.

Yeah, Crabbe was show to be somewhat talented with the Dark Arts, but so did many other characters, including Draco, Goyle, all Slytherins in their year, Snape, all the Death Eaters, many of the order members, many of the aurors, Umbridge (an overglorified paper-pusher) and even Harry (he got the cruciatus on his second try and the imperius on his first), of all of those I would put Crabbe around Umbridge's level (so at the very bottom), if we take in context that this was around 50/60% of the total amount of characters in the series and that Dumbledore himself admitted being able to use the DA if he wanted to then we have a /very/ large pool of people -comparatively to the total population- able to use Fiendfyre of the rest of the wizarding world follows the same pattern/rule.

** I'll say it first, I completely believe that Wizards are superior to Muggles. As far as I'm concerned, the only difference between Muggles and Wizards is that Wizards have Magic. If one side is exactly the same than the other one, /except/ they have something more, they are automatically superior. Should he wishes to do so, any wizard can learn science, or how to use a gun, but no Muggle will either be able to use even the simplest spell. It doesn't mean that the Muggle are useless, or that all the wizards are superior to Muggles (despite the lack of magic, a genius muggle would still be superior to an idiot wizard), but one side has an advantage.

Now, because of this belief, I'm not a big fan of Mugglewank fics. I find the idea that the Muggles could either be able to wage war against the wizards (and even win) stupid. That being said, I noticed in the (admitelly few) fics I have read with this prompt, that authors are always forced to "help" the Muggle. Every time, either the wizards are nerfed to Hell (tired after 3 spells and paper thin Shield Charm), or Muggleborns are with the Muggles (making it a Wizard Vs Wizard fight in my opinion), when it's not both.

Also, outside of some very specific things (such as the computer, which was relatively new by the time of canon), most items used to justify the superiority of Muggle have a magical equivalent that is just as good when not better.

** There's a couple of things that I feel should be noted about this scenario.

One, just because /some/ wizards are capable of certain magical feats, doesn't mean /all/ wizards can actually perform them. Yes, Voldemort and Dumbledore are monsters when it comes to magical power, but the average British wizard is nowhere near them in terms of ability. One example: when Fred and George came up with Shield Hats, the Ministry bought 500 of them, because an average Ministry employee is apparently /incapable of casting a school-level charm/ (y'know, the kind that Snape taught to cast silently in the 6th year).

Remember: thanks to the Statute of Secrecy, your average witch or wizard is likely to be a shop clerk or a civil servant that happens to know some magic, not a trained battle mage or something like that.

Two, if we're talking about a full on wizards vs. muggles war, I don't think that every wizard is just going to go and fight muggles on Ministry's (or Voldemort's) orders. Remember that most wizards have at least some muggle relatives - purebloods are most likely a minority. In particular, I think that many Muggleborns would have very good reasons to side with the Muggles rather than the Wizarding world that discriminates against them.

That's not to mention all the magical races, from Goblins to Werewolves, that the Magical world /also/ discriminates against (remember that lovely statue in MoM?) At least some of them would definitely get the bright idea of offering their knowledge and service to the Muggles in exchange for some concessions later on.

** I think the problem is a lot of people seem to invision a Muggle-Wizard war as both sides facing each other across a battlefield. In that situation Muggles would stand a decent chance - maybe even have the advantage.

But that's just not how Wizards would fight Muggles.

They'd infiltrate the offices/homes of world leaders and Imperius them. These leaders would then order a ceasefire and 'negotiate' with the wizards. Any muggles who try to continue fighting would then be branded criminals and have to deal with the muggle authorities. The whole 'war' wouldn't last a day.

But what if a sizeable chunk of Muggles rebel against their own authorities? Well the same Wizard strategy is great for breeding discord amongst groups. Throw in a few false-flag attacks on key Muggle infrastructure and they'll be so busy trying to survive and fight amongst themselves that they'd not be able to organise an attack on Wizards.

Worst case scenario for Muggles: I'm sure that wizards in USA/USSR must have investigated magical techniques in case of nuclear war. If wizards are sufficiently confident in their ability to survive a nuclear war, it would be fairly trivial for them to instigate one. Then sit back and watch the fireworks.

    - On that topic, not even a single magical country was able to stand together against Voldemort--perhaps the greatest threat to their existence. It all came down to some fucking kids with some riddles given to them by Merlin 2.0.

    - Merlin 2.0, or Dumbledore, effectively killed himself by being careless.

For one muggles have the advantage of numbers. If the top nations of the world dedicated their technology to undermining wizards, they would probably succeed. They have more people to throw at the problem. Wizards on the other hand have a very limited amount of people to commit to taking down muggles.

edit: To add to this point, the top nations would probably collaborate on the issue while wizard countries have shown they are isolationists. British wizards trying to globally dominate muggles would fail unless other wizards were on board. Whereas muggle nations could more easily pool resources.

** Wizards vs muggles can't realistically happen. It'd be some wizards vs other wizards and also muggles.

Muggles would have a few pretty useful things in a wizard war. Information technology would be a big one that wizards are far behind. Also muggle weapons tend to be very fast compared to spells. A big bomb could kill an entire army of wizards if they were taken by surprise and couldn't cast shields fast enough.

But wizards could easily collapse muggle society if they wanted. If other wizards helped the muggles then it wouldn't be complete collapse, but there's way more important targets that evil wizards could destroy than what the good wizards could reasonably protect.

Wizards working with muggles could probably fight a larger faction of just wizards. But muggle society would definitely take a massive hit if secrecy ignoring war broke out.

Number of wizards is just too small compared to muggles' whose population is in billions.

Also you have to see that average wizard population is not a fighter or know a lot of magic. Most of them are shopkeepers, clerks etc in diagon alley and ministry or something. There is no drive in the community and wizarding world is stagnant.

They even refuse to say a Dark Wizard's name several years after he is dead and are willing to believe that a child defeated him. Sheeps following Daily prophet.

Whereas muggles have competitive society and have trained armies with guns. After surprised by attacks of wizards they can bury them with numbers alone. After a while they might even be able to sniff out wizards using malfunctioning of technology.

Wizards have such superiority complex that they disdain even understanding proper clothing. Even Arthur who likes muggles does not understand all the muggle devices.

I realise wizards are fictional, but it's still a bad argument and kind of prejudiced to say "Wizards are superior" just because they're more powerful. Wizards and muggles are equal, but wizards have a superior weapon if there's a fight.

Also, while in general of course magic would always win against technology, you should also factor in stress, imagination, poor skill... I think even a stressed or panicking wizard/witch could do a lot of harm to muggles, but if they're not great at magic, they might get picked off individually.

But yes, overall if there was somehow a war or battle between the two, wizards would definitely win.

** There's so many ways to take this discussion, however just answer one question "if wizards could just overwhelm muggles then why did they create the Statute of Secrecy and hide the magical world due to the witch hunts (where muggles primarily had swords, bows etc)?"

While a single wizard could be destructive remember the governments know that the wizarding world exists. So if the wizards attack the muggles could retaliate and quite frankly the wizards can't accept the same level of casualties due to their small population. Plus it's doubtful that all the wizards would fight on one side.

And most witches and wizards aren't that capable of fighting. Hell half a dozen deatheaters stomp over 100's of witches and wizards (eg Quidditch World cup attack). When they should have been "vaporized" when all the witches/wizards they were attacking all fire the strongest curses at the deatheaters. I doubt Malfoy's shield could withstand 50 cutting curses hitting at the same time.

But the debate between "Wizards Rule, Muggles Suck" or "Muggles Rule, Wizards Suck" when it comes to a full blown war will never be settled. Quite frankly I believe that neither side would win and that the survivors (if any) would not have a pleasant world to "live in".

*********** I personally think that it's not so much that most adults are incapable of using the charm at all, but that after not needing to for most of their lives they would have to try remembering how to cast it, which while fine in a no-stress situation would be really bad if they were attacked.

Sirius didn't receive a trial, but everyone ‘knew' he had sold out Harry's parents, so if they are half as interested in gossip as we are then someone would probably dig to find out exactly /how/ Sirius betrayed the Potters, which would probably end in the newspapers eventually.

Again, the power/skill level thing is really left unclear by JKR, Hermione was brewing a supposed NEWT-level potion at 12/13 and the space expansion charm she used was implied to be beyond even that, Draco spent most of his sixth year fixing a powerful and supposedly rare magical item while somewhat keeping his grades in the green and trying to murder Dumbledore, Crabbe of all people managed to cast a spell which even Hermione (who has a historical of not caring overmuch about how dangerous something is) wasn't willing to try even if it would help in winning the war (yeah, he didn't have the whatever it is necessary to control it -as far as we know he may just have overextended his wand while casting and this made control impossible- but he still cast a spell capable of destroying entire cities), Harry's patronus charm drove off a hundred of dementors and he held his own with the priory incantatem effect, but still none of them seemed to be something extraordinary in all areas or even in their own specialties (eg. Harry's troubles with non-verbal casting) while Voldemort was said to be the most powerful dark wizard of the century and only used basically one spell in combat with anyone other than Dumbledore and in absolutely no moment did any character have problems for using too much magic or having to little, they either had magic and were thus able to use magic with no restrictions or they didn't and were muggles (with squib being more a society stigma rather than another type of magical). In the end the whole definition of power in JKR's magical system makes no sense, so it is completely possible that anyone at all could cast it successfully by following instructions (like a little kid can make a cake by following the receipt to the letter even without knowing what each ingredient is for or even the end result) something that is supported by the fact that Harry was able to cast sectumsempra with only the bare minimum of the instructions.

************ That's fair. I honestly dont think I could scale most of the wizards in HP, we dont even know what limits a wizard after like 7 book and 10 movies. Were not even sure if magic actually exhaust people or not. So yeah bot alot of questions can actually be answered in terms of that
