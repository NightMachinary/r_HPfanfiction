I just finished G.Norman Lipperts James Potter novels. I found it quite good even and was wondering if there were similar fanfics out there that were similar. I m sorta new to this stuff as I hadnt picked up Harry Potter in years before checking out these newer books. Next-gen fic which is well written would be greatly appreciated even if this subreddit is more HP era focused. THanks

Hogwarts Houses Divided is probably the best Next-Gen story I've read.

#+begin_quote
  The war is over, and all is well, they say, but the wounds remain unhealed. Bitterness divides the Houses of Hogwarts. Can the first children born since the war's end begin a new era, or will the enmities of their parents be their permanent legacy?

*** I'll go one step further and say that Hogwarts Houses Divided is not only the best next-gen fic out there, but one of the best fanfics, period. :)

  A mysterious illness leaving a mere handful of uninfected. A school in quarantine, isolated from the outside world. Danger on all sides, striking seemingly at random. And, at the heart of it all, Scorpius Malfoy, the only man to believe this is a part of a wider, dangerous plot. Part 1 of the Stygian Trilogy.

Albus Potter and the Foulest Book is probably my favorite. The plots are interesting and original. The characters feel like they could be their parents' children. They aren't little clones running around, but really do feel like what kids being raised by Harry and Ginny would be like. The one thing that drove me nuts was that there are grammatical issues throughout. That would usually put me off a fic entirely, but everything else was so damn good I couldn't stop reading.
