I'm going to be off-internet for who knows how longs, so I want to stockpile long fanfics that I can then press â€˜Entire Work' on, so I don't have to have internet on. Please help.


** If you're going offline, it's probably safer to download the work as epub or pdf) instead of leaving it open to show the entire work in your browser. You won't be able to load the page when your browser inevitably reloads after some time.

** Seconding the comment that it's better to download. I always download AO3 fics in Epub and then just read them in Google Play Books (ofc there are many other apps to read ebooks as well).
