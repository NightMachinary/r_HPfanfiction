I was just thinking about the days when the shopping scenes would be so drawn out and detailed. Harry would go get glasses/clothes and an EXPANDING TRUNK!!1!!! But the shopkeeper would list every option ever. It was fun at first but eventually the obligatory shopping scene in fic usually ended up as a pragraph or two instead.

I'm not sure if it's because that style isn't as popular now, or if I've just matured in what I'm reading. Any thoughts?

Also do you have a fave shopping scene?


** Early on, those shopping scenes or inheritance reading does seem fresh. Except for rare moments, the canon is really sparse on detail. It's like a kid reading trivia on random planet statistics. After a dozen or so of "oh Harry got this super cool/expensive thing", it becomes tedious. So what if he got an auto-drying/magic-detecting glasses but the story never uses them?

I'm not sure if the style isn't as popular, or now I simply stop reading after the first chapter for fics that have such scene. I don't think I have a favorite shopping scene, the earliest ones do make me "ooh, indeed, an auto-adjusting robe!", later on, I always skipped them because they feel like padding.

** I'm not opposed to a fun shopping trip. There's a reason why the indy!Harry expanded trunk shopping trip became popular in the first place, after all: it's a great opportunity to explore and expand wizarding daily life by depicting consumer goods, shops, professions, the hustle and bustle of daily life, etc. And just a good way to depict the aesthetic of wizarding society.

The problem with all those indy!Harry shopping trips is that they're all the same. There's nothing new there, and none of them capture that essential charm of Diagon Alley that you first feel when you read PS. In those fics, Diagon Alley isn't a living place, it's simply a vending machine to serve the function of giving Harry a ton of cool stuff that he will never use.

The depiction of Knockturn Alley in Out of the Night is the complete opposite of this, and I love it.

** Harry and Ron time traveled together and went thrift shopping in Nocturn Alley. Ran into the Death Eater that killed Hermione. Brutally murdered him and used his hair to walk around freely continuing the shopping trip.

** If the magic item becomes plot relevant later on, it makes sense to describe it in detail. For example if Harry has to hide inside a hidden compartment to avoid getting found by Sirius who just broke into Hogwarts.
