Hello, I've been lurking on this subreddit for a few days, but made an account at last so I could try my luck finding a fic. I suspect it has been deleted by its author on ffnet, and the thought absolutely breaks my heart, but I wanted to give this a shot in case there's any hope.

So what I remember: 1. Set immediately after HBP and opens with Draco Malfoy running for his life and 2. Collapsing on the doorstep of the Burrow holding the cup of Hufflepuff (!) and found by none other than Harry Potter 3. Ginny, being a gifted healer, tending to his injuries 4. Draco eventually taken in by the Order, sharing a lot of insights about the secrets of 12 Grimmauld Place 5. An epilogue including the names Briseis and Caellum (or some variation of that spelling)

Even just knowing the name and author of this amazing epic would do a lot to give me peace, it's been driving me mad for a few years now - thank you!
