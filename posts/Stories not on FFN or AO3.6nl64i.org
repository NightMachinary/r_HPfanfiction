I feel like I've read (or at least tried) most of the top/frequent recs form FFN and AO3. What are some good stories that aren't featured on those 2 sites? Guidelines: no slash, and no large age gaps in pairings (as in no Hermione/Snape without time travel involved, etc). Beyond that, hit me with your best stuff. Please and thank you.


** This has been listed a few times here, but it's still a reasonably good story. If I recall correctly this is set just after the war with a few years past so that should make him between 19 to 22ish. Gabrielle is 16 thou. It's also a Student/Teacher which is a no no for some people.

Premise of the story is that Harry is suffering from PTSD because of the war. He also had a major accident in a quidditch worldcup match and wont be able to play for awhile while he heals up so he cant actively play or practice really hard for about a year.

Friends & the Delacour family conspire to get him to accept a job at the french school as a flying instructor to get him out of the house and to help with the small issue when a veela/soul/bond was formed years ago at the Tri Wizards cup between him and Gabrielle when he saved her.

When she reaches the age 17 or something it might drive her mad if he doesn't accept the bond. So this gives Gabrielle a year to get him to fall in love with him naturally since she doesn't want him to accept it out of duty.

Granted I might have a few facts wrong, been awhile since I read it, but I remembered it to be surprisingly good, if you can look over the age and teacher/student relationship stuff... =D

And I have another one for you, its a Harry goes to Azkaban unfairly trope. I finished reading it too since its fairly short, I'd say its fairly average with lots of bashing. It's not badly written, but it doesn't have any "standing out" moments for me. Give it a go, you might like it.

** You have got to check out [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/forums/creative-writing.18/][Spacebattles]] and [[https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/categories/creative-forums.1/][Sufficient Velocity]] There are lots of great HP stories on these two sites that authors can't be bothered to put up on fanfic.

One thing that bugs me about these sites is that it's hard to search for fics in a particular genre/established universe because there are no filters for that, so I usually just skim through a bit and see the titles the posters put up to find out what stories are being written. But it's worth it for the many fics I wouldn't have found otherwise.

** Full Pensieve's two fanfics---the completed [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/Making_The_Last_Move/][The Last Horcrux]] and the incomplete but very long [[https://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Years_of_Rebellion/Through_The_Looking_Glass/][Harry Potter and the Years of Rebellion]]---are well worth reading, with some of the best characterization in fanfiction. (Years of Rebellion in particular feels like the best [and among the earliest] of the Indy-Harry fics that dominated the fandom post-OotP.)

[[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7149][Three Seasons to Closure]] is a nice Portkey romance that never made it to the major archives.

Mirror on fictionhunt.com. It's incomplete. Amazing story, but I don't recommend reading it as the end has a soul-crushing cliffhanger that I couldn't get out of my mind for days.
