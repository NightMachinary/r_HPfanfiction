#+begin_quote
  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!

  AU First Year onward: Harry's relatives were shocked when the Hogwarts letters came. Not because Harry got into Hogwarts. They had expected that. But Dudley, on the other hand...That had been a surprise. Currently in 5th year. *Reviews contain SPOILERS!*

  Lily and James Potter come out of hiding so their son Alexander could fulfill the prophesy and defeat Voldemort. Things don't go as planned though, as they returned to the Wizarding World in 1999.

  Does nurture beat nature? Can a wizard become a necromancer? Can a muggleborn become a Paladin? Harry and Dudley are about to find out. Warning card games, war, and adult content later. Read only if you are over 18 . Good Dursleys This story isn't dead but i'm not going to work on it for a while.
