Does anyone know a fic where harry is dark and evil but he pretends he isn't? Like he is really manipulative about it. Maybe a fic where Hermione isn't annoying??

I've read Xerosis, Dabbling in the dark, descent into darkness. It doesn't have to be tomarry but please only slash or gen.

Thank you ðŸ˜Š

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years

  Major AU! SLASH LV/HP: Though he was raised without the expectation of saving the world, Harry still possesses a savior complex. Only, it's so dark and twistedly immoral, he created an alter ego to practice vigilantism. His second identity makes a name for himself and immediately ensnares Minister Riddle's complete and obsessive attention. A game of cat and mouse begins and morals are questioned.

  HP/LV Harry grows up relying on only himself until his adoption, when he is taught the manners and politics of high pureblood circles. Masking his dark intelligence at Hogwarts & intending to escape notice, past secrets and Dark Lords force his hidden hand.
