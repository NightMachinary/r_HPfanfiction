So I was reading a fic the other day and there was a part where Hermione could read Harry's mind whenever she wanted. And this really threw me of. So I want to ask you guys what are the things that writers do to their main characters that make your blood boil? For example for me is when the protagonist loses control over his/her body completely or suffer some kind of other mind control like love potions, or even this small thing where the character can't block out other people from reading his/her thoughts. Interestingly the other way around it's completely fine for me, at least the mind reading part. Anyway, what do you guys think?


** My blood boil? Probably if they make life too easy for the protagonist. I always feel like I wasted my time reading the fic when the hero just stumbles from one success into the next. Powerful!Harry fics are especially often infected by this.

I actually enjoy the things you list, if done right. But lets see if I can imagine something I wouldn't want a protagonist to suffer through (given that it serves the story).

...

Nah. Beat him, control him, torture him, kill him... Protagonists are somewhat supposed to suffer great pain in order to achieve great deeds.

**** Especially when the antagonist is highly intelligent too, not to mention the people around the protagonist.

I mean, lets be real here. Dumbledore, however stupid his plan in canon was, is highly intelligent. 15 year old prodigy Harry is not going to outsmart him constantly. Same goes with Voldemort. Say about him what you want but he is on a level with Dumbledore.

Same goes with people like Scrimgeour, Bones, the administration of Minister Fudge, the Wizengamot members,... those are all at least capable of complex thought processes. Harry is not going to outsmart them the way he does in so many fanfics, completely ignoring in this argument that authors often come up with a fairytale of politics.

** I once read a fanfic where Harry had been burnt alive, paralysed from the waist down, and blinded, all before reaching Hogwarts. As backstory. (I think It Got Worse.)

For me personally, any kind of body horror. Teeth getting transfigured into wriggling maggots tethered to your jaw? ugh. Arms being changed into slimy, slithering tentacles which ooze weird, smelly fluids?

Of course, because this is the worst thing for me, it is also my favourite thing.

** Take a main character, usually Harry, Draco or Hermione depending on your gender and fantasy, but I've seen others. Hollow them out to an empty shell of their canon self and then stuff yourself in them to play out whatever power or romantic fantasy you have to unrealistic levels. Then deny it and get super upset when people point it out.

** When people pair Harry with Snape/Voldemort/Draco.

Don't get me wrong I'm not against homosexuality, if someone has a slash pairing I just won't read it, but those three pairings are disgusting to me.

I could see a Harry/Neville or a Harry/Ron working but he hates the other three.

Pairing them together IMO is evil, why the f*ck would I want to fall in love with the man who killed my parents and annually tries to kill me. Snape and Draco both hate Harry for different reasons but they still hate him.

Snape may have loved Lily but that doesn't mean he would love Harry nevermind that the relationship is paedophilia.

Draco and Harry just no. Seriously the only people who could actually think that could work are teenage girls.

I'm sorry for the rant but once I got going I couldn't stop.

Please don't kill me slash lovers. And OP sorry if this isn't what you wanted.

*** This isn't exactly what I asked, but agree with you regardless. Disregarding the fact that slash is a instant bye for me, pairing cannon Harry with anyone completely evil is really hard. It's an other thing if the author actually takes his/her time to develop Harry so that their relationship is believable. Anyway, can't really comment on this because, as I said, I don't really read any slash fics :) What I asked for are more like story elements that, while make a good plot device, you still hate the author who puts your favorite character thorugh it :D

***** hmm interesting opinion, but yeah it's only your personal opinion. I find it quite interesting when the main character's motivation comes from something strong like the death of a loved one. Perhaps you should read more literature, may I suggest "willy wonka and the chocolate factory" by Roald Dahl. Quite inspiration, and the main character Charlie, isn't motivated by any character death.

**** I personally dislike slash because of the lack of good writing I have experienced. I can not name a good Slash fic that focuses on plot and not the fact that they (the main characters) are in a relationship. If it was done following the idea that "oh, this is the plot, this is what happens, and by the way, Harry and Draco have a relationship." Instead of it being OH Harry and Draco have a relationship, the world stops spinning, people are only going to kill/attack/plot because of this. That in my personal opinion is the problem with Slash.(And all fanfictions with Pairings) THAT being said, I do like the thought of Harry/Voldie and Harry betrays him which ends up killing him... hmm...

Most of the time, they always move way too soon. I personally never read any Action/Adventure fics mixed in with a significant romantic pairing because of this. If I ever do read those, I always back out if there's a whiff of anything remotely close to what you and I just said.

*** Pedophilia is prepuberty; I'm not one for age gap relationships unless the younger partner is of age and even then it depends on how the character is written in terms of maturity. I get the rest of what you're saying though, the only time I've seen Snape/Harry work was an adult Harry way post war, and the Draco/Harry fics that seem to work are so AU that Draco is essentially no longer the same character. Same original background, sure, but it's diverged big time.

That said, I'm yet to see a fic well-written enough to make Voldemort someone Harry would be willing to get jiggy with.

Also, this may be the fic where Hermione can read Harry's mind. If so, I actually liked it, the author provided a good reason for why it was so. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10807718/1/The-Hogwarts-Strike-Team]]

** One thing I really hate to see is the pov character losing their memory or being Obliviated.

It's infuriating. Basically, the author has just told me what the ending is going to be /then/ made sure my reader avatar doesn't know. So I have to watch them stumble around blindly for however many chapters in the name of 'drama' and 'tension' while I'm sitting back grinding my teeth over how stupid it is that /I/ know more than the character that is supposed to be my eyes and ears in the world.

Obliviation can be done well, but if it is the pov character being Obliviated I'm adamant that the reader shouldn't know /what/ was obliviated until the character remembers. That adds good tension, especially if you add a bit of foreshadowing to suggest that something's not quite right.

Similarly having the main character left helpless before an Imperius Curse or control potion of some kind. A brief stint is fine to show the stakes of the battle but having them completely subverted for ages is just bleak and I have no interest in watching it unfold.

** There was a fic that has since been taken down called Sanitarium.

In it, Hermione had lost her focus and ingenuity partway through the war against Voldemort. Later it was revealed that she was blackmailed by Theodore Nott to extract the bulk of her classtime memories for him to absorb, thereby making him the smartest wizard of his generation. With the bulk of her knowledge inaccessible, Hermione turned to drugs to cope.

The reveal for that brought me to tears (of course I was sick with stomach flu so my emotions may have been easier to provoke).

I cried again when the trio finally caught up with Nott and made him give back the memories... and took his own as well. Harrowing stuff.

I can handle most challenges, even extreme ones, sent the protagonist's way provided they're integral to the story and not just there for shock value. More annoying for me is when the character is handed a full-on personality transplant for no reason: Hermione with the idiot ball, Ron the Death Eater, craven or overly emo Harry, evil Dumbledore, etc.

** ** Character Bashing.
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: character-bashing.
   :END:
I don't like certain characters, and I can understand if a fanfiction author wishes to portray a character in a certain fashion because they don't like them, but when we are /told/ rather than /shown/ why we should dislike a character, it ruins the immersion of the story. The further away a character behaves in the story than how it behaves in canon, the more time and effort needs to be put into displaying this change. However, many bashing authors simply have a favourite character say or think things that are down-putting to the character that the author dislikes, whether or not their actions warrant that. Some times, I click on a bashing fic hoping that there will be some sort of subversion to the trope; where the bashing does not follow the simple 'Word of God says to HATE THIS CHARACTER.' For example, if we see a Ron bashing fic, shown from the viewpoint of Hermione, we might see how Ron is a lazy neer-do-well. The typical Ron bashing fic might include Harmony; but all we're going to get is the author projecting his or her feelings onto Ron. Ron will descend from layabout to worse, contrasting with the relationship between Harry and Hermione. However, if there was a bashing fic where bashing was used as a story tool rather then a lens, it could work out very well. However, most authors who bash characters just cannot write well enough to do this.

--------------

Mischaracterization.

I suppose that this is the natural continuation of bashing; it's not as bad, and I might even be guilty of it myself, but it can be very annoying to read; when a character behaves in a manner that is completely alien to what we know the characters to be.

**** Dumbledore is one of the most polarizing characters in HP; this complexity of character is something that is very hard to recreate. I don't mind people getting angry at Dumbledore, but there is a problem when the author presents Dumbledore as uncaring or foolish; Dumbledore does borderline things in Canon, but he is genuinely motivated to help everyone. Presenting Dumbledore as a Gold-Hoarding, Goblin-Insulting, Harry-Oppressing dunderhead, completely wastes one of the most complex characters J.K. Rowling gave us.

I was rather liking the story until then and I actually tried to push through until it was fixed, but after several chapters of her being in magic school without any magic and no one noticing (how does that work?), I stopped reading out of frustration.

Your point of the protagonist losing control over her body makes for a good second place, I remember reading a story where Ron drugged Hermione with a love potion to make her see he's best for her and it ticked me off.
