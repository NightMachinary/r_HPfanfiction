  summary: Hermione gets ejected into an AU in which good people are bad and v.v. Torture, PTSD therapy, subterfuge, Dark and Evil Dumbledore; Light, Good and Manipulative Tom Riddle. Main characters: HG, DM, LM, BZ, PP, BL, TMR, ██. A little too much drama and therapy talks to not be boring, but overall good character designs, good writing style, not too many idiot balls.

A Light wizard resistance led by Tom Riddle and the Malfoys has been left to a nightmarish fate. Can Hermione, posing as her darker incarnation, help save a world more shattered than her own? HG/DM
