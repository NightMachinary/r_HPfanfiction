I think a curse called 'The Killing Curse' should have some serious side effects! Like, even if Harry survives it should leave some mark on his life other than an itty bitty horcrux that doesn't do much!

For example:

Imagine if the killing curse did work, but it doesn't kill the person, only skin, organs, and other stuff, leaving them a bag of bones or a walking skeleton. Basically, Harry Potter the skeleton.

Or like magic tends to be, a weird side effect that makes no sense, but also does at the same time! Like a spectral Harry, switching between corporeal and incorporeal at random moments.

But we could also have stuff that makes no sense at all! Like Harry just being totally invisible, invisible man style.

I've seen so much fanfic of the horcrux in his head doing something, but I wanna see more of the killing curse doing something instead.

Edit: I've decided to write a character analysis thing involving Hagrid, Harry and Death itself! It'll be a bit different from canon obviously but I think it'll work out! I'll post it on FanFiction.Net later!

*** True, but all the same, as we saw with the Diary, it could do way more than Harry's horcrux. I know it was weak, but as big and bad as horcrux's are made out to be it didn't have much impact on the story in my honest opinion. It might be different for you, but I still think the killing curse should have some sort of effect on a person, especially a baby.

** The problem with this is that it makes it impossible to have a story other than a small snippet

*** True, it would probably have to be heavily modified in order for it to work. Or it would have to involve horcrux stuff.

  AU: JKR portrays Harry as completely unaffected by trhe Killing Curse cast at him, but how would things have gone if it had been different? Drabble series, five drabbles per chapter.
