I was watching My Hero Academia, and the class system got me thinking:

What if Hogwarts worked in a similar fashion?

Instead of four houses, Hogwarts has four class ranks: S, A, B, and C. Students are placed into a ranked class. This would be based on their aptitude in many fields, not solely on their magical ability, so as not to make things too lopsided towards purebloods. Or, if you do, to emphasise and provide commentary on (pureblood) privilege. If students prove worthy (or the opposite), they can move into a different ranked class.

What do you think Hogwarts would be like? How would this have changed events? How would this change the fandom?


** I mean, it could work. Some schools in the UK do have Educational Streaming, where classes are divided by rank/skill. I think my secondary school had five levels of maths, for example.

I'm utterly baffled at it being 'S, A, B, and C' though. Why is S in there? I'm assuming it's a thing from the anime, but even so, it's quite an odd thing to go alongside 'A, B, C'.

I'm not sure who started it, and I'm not even sure it's a manga thing (you also see it a lot in light novels as an example), but that's probably a Japanese thing indeed. I don't think I ever saw it in something that was not either Japanese or greatly influenced by Japan. For them, rank S is at the top above A, B, C (and sometimes you can even see things like SS or SSS).

Now I'm a bit interested to know who started to rank thing like that, and also why he did it.

**** I don't know how accurate it is, but the internet tells me that it started with actual Japanese school grades, where S is basically their equivalent of "A+ with a gold star sticker." From there, it went into Japanese games, anime, and manga, and started trickling into the rest of the world.

  To help me out, I spoke to Matthew Hegstrom, who currently teaches in Tsu, the capital of Mie Prefecture in Japan. He was able to confirm to me firsthand that the S grade is used in post-secondary schooling, though when Matthew brought the concept up to his colleagues, they mentioned that they had “never thought about it” before. At least on some level, the S grade has been ingrained into Japanese culture --- or at least Japanese academia --- to the point where it's second nature[.]

  More importantly, however, Matthew told me that academia isn't the only place that the S grade is found. At live events, tickets are separated by price and quality into B seats, A seats, and S seats. It's used for cars as well, with the S rank going to the most expensive, high-quality vehicles. According to Matthew, “[...I]t's Japanese culture. They use these rankings for many things. It's very common. So, to say [the S-grade or S-rank] originates from school rankings is maybe only partially true, but definitely valid.”

In my case (I'm not sure how it worked before they changed the exam system) the set you were in corresponded roughly with which level exam you sat in 4th year, which is where my idea of Hogwarts using a naming technique corresponding to exams/grades.

** MHA classes are divided by occupational study, not explicitly skill. People in the business or support course are there because they signed up for those classes, though perhaps a few general studies students want to be in the hero course. It would make more sense to divide it into Auror/Hitwizard course, Ministry of Magic course, Healer course, and then some kind of business or craft course (enchanting, potion-making, etc).

**** No Class A and B were assigned pretty random. It's not a ranking system.

In MHA AB are hero courses C-E is general studies, F-H is support and I-K is managing classes. That's the only system that exists.

I've seen this mistake a few times (especially among American fans who aren't used to the alphabet class system). But the assumption that A is better than B is wrong. In some countries (where I live too) classes are just randomly assigned letters. It has little to nothing to do with skills or performance.

For example if you look at MHA's class 1A and 1B: 1A and 1B each have two recommended students, a girl and a boy each. Among the Top 10 of the Entrance exams, while more people got assigned to class 1A it's not a clean cut. I assume this is mostly, because Horikoshi didn't have all of class 1B developed yet. 4 out of 10 in the top 10 get assigned to class 1B.

Edit: and the reason Monoma is so excited to show off class 1A is not, because 1A is better per se. But beause 1A got a lot of outside attention. they have both the son of Endeavor and the single best ranking student in class. They were attacked in the USJ.

** It is an interesting idea, because you would have go explore what is taught more thoroughly.

My school had streamed classes in some subjects, mainly maths and languages so that the pacing could be more suitable for the students rather than have half the class bored and half left behind. The extension of this is that the 'top' classes would tend to do some extra extension material in class to keep things interesting and maybe lay some groundwork for those thinking of keeping on with the subject in later years. Putting this in Harry Potter you could have the higher classes spending a lesson or to messing about with more advanced spells/potions/runes which aren't on the exam syllabus. We can see in canon from Hermione that while some of the stuff that is only taught to later years can be done earlier if you have the time to spend on it.

This would involve more work for the teachers and a more proactive teaching environment that I get the impression of from canon.

** Personal opinion but I think that would make certain characters unbearable. Can you imagine Hermione if she had /more/ metrics on her intelligence? Or Draco if his house had a measurable quantifier on his standing? (I imagine he'd accuse everyone above him of cheating in some way and be unbelievably smug and condescending towards anyone ranked lower)

House pride was a pretty divisive force in canon. This, I think, would make it seem tame by comparison.

That's not to say it couldn't be interesting though!

In canon we had people fretting about their grades, as every student does at some point. High grades, however, aren't a finite resource. In theory, unless Hogwarts grades on a curve, /everyone/ could get an 'O' or whatever the highest mark is. This alternative setup, having classes divided by ranking, implies that each class has a finite amount of spots. That means that people of the same age would be in direct competition with each other for a spot in a better class and the opportunities it provides.

It creates a setup for vicious academic competition and all the nastiness that implies. After all, you may not need to outperform someone if they find themselves... /indisposed.../ at a critical time.

It could work in a setting where you want to focus on the academic (magical) side of things and the competition between students (the phrase "survival of the fittest" comes to mind).

** I mean, this is how my British secondary school worked. I think it started off in year 7 (first year) as just Maths and Science by set by ability, the rest were by tutor group (essentially houses, but more boring), and then in Year 8 English was done by ability as well. We just called them sets 1 to 4 I think, with 1 being the smart kids. I think the problem with Hogwarts is there just aren't enough kids to justify it, or teachers to implement it. Firstly I think even if you put the entirety of Harry's year (like, 40 kids?) in one class in would only be slightly larger than one of the middle sets at my secondary school, and secondly all of the sets would have their lessons at the same time but with different teachers, and Hogwarts only appears to have one teacher per subject.

Put it this way - who do you expect will generally, initially do better? A muggleborn with 2 months of knowing that the WW exists, or a 10th generation wizard that's been tutored in magic for the last 6 years?

Then, setups like that usually assume that the best educational resources get given to the top class - which again would give them more of an advantage to hang on to the top rank.

Edit - also, the general plot with setups like this are to get the reader/viewer to associate with the underdog class as they try to beat the system that's biased against them, I think. Which would fit the privileged, bigoted purebloods at the top angle.

** The Class system in MHA is no ranking. It's just the alphabet to differentiate them, but has no ranking quality whatsoever.

But it would be interesting to consider :D First I guess we'd have to decide whether the sorting only cares for grades/class performance or whether they look a things like magical ability, basic intelligence etc...

Draco and Hermione would land in the same class. It's at least insinuated (in the second book by Lucius) that although Hermione is better than Draco in everything, he still does quite alright. Harry would probably also make this class cause of his potential and instinctss and stuff if that got considered, even if he's not the best student. If that's not considered, he and Ron might end up in A.... Ron is intelligent, and an okay student, thought he'S also not trying very hard... so I guess A or maybe even B would be alright for him

Neville would suck... The system I think would be detrimental for Neville. He's one who's performance - at least early on - was very dependent on how well he was supported. Moody (Crouch)/Lupin who treated him nicely pulled a lot out of him. Meanwhile Snape destroyed him... He also faces a good deal of external presssure by his grandma and family... So I fear this system would be very harsh for him...
