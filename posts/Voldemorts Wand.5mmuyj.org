Hey guys, I am looking for a fic where Harry takes or swaps his wand with Voldemorts.

Bonus points if he uses the wand too.

Thank you


** This is linked a lot but technically fulfills all three requests. That and I can't think of a single fic outside of this one that does any of the three.

  A trap during the Horcrux hunt sends Harry into a dimension where war has raged for 28 years. Harry must not only protect himself from Voldemort, but also from a rising new Dark Lord, the evil Ministry, a war-hardened Dumbledore... and himself... Will he find his way back home to finish his own war? Warnings within and please note that this is a very dark fic.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.
