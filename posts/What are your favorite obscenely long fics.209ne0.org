so I'm currently in story hoarding mode and I'm looking for basically anything as long as its very very long. I've been on a slytherin-y kick lately but I will read anything really. So if anyone has any suggestions I'm totally open.


** Saving Connor. The entire series is just shy of 3.1 million words. It's well worth reading, but it's pretty dark (it basically gets darker and darker at an alarming rate as the series progresses). I love dark fiction and long books, so I enjoyed it, but some people don't like this kind of stuff.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3735743/1/The-Moment-It-Began][The Moment It Began]] by Sindie. It's a Snape-centric timetravel story, based on a comment by JKR that if Snape could do things over he'd choose Lily.

It's Snarry...but it's quite tame compared to Maeglin's stuff although it still deals with some disturbing things. The whole series is soooo long though and you'll be glad how long it takes.

** At how many hundred thousand words does something hit "very very long"? Is it alright if it's properly a series of fics rather than a single one?

Edit: I've found using the list [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/10tgby/list_of_2500_top_completed_fics_by_favs_from/]] is substantially easier than using fanfiction.net's filter. Just sort length by descending and you have some truly massive fics. If you can cross reference an interesting looking fic with DLP or the TvTropes recs pages, that can help even more imo.

Super long (104 chapters), and not complete yet!

It's not really slytherin-y, but it is amazing! It's the Marauders' years at Hogwarts, third person Remus. The author is incredible at weaving canon, and her own meticulously constructed fanon together.

But I thought each year had a decent climax, and with the rise of voldemort, it gets more and more tense, I found. Slow burn for sure, and definitely not everyone's cup of tea!

****** I would tend to agree. But not with this fic. The boys all react differently, and all with remarkable insight into their characters and upbringing. But their acceptance isn't resolved in a single chapter. It's a suitably Big Deal.")

[[/s][Spoiler]]

Also, the author succeeds in building up the atmosphere of intolerance throughout the first 48 chapters. Remus' terror, his father's paranoia, and his mother's sorrow at the situation are particularly front and centre. But James makes some offhandedly bigoted comments, and Sirius, and Peter take part. Thoughtless kids, but not mean ones. Not irredeemable ones. And further, experiences Remus has at St. Mungo's emphasise the hostile attitude towards werewolves.

In my opinion, it's pretty nuanced, suitably tragic, appalling, and frustrating. The reveal is the climax, but the build up, and fall out are equally important.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6254783/1/Rise-of-the-Wizards][Rise of the Wizards]] is a fic that I just recently discovered and binged in the past week. It's essentially completed, with only an epilogue remaining, and instantly became one of my favorite stories. It has it's fair share of cliches early on (which the author owns up to) but once you preserve through those you're treated to one of the best characterizations of a dark(ish) Harry I've ever read.

** I tend to shy away from very long stories told as a single tale and not a series of self-contained stories; the former tend to lose their focus after a couple hundred thousand words and the pacing tends to be subpar. Most would have benefited from dividing into two or more separate tales.

The best series of self-contained stories nearing a million words is the Alexandra Quick series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/Inverarity][Inverarity]]. The series is about 900k words now, told in four self-contained (complete) volumes. Inverarity makes a habit of finishing stories before he begins posting, which lends them more polish than the average fanfiction tale.

Another possibly readable tale (if H/Hr is your thing) is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4098039/1/Harry-Potter-The-Fifth-Element][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]] by Bexis1. It runs about 1.2M words, though I've never made it even halfway through. While it's not my cup of cake, some like it.

** The longest fic I've ever read is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom][Prince of a Dark Kingdom]]. It's over 1.2 million words long. It's over a million words longer than about 98% of other fics. I find that insane. It can be a little difficult to get into, but after about chapter 5, I found it extremely entertaining. I'd say it's definitely worth a read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8615605/1/The-Never-ending-Road][The Never-ending Road]] is a character driven, female harry fic, which will eventually result in Snarriet. I've never been a huge fan of harry and snape being paired together, but this is almost 500,000 words and they aren't close to being together. It's a slow burn haha. That beside, the writing is good and I've really enjoyed it. It may be my favorite Harry Potter fanfiction. I would whole heartedly recommend it.

I'm finding [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1962685/1/A-Stranger-in-an-Unholy-Land][A Stranger in an Unholy Land]] to be a very enjoyable read. It's 470k words and complete. I'm only about 100k in so far, but I've enjoyed it and while it's not one of my favorites yet, I'd still recommend it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/A-Difference-in-the-Family-The-Snape-Chronicles][A Difference in the Family: The Snape Chronicles]] is a snape centric fic starting from his birth. It's over 600k words. I'm only about 75k into it, but I'd say the writing is good and it's overall an enjoyable read.

To sum this up, the first two I mentioned are among my favorites of all time, and the next two exceedingly long, but definitely worth a read, even though they aren't among my top 10.

I've read so much of this stuff that this isn't even that squicky or bad, I've seen and read way more disturbingly squicky things than I ever cared to. Maeglins stuff IS GRAPHIC AS ALL HELL though, but if you get passed a lot of her sex scenes you can see the truly beautiful way she writes. The plot is wonderful, moreso when/if you finally get to the sequel.

Like I said, I've read a lot of really bizarre things in my time as an HP slash shipper, and this story is nowhere near the top of the worst of my list.

I read a lot of NC-17 stuff, not necessarily just sexy things ha, but also things that have lots of gore/horror/mystery/suspense in it.

Just give it a chance if you can, it's extremely well written and while it def deals in some weird/bizarre things, I was hooked onto the storyline and how they were going to resolve what happens, not on the pron aspect itself.

After a certain point you'll run out of "normal" fics and have to search for something new. I've learned to not let the bizarre hinder the possibilities in great fanfiction.

Very little her stuff is on ff.net-I basically stopped reading anything from there forever ago; the site has gone downhill ever since they took the NC-17 fics off imo.

Back in 2003? Honestly, I see /way/ more NC-17 content on FFN than I used to 5+ years ago (before I took an extended break from reading fanfiction).

**** Sure :). Emperor assumes that the Potters, rather than just going into hiding under Dumbledore's protection, completely fled the wizarding world. There are several arcs, from Harry growing up, gaining power, and then working to increase and stabilize that power in the face of enemies/obstacles (which is where I am right now). I think the author does a great job of making every character realistic and relatable. Even the "enemies" are portrayed as very human and you get to see both good sides and bad sides of most of the main characters, Harry included.

Sorry if that wasn't exactly what you were looking for. I know it's not very specific, but I didn't want to spoil anything in case you read it. I can give more details if you want.
