I just started reading linkffn(10857933) and absolutely loved that he made a lightsaber, and is working on a blaster rifle. It got me curious- are there any fics that have Harry inventing things as a main focus of the story?

Over 70k+ words!


** linkffn(Harry the Hufflepuff by Bajab) has a Harry who invents things. With its two sequels, it's probably close to 70K.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.

  A childhood love, combined with magical experimentation, and a determination to see his project brought to life. This was all it took to change the world...forever. (A/N: Based on numerous reviews, 'suspension of belief' is evidently required to enjoy this story)
