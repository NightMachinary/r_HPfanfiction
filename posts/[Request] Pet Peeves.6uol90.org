No, not /those/ pet peeves! (Hello to the folks of [[/r/hppetpeeves]] who were all set to make fun of me, but no, not today.) I am talking about the lovable Poltergeist. Is there any story centering on him, possibly where he becomes an ally to the main character? It seems every time he's mentioned in a story, it's either background comic relief, or he's mentioned to have "helped them with [Insert Sidequest Here] in exchange of a box dungbombs" (seriously, how many times did that happen in a story?).


** Linkffn(Deaths True Hallows by Ensis96) He's not in every chapter, but he has a bigger role in this than in most stories.

  She had electric blue hair and emerald green eyes that twinkled with mirth at their surprise, but what put her even more out of place was her clothing. She had no robe or House emblem, nothing Wizardly about her at all. The halfblood beamed at the Poltergeist of Hogwarts and brightly spoke words that had never once been said: "Hi Peeves, it's nice to meet you!" (A Next-Gen fanfic)

*** Just had a look at it, it seems interesting. Provided the OC is tolerable.

** Linkffn(Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King by Shadenight123) has Peeves as a contributing character. There isn't any dungbomb exchange and Peeves is actually a dangerous threat to Harry.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.
