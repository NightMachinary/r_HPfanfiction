So guys im looking for fics during 4'th year, where Harry doesnt just follow along the cannon storyline.

So hit me with your best: *Goblet emancipates Harry *Harry refuses to compete and doesn't lose his magic *Harry makes a mockery of the tournament *uses Parseltounge in first task with the dragon *ignores Ron and saves Hermione during 2'nd task *is abandoned by everyone (save hermione?) And doesnt forgive everyone-angry Harry yay! *learns a lot of interresting magic and stomps on everything. (Dragon killing?)

Link, descripe whats in the fic of the above and lets see how many 4th year fics we can find where fun/interresting things happen differently from cannon!

Will personally recommend linkffn(Harry-potter-and-the-daft-morons) as a good read, has smart harry bashing dumbledore and ruins the tournament.

EDIT: where am i going wrong in the linkffn usage?


** I have yet to properly write it, but I'm sitting on an idea that the Goblet of Fire, to enforce its magically binding contract, conjures up a trio of imps to act as agents on its behalf.

Unfortunately, while I've got the characterisation of said imps down, I haven't figured out how to alter the plot in a way that isn't 'canon/fanon but three OCs take place of Hermione'.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

  ONE-SHOT. After being entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament against his will, Harry does some independent research on what precisely "magically binding" means...and comes up with a very different approach to the competition. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword...but is the quill mightier than the wand?
