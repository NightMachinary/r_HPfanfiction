** Wards are canon (under a different namel, but that aside I'm writing a story where Harry's introduction to magic as a young kid causes him to see it as intuitive. So the way he uses magic wandlessly isn't really about having an intellectual understanding of a spell he's trying to cast, but about figuring out in his head how he wants his magic to act. Warning: I'm only four chapters in so far.

*** While that sounds interesting, that doesn't seem to fit the prompt. There's no canon basis for what you're developing. Even silent spells are show to be 'said' in the person's head, we've evidence of a curse that's supposed to be spoken aloud being weaker when silently cast in Dolohov's purple flame curse, and of course the whole 'leviOsa' business. The words are show to have power.

**** Wandless magic is not, outside of the Third movie, suggested to require an incantation. Otherwise accidental magic would be impossible! This Harry is only eight right now, he wouldn't have a wand.

Anyway, the Dolohov example really shows (I think) that Dolohov simply wasn't skilled enough with that curse to cast it full power without the incantation.

*** What's you update rate, this seems like a story to keep my eye on. Also if possible do you have an estimate on when you'll complete, or at least get to OOTP year. Sorry, it's just I don't start reading stories that follow canon(as in first year Philisopher's stone, second Basalisk, third Sirius(unless freed earlier), and fourth GOF) until it gets past GOF. It's just before that he's still naive(a bit), and hasn't really gone through the hell that is Voldemort's resurrection(with the lead up in the earlier books).

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

** There's 2 that I know, and both are from the same author. linkffn(Brightest Witch and the Darkest House; Potter vs Paradox).

The author explores canon magic to a level where it doesn't even seem like it, but it is. He also explains where and why that's considered canon on some A/N, but its mostly from Pottermore, I think.

  What happens if the 'brightest witch of her age' is very different than Hermione? Would there be a golden trio? Would the fate of Britain be brighter, darker or unchanged? What is dark and what is evil and how much do choices matter? Slow break from canon initially, full break at book 3. Lots of magic, action, reasonably competent Harry and friends, PoV is potential dark witch.
