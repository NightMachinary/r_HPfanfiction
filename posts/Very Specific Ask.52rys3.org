1. *NO BASHING.*\\
2. H/Hr, H/G are the only acceptable pairings involving Harry. Most pairings with other characters are alright.\\
3. Please no Harry Stu. I really hate the ones where Harry is goblin-trained, is the heir of all the founders and can speak to Hogwarts etc. Just no.\\
4. Linking into 3, no Harry travelling back in time more than a year. To fix mistakes or by accident, *I don't care*.\\
5. Must be complete.\\
6. Must be decently long. No one-shots, no 10 chapter 5k stuff.\\
7. No twu luv at first sight. No surprise ambush declaration of love in the final chapter. Conversely, no rambling on about how good her curves look for a paragraph.\\
8. No soul bonds.\\
9. Oh, and no HPMOR. Read it already, pretty good, 8/10.\\
    \\
   There are probably no stories which follow all of these rules, but at least 6 or 7 should be fine. Anyway, probably 10 people are going to read this and 5 people are going to comment, and the story probably doesn't or never will exist, but I'm asking anyway.


** Sounds to me like anything long and canon-compliant will fit your requirements? There was a thread a couple days ago with tons of great recs. But to get you started, I am LOVING [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7737991][*Put Your Guns Away It's Teatime*]] and the sequel that is a WIP [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/7882474/chapters/18003613][*Put Your Curse in Reverse*]] by Frombluetored. The are not only canon pairings but CC compliant fics. The twist is that there is an Albus/Scorpius relationship, but even that is CC compliant with how she did it and so well done (even if youre not huge on slash - it isnt graphic at all).

These fics are SOOO good - the author writes their family dynamics and banter perfectly - and it's updated every couple days which is amazing. Idk how she does it. I highly recommend them! Linkao3(7882474), linkao3(7737991)

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

#+begin_quote
  Scorpius Malfoy knew his fifth year would be challenging-- but he hadn't expected this. Between his impending O.W.L.s, his new relationship, Quidditch tryouts, the public eye, and the Slug Club, he can hardly catch his breath. Meanwhile, Harry Potter discovers that being a professor at Hogwarts is very different from being a student there-- especially when you've got three mischievous children and a handful of students who can't seem to do more than ogle at you.

  What happens during the year after the battle ends? Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco pick up the pieces left behind in the post-war Wizarding World-a world where they are adults and Voldemort is gone in body but not in spirit... This is *mostly* based off of book canon and what JK Rowling has said in interviews. Rated M for some lemon-y scenes.
