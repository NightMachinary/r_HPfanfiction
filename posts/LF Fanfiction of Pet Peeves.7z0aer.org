Any story where Harry or the Twins take Peeves in as their pet. Bonus points if they try to bring him home as a pet. I'd also accept any stories where Peeves is a main character or plays a major role.

  Nothing is as it seems on the path to power. Bodies and conspiracies litter the road as daggers shine in the air. Treacheries centuries old leave the place to decade long plans that are just now coming to fruition, and Harry Dursley questions himself through a journey that shall lead him to drastically change his perception of the world. It's all a matter of perspective, after all.

  A difference of a few seconds can change a life. The difference of a few minutes stained Harry's hands with blood - but for the Dark Lord, it was insufficient. After all, you do not need to kill a man to utterly destroy him. Harry/Tonks

**** In all humorous good faith, I'm going to respectfully disagree. My title was merely "requesting Pet Peeves", which kept the illusion until one actually read the description --- whereas careful reading of /your/ title lets one on to you from the start.
