**** After their Harry was out, Dumbledore and his Order summoned 'Harry from another world', and the newcomer was NOT pleased. [[/spoiler][The other world's Hermione had her voice cord cut out]]

It's curb-stomp and Order bashing story, abandoned and only good for guilty pleasures, but meets what the OP asked.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
