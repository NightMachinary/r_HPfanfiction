** The Theia Higglesworth Trilogy by FloreatCastellum is the best fic I can remember having read. Pairing is canon, though mostly in the background.

  AU: When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween night, she not only created a living legend in Charlus Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, but she touched the life of another just as deeply. What will happen when a more jaded, more focused, and more gifted Harry Potter shows up at Hogwarts in 1991 after being abandoned and forgotten? Fem!Voldemort, WBWL

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.

It's slow burn wolfstar from remus perspective (remus and Sirius for those who don't know). It starts just before first year of hogwarts and ends around the summer of Order of the Phoenix. It's funny, sad, silly and well written. I got to the end and jsut went back and re read it again lol.

** [[https://archive.org/details/TheLastRingbearerSecondEdition][My favorite fanfic ever]] is a LOTR fic, not Harry Potter. Unless maybe you count Mark Twain's "Connecticut Yankee" as a fanfic of the King Arthur stories.

My favorite Potter fics: one is (ducks) ROMPH spelled backwards, still. That's the one that got me into the genre. It has some awful parts and starts out badly and takes a huge beating in this sub, but it is hysterically funny in parts, and deep or at least decently pseudo-deep in other parts.

The other main possibility surprised me since it's a Dark Lord Harry fic, linkao3(The Sum of their Parts by holdmybeer). It's one of the few longish HP fanfics that I didn't think needed to be edited to about half its original length. I didn't expect to like the Dark Harry angle but it was done convincingly.
