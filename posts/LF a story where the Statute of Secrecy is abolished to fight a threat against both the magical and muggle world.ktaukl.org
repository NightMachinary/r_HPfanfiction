***** I've seen something like that before. I don't /think/ the Statute was revoked, but there was a Stargate in the CoS and one of the SG teams came through and I'm pretty sure they worked together when there was some sort of kerfuffle with one of the big Goa'uld bosses. I think it was a pretty minor thing though, rather than a proper invasion. My memory's fuzzy at the best of times, and Egyptian stuff in space makes me mix things up with Necrons for crit confusion.

It's a fun fic even if it only vaguely matches the prompt. There are other extraterrestrial friends & foes, and Harry refers to magical folks as 'wiggles'. Have a link!

** I've been writing one where it gets smashed when Natasha Romanoff puts the SHIELD files online in a marvel crossover, but it's nowhere near finished and I might release it into the wild if anyone's interested

There is one that is a shadow run crossover that is fun. It's about Harry being a dragon, but in the background Magic is leaving into the world, so they aren't facing a danger so much as Magic is the danger and the statute becomes useless

I think your prompt is fucking cool though, and hope there are other responses that are more specific to what you're saying

**** I went into the Battle Star Galactica one blindly. I didn't know anything about the show. I still enjoyed reading the story because the Battle Star elements only appeared in the later chapters.

For the second one, I had already watched World War Z starring Brad Pitt & read the book, which was nothing like the movie, before discovering the fanfic. However, I think you can go into it without having seen or read those. What the fanfic author did was mimic the writing style of the book's author but no characters were crossed over.

** They are star wars and mass effect stories like this, I do not know them off head but if you do search under those cross overs your bound to find them, especially the longer stuff
