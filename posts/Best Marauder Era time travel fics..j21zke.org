Can you guys recommend me your best Harry Potter time travel fics were Harry goes back in time to his parents era? My only requirements are that it wither be complete or at least recently updated. Gen/het/or slash doesn't matter.


** linkffn(Wind Shear by Chilord) would be my favorite: It gives Harry a very unique and brilliantly-written fighting style, and makes it very clear why people were so scared of Voldemort.

  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

***** Not really. She tries to seduce him several times, but gets nowhere. The epilogue is /slightly/ more open-ended; she's thoroughly enamored with him, but it also mentions her ignoring suitors so she's likely still single.

  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

  Post-OOTP. The episode in the DOM has left Harry a changed boy. He returns to the Dursley's to prepare for his inevitable confrontation with Voldemort, but his stay there is very short-lived. He finds himself in the care of people who he has no choice but to cooperate with and they give him a startling revelation: Harry must travel back to the 1970's to save the wizarding world.
