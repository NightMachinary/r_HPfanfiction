** These are all Draco/Harry!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/3171550/chapters/6887378][Running On Air by eleventy7]] - Draco Malfoy has been missing for three years. Harry is assigned the cold case and finds himself slowly falling in love with the memories he collects. (75k, teen & up)

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1273078][Stop All the Clocks by firethesound]] - Living with Draco was difficult; living without him is unbearable. But if there's one thing Harry learned from the war, it's that even when one life ends, the rest of the world goes right on living. (45k, explicit).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18960145/chapters/45017440][Grounds for Divorce by Tepre]] - Malfoy finds a coin. Harry finds a letter. A story about histories, a story about families. A story about a lemon tree somewhere in Upper Egypt. (122k, explicit).

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/2734082/chapters/6126311][Tea and No Sympathy by who_la_hoop]] - Draco is stuck in a time loop. (70k, explicit)

These are a few of my favourite drarry fics !! I have a rly big list though, I've been reading it for years now so it's been a ride lol

[[https://www.archiveofourown.org/works/4422662][Girls In Peacetime Go Dancing by FeelsForBreakfast]] - this is a fem!drarry where they have to take dancing lessons at hogwarts. rated teen, 22k.

** I read it a fair few years ago, so I'm not sure how I'd like it now, but I remember enjoying The Soul Adores by Maeglin_Yedi (won't link because Rule 8). It's stuck in my head for years. Harry/Tom.

Apart from that, as (fem)slash goes, I mostly read Lavender/Parvati these days.

A Lightness by Teh Tarik is mostly Lavender-focused, but does contain mild Lav/Padma: [[https://harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?chapterid=485960]]

** I like a lot slash pairings with harry, in fact my first OTP had been drarry! :) my current obsessions are time travel fics so I read a lot of snarry, tomarry, jeverus, and some abraxas malfoy/harry potter and remus lupin/sirius black by default. My favorite tomarry fics are To Kill You With A Kiss by Paimpont on ao3 and Stand Against The Moon by Batsutousai on ao3(apart of the series 'Like A Ghost In My Town.') My favorite jeverus fic is Earning His Forgiveness by OwlsWithFins on ao3 and I can't quite think of my favorite snarry fic off the top of my head, hopefully that was helpful though and I hope you have a great day!
