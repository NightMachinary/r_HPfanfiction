... with a more athletic or physically-oriented Hermione?

I know it's seriously going against canon as well as the vast majority of fan perceptions of her character, but I just thought of it today, and there's /got/ go be a fic or two out there.

It could be quidditch!Hermione, runner!Hermione, or just perhaps "Hermione decides to do something with her life"; I don't care.


** linkffn(A Switched Chance by LunaStorm) has quidditch!Hermione but [[/spoiler][that's because it's actually bodyswapped!Harry]]

linkffn(Hermione's Brilliant Idea by Ares.Granger) has was-always-an-athlete!Hermione, H/Hr wish fulfillment in the vein of robst, everyone is perfect.

  A fourth year fic. Harry is stuck in something he doesn't want to be in, Dumbledore's a manipulative bastard, Voldemort wants Harry dead, the school hates him...sounds like every year right? Well this year Hermione has a brilliant idea (or more than one) and her idea(s) change Harry's life, her life, and a big black dog's life too. AU and no idea which genre to put this under.

  Her father had told Harry that if Hermione was in danger he should hold that box in front of her and push the button. He'd never have expected that a series of flashing lights would transform Hermione into "Spygirl". Fortunately, the dozen Death Eaters facing them hadn't expected that either. Harry Potter/Spyboy crossover.
