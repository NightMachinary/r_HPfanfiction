Orion Regulus Black is son of Regulus Black and Severa Wing, a pure blood witch that was a spy in the death eaters for the order of Phoenix until she was found out and her whole family was wiped out save for Orion who was raised by his godfather, Severus snape.


** I think this is a good idea! Perhaps Orion gets into a situation where he has to be a double agent, and Snape coaches him. Since he's Regulus's and Severa's son he has sneakiness in his genes.Also, are you sure you want the mother to be named Severa when Snape is Severus? lol.

Or, creepily, maybe Orion visits the Inferi cave and sees his father in the water.

*** Maybe lucina or something like that would be a better idea. As for the double agent thing maybe Snape tells Orion to keep an eye on harry when Snape can't so that means his griffendor though Regulus had griffendor traits if only he didn't have to be his parents favorite

**** Here's the plan I have for Orion, he's Snape\ dumbledore's inside man on harry's activities when either doesn't want Harry Potter knowing they are watching him.magic Skills: charms magic, potions, caring for magical creatures, and flying. As for non magic skills: stealth and sending info

***** Also Orion will have his own inside people in every house plus one in the death eaters. All I will say is one is daphne greengrass.

***** Kreacher, who watches over Orion while snape is at hogwarts, will have a lot of explaining to do after that moment.
