I have never read this trope but just developed a strange curiosity about it (I might be a masochist). Preferably no Weasley bashing, but I'll take what I can get. No slash, Dramione, or Snamione.

Thanks in advance.


** Marriage contracts are usually a very lazy way of putting 2 people together. Thus I will rec you some where it is not used for that Express purpose.

The Legacy by storytellerSPW, the Amalgation Agreement, and Contractual Invalidation by rdude are all what I would define as "the best" that this trope has to offer.

The first is very long and a bit wordy but it manages to actually progress a relationship slowly; Harry and Daphne dislike each other for the first 500k words. I rec this often because I genuinely find their relationship believable.

The 2nd manages to take a nice little spin on the trope with a strange (unique) characterization of Daphne that I really enjoyed as well as doing a great job or progression. Both Daphne and Harry are not interested at all, and I honestly really felt for Daphne at times. Sadly this like the first appear to be abandoned.

The 3rd is the best of these and is complete. This is the gold standard for this trope. Harry discovers the contract with Daphne and decided to manipulate it in his favour and advance his career. The only nitpicking I can do is about Harry, who is a bit too ruthless for his character. I didn't describe this one very well, it's hard to do without spoiling but trust me it's well worth a read.

** Just as an aside, you should be warned that most marraige law fics seem to disproportionately have major bashing relative to other tropes out there, so your request may not turn up a huge amount.

That being said: linkffn(The Amalgamation Agreement) is an...interesting take on the Daphne Greengrass characterization.

** In other fandoms, you'd have the couple that has to fake a relationship for some reason, only to fall for each other. The contracts here serve that purpose. Just as with any trope, they can be used to make a good story better, though that's not always the case.

Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts is a good one, though it ticks a bit dark in places. Come for the contracts, stay for the confused Dumbledore. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts)

There's a new fic that I enjoy, Betrothed. It kicks off with a quite detailed negotiation for a contract involving Harry. Unfortunately, Vernon Dursley is the one signing. linkffn(12964930).

I forget the work, but there was one where Dumbledore abused his magical guardian rights on the muggleborns and sold their contracts at auction - so Harry and others ended up buying them out to rescue the girls (and build a ludicrous harem). That's a rather extreme example of the genre, however, and not at all typical.

I'll see if others come to mind.

  The War is Over, Harry has won. But at what cost? At odds with Dumbledore, estranged from the Weasleys, betrayed by Lupin, Harry tries to carry on for his 7th year. Harry/Daphne. There will be Humor, there will be Romance, also Drama and Angst.

*** Does it? The lasting impression I have of it is that it's mostly just more of the same. Perhaps a little bit more refined than usual and unshackled by canon restraints due to being post-Hogwarts, but at it's core, it's still the same thing as the rest.
