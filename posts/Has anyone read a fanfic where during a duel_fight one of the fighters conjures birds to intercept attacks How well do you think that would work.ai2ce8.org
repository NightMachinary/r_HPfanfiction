** Cadmean Victory has conjured butterflies which intercept curses. The idea is that you create a whole swarm and since most curses stop upon hitting the first thing, that swarm would be an effective shield because sufficient numbers mean that it is guaranteed to have something between the curse and you.

*** I'm imagining a duel now where one person throws a rock or something at the other who changes it into a bear before it gets destroyed and changed again. Basically rather than just blocking the attacks each person using them to their advantage.

** I had this in a recent chapter, sort of. During the Azkaban breakout, Tonks summoned a flock of seabirds and commanded them to intercept any spells in mid-flight, her reasoning being that the Death Eaters were winning, so it'd be more likely to help her side than hurt. Worked out rather well.

** If the opponent has any skill with transfiguration, I imagine they would shift the birds into something else like knives and attack with them. The birds could be vanished, blown away with wind, taken out in an explosive/wide-ranging spell, etc. Unless those involved are novices, it's not really a viable strategy IMO.

*** That still sounds useful to me as a defensive measure, any time spent removing the birds is time not spent attacking you.

**** Except when they turn those birds into knives (presumably changing something that exists is easier than creating something) and banishing them straight back to caster in which case you're only hindering yourself.

Something to consider is that not all attacks will be affected by conjured animals and so its' value as a defensive measure is questionable. This ranges from blasts of fire & wind to explosive force and acid mists.

**** To me, it doesn't seem like much of an impediment, unless the opposition only knows how to sling straightforward curses. More skilled wizards will use transfiguration to attack and defend simultaneously by redirecting/shifting whatever their opponent creates to work with.

(Or by simply ignoring a conjuration that isn't directed at them and actually helps them more than hindering, i.e. a bunch of birds blocking your opponent's view while you send a wave of fire or whatever.)

As for time taken, (in my opinion) there's no reason it should take someone skilled more than a second to vanish or shift them.

** I doubt that would work every well, unless you surrounded yourself with a swarm of them from the get-go; empirically, wizards /don't/ seem to do this, and the most likely reason is that Conjuration or Transfiguration, especially of living beings, take rather more time and concentration than it takes for your enemy to cast a common curse in your direction and for said curse to cover the distance between you and your opponent.

#+begin_quote
  A sharp and sudden change that can have devastating effects. When a Harry Potter that didn't follow the path of the Epilogue finds himself suddenly thrown into 1970, he settles into a muggle pub to enjoy a nice drink and figure out what he should do with the situation. Naturally, things don't work out the way he intended.

** While it could stop a fair few spells, a powerful spell would likely just blast through the bird and keeping going towards the target. For example, in GoF, Dumbledore's Disarming Charm smashed through a door and continued to disarm fake Moody on the other side.

Also you have to question why you would do this, rather than casting the Shield Charm. It seems like more difficult magic to achieve the same result.

Really it sounds like a specialised defence for the Killing Curse, not a general duelling tactic.

*** I was thinking for things like curses/stunners or maybe blasting curses. If the bird is far enough away from you when the blasting curse hits, that's less of a chance for your shield charm to break. With curses they seem to be single target stuff. If an enemies spell is strong enough it can break a shield I think. This would reduce the chance of being hit if you overestimate your shield or underestimate your opponents spell.

**** Spells don't necessary execute their effect when they make contact with the first physical object in their path, though. Have edited my above post to include an example. A bird is a fairly insubstantial barrier - if spells can blast through a thick layer of wood and hit someone on the other side, a bird isn't really going to block a powerful curse.

The Killing Curse is the exception because it "executes" the moment it touches a living thing.

***** True. I am curious on your opinion on what other spells would work like this. The disarming spell seems like it unleashed a wave of force which knocks stuff aside as well as disarming. But would an explosion spell do this? I would assume that an impact would cause the explosion to go but I could be wrong.

** I don't know if it'd be great in actual life-or-death scenarios, but now you've got me thinking about the type of competitive dueling that must exist for Flitwick to be a champion. I'm thinking there should definitely be a style-points component to wizard dueling leagues, and summoning birds to block a curse would be a good example of how to earn them.
