*** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/][*/Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux/*]] by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3306612/the-Imaginizer][/the Imaginizer/]]

#+begin_quote
  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Are you looking for a specific fanfic? There are a lot of fics where the soul fragment is Harry's friend when he's growing up, do you have any more specific details?
