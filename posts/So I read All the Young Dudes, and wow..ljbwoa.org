I read All the Young Dudes by MsKingBean89, and it was by far the best fanfiction I have ever read. It's a prequel about the marauders (James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin and Petter Pettigrew). It's in Remus' point of view and it's a slow burn with Sirius Black. This fanfiction made me laugh, and it made me cry, I just fell in love with how the author wrote these characters. I know it's already pretty well known, but wanted to put it out there in case no one has heard of it. It's on ao3.


** ATYD is in my top five fanfics ever now!

Can't wait to read it again someday!!

**** Probably hand in glove and the pureblood princess.

Hand in glove is a Drarry fanfic with two sequels that starts in 5th year that is on AO3 and fan fiction.net.

The Pureblood princess is a SiriusxOC fic on wattpad that starts just before their first year with a somewhat slow build up.

** There are a handful of fics that I compare every story to, and this is the one for Maurader's era stories. It's fantastic. It is long, but the story flew by for me.

Have you read the short epilogue fic that's like two chapters about Grant? That fic made me cry even more but it was the cherry on top for me!

**** I recommend it, we get to see Teddy Lupin and something about seeing Grant as a whole adult reflecting on his time just really cinches Remus' life as a terrible tragedy. It has one of my favorite lines in the whole story!

  LONG fic charting the marauders' time at Hogwarts (and beyond) from Remus' PoV - diversion from canon in that Remus's father died and he was raised in a children's home, and is a bit rough around the edges. Otherwise canon-compliant.1971 - 1995This IS a wolfstar fic, but incredibly slow burn. Literally years. Long build up but worth it I promise! PLEASE DO NOT COPY TO WATTPAD. SERIOUSLY, WHY??

  Also published on AO3 (same author, same title): Wolfstar get together fic charting the Marauder's time at Hogwarts from Remus' POV. Obviously a Remus/Sirius fic, but loads of general marauders mischief and fun in the first few years. A few diversions from canon - working class/orphaned Remus.

** You should read their other story linkao3(Dress Up In You by MsKingBean89) it's also adorable.

Also linkao3(Flat 9 by JustGettingBy) is a really good look in story of just the other people living in their flat and it's really sad!

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.
