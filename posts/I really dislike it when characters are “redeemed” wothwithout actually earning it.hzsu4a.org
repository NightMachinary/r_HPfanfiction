This is not directed towards snape, my opinion of him is that he is an asshole with a chip on his shoulder who was obsessed with a dead woman and took out his own bitterness on her child and his actions shouldn't be whitewashed but he tried to do the right thing No this is directed to all characters who are basically antagonists through out the story and don't even try to redeem themselves but near the end they die or make one decision that helps the Mc and suddenly they are a hero or they get off with little to no consequences /cough/Malfoy/cough/. Is it truly so hard to have a character be dealt with properly?


** To this day I still can't understand how Lucius Malfoy avoided prison.

Was it ever mentioned that he was free in anything besides Cursed Child? Because I can pretend that's not canon easily.

*** I think only a direct pardon by Kingsley for political reasons can save him from prison. Immediately after the Battle, good guys' hold on power was tenuous at best, so punishing a defector too hard could push less resolute Voldemort collaborators/sympathizers into continuing resistance. "Divide and Conquer" would be a better strategy at this point.

However, the Malfoys must pay dearly to avoid Azkaban. For example, every victim of the CoS incident should receive huge indemnity payments. And of course, every direct victim of Lucius Malfoy from the first war were entitled to the same deal. Furthermore, the Malfoys needed to pay more into some kind of general reconstruction fund, and relinquish control over any businesses deemed 'essential' by the Ministry.

In addition to selling out every known members of Voldemort's organization, the Malfoys must publicly denounce blood purity and present themselves as 'reformed'. The Ministry in turn would praise them for 'seeing the light' and contributing significantly to the destruction of Voldemort (which was true, albeit for their selfish reasons). That should paint a huge target on their back for Voldemort remnants.

Only then do I think a pardon for Lucius can be accepted.

*** It's super believable to me, actually. Otto Skorzeny was declared “Denazified” as early as 1952, despite the fact that the declaration had to be made in absentia because he had /broken out of prison/. He proceeded to set up shop in Spain, where he ended up advising fascist Neo-Nazis till dying of cancer more than two decades later.

There's no doubt in my mind that Lucius Malfoy could get away with little more than a slap on the wrist, even after everything he did. Oh, sure, he'd probably go to Azkaban for a bit, not for more than a handful of years, plausibly less.

Heck, given that a former Nazi party member was elected Chancellor of W Germany in the 1960s, Malfoy might even still have a political career ahead of him...

I don't know how Draco got free though, and there is no indication by Rowling either.

But there were not a whole lot of Death Eaters alive after the battle, because if they were the battered remains of the DA and the OotP (basically the Weasleys, Kingsley and MAYBE Hestia Jones) would be unable to restore their ministry (Umbridge and the collaborators did not fight, they would have an interests in staying in power).

***** Umbridge didn't stay in power she ended up in Azkaban for sending Muggle-born to be exterminated.

Also according to Rowling the information Lucius gave literally did help.

#+begin_quote
  Abraxas's son, Lucius, achieved notoriety as one of Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters, though he successfully evaded prison after both of Lord Voldemort's attempted coups. On the first occasion, he claimed to have been acting under the Imperius Curse (though many claimed he called in favours from high-placed Ministry officials); on the second occasion, he provided evidence against fellow Death Eaters and helped ensure the capture of many of Lord Voldemort's followers who had fled into hiding.

If she was that easily removed, Lucius information was irrelevant. Had it been relevant, the Death Eaters would have been too strong/entrenched to be removed by what was left of the good guys. Because canon implies that the vast majority of Voldemort's forces were killed at Hogwarts. Whoever Lucius sold out had not been important, else they would have been at Hogwarts, where Voldemort literally fought to the last man, well woman since Bellatrix was the last of his minions standing.

*** In complete fairness, Lucius /did/ leave Voldemort's camp when it seemed like Voldemort was going to /win,/ and Harry was aware that for all Draco's posturing, he was unable to kill Dumbledore when it counted. That's without even mentioning Narcissa's selfless stunt that wound up saving his bacon.

Did Lucius /deserve/ jailtime? Yeah. Could he also be used as an example of someone who genuinely turned away from the Dark? Absolutely. Which is more useful? Probably the latter.

**** Lucius and Narcissa's abandonment of Voldemort in the end was not about them acting against Voldemort's cause though. It was more about them finding Draco than really a "turn to the light".

If Lucius killed someone, turn or not, I don't see him avoiding jail.

Besides, not sure how Lucius can use his "Dark side" as a leverage, for bringing peace that was. He was already down in importance in VOldemort's cyrcle before Voldemort fall, and every death eater knew that.

** It's sadly what's happens with big issues in canon in all fandoms. A lot of stories either uncritically repeat the same follies as canon or try to further justify them.

Justice, proper fair justice, is a rare resource in Harry Potter. Either we have mindless redemption without even requiring the character to repent or we have corruption.

The list of adults in Harry Potter who don't deserve jail time is probably shorter than the list that do. And I'm not sure if that doesn't stay true if you exclude marked Death Eaters.

** I love Snape centered fanfics but if he doesn't go through a full and worthwhile redemption arc, I can't actually buy his "goodness". So either change canon so you don't have to deal with the consequences of his actions(that is something you can do since it is fanfiction) by not making his whole personality about him pining over a dead woman and maybe make the whole bullying little children an act and this kinds of shit ooor hold him accountable for his actions. Or y'know, make him own up to all his arsehole-like douchey ways. In all you can explore his feelings in a very compelling way, be it to be an actual jerk or someone with actually redemption potential. The same goes for everyone else, either own up to their crap or convince me that they changed and deserve my forgiveness.

Edit: Linkffn(Presque Toujours Pur by ShayaLonnie) Is Dramione, but explores Regulus, Snape and Sirius' past in a brilliant way that changes the narrative to such an extent that is really ease to just like everyone hahah. Is not exclusively Snape centric, but he plays a big role in it. Is not one of the "earns his redemption", but I really don't find him bad in here and this fic is just a gem that deserves to be rec'd. If I remember anything else I'll come back here ;)

I don't really consider anything except the original books as canon and tend to ignore the epilogue so when in post war fics the malfoy get off with minimal punishment for the crime committed it annoys me. It's even worse when the author just has an antagonist spontaneously for the right thing in one instance then be forgiven for everything they have done before.

**** I can understand this. I can enjoy a future fic, particularly established relationship ones, where the author skips explaining this forgiveness process as long as it's alluded to. But for stories directly post-war I don't see how skipping that process makes the fic work. Moreso with Draco than Snape, but with both honestly. Snape, while on the good side, was still a first class jerkoff and that has to be worked through. For Draco, he's not only a jackass, but one indoctrinated in hate from birth. There's a lot to overcome there. I love both of these characters and enjoy them a great deal in fic, but skipping the process of getting them to "good guy" status confuses me.

As for Papa Malfoy, if he gets off with little to no punishment in a story where the Ministry is still all jacked and corrupt post war, this makes sense. It isn't just or right by any means, but his power and money have helped him slither away more than once. That said, I do prefer when he has to pay for his crimes.
