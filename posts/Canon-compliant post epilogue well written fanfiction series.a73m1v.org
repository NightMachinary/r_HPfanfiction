Since I really had problems finding fanfiction like this and finally managed to find two series that made me really happy, I thought maybe I could mention them in this thread. I suspect that many ppl in this subreddt have either read them already or are not interested, since they are already rather old, written not long after the books ended. Still I was quite ecstastic to find such good fanfiction and thought that it could be of use to somebody.

Kerichi [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/322080/Kerichi]] has written a lot and I'm especially in love with the Scorpius/Rose fanfictions. It does kind of focus on romance, but also deals with family dynamics including the dynamics between the families and the way Scorpius deals with Lucius whom he loves and respects but whose ideals he refuses to adopt despite Lucius' best efforts. Almost all (?) canon characters with some significance make an appearance and are written kindly and plausibly (with Rose's family non too happy with the developements at first, understandably, but no bashing of anybody).

Fernwithy [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/FernWithy/pseuds/FernWithy/works?fandom_id=136512]] has written a rather long series about the Hogwarts life and adventures of Teddy Lupin. Very sweet and in the style of the books, he deals with some of the same problems as Harry. No focus on romance, though some kind of off and on relationships are repeatedly mentioned. I actually cannot find words to describe the series, it's like reading 4 more Harry Potter books, except the protagnist is Teddy Lupin. Quite a few canon characters make an appearance, of course, prominently the teachers, Harry, Andromeda, and Teddy's dead parents.

The author has also written two long stories about Remus and Tonks called Shifts and Shades, which are also very well written but imho rather frustrating to read with all the back and forth especially on Remus' part. While it's completely plausible that that was exactly they way he acted before he finally decided to settle down for a few months with his wife, it still hurts my brain to think about him that way. That's just my problem though and I think that anybody who does not have my problem will enjoy the Shifts and Shades just as much as the Teddy Lupin stories.

So there's that, I hope that somebody found that useful and I didn't break any rules.

Also if anybody could recommend any other fanfiction like that to me I'd be very grateful. Can't seem to find anything else at all.


** Check both little0bird and Northumbrian both authors do a bunch of canon compliant (some very minor alterations) post Hogwarts and post epilogue interlinked stories

** Are you open to slash? Turn by Saras_girl is a long, Draco/Harry, epilogue compliant fic. It's very, very well written and I think a good fic for someone who wouldn't normally read slash. Very slow burn and makes you understand how the relationship could feasibly work within canon parameters.

**** I get that, but this story isn't really a “omg I'm actually gay and didn't realize it for 35 years” kind of story. The characters all get a happy ending. I dunno, I think if you give it a shot you might like it!
