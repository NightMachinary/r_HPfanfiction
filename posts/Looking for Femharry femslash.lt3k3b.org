So like the title says, I am looking for fem!harry femslash fics. However, since I have already read a lot/most of the more commonly suggested ones (see fics like, Yule ball panic, etc.) I am looking for some more that may not be commonly recommended.

I am specifically looking for some maybe less common fem!harry pairings like fem!harry/ginny (this one may be common and I've just missed all of them), fem!harry/daphne, fem!harry/fleur, fem!harry/tonks, etc. I do however don't mind if the more common pairings are recommended as well.

Fluff is always welcomed and I don't care if there is or isn't any smutty elements. I especially favor anything that has fem!harry being the more submissive one/the one getting cared for (there might be a better way to say this but I can't think of any atm).

Writing quality is not a big problem for me so as long as the fic doesn't fell like it was written by a ten year old and it is an enjoyable story, feel free to recommend it.

If the fic isn't harry-centric, then I would REALLY like for her to still be a major part of the story.

My biggest nono is forced love in any way. This includes actual usage of love potions to entrance the mc, forced marriage contracts (to someone that isn't the main/one of the main love interests) or mind control (imperius etc.). If anything like this is used and not resolved in the same/next chapter then I will stop reading since it makes me uncomfortable or slightly physically ill.

Thank you in advance for any recommendations you grant me!

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

  Voldemort didn't like what happened at the Department of Mysteries and viewed the connection as a liability he could no longer afford. The steps he took changed Harry's life forever, and set him on the path to victory. Fem Harry. Harry.Multi.

  Harry has died for the twelfth time and his Reaper is NOT happy about it. Given a chance to go back to fourth year and do things again, Harry jumps at the opportunity. But what's this about being a girl! Don't Fear the Reaper with a twist. Fem!Harry. FemSlash.
