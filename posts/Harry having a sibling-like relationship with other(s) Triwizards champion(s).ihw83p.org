**** Yeah! Harry stressing over being a good role model for Gabby, entirely unaware he can do no wrong in her eyes. His constant doting actually making her love her big bro even more.

** This is an awesome fic where the Triwizard Tournament takes place in his first year and because Harry is 11 years old no one thinks that he entered himself. As a result the other champions are supportive. It's good. [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13260989/1/And-the-Unethical-Binding-Contract][And the Unethical Binding Contract]]
