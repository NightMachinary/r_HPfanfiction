Any fic where the Magical world is very different than the books which leads to a very different sort of plot than in the books.

For example Prince of a Dark Kingdom [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3766574/1/Prince-of-the-Dark-Kingdom]]

This is a world where Voldemort won the war and changed the society of the wizarding world to better reflect what he wanted out of it. All muggleborns forget about their muggle families and are later adopted by pureblood wizarding ones adopting is mandatory for the high society purebloods and what magical school you go to is based on magical aptitude at 11. Voldemort is a respected public figure now is very different even if the end goal is the same.

Something like methods of rationality though I wouldn't count. The wizarding world is the same you are just explaining mechanics of it more and exploring sides of it you maybe didn't in the original. But its still supposed to resemble the same world not a altered one.

No major character/OC ships, No major character/self insert, No character of harrys gen / Anyone of the Marauders gen or older, No next gen characters/ people of Harry's gen or older

being critical is fine but preferably no bashing

preferably No Draco/Hermione or Sirius Black/Marlene McKinnon.

No sex swap aka any canon character being a different sex than what they are in canon like for example fem!Harry or male!Hermione ( trans characters are fine i dont consider sex swap trope to overlap with that)

Apart from this any other ship is fine slash, fem slash, whatever.

Though no ships are also fine and I actually prefer friendship focused and/or plot focused.

** I've written a few stories that would fit your request. "Patron" is an AU where the magical world developed differently since 1692. There's a caste system, mitigated a lot by custom, and wizards have a very different culture - more progressive in some areas, more conservative in others compared to muggles, and different countries have different cultures.

In "The Dark Lord Never Died", Lucius Malfoy took control of Wizarding Britain in 1981, and formed the country according to his wishes. Muggleborns get taken from their homes and raised as loyal enforcers of his - like janissaries. Dumbledore moved to France with his supporters and is now, 20 years later, planning to return as Voldemrot has returned as well, and is already fighting Malfoy.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.
