  Vernon changed in the beginning to be a better man, thanks to a wish. How will this affect Harry, and the entire Wizarding World? Now complete! Please R&R. AU, HPGW, RWHG, RLNT

** Unfortunately, I don't have anything that's exactly what you're looking for, but I've a few that are closely related. There are a couple featuring a Magical!Dudley where either Petunia or Vernon is supportive of magic (and the other isn't).

Petunia isn't supportive of magic, but Vernon is in linkao3(Magical Relations). Vernon accepts that Dudley is a wizard and takes the attitude of "Well if my son /has/ to be a wizard, he's going to be the best one."

Petunia is supportive, but Vernon isn't in linkao3(Dudley Dursley and the Sorcerer's Stone). Note that it also contains a time-traveling Dudley who is rather ashamed of how he and his family treated Harry, so he is sympathetic.

This is a very minor aspect of the work, but in linkffn(Deathly Hallowed), while Dudley (who's a muggle in this fic) does mention that his mum told him that his cousin was a freak, Harry seemed well cared for and developed a close relationship with Dudley. Lily lived, but didn't take care of Harry until sometime before Harry gets shipped to Hogwarts.

edit: so apparently ao3 bot is down so

**** I like how it captured the whimsical nature of the original series. And how, just like the original series, it started off light but slowly developed more mature themes as the story progressed.

  The Tale of Three Brothers was not a legend. It was a warning. No one cheats Death. And luckily for Lily Potter, the promise of the Cloak's return in exchange for her son's life was a fair deal. Stare into the abyss, Harry Potter, and we will see who blinks first.

  Instead of letting Vernon in on her sister's little secret, Petunia worked diligently to keep magic as nothing more than a fairytale. However, when she dies unexpectedly, leaving her husband a widower shortly before that fateful Halloween night, Vernon doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he takes Harry into his home. AU. COMPLETE with epilogue!
