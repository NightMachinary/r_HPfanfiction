In the first book, it's a basic AU. But in the last few chapters, when Harry goes out into the forest, he actually dies. But Hermione and three other girls (Daphne, Susan, and Luna?) who care for Harry use themselves to anchor his soul and bring him back (or something like that).

Here's where it get's interesting...The next two books leaps forward through time, where four woman perform the same ritual and Harry is resurrected into either the Star Wars universe or the Star Trek universe.

I think the second book is the Trek story. Three young woman from the academy go to a place that one of their grandmother's talked about, and go through a ritual as dictated by said grandmother's will. Lo and behold, granny was a witch! And this ritual summons and/or resurrects Harry Potter himself. At first, harry doesn't have his memories because there were supposed to be 4 ladies summoning him, not 3. Eventually the ladies he bonded with gain magic, plot ensues.

The third book (I think) is when Emperor Palpatine find the stone/ritual chamber or whatever, and the legends surrounding it. He forces four slaves to perform the ritual, but kills them before harry could stop him all to force Harry into submission. Harry of course, is not down for that bullshit. He forces a bond with the Emperor's bodyguard Mara Jade Skywalker (I think it was her) and takes off with her in tow. That was as far as I got on that story before distractions happened. But I forgot to mark ANY of the series as favorites or to be followed. So I most definitely need some help tracking these down. Help out a brand new redditor?


** Harem Trilogy by Darth Marrs?

-edit- I haven't actually read any of these because I can't go a chapter in a Darth Marrs fic without wanting to tear my eyes out, but I remembered the summaries from them popping up occasionally.

*** Yeah it's this one. The harem stuff is pretty obnoxious but the action is palatable.

Loses a lot of a points for being a cocktease. Apparently between the 2nd and 3rd books there was a war between the Q and the Mages in the Star Trek universe, and DM only gives a cursory summary of it through Harry. Would have been a *lot* more interesting to read about compared to the otherwise forgettable second book.

Also worth noting is that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12671206/1/The-Simurgh-s-Son][The Simurgh's Son]] story that DM is posting now is sort of a continuation of these three stories, this time crossed with /Worm/.

**** Yep, those are the ones I was looking for. But they're by Marrs, eh? Screw it, I'll go through them once more just to get to the Worm crossover. Thank you both!
