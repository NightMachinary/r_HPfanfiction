** linkffn(Harry Potter and the accidental horcrux) The horcrux in Harry's head awakens and starts talking and helping/manipulating him. Although I am not sure he counts as Voldemort here since technically he is a horcrux that is Tom Riddle.

linkffn(Prince of the dark kingdom) Voldemort won the first war and created his own wizarding society. I definitely feel like he acts more like Tom Riddle here than canon Voldemort. He can be charming, reasonable, knowledgeable about magic and a leader although still a psychopath.

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** linkffn(3766574)

Don't read it unless you have a massive amount of time on your hands. I read hours a day when I was in a bad place in life, and still took weeks to even get two-thirds of the way through the story. It's an amazing story though, and has aged very well.

It's a pretty serious AU. He's pretty collected and sane in this story, although you can definitely still see the Voldemort and Riddle sides of him.

** linkffn(Rising From the Shadows; A Distant Storm) Due to using his Horcruxes to possess his new bodies, Voldemort is saner. (Although he does pick up minor personality traits of his hosts, like Lockhart's flair and Bagnold's commanding presence.)
