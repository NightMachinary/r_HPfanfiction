Here is the first draft of a screenplay that I'm writing in case you need something to read while in self isolation. Feedback is appreciated.

** Premise: James Potter and the Marauders must defend Hogwarts against a group of death eaters who have infiltrated the neighboring city of Hogsmeade. James must also restore the honor of the Gryffindor house by joining the Quidditch team and winning the great Quidditch match. A smaller scale, James must protect his secret girlfriend Lily Evans from Severus Snape's advances as the marauders cause mischief against the slytherin house.
