** Yes! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7937889/1/][The Snape Chronicles]] is an amazingly well written Snape POV story, covering his entire life.

** If you enjoyed /Cauterize/ and don't mind next-gen stories, then I recommend respitechristopher's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4180032/1/Albus-Potter-and-the-Misspent-Youth][Albus Potter and the Misspent Youth]] and sequels (the Mercurial Trio series); the former is an authorized sequel to /Cauterize/.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1374917/][Inverarity's]] work is very good. He has a completed, next-gen novel /Hogwarts Houses Divided/ as well as the very polished /Alexandra Quick/ series, which spans four complete novels; set in the U.S., it has virtually none of the canon HP characters.

Two good Ron-centric stories: Perspicacity's one shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Ickle Ronnikins]] and jbern's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5987922/1/Number-Games][Number Games]].

Something completely out there is Larry Huss's AU [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5463888/1/Out-of-the-West][Out of the West]], another complete, novel-length story with Harry making only cameos. Larry Huss has an indirect style of writing that resembles Jack Vance's and is appealing to some.
