Voldemort wins the war. Either first or second one. Decades later, however, taking stock of state of affairs:

- Economy has tanked and flounders. Former backbone of the working class is long gone. Skills once plentiful are forgotten. Now only survives through brutal slave labour and institutionally robbing the muggle world.
- Population is dwindling. Purebloods do not like having many children, muggleborns are refused entry into the society, rest have been killed off. In their zeal even half bloods are now being prosecuted, detained and executed. With time more and more people escape into the muggle world.
- Education levels have dropped drastically. Many skilled and educated witches and wizards have been killed or driven off. Actions such as book burnings and extreme dogma have severely impaired creativity and critical thinking. Hogwarts is open only to the elite and mostly teaches dark arts, the importance of pure blood and revised history.
- Extreme disparity between few rich and the rest of society. Properties, assets, gold, homes and possessions are being confiscated on daily bases for any reason at all. Most people live in squalor and terror. Any (even perceived) resistance / non-conformance is dealt with extreme prejudice.
- Meanwhile small pureblood elite lives in a bubble of absolute luxury and power. Ignorant and uncaring of the woes that plague their nation. They play their political games, live for the intrigue and back stabbing, vast wealth and mountains of gold are nought more, but a plaything. Misery and poverty of others is a matter of joke.

Voldemort is not happy. This isn't the utopia he imagined.

Not looking for redemption / humanisation of his character. He doesn't regret his deeds nor is he going to give up power. Simply unhappy with the results. And what he might do to "fix" things. (by perhaps making everything even worse)


** There is a story like this - told from the pov of Lucius Malfoy, with Harry and the rest of the light population striking a deal with Voldemort and leaving Britain, after which time the Death Eaters realise too late that they're basically trapped in a slowly decaying society. Can't remember the title but hopefully someone else has it.

** I can't really see Voldemort regretting any of those things, to be honest. Mainly because Voldemort isn't an ideologial villain. He isn't Hitler, he isn't out to create a "utopia of blood status", he is in it for the power and life unending. He couldn't care less that the poor are poor or that population is declining, as long as he gets his castle and servants and people to torture when he's bored.

*** Concur.

I could easily see Voldemort moving on from Britain after winning his war there to start the same thing in another country. Meanwhile, the purebloods in Britain are playing their games at court and mostly oblivious to the decline of their country.

Voldemort comes home after another victorious campaign and has to put his house back in order.

*** Oh I don't mean he would regret his villainy, misdeeds or murders. Nor would he give up power. I'm not looking for any sort of redemption story.

However I'm pretty sure he has some idea of what he wishes to accomplish, what his ideal society to look like. What is all that power for? Just to have masses venerate him? I think he is fully capable of looking at the situation and admit that his policies and rule has not been exactly exemplary. It has produced a world that is more boring, more dull. That reality does not live up to the ideas he once had.

**** He is a narcissistic psychopath - has zero empathy/interest in other people or the rest of the world. So long as his own wants are being met (he has absolute control and is worshipped and feared) he doesn't care what else is going on.

There are stories like this, but they either have him as OOC or have him grow as a person over the course of centuries to the point where he does regret his actions.

***** links?

anyway it is too easy to fall into a trap and humanize him, or as you say "grow as a person". I think regretting his actions, and not being content with the outcome are two separate topics.

****** That's the thing though, his canon personality means he'll be happy with with the outcome so long as he is in control of everything.

As for links, it's been too long I just remeber that there were a few stories like that.

*** Voldemort strikes me as someone that would only be unhappy with annihilating everyone else because that would deprive him of people to wield power over. Then again, he might be content with ruling the ashes because there'd finally be nobody to threaten him - fear has always been one of his core motivators, after all.

** There's another one shot about that (aside from Wish Carefully), linkffn(4590039) Future Imperfect. A story focused on the future itself sounds excellent, though.

Edit: Actually, come to think of it, there's also HP & the Warrior's Code, linkffn(10673953), as well, where he also travels back because he regrets the dismal outcome. However, it's more centered around Harry's POV than it is Voldemort's, and it's incomplete.

  An odd, dark-haired man rescues Harry from the Dursleys when he's nine years old. Harry would have been thrilled if his saviour didn't claim to be a disillusioned madman come back in time to stop his other self from taking over the world. Add to that his apparent belief that Harry is important to his plans, and things become just a little bit complicated.
