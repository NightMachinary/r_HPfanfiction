Major divergence from the canon won't be necessary.

Harry is in his late 30s. He isn't Super Harry or too overpowered but has learnt a lot over the years. He is MoD and was unable to get rid of the elder wand & resurrection stone. He left his Auror job, and Quidditch Career because of he didn't like the fame. He then decided to learn about various forms of magic and occasionally going to other magical cultures (being the Man who conquered has perks). Somewhere along the way, he mastered the hallows completely and helps the ICW in emergencies, and has friends and contacts all over the world. (Basically following the footsteps of Dumbledore).

The MoD doesn't grant him immortality or super powers but additional control over the Hallows. He can call the elder wand to him anytime, and won't lose its allegiance. He has perfect invisibility (the cloak merged with him or something) and isn't detectable by magical/muggle methods. The stone doesn't affect him emotionally.

Over the years, he has become exceptionally skilled in magic, and can perform simple feats wandlessly.

Ginny is married to Harry, and has 3 children (from Canon). She plays quidditch but occasionally travels along with Harry.

Ron and Hermione are married and work in the ministry. Ron has taken over his father's post in Muggle Affairs, and with the help of Hermione (works in the same department and liaisons between the ministries), the department is one of the most important in the ministry.

In 2019 or 2020, when all (or almost all) the children are at Hogwarts, the Muggle Ministry (secret services, etc) beleives that a conspiracy to reveal the existence of Magic is underway and cause a war between muggles and wizards. The MoM (Kingsley) makes a special team to counter the threat. The Golden Trio are leading the team.

Some muggleborn / half blood could be the dark lord/lady behind the conspiracy with the sole aim of causing chaos and death.

Even though Harry can defeat the Dark Lord / Lady in combat, doing so while maintaining the secrecy is impossible. The ICW decides to stop hiding, and ending the secrecy on their own terms thus causing huge damages to the dark sides plans.

The reveal causes mixed reactions all over the world, but a series of issues (muggles vs magic war in some countries, economic issues due to merging both economies, trying to merge science and magic) becomes the next adventure for the Trio.

And please no Ron bashing (he is a loving husband and not abusive towards Hermione. I hate that trope). Ginny is also a great wife, and not someone who poisoned Harry with Amorentia.
