Where harry is dark and starts his own army, where harry is rebellious and gets magic tattoos, where harry has wings (just an idea), where harry is a demon, where harry is the commander of an army, where harry uses his parseltongue power to control and/or talk to dragons/basilisks/snakes or he has a snake familiar, and lastly a story where harry uses guns.


** Well it sound like you are asking for an awful fanfic, but I am going to give you an awesome one. It has almost everything you wanted. Harry is kind of a demon, he is rebellious and he actually has wings from time to time, he has used a gun to shoot someone. And the best part? This might be one of the best fics in the fandom. If you haven't read it yet you are missing out. The Denarian Trilogy is a must read. Don't get scared by the fact that it is a crossover, you don't need to know anything about the other book to understand what is going on. linkffn(3473224)

  Harry has wings

linkffn(2686394)

Don't get turned off by the summary, the fic is really good, although it has little to do with the Harry Potter world. It's almost like a separate fantasy novel with Harry as the main character.

Turning to their own war plans, they create an inner circle and begin recruiting assassin, spies, ticking time bombs. A group of rag tag students will become an army. Can this give Harry the opening to defeat the Dark Lord? Inspired by Red Dawn.

** Cold blood by derlacroix for wings.

My darkness ascendant story has an eleven year old harry with a dark army already and he'll get a magic tattoo in fourth year. and grounded for life. He'll also use guns. Oh, and my stttng/hp story has guns, armies(well, navies actually), and potentially lightsabers for shipboard combat.

Emperor by marquis black for command, I think, havent gotten very far.

Godemperorless heathens and its sequels by littlewhitecat for guns, army.
