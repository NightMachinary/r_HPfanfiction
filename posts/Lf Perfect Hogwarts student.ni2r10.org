I have a very biased opinion on what should be the perfect Hogwarts student, and im mad because it happens so rarely you probably didn't notice, and when i mean perfect i mean it, He's has to be as Cunning and Ambitious as a Slytherin Brave and Noble as a Gryffindor Intelligent and Knowledgeable as a Ravenclaw And Hard working and Loyal as a Hufflepuff And usually when the have all this qualities isn't mentioned... the only example i have, is Harry from Linkao3(Say a Prayer) This version of Harry is raised by Loki, so he's cunning and a little trickster, he's Knowledgeable because Loki teach him how to be Clever, His Ambition/Dream is take the Wizards to Another Planet so he's for sure a Hard Worker cause he's creating a Wizard Space Program from Zero , He creates a Clubhouse were he's loyal to his friends Obviously as a Gryffindor he's Brave and Noble, (Tom Riddle becomes sane, and Harry even forgives him) So I'm searching for more Perfect Hogwarts student fanfics like this one


** I think I remember one like this where he builds a colony on the dark side of the moon for wizards, but I can't remember the name so I'll have to try and find it. It's the only one I can think of where he is like that.
