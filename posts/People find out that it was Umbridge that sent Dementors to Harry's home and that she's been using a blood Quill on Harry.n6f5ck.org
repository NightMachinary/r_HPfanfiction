** Pretty sure they find out in canon.

It's just that everyone either already hated her or would approve of that behaviour.

*** The blood quill thing became common knowledge. Harry has permanent scarring on his hand because of it. Umbridge didn't get in trouble for it because it wasn't illegal: the idea that it was is entirely fanon.

You are allowed to torture students at Hogwarts. It is explicitly stated that before Dumbledore became Headmaster, persistent troublemakers would be whipped, hung from the ceiling in chains, or even put on a rack. Filch keeps the chains and torture devices well-maintained in the hopes of one day being allowed to torture misbehaving students.

It's also legal to dose someone with amorentia. Vane did not get in trouble for what she tried to pull with Harry.

Wizards appear to have extraordinarily lax laws when it comes to torturing, maiming, mind-controlling, and raping people. I have no evidence to prove this, but it's logical to suppose that the reason they don't care about these things so much is because they can just fix the damage it causes with a wave of a wand or a potion. A school nurse regrew all the bones in somebody's arm overnight with spicy soup. I can't even begin to comment on all the logistical problems that would have, like how in the hell the ligaments somehow reattached themselves to the bones automatically.

Only spell damage via dark magic seems to have any true permanence, re: Alastor Moody. I'm pretty sure somebody could legitimately have an arm or a leg cut off, and then get it reattached almost immediately with a spell as long as it wasn't a dark cutting curse that did it. It might even be possible to survive a beheading if you were quick about it.

The assassination attempt never became common knowledge, however. It never came to light that the Ministry attempted to assassinate Harry Potter, or that she and her Inquisitorial Squad were using/were going to use the Unforgivables on students. Umbridge was given life in Azkaban after the war, but that was for her behavior after she joined with Voldemort's administration.

Because, you know. The world is absolutely divided up between good people and Death Eaters, and both Sirius Black and Albus Dumbledore are daft and provably wrong. A monstrous woman who hates and fears Lord Voldemort to such an extent that she's willing to torture students with Unforgivable curses to stop them from talking about him would definitely sign up with him immediately the moment he revealed himself and seized power. That is how things work.

Great lesson, Rowling. Very high levels of nuance and world building, here.

**** I don't think she was motivated by hate and fear for Voldemort. She hated anything that contradicted the Ministry. She'd be the one saying you need to believe 2+2=5 because the Minister said so. The Ministry's official position was that Voldemort was still dead, so she attacked anyone who disagreed. Then when Voldemort was the Ministry, she happily went along with whatever he wanted. "Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia" --probably someone who admired Dolores Umbridge.

**** I saw it as less she fears Voldemort and more that she's just interested in sucking up to whoever is currently in charge and grabbing as much power as she can.

So she'll go along with Fudge's nonsense because he's minister and he'll let her treat Hogwarts as her own little dictatorship.\\
And then when Voldemort takes over she's happy to be part of his even more authoritarian government, because getting to snatch people of the streets just for being different is the kind of power that woman dreams of.

There's also the fact she was always a bigot and probably quite liked the whole genocide idea.
