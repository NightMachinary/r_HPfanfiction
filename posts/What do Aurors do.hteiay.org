They're described as elite dark-wizard catchers, but what we actually see them do is apparently patrol Hogsmeade and guard the Prime Minister as personal bodyguards under disguise. They're also not very elite, as zero out of three aurors defeat the Death Eaters in the battle of the Department of Mysteries. Tonks gets knocked out (and eventually killed), Moody gets knocked out (and eventually killed) and Bellatrix obliterates Kingsley (who just goes on to guard the Prime Minister). The out of practice werewolf is the only one left standing by the end of the battle. Frank and Alice didn't stand a chance against Lestranges and the Crouch, but Word of God is that Moody says Gideon and Fabian Prewett only went out after fighting five Death Eaters, among of which was Dolohov, who killed Lupin (aka only one left standing). The power discrepancy is staggering, as is their job (bodyguard, patrol, Investigator, FBI or SWAT?)

There's the dubious nature of how many aurors you'll actually need. I imagine dark wizards aren't in abundance most years, unless Aurors act not just nationally, but globally as well. They only seemed to be active in the two wars. The only time we hear of aurors acting in their capacity is when Kingsley is hunting Sirius and we know even that is fruitless because he never actually found him. And even as they're patrolling they let slip Katie's necklace, a dark object, can't fish out someone is under the imperius AND on top of that Death Eaters enter the school through a schoolboy. Dawlish, Proudfoot, Savage and Tonks really are something, extremely elite.


** my headcanon, which can probably be disproved if you just look on Pottermore, is that the Aurors were created during the first wizarding war to combat Voldemort by crouch during the Bagnold government because she seems like the kind of person to construct a force of elite dark-wizard catchers. And these are the hyper-competent Aurors we here about.

However, after you know who was vanquished, though they were not disbanded (because people were still paranoid about dark wizards (see how easily the mention of you-know-who makes them flinch)) they were scaled back.

then the Fudge government being controlled by Malfoy / Malfoy type figures did all they could to defund/weaken the Auror force (promoting people like Dawlish, reducing training, ect.....) during Year 5, where only DE's and the OOTP knew what was happening.

This could go some-ways to explaining how the ministry, which held out for all the last war, held out for just 2 years in the second wizarding blood war; the DE's defanged the Auror force.

Now yes the type of person to make auror is probably talented enough to self study potions but they have to be motivated to. One bad teacher can spoil a subject for a student let alone 5 years of that teacher. I think lots of people who were excited about potions probably lost their interest/passion for the subject after having to endure his classes.

Luckily my 11th grade math teacher (and every other teacher in the school, she really was the Umbridge type) picked up the pieces of my shambles self confidence and took me in as a favorite student. Now, I ended up going into English anyways, but he was always a supporter of me in math and even after I graduated would argue w me that I should do math not English. If he hadn't been there I absolutely would've given up math completely because of one year w that bitch. I can't imagine having her for 5 years AND it be a dangerous, required subject!

****** Snape has his faults and is a bully but having high standards isn't one of them. Aurors are supposed to be the elite, they're supposed to have high standards.

If I was in charge of recruitment for Aurors I'd keep the standards as is. The Riddle/Dumbledore prodigies can still make it, lowering it just means you get more unqualified candidates. Sounds harsh but magical special forces should have standards. Special forces selection is gruelling with a high drop out rate, which mirrors the Auror selection process when McGonagall says they haven't taken on anyone in years.

******* I agree that aurors should have a grueling selection process and that they should not lower their standards. However you have to keep in mind that snape is not the instructor for auror recruits. He is the potions teacher for standard education for the whole country. He's not dealing with adults who have graduated and are looking to enter a very selective profession he is dealing with children who are still developing. And since he is abrasive rather than supportive or even neutral those children focus on developing skills other than potions. Also for the record I do not believe prodigies like dumbledore/riddle tend to join law enforcement and even if they did one person a generation is hardly enough to fill out the auror department.

***** I don't buy that last one personally.. when you combine that with the fact that you also need NEWTs to become a healer, and presumably a professional potions brewer, as well people aiming for full on masteries like Snape has.. very few of the people that do get into NEWT potions, never mind pass, will be likely to aim for the Aurors..

Edit:

If 100 kids show up at age 11, 20% get the grades and are willing to do NEWT potions, that's 20, if 10% fail that's 18 people.. that's not very many to split between the aforementioned jobs.. And that 100 seems fairly optimistic (and was chosen to make the math easier)

#+end_quote

I'm not sure they are, at least not beyond the way that the armed officers in SO15 are going to be good shots. Where are they presented as James Bond in the text? OP's point on their combat skills is "They're also not very elite, as zero out of three aurors defeat the Death Eaters in the battle of the Department of Mysteries".

Pottermore says:

"An Auror is "a Dark wizard catcher". They are an elite group of witches and wizards, loyal to the Ministry of Magic , whose mission is to fight against and capture the forces of the Dark Arts.

Aurors are like a police force, and sometimes work as intelligence agents. They have the authority to arrest malefactors like Death Eaters, and at times have been given authority to use deadly force against Death Eaters in particular."

A police force that sometimes work as intelligence agents sounds very Special Branchy to me. They seem like elite law enforcement rather than elite combat units.

Wikipedia says:

"Special Branch had responsibility for, among other things, personal protection of (non-royal) VIPs and performing the role of examining officer at designated ports and airports, as prescribed by the Terrorism Act 2000.

The intelligence work of Special Branch was often overlooked in some circles. This is because its role sat somewhere between that of the Security Service (MI5) and that of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch (SO13). Special Branch officers were usually the ones to perform arrests of suspected spies, since Security Service officers are not authorised to take such actions; an example being the Portland Spy Ring."

No, I don't think Kingsley was saying Sirius was in Tibet because the Aurors have jurisdiction in Tibet. He's picked Tibet /because/ it's a far away place that means he doesn't have to go there and try to arrest him.

Saying he's in Manchester, for example, would be equally wrong but he'd be expected to leave the office and attempt to find him in Manchester because it's in his jurisdiction.

** Personally, I imagine the closest American-applicable term for them is the Secret Service, not SWAT or FBI. They were used for something else (art or financial fraud, I think?) and then got coopted into their current protective/important places security guard role when a President got assassinated and the Government realised not bodyguarding their leader is probably a bit of a misstep.

So, I see them originally being purely Dark Wizard catchers, but since that didn't come up very often, the budget-conscious Ministry co-opted them into protective/bodyguard roles for the Minister and perhaps Department Heads, then security-guard roles for the (like, four?) important places the British Wizarding Community has (Diagon, Hogsmeade, The Ministry, and St. Mungos). Over time, they let that become their primary role while the Dark-Wizard stuff falls to the wayside.

Since Dark Wizards don't come around very often and it's no longer their primary role anyway, they get out of practice with all of that end of their job and get lazy. It's the only In-World explanation I've got for why Aurors were so shit against an apparent minority of what were basically Idle Rich Pseudo-Aristocrats and Ex-Cons. The canon situation with them is basically like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Jeff Bezos Rambo'ed and John-Wick'ed their way through the entire FBI. :D

Doylistically, they're basically just Harry Potter's version of redshirts - they die to show how 'serious' the situation is and how tough an enemy is so Harry lucking out and beating them looks more impressive.

** In canon, you're pretty much right (though Kingsley takes down a couple DEs before Bellatrix beats him, IIRC).

When JKR introduced them in GOF, they were meant to be these super cool, elite dark wizard catchers. But then over time the needs of the plot meant that they couldn't be effective in that role (else Harry et al would have less to do) and also narrative simplicity meant that other roles got given to Aurors simply because that was easier than introducing other jobs.

In fanfiction, I like to take them back to their roots: elite, specialised, and small in number. They're not cops or law enforcement, they're basically bounty-hunters than the Ministry has authorised with state power. They work alone, not with partners, and can spend years tracking down a single dark wizard.

As for the rest of law enforcement, that gets distributed around the rest of the DMLE. Full breakdown in the below Ministry org chart:

** Well, er, of course Kingsley never caught Sirius. I wonder why?

And as for Bellatrix, she was the crème de la crème of Voldemort's followers. Basically better than even an elite Auror or two (but not Mrs Weasley, I guess).

But you could sort of mostly blame it on the fact that JKR had to make the main characters do something. Notice how it's mostly Harry who does a lot of the action, with everything else happening in the background? It's his POV, and his story.

Also note that the more realistic outcome of the Dept of Mystery battle would've been for nearly all of the Death Eaters (except for Dolohov and Bellatrix) to be taken down by the Order of the Phoenix without needing Dumbledore to save their asses.

The gap between the Ministry action (June) and the mass breakout (January) was about five or so months, so I can understand the recently freed Death Eaters being recuperated and all. But that does not excuse the narrative having made a group containing two Aurors be near useless against them.

The Death Eaters had the superior numbers, sure, but you'd think that Moody, Tonks, and Kingsley would've had the necessary training to deal with that. And they had Sirius and Lupin to assist them as well.

It's the backs-against-the-wall thing that puts drama and builds the plot up to its climax. The same could be said for the Aurors not spotting Katie or doing the sensible thing and searching as many people's packages during the Hogsmeade trip as they could.

Maybe JKR didn't want to write the Aurors as a sort of Deus Ex Machina of sorts. It's the same mindset like those action shows where the main characters do everything, and then the police only arrive (sirens blaring) right at the end, when everything's done.

Does it make sense? Not really. But it's the easy way the pep up the main characters, despite having the resources to do better.

** They catch dark wizards. They're just bad at their jobs.

The MoM was created to maintain the Statute of Secrecy. There isn't really a position in the MoM that has the fighting power the Aurors have. No one knows what Unspeakables do and what we know of their work it seems to be mostly R&D. By all accounts the Aurors were probably decimated during the first wizarding war. Voldemort reportedly had an army of Inferi made up of the people he killed; which is crazy bonkers.

Why they are bad is probably because of a number of reasons. Corruption in the ministry, terrible education, high mortality rate, competing with dark magic, etc.

** My theory is that their just cops. Police. Some are good, some are bad, some are lucky, some are unlucky. Some stay out of political debates and some leap into it head first - whether they take the “right” side or “wrong” side is up to their mortal beliefs. They're humans and are susceptible to greed, seduction, and fear. I'd like to think they're are many great Aurors worth their salt but who knows? Maybe the more talented witch and wizards go on to do things far less dangerous, someone a lot of “muggles” do in our world. Instead of being a cop you could be a security guard, body guard, personal trainer - still all dangerous but less dangerous than being a straight up cop. Wizards have options too, I'd like to think. The Malfoy's would be much more inclined to hire a private body guard than as the Aurors for help - and they're not the only ones. I'm not good on history but if a police force went up against a serious gang - well, I wouldn't think the police would come out unscathed. I'd think they'd lose a lot of their men, because unlike the gang the police has to follow regulation. An all out war like Hogwarts is different of course but still, the idea is the same. An officer (or Auror) might hesitate shooting/spelling to kill whereas the bad guys? No pause. No blink. Just shooting/spelling blindly trying to take down/hurt/kill as many bodies as possible. And, I'd like to think, there was probably a few really great auror's working for the ministry who kept their heads down. Why join Dumbledore who /might/ win the war? Why join Voldemort who /might/ win the war? Best to keep your head down and mouth shut. But who knows. Maybe they were all the Aurors had to give. The ministry is a joke, after all, so it wouldn't be to surprising to see the Auror's being a joke to by mere association.

** Totally agreed. Aurors are meant to be really powerful and strong but the story made them out to be a joke. I think it is simply that the author wanted the Order and D.A. members to appear as the better counterpart, and it came at the expense of removing the effectiveness of professional Aurors. Or she simply didn't pay attention to making the Aurors important.

John Dawlish should be one of the finest in Auror Office considering he got Outstanding in all his N.E.W.T.s, but he's portrayed as a tragically funny character who can be confunded or get defeated by Augusta Longbottom, a women with no Auror training and probably unfit for dueling.

You really hit the nail on the part where Aurors are portrayed as redundant wizards.

** I've always attributed the Aurors (and Order of the Phoenix members) failing against Death Eaters because of the choice of spells. While some Unforgivables might be permitted by the Ministry against Death Eaters, I imagined the DE more freely used dark arts and dangerous curses that Aurors wouldn't use and probably wouldn't know how to counter given the state of DADA courses for decades.

Every writer chooses what they do differently, and in my headcanon, it's some odd combination of Special Branch or MI5-MI6, with the Department of Mysteries and Unspeakables being something like Boniface at Bletchley Park.

I've only seen the first Fantastic Beasts film, so the American version of Aurors seems more like a typical American detective.

*** The problem is that you really don't need dark arts to win fights, in fact outside of the killing curse they're really not especially useful. Dark arts seem to be more about nasty long term effects that can't be healed than especially effective stopping power.\\
Most dark curses don't seem to be any more useful than a stunning spell. And it's not like the order are opposed to lethal force anyway.

** First off, you shouldn't generalize characters and then complain.

The aurors go down first /because/ they're dangerous, but not dangerous enough (Dumbledore, for example, is much more dangerous than any auror, and any regular wizard would be an easy prey for an auror). They're also fighting in unfamiliar terrain with their opponents using unforgivable spells. I'd also guess that they're specifically targeted, practised against and have a few common spells.

And there are /always/ dark wizards, just not ones that are very powerful. There's a reason places like Knockturn Alley exist.

#+begin_quote
  And even as they're patrolling they let slip Katie's necklace, a dark object, can't fish out someone is under the imperius AND on top of that Death Eaters enter the school through a schoolboy.
#+end_quote

There's no way they could have avoided that on their own. Aurors are just an attempt to even the scales, but magic is too versatile and the /primary/ job of Aurors is to reduce the number of ways in which an event can go wrong / be compromised.

** The dark lord isn't instructing his Death Eaters to capture Aurors to bring them back to the dark lord for trial. Death Eaters are just killing mofos. The aurors, like policemen, are hobbled by their mandate for justice; capture, bring to trial and incarcerate. Aurors are simply not allowed to use the lethal spells that will take somebody down fast. It's kind of like pop guns versus AK's. ( see what I did there)

It just seems like dark magic is strictly better in combat, and the magic cops don't use it because it's bad M'Kay. Besides just think of all the plot points that would not have happened if aurors were good at their job. With JKR's staunch moral opposition to the good guys taking lives, I wouldn't be surprised if an auror who accidentally killed someone was drummed out of the service.

*** Nah, this is down to it being a limited third person point of view. We know of two other professions: Bill Weasley is a Curse Breaker for Gringotts, and Charlie Weasley works at a Dragon Preserve. So there are other options, it's just that most of the people that Harry knows of work in one of the professions that you listed. It's a fallacy to think that just because something isn't mentioned, that it doesn't exist. In the context of a story, it simply means that it wasn't important to the story. For example, we never hear about Harry needing to go to the bathroom, or brush his teeth, or any of that stuff, because it's not important to the story. But we can assume that he still does these things.
