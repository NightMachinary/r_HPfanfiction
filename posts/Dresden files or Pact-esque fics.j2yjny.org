Any fics like dresden files or Pact that have magic as more magical and interesting. Victoria Potter has this sort of. Is there any more fics with magic about connections and actions and words rather than just pointing a stick and shouting?


** The Denarian Trilogy by Shezza, High Prophet of Harry Potter Fanfiction. Read the Azkaban story by him too. There's also Prince of the Dark Kingdom, where Harry gets raised by Voldemort.
