That's essentially it. I think it might have been in an alternative dimension or not, and Grindelwald fights Voldemort at some point whilst Harry is busy doing something else/is in a bad position.

I can't remember if it's any good or not, it's probably at least a 5-year old fic, I keep thinking about this plot point though so I'd like to see it again.

Thank you !


** There's a certain fic that I'm not going to name that is literally going to be a 200-250k word setup because I wanted to write a sequel that deals with this topic.

** Well, Grindelwald was freed from prison after Dumbledore's Death in Unbroken Universe. But the rest of the details suggest that may not be it. Still linkffn(Promises Honored;Promises Unbroken;Promises Remembered;Promises Defended)

  He made the choice knowing full well what the consequences might be, but expecting death does not necessarily prepare you for hell. In 1981, Sirius Black ignored the dangers to himself and became the Potters' Secret Keeper. Prequel to Promises Unbroken,AU

** That sounds like greengecko's Resonance Trilogy, I think that part didn't happen until the third story.
