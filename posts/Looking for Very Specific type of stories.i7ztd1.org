Any stories where Harry is kidnapped by the Death Eaters (Or any other group), found by The Order or such and rescued and it deals with the after effects of his time with the Death Eaters (or whatever group captured him).

Maybe his viewpoints are changed dramatically, maybe he starts taking things more serious, gets stronger/smarter. (Though if he does I'd like it to be relatively believably, instead of just automatically OP). et cetra.

Would rather not have Weasley bashing (if at all possible, though I understand that might be difficult, so if there is, that's okay).

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash, threesomes or not. Doesn't have to focus on a pairing.

Can be on any site, anyone can be the main character, can be completed or not.

  “I was going to kill you,” Grindelwald said nonchalantly, twirling the wand in his hand. Harry's blood ran cold, all too aware of his own vulnerability. He inadvertently recalled the row of followers in the back of the dungeon, their reverence and fear of the lord undeniable. "What changed?" Harry asked, quiet but daring. His heart was beating loud in his chest, adrenaline beginning to pump through his veins. Grindelwald's piercing eyes finally turned to him, tracing his features unabashedly. “Your resemblance to the Potters.”At the mercy of the powerful Gellert Grindelwald, an amnesiac Harry Potter reluctantly accepts an undercover mission to assist in his search for the Hallows. Only, the young wizard finds himself involved in far more dangerous matters than he could have ever imagined.
