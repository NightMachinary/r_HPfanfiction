I am interested in good stories and I try to create good stories.

I do not always succeed, but not for lack of trying.

I am a Harmonian, though I am not averse to being a Harmolunian.

May 25,2017

ok, here's another update.

I got this review today from the ever present 'guest'

:At the end as in all the stories you do the same stupidity, saving bigots, r* and bullies with the exception of the dursley. So same s* on different worlds but as you are exactly as the morons pure blood so the dursley pay, the pure blood get brain wash. Also this story as all the other are just full of crap and so many grammatical error, name change from chapter to chapter something that I interpreted as simple as you been incapable of at least try to use the name correctly as you do not know them that is lazy s*. As you are an arrogant moron, you can go and start crying where ever you are subscribe that someone one more time show how bad you are at writing.

well, I guess I am simple and not worth the air I breath, I shall bow down to the ever so Holy and Unassailable 'Guest' and kill myself.

but first, let's go over the qualifications of 'Guest'

- let's see, nothing ever written or published, check

- no reputation for anything other than trolls and flames, check

- too scared of comments that they must remain anonymous, check.

'Guest', you left out the parts saying I dress funny and drive the wrong car, oh, you would know because you are 14 and at the age where you know everything.

So, 'Guest', I will give you the same advice given to me by an old artist some decades ago:

"Do your art for yourself, and don't let other's opinions matter, because opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and they all stink.'

That said,'guest' I will do what I want, and publish it or not, and invite you to go fuck yourself, since I don't care what YOU think.

If it was a signed opinion I might take you thoughts and think about them, and if I found a valid point I MIGHT change something, but since you are a coward who doesn't matter, What goes around comes around.

Sincerely, Tim Williams
