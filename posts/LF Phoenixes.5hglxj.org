Looks for fics that have Phoenixes (plural) as a major roll in the story. Lots of fics talk about Phoenix feathers, tear and ashes. Where do they come from when the only known Phoenix in the Harry Potter world is Fawkes?


** You are mistaken- while Fawkes is the only one ever shown 'on screen', [[https://www.hp-lexicon.org/creature/birds/phoenix/][the Moutohora Macaws (New Zealand) Quidditch team have a phoenix for a mascot. His name, appropriately enough, is Sparky (QA8)]].

Also, Ollivander is known to use Phoenix feathers in his wands, but Fawkes is known to only ever have provided two.

There is a nifty bit in linkffn(A Long Journey Home by rakeesh) where Jasmine visits Avalon with a friend to discuss getting a feather from one of the flock who live there.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

  AU/AO: [HG/SS] What-if Story. Hermione Granger gets erased due to a badly phrased, vague, and bitter wish. She is Hermione Granger no more. Now, thanks to Ron, she is Hermione Ankaa Black, sister of Sirius and Regulus Black, and member of the Noble and Most House of Black. Now what is she going to do? Multiple pairings in later chapters, and JP starts out as a rampaging jerk.
