May be a shot in the dark, but does anyone know of any fics where Draco leaves with the Golden Trio that night at Malfoy Manor when they're captured? Possibly having helped them escape.


** While i do love the thought, the problem with the execution is that Draco has the dark mark. Like, voldemort would be able to find the golden trio and malfoy real quick.

Edit: thought this was a prompt, sorry. Gonna keep the comment up anyways, but i hope you find a story that suits it realistically!!

**** Many places that had the fidilius charm got ransacked in many different forms (think yaxley & grimmauld place via accident). The dark mark is like the physical form of the taboo. If you have it, he can summon you to him, or you can accidently summon him to you. Imagine draco trying to help, going to sleep, next thing he knows the whole place burns down daddy lovegood style because he accidently put his arm under the pillow (Tbh that could be a plot on its own). I guess it could work if you got rid of the whole basis behind the mark, but it wouldn't be realistic.

***** The reason the fidelius broke with yaxley is because when dumbledore died, everyone who knew the secret becomes the secret keeper. Hermione accidentally apparated yaxley onto the doorstep, revealing it to him and making him a secret keeper, nothing to do with the dark mark in this instance.

****** As i said "Many places that had the fidilius charm got ransacked in many different forms". That wasn't me stating it was because of the dark mark, i even stated "via accident" referencing the hermione situation. I stated that to explain why the fidelius charm doesn't always work. You could say the same for shell cottage the instant draco becomes aware of it (because, of course, at that point in the novels he's a death eater whether we like it or not).

Edit: i feel at this point I've accidentally hijacked the post, so im done with the convo. If you want to debate more dm me, otherwise help this poor soul find what they were looking for.

  Everyone finds out where Draco's loyalties really lie, and it's not where everyone thinks....
