What are some significant things you remember about fandom/reading fanfiction back in the early days (for me that was late 90's, early 00's)? Things that might seem crazy, or funny now, especially if the technology we have today has made that thing so much easier to do?

For example (long story ahead): Reading the comments on the post about FicSave made me think about workarounds I had to go through to read fanfiction when I was younger. /Back in the old days of dial-up/ I used to load all the chapters into different IE windows (pre-Mozilla Firefox days too, lol), and then put them into a Word document to read so that I wasn't hogging the phone line. Then a few years ago when when I got a phone that supported java, I had an application that converted text files to .jar

My friends and I in high school would print out fanfiction in 8x13" paper, 6 columns, font size 4, keep them in clearbooks and then share them with each other in between/during class. Someone would have pages 1-2, another would have pages 3-4, etc. It sucked if the one who came before you was a slower reader, haha.

The worst thing that happened was that our English teacher confiscated one of the pages because someone was reading during a school event. No one was punished, but hopefully the page he got wasn't a sex scene, lol. Our fic of choice then was dramione and cardcaptor sakura fanfiction. In hindsight, the fics we read back then were awful, D:

TL;DR, not sure if this is something discussion-worthy, but I'm definitely interested in hearing stories if anyone has them, :). I've always loved how fanfiction has brought people from all over the world together.


** What I really notice these days is how much the quality has shot up in fanfiction. I remember when that old gem Harry Potter and the Psychic Serpent linkffn(288212) was the high watermark of what the fandom produced.\\
Particular to the potter fandom was the glut of divergence fics after GoF with everyone trying to figure out where things would go next during the big wait until OoP, I think very few of us expected Voldemort to remain in the shadows for as long as he did. A lot of stories kicked off with an all out attack on either Privet Drive or The Burrow and not a small number had the masquerade completely dropped by mid way through fifth year.

** Back then I read a bunch of one-shots, usually romance. These days I generally don't read anything under 30k words unless it's specifically recommended.

My favorite author (or rather, the only one from back then whose name I can remember) was subversa, and this was back when people actually used mugglenet's fanfiction site and stuff was added daily.

I kinda miss mugglenet's fanfiction site, because back then the side bar was always updated with new stories.

And there were so many ways to end the war, or for it to be fought, no mention of artifacts like horcruxes (I've only come across immortality granting objects completed before DH once!).

I also spent a lot of time reading it in the school library, being careful about which computer I used.

*** one-shots were my usual go-to for angst, XD.

I had a bookmark full of sites I used to go to, including mugglenet, schnoogle, hpff. I liked how they had lists for "most favorited, most reviewed" There was also probably a site for every ship under the sun, haha.

I hear you - there was much more room for speculation before the second half of the books came out. I also remember people putting up ship manifestos on LiveJournal, on why A and B belong together and not B & C or D or E.

** Fanfiction has kept me sane /[citation needed]/ from Year 6 and counting. I started off in the Ranma fandom, which was cool, but it was losing traction even back then. My first reading of [[http://www.soulriders.net/brian/archives/zen/bitter.htm][The Bitter End]] left me in tears. Lol.

It didn't even cross my mind that Harry Potter fics were a thing until a couple of years later. Found H/Hr, and stuck with it. I actually got my Mum to print off a good 80k at work so that I could read it on the go. The strange thing is, I can't even remember its name... darn.

We tried writing one among friends at around the same time: one chapter each in a rotation of three. I finish mine, where Harry's angsting about life because Hermione might not like him (this was pre-OoTP, but there's absolutely no excuse). Like all good friends would, the next guy up (let's call him John) opens with the following:

/'It was a grey-as-fuck morning in the Great Hall. Harry sat down to eat beans on toast, but he didn't feel like beans. He grumbled.'/

And on went the rotation.

*** "It was a grey-as-fuck morning"

No words in the history of English Literature have ever been so poetic.

*** LOL. That sounds like fun.

I deleted most of my HP fanfiction, it kept making me cringe reading it, haha. I kept one just to remind myself of how bad I used to be.

** the first fanfic I remember reading was Starsky & Hutch written by a friend. This same friend started writing a Facts of Life fic (by hand) and a group of us would share the pages as they were written and then a couple of us started contributing. This was BTI (before the internet). I may still have a floppy disk with part of the FoL story on it, typed on a Commodore 64.

I also still have about 20 one inch binders of fanfic from The Sentinel bought from someone online and probably a handful of X Files crossover fics that I printed out right before I killed my AOL account.

(it's been a long strange trip)

*** I really didn't like HHr back then. Was hardcore DHr, but that petered off into becoming more ship-agnostic. I've read some HHr in the last few years that I liked.

When I introduced my sister to fanfiction, she mainly read HHr. I regretted introducing her to fanfiction though because we ended up fighting over PC time, haha.

These kids today, with their fibre opticals and smarty thingamajigs...
