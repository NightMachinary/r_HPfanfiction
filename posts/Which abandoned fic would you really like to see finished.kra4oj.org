As we all know, a lot of good fics get abandoned or go a long time without updates for one reason or another.

Which fic would you love to see get picked up again by the author?


** It's been the same answer for basically my whole year in the fandom - A Long Journey Home, by Rakeesh.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** The Marriage Stone by Josephine Darcy

Snarry aside, this had one of the best explorations of magical theory and even established a magical class structure, reminiscent of our human one and touched upon those issues. I think the author doesn't want to come back to it, which I respect, but a girl can dream...

** “James and Me by Northumbrian” linkao3(8402590). In desperation I wrote even my own closure (linkao3(23267857)), but I still wonder what Northumbrian planned for the end (and how he finally resolves “Strangers at Drakeshaugh”, because these seems to me quite unfinished).

** James and Me.

And also [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6574535/1/Unlike-a-Sister][Unlike a Sister]]... even though I don't really read Harmony any more, this was the first fic I can remember reading that was abandoned.

Oh.... and also To The Ordinary World. But, um, that's one of my abandoned fics so I can actually do something about that one. The reason I nominate it specifically is because I even designed it to be pretty short (four, five chapters or so) to defeat my inability to finish things. Which reminds me, I must edit out the references to Neville and Lavender as their function in the (unwritten part of the) plot has been replaced with Ludo Bagman and these random muggle holidaymakers.

** I desperately wish someone could post the material DrizzleWizzle had ready for his Slytherin!Harry series. He completed 5 books (the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10298096/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Emerald-Trance][Order of the Phoenix]] one is mind blowing and works so powerfully because of the build up from the previous books). He posted the first few chapters of the sixth with an authors note that it was finished but it hasn't been updated since 2015. Damn, it's so good. It's one of those I'm tempted to say is better than canon.
