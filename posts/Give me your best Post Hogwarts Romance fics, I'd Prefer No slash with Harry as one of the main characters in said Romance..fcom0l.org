I won't condemn slash, I'd just prefer no slash but if you must keep Draco or Snape or any death eater as far away from me as possible. Draco is fine as a side character, I just don't want him as a love interest with Harry.

** linkffn(What We Lost by JacobApples) this is my absolute favorite romance fic ever. Harry and Andromeda. Andy is catatonic while taking care of Teddy due to all her family dying. Harry comes by and takes it upon himself to help raise Teddy.

linkffn(The Favour by mrs.milfoy) Harry agrees to take Narcissa on a date to the theater so Draco can go bang his lady friend in peace. A romance blooms between Potter and Narcissa.

Epilogue of linkffn(The Pureblood Princess by TheE dless7) i absolutely adore it as a one-shot. The story it's attached to not so much.

linkffn(A Different Life by phoenixgirl26) Potter/Tonks. Tonks lives due to dreamless sleep potion. Potter puts life on hold to help care for her and Teddy.

linkffn(Beltane Child by White Angel of Auralon) Harry and Daphne bang in costume during a festival. Daphne becomes pregnant and goes on search for the father after the war. (Can't remember if this is post hogwarts but it's definitely post the war.)

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards

** Linkffn(Marry You by Dorothea Greengrass)

She has another fic that fits that I can't quite remember the name of- 'From London to Southampton and Beyond' or something similar? The one with the cruise ship.

I've read a lot of these honestly(Mostly HP/DG and HP/OC which is arguably very similar), and I'm stuck on mobile presently. I can find more in a couple weeks when I'm back at my PC. I'll try to remember.

  Harry and Daphne find themseves trapped in a hasty marriage after a drunken night, and there is no way out. How will they cope with that?

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.
