Any fic where the main character (probably Harry, but other character is OK) is Dark or becomes a Dark Lord/Lady and actually does villainous things.

Can be sympathetic and misguided, or even trying to do the right thing, but they actually kill people, they do real dark magic (not "This totally benign blood magic is considered Dark because the Ministry is dumb!"), they make morally questionable decisions. Basically, anything other than "Dark!Harry" who is really just Edgy!Snarky!Slytherin!Harry.

​

Bonus points- the character starts out well-meaning but goes down a dark path

​

Bonus Bonus- Character has different motives/ideology from Voldemort.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13045929/1/Reformed-Returned-and-Really-Trying][Reformed, Returned, and Really Trying]], linkffn(13045929), seems to be fit your request very well:

- Main characters (Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna) going dark
- Trying to do the right thing
- Killed lots of people (Death Eaters, Ministry Aurors, and many others)
- Morally questionable decisions: looting, torture, and inciting violent uprisings in other countries
- They started out just like at the end of canon HBP, but got progressively meaner as the war went on
- They were diametrically opposed to Voldemort and his ideologies.

  AU. With Albus dead, there's only one wizard left continue his fight. His oldest friend. His true love. There's no better choice for defeating a Dark Lord bent on murdering all muggleborns than the one wizard who gathered them under his banner once before. True, things went a little out of hand, but Gellert Grindelwald has changed. Now, if only everyone else would realise this...
