This fic had a female Harry Potter named Meredith Potter, nicknamed "Merry" and the pairing was Voldemort/Meredith or Tom Riddle Jr./ Meredith. It had quite a few chapters and I believe the two met each other in dreamspace? Anyway, as the story progresses Meredith slowly becomes darker and even raises the suspicions of Hermione if I remember correctly. This fic was posted on fanfiction.net.


** I think it was Rumor Has It by Parker K. Harvelle, but it looks like it's been deleted.
