This is part of what I recall as a favorite --but I can't remember the title. Tonks falls under a DE spell, Dumbledore turns a present into a port key to get Ginny back to the UK (hoping to get Harry to follow), and the kids take OWLS in South Africa.

Does this sound familiar to anyone else? I'd like to read it again. Thanks.


** Almost positive it is Perilous Journey by Sbmcneil [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8281675/1/Perilous-Journey]]
