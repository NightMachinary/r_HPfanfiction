**** The only ones I've read from your list are /Circular Reasoning, Too Young to Die, and Emperor/, and in neither of them is Harry evil --- merely immoral (granted, I don't remember that much from /Circular Reasoning/).

But in context of those stories I could recommend (descending by quality)

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4916690][HE & the Spiral Path]]/ (fem!Harry), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8233291/1/Princess-of-the-Blacks][Princess of the Blacks]]/ (OC as protag), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][The Denarian Renegade]]/ (some imported creatures and universe mechanics from Dresden Files).

/[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5333171/7/The-Weapon-Revised][The Weapon Revised,]]/ /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10182397/1/The-Nightmare-Man][The Nightmare Man]]/ (crackfic), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/][Evil Be Thou My Good]]/ (HP × [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellraiser][Hellraiser,]] crackfic, wishful thinking), /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11589304/3/Blood-is-not-family][Blood is not family]]/ (HP × [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R.][F.E.A.R.,]] crackfic) /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8192853/1/Yes-I-am-Harry-s-Brother][Yes, I am Harry's Brother]]/ (TMR as protag, crackfic, wishful thinking).

There are also several stories in which the author tries to portray Harry as evil; but his character was rather inconsistent in those and the stories themselves were rather poorly written in general, so I'll skip them.

--------------

p.s. Maybe also check out /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2428341/1/Mastermind-Hunting][Mastermind hunting]]/ (FUBAR ending) and /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9036071/1/With-Strength-of-Steel-Wings][With Strength of Steel Wings,]]/ though in those Harry's not even immoral that much, just lacking the [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThouShaltNotKill][Thou Shalt Not Kill]] bullshit towards enemies.

Oh, and there's also the /[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][Sacrifices heptalogy]]/ (slash in later books, but can be skipped without missing the plot) in which the overarching trope is of Harry trying to fight against corruption by Dark Magic™ while a bunch of supposedly smart characters are doing everything they can to piss himself off into the dark cookie zone.

As I said, I don't remember much about that story. But I'd argue that even in case of Hannibal Lecter shenanigans the same actions could be defined either as “evil” or as ruthless, depending on the Lecter-wannabe's intentions and state of mind (was he going to get something out of it or was he doing that for its own sake and his enjoyment?).

But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
