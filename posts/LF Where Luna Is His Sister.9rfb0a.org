** Whose sister? Harry's? If so, I am aware of one story like that: "Exceptionally Ordinary" by sprwholock 44. It's a rewrite of canon that makes it up through PS/SS, but it was discontinued after that.

  Extraordinary circumstances lead to the Lovegood family raising a young Harry Potter. With a real family (and Luna for a sister) and a not so ordinary upbringing, who will Harry become? How will Hogwarts react to a smarter more eccentric Harry trying to save them from the Nargles? Oh and He-Who-Has-Too-Many-Names (Voldemort) too of course! AU Independent!Ravenclaw!Harry

** In /The Merging/, Harry and Luna have a sibling-like relationship where Harry is extremely protective of her.

  The Dementor attack on Harry leaves him kissed with his wand broken in an alleyway. Somehow surviving, the mystery remains as the new year draws closer, buried by the looming conflict the Order scrambles to prepare for. Buried by the prospect of his toughest year at Hogwarts yet. But this is nothing to what awaits him in the future. A future that he will do anything to protect.
