I've excluded all male characters other than Harry to remove slash, set it to M-rated only so you get smut, used the keyword "harem" and excluded the keyword "not harem".

I've then sorted by favourites.

193 fics.

The next step is to go to the Chrome store and add the extension Multi-Highlight. Then paste the following into the search box:

#+begin_quote
  bra kiss breast breasts underwear naked nude boob boobs knickers sex sexy undress ass arse butt bum vagina pussy panties penis cock clit clitoris nipple nipples bust busty bosom chest cleavage hip hips hardness arousal manhood jiggle
#+end_quote

Now you can skip through the chapters until you see a concentration of highlighted text. Congratulations you have created a smut-locating machine.
