I can't even remember much of it except for one particular scenario. I really want to read and see if I had actually liked the fic or it was something I abandoned. But what I'm certain of is the fact it was a Tom x Harry fic.

What i remembered:

- they're finding something in the RoR, presumably the horcrux
- Harry finds it and diadem!Tom sucks him in (smtg like diary tom did in canon)
- Harry pretends to be Tom's son from the future
- He even hisses in parseltongue when Tom does it (something about confirmation?)
- There's a tom that follows Harry around

And that's it. I literally cannot give anything else, nothing comes to mind. I can't remember if it was well written or whatsoever, all I know is this one scene that keeps playing over and over in my head.
