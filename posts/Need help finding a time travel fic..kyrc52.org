:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
This story was on fnaf and the basic plot of the fic I'm looking for is that Tom won the war, so harry Hermione and Luna hide out. when one day a member of the Fey (Iirc Santa claus) tell them Tom has nearly found a way in to the Fay realm so lilith will send them back in time so they can stop him.

Also when they get back in time they start to rob DE's while wearing fox masks.


** Faery Heroes.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
