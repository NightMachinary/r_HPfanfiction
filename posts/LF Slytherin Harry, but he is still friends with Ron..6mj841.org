Most of the slytherin harry fics i read have him as an antagonist. but i like ron as a charactor.


** linkffn(The Other Side of the Coin by Zennith6):

Ron and Slytherin Harry have a great relationship - they even frequently train together. Features a Sirius-raised Harry with Grindelwald as the Dark Lord, and a very interesting take on Tom Riddle and Dumbledore.

**** Yeah, I remember finishing the fic and being so dismayed that the sequel only had like 2 chapters. The story was definitely going somewhere.

** There was one that had a forest-elf-raised Harry. It's called To the Waters and the Wild.

Ron purposefully gets himself sorted into Slytherin to follow Harry, in that one.
