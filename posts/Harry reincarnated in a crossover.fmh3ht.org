So I found this fic recently [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13366763/1/No-Rest-For-The-Weary][No Rest For The Weary]] linkffn(13366763) so I was wondering if you could recommend any other fic where Harry is reincarnated with his memory in another universe (a crossover not just an AU of HP). I've seen a lot of rec for another character reincarnated as Harry but not so much the other way around.

It can be in a minor character/OC if he becomes important (like in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12853038/1/Swords-and-Roses][Swords and Roses]] but preferably in a MC of the other universe like in the first fic mentioned (where he's reborn as Anakin).

Preferably complete or not abandoned fics. Thanks

  Harry did not expect to be reborn as Anakin Skywalker in a galaxy where blue girls were considered sexy, sentient dustbins barely rated a glance and giant slugs were criminal warlords. He took it all of that in stride until The Force started singing in his ear. Good thing there were no prophecies lying around... right?

** I have two ASOIAF fics where he is reincarnated that are both high quality, although neither is likely to be completed.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of dead things. He is the second son of the king, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might. Very Abandoned

  When Tywin Lannister crushed the Reyne-Tarbeck Rebellion everyone in the Kingdoms believed he ended two noble lines. But thanks to one unique infant, one Harrion Reyne called Harry by his parents, some survived.

  74 lives since his original, Harry Potter, or the being that once went by that name, is tired. He has had enough, yet his lives continue. Now, he's reborn into a very different life than many of the others he's had. Once again he's got to save the world... With a bit more. Now, he's got to save the Galaxy... Because he's the Chosen One... again. Will he never get a break?

** The only ones I have that probably fit that description - I don't remember how much memory Harry has of his life as Harry - are linkffn(Uekibachi Koyoko by yorushihe), in which fem!Harry is reincarnated in the Narutoverse, and linkffn(Dusk to Dawn by reighost), in which Harry is reborn as Sawada Tsunayoshi in the Katekyo Hitman Reborn! universe. I didn't care much for the first one, and I don't know enough about KHR to have enjoyed the second one that much.

  Old Lady Potter died silently in her sleep. It was Halloween to the morbid amusement and sadness of those who knew of her story, though she passed on peacefully and in no pain, with a smile on her lips - only to wake up as Uekibachi Koyoko, a potters' daughter and someone with too much time in her hands.. GenFic, Fem!Harry, Major AU.
