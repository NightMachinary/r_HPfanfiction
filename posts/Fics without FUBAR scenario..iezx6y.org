It's always similar. Something always goes side-ways.

Pettigrew is involved? You can be sure that the pathetic wizard who is bashed by author previously as pathetic, will manage to somehow escape, kidnap, kill, succeed.

You have a plan to get rid of Horcruxes? Well, make sure to tighten your seat belts, because somehow, in someway, every single person will forget some crucial detail, that they have no right to forget in the first place, about Horcruxes that would make getting rid of them so easy.

You going to the political arena? Well, you WILL get stopped by Manipulating!Dumbledore of BAMF!Malfoy, who know just enough of your dark secrets that they can stop your plans.

Honestly man, I just want some fics where Harry doesn't need to constantly go against the current, where he isn't Fate's bitchboy, or something goes just bad enough to make him struggle with something for the rest of the story.

Also, I'm not requesting for God!Harry who can curbstomp every one because of his throbbing, huge, pulsing, and bulging magical core which he got due to some unlikeliest possibilities. I'm not requesting for it, But I also wouldn't mind some of those.

Anything like it?


** Most of Rowling's threats are honestly incompetent assholes on paper who only really have success because chance reliably goes their way due to author fiat.

If you put them up against competent adults, they turn out to be tissue paper and you're left to try and figure out new antagonists that can actually threaten the protagonists.

** The one that jumped to mind for me is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2919503/1/Luna-s-Hubby][Luna's Hubby]]. It's a fun read and most things go surprisingly well for Harry.

** The problem is that such stories are usually rather boring. You can read linkffn(Long Live The Queen by offsides), but the result is rather predictable and boring (fortunately, struggle against the Voldemort is not the most significant part of the story).

**** It can work but it has to be mainly comedy/slice of life like make a wish or Harry is a dragon and that's okay
