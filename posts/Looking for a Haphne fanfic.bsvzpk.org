Looking for a fic where the Greengrases care a lot about Harry. Also, apart from Daphne and Astoria, they have also taken in two other girls who were orphaned earlier (probably family friends, I don't remember if Tracey is also there). So the Greengrass Manor is attacked, curses flying, both the parents and the two kids they took in are killed by the time Harry reaches.

Any clue which fic I'm taking about?

Edit 1: I believe Lady Greengrass fires of killing curses at one point when they are attacked at the Manor.
