I recently started writing my first HP fanfiction. I've been reading them for years and I wrote a crossover with Percy Jackson but this is the first time I'm writing a fanfic for HP alone. What should I avoid or try not to do?

I already have a few things that I'm going to try to stay away from just because I personally don't like them. Edge lord Harry, overly political 11 year olds and stupid Dumbledore. Though I have no problem with a manipulative Dumbledore I don't really like when people make him stupid asf so that kids outmaneuver him over and over again.

Is there anything else that you think writers should generally stay away from for HP fanfictions? Things that got old or things that annoy you?


** Don't be afraid to use pronouns. Majority of fanfic writers overuse descriptions, and write things like 'bushy haired girl' instead of simply 'she' or 'Hermione'

** Rule 1 is "write what you enjoy and would want to read."

Rule 2 is "there is no rule 2."

​

As far as my personal pet peeves, I'm not a big fan of how many authors make 11-year-olds (especially Harry) way too grown up. It's legitimately hard to write kids without making them too young or too old though.

** Try to avoid using too many said-bookisms (or any at all). That means avoiding things like 'laughed', 'sneered', 'chortled', 'smiled', 'giggled', etc. as dialogue tags. (I.e., "That was funny!" laughed Luna, "You're a loser," sneered Malfoy, etc.)

'Said', 'whispered', and 'asked' tend to get ignored by readers, while the various bookisms really stand out at times. One of the more egregious examples from canon is this:

#+begin_quote
  ‘Snape!' ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale and sweating.
#+end_quote

-/Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince/, ch 29.

Sometimes, it's better to either rearrange your dialogues to avoid excessive dialogue-tags, or to simply stick to using 'said' whenever possible. Yes, it can be boring and all, but there's a reason why many professional authors prefer to steer clear from using too many (or any) said-bookisms in the first place.

It's OK for when you're new to writing, especially at school level, but not really for anything more. However, it's worth noting that JK Rowling, herself, managed to get away with using said-bookisms and loads of adverbs (i.e. said calmly, said happily, said angrily, etc.) as well, which authors such as Stephen King frown upon.

** The first thing to do is to figure out /what/ you want the story to be - what's the elevator pitch that you would give to have someone read/be interested in your fic?

Before we know that, honestly it's impossible to say what to avoid. The ones you described could be great, in a comedic/satirical work. Other aspects can always be done well, especially if they are the focus of the story.

This is outside of 'normal' writing advice, of course - that's an entirely different can of worms. For that, the biggest thing I'd recommend is to stop and re-read your story as you're editing it/as you write it - and read it out loud. That should help you catch weird aspects of it that don't sound right.

** I second the advice all previous commenters have given (particularly the one about not being afraid to use pronouns, and avoiding said-bookisms, which are both deal-breakers for me in a story.)

In terms of my own advice:

*/Avoid 'flashbacks'/*.

Start the narrative at your most important scene, or integrate it into the story. But don't use a subtitle of *Flashback,* write a scene in italics, and then put *End Flashback*.

e.g. Harry goes to Gringotts at the end of fifth year and finds out Sirius left him 50 bajillion Galleons in his will and Dumbledore has been manipulating him ... but nothing else interesting in your story happens until Horcrux hunting. You can either start with the visit to Gringotts, and then put some indicator of time passing (Harry may casually mention that sixth year was different without Ron and Hermione at his side). Or, you could start straight at sixth year, and then have Harry mention to his new soul-bonded partner (probably Daphne Greengrass) how shocked he was to find it out etc. etc.

But please, for the love of all that is holy in this world, don't do a flashback. I beg you.

*/Avoid perfect dialogue/*

No-one says exactly what they mean with just the right words and no fillers. Harry definitely won't. One of the reasons I love HP so much is the dialogue is realistic. Harry says "yeah" and "erm" a lot, and it reads like a genuine teenage boy.

Also, there's no chance Harry is going to reduce Ron and Hermione to stunned, stuttering silence with his well-curated and rehearsed monologue about how they betrayed him. Idk what kind of fic you're writing, but whilst obviously dialogue in stories is more clear and direct (you don't want to waste your readers' time with small talk, unless you're going to come back to it later), it shouldn't /sound/ like it's written. Everyone has words and phrases they use more often (think Ron and "Bloody hell!"); include them!

*/Don't be afraid to cut scenes/*

If a scene isn't adding anything to your story (it doesn't move the plot on, it doesn't tell you anything more about the characters, it doesn't drop a hint that becomes relevant in the future), cut it. Also, this is fanfiction, so we're familiar with the characters; you don't need to rehash canon. I read a PJO/HP crossover where a whole was about Percy and Sally flying over to the U.K., and all it mentioned was that (a) Percy hates flying, (b) turbulence because Zeus, (c) Percy loves his mom, and somehow (d) that Percy is ADHD and dyslexic. Which I knew from canon.

The previous chapter was telling Percy his mom had relatives in the U.K that happened to be the Dursleys (which I knew from the description) and the next was Vernon driving them back from the airport, complaining about weirdos (which is just canon Vernon), and again establishing that Sally and Petunia are related but haven't seen each other in ages (which I knew both from the description and the first chapter).

TL;DR: be ruthless.

*/Conclusion/*

(I've been writing a lot of essays for uni and fallen in love with headings, okay, sue me).

Write what you want to read!! What do YOU like to read in a fic? What makes you close a fic straight away? These are my pet peeves, but if you've got a guilty pleasure Harry monologuing in the Great Hall before Everyone ClapsTM, then do that! Live your best life and write your best fic xx

I'd say that's not /always/ the case. I've read more than a few fics from fandoms I have only a passing familiarity with, so giving at least a bare overview of a character's key traits can be useful. Crossovers in particular can draw fans of one series that have never read the source material for the other.

** My one advice to you is try to avoid either Mugglewank -- when the author portrays wizards and magic itself as inherently inferior to muggle technology -- or Wizardwank, when the author does the opposite and dismisses muggles as cute little monkeys.

When either is done, it tends to ruin a story that is otherwise normal, perhaps even great.

Also, I'd ask for a link to your works, if you don't mind?

Like say a character is nice but it only takes someone pressing the right few buttons before their personality becomes more unpleasant and hostile. Don't present that as a good thing. Maybe they will feel guilty about it or apologize.

Also don't suddenly make the death eaters saints. It goes the same for Snape as well. No matter the mixed opinions on this are, he is still Snape. Jk tried and failed to write Snape as a “oh he was good all along” character. Instead we got an obsessed man over a dead married girl who has a son that he picks on.

**** I personally find that slow burn only works if the end pairing is actually uncertain. Otherwise it just ends up extremely frustrating when you know the pairing WILL get together and it highlights every single little plot device the writer uses to FORCE the pairing to stay apart.

Even if the pretty clear pairing from the start IS actually the final pairing, slow burn should always enough mysteries to cause doubt over the final pairing.

***** Mmm yes and no. Take the harry black series for example. It was a slow burn for the entirety of book 1 and it was honestly done very well. Harry and daphnee have been together the next 3 books. I believe book 5 is a WIP atm but so far him and daphnee are still going strong

** Might I suggest the YouTube channel Terrible Writing Advice? It's very useful.

But as a rule of thumb. You can tell but show more. 1 in 10 characters should be LGBTQ Avoid bashing. Every character should be flawed but they should have good qualities too. Said should be your default dialogue tag. Character development! If you need a character to act a certain way for a plot point, take the time to make it believable. Avoid Muggle Wank like it's Covid. Wizard Wank is also annoying but less so. No child politics, no heir/lord shenanigans. Plot! Make sure you have one. Once you have a fleshed out plot, add in some sub plots. But make it realistic. If your plot has to do with someone leaving an abusive relationship, one of the subplots shouldn't be romance. I mean it can be but it would make no sense. The Room of Requirement is amazing but don't abuse it. “Oh I'll ask the room for this! And this! And that!” I'm willing to talk more but it's 1am.

** My advice is to try and make everything possible make logical sense. Characters, your plot, how magic works. Changing cannon is the whole point of fanfiction, but try to make your changes make sense.

Other advice: When you write a chapter, edit it, let it sit for a week, then edit it again. The more you tweak it, the better your final product will be. Find someone willing to look through it and help you find things you missed.

Also, a general outline for your plot is your friend!

** Avoid religiously using the stations of canon. The most irritating thing that I come across as a reader is a story where the author diverges from canon for whatever reason and then promptly ignores that divergence to follow the main canon plot points as if there were no change in the first place.

I also advise you to know or at least have an idea where you want your story to end up and then work the characters and events into that position. I think many don't have that idea and then regardless of what changes they make, they revert to the events that happened in canon that now no longer make any sense. Like if Harry is known to be a parselmouth in first year and is still held in esteem, it doesn't make any sense to have him be ostracized in book two for the same thing without a good explanation as to why. In canon it was a shock to learn of this supposed dark ability and this was after the chamber had already been opened. If everyone knows already, you need to work out a reason that Harry would be suspected to be the heir.

Or if Harry saved Draco from getting hurt by Buckbeak, then you need a different reason for why Harry would go into the forest with Ron to “follow the spiders”.

Oh and one last pitfall to avoid, try not to have Harry or your other characters automatically know things that they wouldn't otherwise know without any reason. Yes most of the people reading your story will be familiar with the original work and knowledge of things that will happen and have happened in the books, but unless you give your characters a reason they will not know things that they haven't experienced, or been taught or told.

** I don't like the misunderstanding as a plot advancer. If Hermione doesn't understand why boyfriend whomever is being mean, ignoring or suddenly acting all moody, she's not going to cry and move to America. She's going to talk and get to the bottom of it by the end of the day, by God. If you want her to go to America(why would you) think up something cool. PS read my fanfics: start with Harder to Remember Her.

** This isn't so much an 'avoid' but still worth saying.

When/if you get into relationships put as much effort as you possibly can into quality not quantity.

I've no idea if you write multi or not, but it pisses me off when people add 4, 5, 6 ect girls to a pairing when they haven't even gone to the effort of ensuring the already existing relationship is anything more than 2d. If adding a new character will negatively impact how detailed the development of an already established is, dont add the new character until it wont to that.

Edit: I personally dont think I have ever, in many years, read a non-crack fic with more than 3 girls in the pairing that isn't complete trash. And only 2-3 fics have ever successfully managed more than 2 girls

** Please, avoid wizards and witches behaving like muggles. They have a wand for a reason, they don't wash the dishes using their hands or fetch things themselves etc. Pay attention to the clothing, if the character isn't muggleborn or halfblood, it doesn't make much sense for them to wear jeans, sweaters and so on. Also, wizards and witches don't usually name their children Joe, Tom, Karen, Brad, Jim etc. If your story takes place in the UK and you are not British, mind the language differences between UK English and the rest iterations of English.

** Things I can't stand:

- ALL CAPS ANGRY HARRY! WHY IS LIFE SO UNFAIR!

- I don't know where you are from, but if you are not from the UK, at least /try/ to use words British people would use. Nothing breaks immersion more than a British character speaking like an American.

- Don't try and "fix" the wizarding world. The wizarding world is great because it doesn't really make sense. The best fics tend to embrace that about the world.

- You are writing a story about characters we know, that is the advantage of ff, we know these people. As best you can, stick to their motivations and who they are, it makes telling your story much easier.

- If you are doing romantic pairings, be very careful about how they get together. People don't just fall in love immediately, and then spend all their waking moments together. I've never had a fight that was ended with a passionate kiss. Life doesn't work like that.

- My biggest rule of writing: The problems of your characters can be anything, even something small and unimportant in the grand scheme of things. But they /should matter/ to your characters. They should matter more than anything, even if they are relatively small.

** I'll add this because I don't think I saw it and it's the advice I gave my sister when she starting writing fanfiction. You mentioned you've written one already so this may be old news.

One of the pitfalls of fanfiction is that you write/post one chapter at a time, so it doesn't really get the same "trim" that a published novel would get. As a result, sometimes fics just end up very bloated.

I love reading long fics, but I get a bit exasperated when I'm 60 chapters or 160k words into something and Harry is only halfway through year 2. Some stories involving time turners will have 2 days of real world time take 20 chapters. Or there's the dreaded 10 chapter shopping trip. As a reader, it can get very frustrating.

It's just something to consider when outlining and writing your story.

** Try to have as little plot setup as possible: start as close to the end as you can. Try and fill in most of the information through context/implications rather than blatantly saying it or adding tons of unnecessary scenes to show one small thing. Flashbacks are alright, but have to be done right.
