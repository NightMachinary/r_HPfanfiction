Hi,

I'm looking for well written fics where Dudley contemplates, contacts meets Harry in the future. Or a partner of his does. I don't mind if they form a relationship or not. Preferably not wildly out of character for Harry, etc.

Alternatively, just fics about Dudley in general.

Some fics I have read are:

- Cousin/Uncle Harry

- A fic where Harry has Learning Disability and moves with Petunia and Dudley to Canada.

- One where Dudley teams up with Piers to drive Harry to the Weasleys, mediwitches visit the Burrow and then Dudley goes to stay with Piers.

Probably some others I don't really recall, I think one where Dudley has a daughter and manages to contact Harry but that's not very specific.

Thank you in advance!

  It was funny to call it normal, but life can be funny sometimes: that was what Lavender had said, and Dudley, who knew he wasn't very clever, was bound to agree with her.

  What begins as a simple trip to retrieve extra cleaning supplies for his mother turns into something more for Dudley, something even he can't explain. He still hasn't forgotten what the Dementors showed him the previous summer, and he's beginning to think that maybe they were right after all. Oneshot.

- Well, the reason for contact is /special/ in linkao3(19475812).

- And than there is a zillion of stories about “Dudley's Daughter is a witch” (surprisingly, never son, did anybody read anything about his son?), where of course Harry is contacted with plea for help. linkao3(1048010) is by far the best of them.

  Dudley Dursley reluctantly and somewhat awkwardly accepts an invitation to his cousin's wedding. While there, he meets Harry's friends, discovers some fascinating wizarding adult beverages - and meets Cho Chang, who has her own reasons to find herself out of place and drinking heavily at the wedding of Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley.In the months to come, this unlikely encounter will make him rethink his attitudes towards the magical world, drastically change the course of both of their lives, and change Dudley's relationship with his family forever.

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.
