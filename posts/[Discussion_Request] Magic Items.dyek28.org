I have been wondering if there are any fics dealing with the actual making of magical items instead of just using them (Ex: multi-compartment trunks, pensieves, etc.). I recently started one on AO3 and I was wondering if anyone had done something like it before. If you know of any, please link.


** There are two which came to my mind:

**** I really like how it take the story out of the super-beaten environment of Hogwarts/Burrow/Grimmauld Place, where 99% of all stories stays. Normal magical life or the magicians' realism, something like that.

***** Yes! I'm always on the lookout for fics centred around more ~ordinary~ characters, in Hogsmeade or Diagon or wherever.

****** What about [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/]] ? Yes, it is a historical fan fiction as well.

  The MirrorphoneÂ®, the latest advance in Wizarding communications. Now, of course, everyone seems to own one. The kids seem to be incapable of living without the device. How did it happen? Who was responsible for the design? To find out we must return to the year 2000.
