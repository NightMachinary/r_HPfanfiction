So, I read a few Indy!Harry fics recently, just to see what all the fuss was about and inevitably there was some scene where Hermione joins the Order or asks Harry to fight and Harry gets pissed for whatever reason.

I just want Hermione to yell at him, like, not everything is about you, Harry! She is literally evidence that the pureblood supremacy platform is false. She would 100 percent be near the top of their hitlist. Of course she wants to know if her best friend would fight by her side. And the order is the only group fighting the death eaters. Of course she"s going to join.

Ugh. Are there any Indy!Harry fics where everyone is like, eff off Harry, in what universe are we going to listen to you about battleplans, you wouldn't even do your homework if granger wasn't on your case all the time.


** In answer to your only actual question; No. I've never come across an Indy!Harry story where "everyone is like, eff off Harry, in what universe are we going to listen to you about battleplans, you wouldn't even do your homework if granger wasn't on your case all the time."

Probably because that premise would defeat literally the entire damn purpose of it being Indy!Harry. You can either have a story where that does happen; or you can have Indy!Harry. You can't have both.

Of course this is fanfiction so if you can't deal with that then by all means go and write your own story to try and make it work. I'd personally be damned impressed if you or anyone else actually managed to.

There's nothing contradictory about having an independant character without making everybody else into pandering NPCs. A character doesn't have to become a war general to be considered independant.

The story would only win from more realistic and consistent portrayals. The problem is that it would also require better talant and dedication from the writer, since they couldn't just ride the story on the indy-exploitation tropes.

*** I tend to avoid Indy! Harry fics like the plague (Rise of the wizards is such a guilty pleasure because it does good intentions going wrong so well.).

That being said, Hermione really didn't have anything to worry about until book 7. Her being a high priority target is a misconception.

Although, yeah, Indy Harry fics tend to push her either in the Mary Sue direction or the helpless damsel direction. I tend to respect fics that have her as an academic, but not a fighter.

Any fic that calls itself Indy is usually horrible, that's for sure. There are two factors that I would split indy fics into. The first makes it unreadable, while the second is more nuanced. Shouty!Indy!Harry is bad, Independent!Indy!Harry can be good.

Harry going out on his own, and making his own place in the world does fit in with the typical "adults are useless" themes found in children's books (including the first 4 HP books). Shouty!indy!Harry with his ridiculous nicknames and mountains of angst doesn't.

I'll argue against this for only one reason. Draco Malfoy. Draco was going around wishing "Granger" dead in second year, it's not a stretch to believe he might be telling his (high ranking Deatheater) father about her.

Honestly, I feel like writing Harry as a young adult rather than an edgelord teen fits better for that.

Hermione only got her parents to safety in book 7 and they really only started their pogrom in book 7. Would the death eaters know of her? Yeah. Would they do anything? Not unless they had a government in place. I'll concede that if you have them as an immediate threat in your fic, treating her like this helpless child to "Harry" is awful.

I should have clarified. I mean I respect fics that write her as a nuanced academic who isn't this super fighter. I'm not excluding fics that write her as a fighter (although, I rarely see one where she suffers setbacks or losses (I'm a sucker for classical storytelling. I'm fairly sure Rowling is too to be honest.)), but rather I like fics that have her character as an academic, not a fighter.

Just my two cents.

Yep. You weren't intending this in this way but it does sum up what I was saying well. I think you can write a teen as a young adult. So a teen Harry that is mature can fill that role well, but an edgelord? Not so much.

(With the timeline of the series, if you want Harry doing a lot of this stuff before defeating voldemort, then he does need to be a teen.)

On Hermione's safety, fair enough.

#+begin_quote
  I should have clarified.
#+end_quote

Oh I did get that :)

With every character in fanfiction there is a huge range of characterisation, and so you typically have ranges of that character that you: love, like, can stand, and hate.

For example, I "can stand" a mildly damselly Hermione if the rest of the fic is good, and I "hate" most bashing of her (If she isn't at least smart then she isn't Hermione). I don't like when her academics suffer for the "action" part, so am more on the academic side there.

There is a tone of nuance that I can't (or rather don't feel like) getting into here, but what I'm trying to say is that on the scale between "Mary Sue" and "blithering idiot", I tend to like the range between "Super genius kinda actiony" and "Smart but not on the front lines".

** You kinda bashed canon Harry here.

- why is Harry expected to work with the Order?
- it is about him, though. Voldemort spent 2 decades thinking of and plotting against him. Multiple people in various ways told him it was about him. Remus and Hestia said it outright.
- Hermione is intelligent, but not enough to be at the top of anyone's list because of it. If she's not friends with Harry she's targeted like any other muggleborn, but not singled out like she was in canon.
- Hermione herself listened to a battle plan or two of Harry's in canon
- Harry did his homework on his own anytime Hermione wasn't around and literally every Indy fic I've ever read dedicates at least a paragraph to Harry "doing his own work."

Edit: is it the pointing out that intelligence wouldn't be enough for a random muggleborn to get singled out that's getting the downvotes? If so, Lily Evans didn't have her own bull's eye until she conceived the child of prophecy

Edited a million times 'cause I can't spell.

*** I always saw Harry as being, really, a small part of the overall war. He was just an obstacle for the death eaters, a big obstacle sure, but his death would just be one point on a long list of things they want which is ultimately the subjugation of those with lesser blood. I see Hermione as a prominent muggleborn witch who is very good at magic and likes to draw attention to herself through those accomplishments. if she wasn't a target yet, she definitely would have been later and would have been on the radar of the future death eaters who were in her year and possibly their parents.

At the very least she would have been on umbridge's hitlist for the muggleborn registration.

Also, I think it's a false to assume Lily Evans wasn't a target in some manner. She defied Voldemort three times and he definitely wouldn't have liked that, I believe, to the point of targeting her.

Harry doesn't have to work for the order, but he shouldn't get pissy with Hermione when she does seeing as they are the only group opposing those who want to wipe out her 'blood type'. And she wouldn't be out of line for hoping he would join her as her friend.

Save for the small part of the overall war, this is true. You could say the same for Dumbledore, every Bones that was murdered, Crouch, Moody, and Scrimgeour. Each of these deaths revolved around that goal and got them closer to it. Harry, the last of these would have cemented it. Remus and Hestia both tell him Voldemort has won and he's their primary reason for resistance.

Not if she had a talk with her parents and then relocated to somewhere more sane. Somehow I doubt VD would have enough reach to organise her assassination somewhere in the middle of the US or even care enough to consider it.

**** OP was giving an argument that she had to fight because she was a target, and I was responding to that. Whether or not she also had to fight because of her own principles, values, and decisions, is another argument entirely.

Anyways, in-universe answer to your point: 1) Her friends could've ran off along with her too. They're /wizards/, for crying out loud. They do not have to deal with the restrictions that muggles routinely face. Hell, put together enough Fidelius charms and organise them into decentralised [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system][cells,]] and suddenly Voldemort loses most of his relevance.

Out-of-universe answer: Canon Hermione couldn't because that's not what the archetype heroine is supposed to do. A Hermione from an Indy-Harry fanfiction, on the other hand, could be well portrayed in many different ways. Among which is a Hermione that's abandoning Magical Britain to let it fester in its own corruption and incompetency and emigrating to some better country that actually appreciates its half-blood magical citizens.

***** *Clandestine cell system*

A clandestine cell system is a method for organizing a group of people such as resistance fighters, sleeper agents, or terrorists so that such people can more effectively resist penetration by an opposing organization (such as law enforcement).

In a cell structure, each of the small group of people in the cell only know the identities of the people in their cell. Thus, a cell member who is apprehended and interrogated (or who is a mole) will not likely know the identities of the higher-ranking individuals in the organization.

The structure of a clandestine cell system can range from a strict hierarchy to an extremely distributed organization, depending on the group's ideology, its operational area, the communications technologies available, and the nature of the mission.

** Well, to be fair they are nearly turned into child soldiers. Admittedly Harry has a prophecy hanging over his head, but I can see him arguing that it's morally and legally wrong to force teenagers like Hermione and Ron in combat. True, the adults fail miserably at most of the things and especially at the war effort, but still. I can't remember what the title was, but I remember a fic where Harry and Hermione just decided to up and leave the war and Britain. They get caught by mrs. Weasley who instead of stopping them just hugs them and encourages them to go and leave the war to the adults.
