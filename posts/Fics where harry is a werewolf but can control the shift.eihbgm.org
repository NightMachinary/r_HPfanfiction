  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

** I think it's called something like Standing against the moon. It's like his animagus form because of an accident and he goes around preaching to werewolves to join his side instead of Voldemort because of a werewolf prophecy. This could be completely wrong so sorry in advance.
