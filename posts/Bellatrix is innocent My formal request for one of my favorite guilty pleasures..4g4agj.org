So I thought I ask for a "Bellatrix is innocent" fic. Normally I do prefer Bella to be the evil, twisted psychopath. But occasionally, I like it if it turns out, she was controlled/tricked/forced/... to become what she is.

Everythings allowed, but bonus points for a Bellatrix that then takes horrible revenge on the Death Eaters as a whole.

Gold for anybody who has a fic that also doesn't white-wash her into being essentially Lily Potter in character, but lets her be the arrogant pureblood on the side of the good guys.
