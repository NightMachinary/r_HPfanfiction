*(Something I just wrote cus I was bored but I can't find a way to make this into a full story feel free to abduct it and finish it if you want)*

Harry was pissed and he didn't know why.

He thought he'd be nervous about having to face dragons for his first task in the tournament, but instead he found sitting in the champion's tent, leg moving up and down on the ground in annoyance and right hand twirling his wand.

Every time a dragon would roar or begin breathing fire Harry's hand would twitch towards his hip, as if reaching for a blade that was supposed to be there but wasn't. He watched as Viktor, Fleur, and Cedric all went out to face their dragons and returned, each returned, some a little more singed than others but their dragons were still bellowing rage in the background of the hustle and bustle of the tents staff.

That was unacceptable to Harry, yet he didn't know why.

When his turn finally came, he stood and walked out of the tent towards the arena. His ears ringing with every step and his wand warming in his hand, waiting eagerly for the combat that would surely happen.

Once he was inside the arena the sound of the crowd ceased, not because they had stopped cheering or jeering as some of the Slytherins were quick to do. No, the cheering stopped because the ringing in Harry's ears muffled the noise. He laid his eyes upon the Dovah before him, and he found his anger growing.

With a flick of his wand, the dragon was freed from its chains, but Harry didn't do this out of mercy. Instead he sneered at it and spoke in a language that his mind did not know yet his soul did. “Hi Drun Aan Folaas Bo Het!”

The crowd who had stopped their nose mere moments after Harry had snapped the dragons chains were now staring intently at the stadium bellow, Dumbledore himself looked ready to jump in and interfere with the task, while Hermione had to be held back by the twins from jumping into the pit herself.

All of that stopped though when the dragon, an animal that Wizards had no record of ever verbalizing anything outside of roars and growls, began to speak.

“Zu'u Drey Ni, Dovahkiin” The dragon shook its head and looked to its eggs “Fus Naal Jul”

Whatever the dragon had said had slightly pierced the rage inside Harry's heart, but not enough to get him to back down instead he growled “Fus?!" the world cracked "Hi Los Aan Dovah!”

The dragon lowered its eyes from Harry, cowed by his rebuke, it no longer talked, instead it merely pushed a golden egg towards the young wizard and looked at him.

Harry looked at the egg, his goal for the task and frowned, before picking it up and looking at the dragon once more. “Take Hin Kiir Ahrk Leave.” He said softly.

The dragon nodded, it looked down at its eggs and began to swallow them, much to the dismay of the dragon handlers present and the surprise of everyone else watching. After swallowing the last one, the dragon took off, flying east towards presumably Hungary.

Harry's frown didn't let up as then turned his glare towards the judges table, before leaving the stadium he spoke to them in the same tone of voice he had used on the dragon, his words thrumming with power “No more Dovah.” With that he turned on his heel and walked towards the tent.

It was only after he had entered the tent that he heard the high-pitched shout of Ronald Weasley say “What the bloody hell was that?!”

*So each of the words KINDA mean this keep in mind i had to use a Dragon Language Translator for the words since I don't speak it.*

*Hi Drun Aan Folaas Bo Het kind of means You Made a Mistake Coming Here*

*Zu'u Drey Ni, Dovahkiin mean's I didn't or did not Dragonborn*

*Fus Naal Jul means something like Forced by Humans*

*Hi Los Aan Dovah basically means You are a Dragon*

*Take Hin Kiir Ahrk Leave this basically means Take Your Children and Leave*


** "FUS RO DAH" shouted Harry... "Harry you just knocked Malfoy off of the Astronomy tower" complained Hermione. "Wicked mate" praised Ron. "See, you can see the Dark Mark there, on his splattered corpse... I mean arm" Harry gestures. "YOL TOR SHUL" Harry decided it was best to get rid of the evidence. Death Eater or not, Dumbledore and Snape would only complain, and it wasn't worth using that self deafening spell that the Twins made to deal with their Mother's Howlers just to ignore the pointless ranting.

Alternatively ...

"Drem Yol Lok, Dovah" greeted Harry, in the tongue he found even more natural than Parseltongue.

The Dragon didn't respond. "Must be one of those Worm Drakes that Paarthurnax warned me about. He did call them fakers that were an insult to true Dovah" Harry then sighed "ZII LOS DII DU!" shouted Harry, devouring the Soul of the Dragon, causing its body to burst into Golden Light.

Those watching the Tournament were shocked and confused, and more than a little terrified. The missing Boy-Who-Lived, returned for the tournament just, to their eyes, disintegrated a Dragon with wandless magic.

Alternatively...

"What kind of terrible Dragons are these? They don't even Speak" Harry sighed. Well, the Tournament was about putting on a show... he'll give those Wizards a show.

"OD AH VIING!" Harry shouted, and a tremendous roar burst through the air, with a huge wingbeat. "Drem Yol Lok, Dovahkiin, We are under a different Lok, a different sky today. What enemy shall we face?" the giant red dragon's booming voice asks.

"Drem Yol Lok, Odahviing. I'm back in my Old world, unfortunately. I figured you'd enjoy the snack. That Worm is what this world calls Dragon" Harry gestured.

Hearing a Dragon burst out laughing is a disconcerting sound for those who do know Dragons can talk, for those who don't... let's just say there were more than a few soiled robes that day.
