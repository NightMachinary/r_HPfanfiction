I just can't imagine Lily and James as bad parents who neglect Harry anyway, Lily gave LIFE to save Harry, do you really think she would love Harry less if he had a brother? OF COURSE NOT!

​

The most bashing Lily and James I can read is when they regret leaving Harry and try to get close to Harry in some way! */(If you know of any fanfic like this, please tell me!)/*

​

I'm curious to know your opinion, tell me what you think!


** I hate it in most ways, but The Prince of Slytherin makes it make sense.

Also, Wizarding families do abandon squibs...

I mostly agree

*** Yeah but Harry isn't a squid I don't see why they would abandon him

**** Some people like to pretend that they “thought” he was a squib.

***** I understand your point of view, but it still doesn't make sense for Lily to abandon Harry, no matter how squib he is.

******* Yeah true! I've seen lily and james defending themselves by saying that they thought he was a squib and decided to send him to the Dursley's or an Orphanage where he could live like a Muggle. Never mind the fact that accidental magic can occur at any age before a witch or wizard gets their wand. Like Neville who was a late bloomer. This is so OOC it's unbelievable. I go right back and exit when I see this lol

** See personally, I love reading bashing about either- especially Lily. I like it when writers twist usually likeable characters into jerks. It's interesting

** Middle child syndrome is a real thing. Probably wouldn't be as exaggerated in real life but would exist on a certain level. Happens even with the Weasleys. Look at Percy.
