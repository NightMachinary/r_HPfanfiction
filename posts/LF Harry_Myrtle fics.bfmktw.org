When I was a kid and reading CoS the first time, Harry/Myrtle was my OTP. When Harry gotten bitten by the Basilisk, I legit believed that Harry would come back as a ghost and wipe the floor with Riddle because wizards can't kill what's already dead. So now that I've discovered the joys of fanfiction, I realized that maybe somebody has written this already. Or at least a Harry/Myrtle fic. So if you kind people would send some Harry/Myrtle fics my way, I'd be real appreciative! Or maybe a fic with Myrtle shipped with somebody else. Thanks in advance!


** Ehhhhh, this barely counts but it does include harry/myrtle and its a pretty fun story anyway.
