It was Ginny's point of view through all the books. I think the first part was post book seven, with Ginny being interviewed about 'her story'. Included a scene in which Bill teaches her the bat boogy hex.


** Is it "In the Words of Ginevra Molly Potter"?

(I don't remember if it has a scene of Bill teaching her the bat bogey hex though)
