  Long-distance relationships are hard under normal circumstances, but Harry and Ginny don't have the luxury of living normal lives. Their relationship is put to the test when Ginny returns to school and Harry stays behind to continue his Auror training. Ginny soon realizes her greatest challenge may be in coming to terms with Harry's fame and dangerous line of work and deciding if she can make the sacrifices needed to be part of his life. Sequel to Starting Over. (COMPLETE)

** Self-recommendation:

linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14842689/chapters/34356255]])

I also have another fic in which Remus's tendency to self-harm is a very small part near the end:

  Complete! The Christmas of 1981 wasn't so merry for everyone. Who is this guy running from his past, trying to make it in the muggle world? What does he mean by the word “muggle,” anyway?Warning: this contains some disturbing stuff. The familiar characters and events in this are the property of J.K. Rowling of course.

  Complete! Tonks knows all about werewolves, thanks to her Auror training, so now she can humansplain lycanthropy to this intriguing man she just met named Remus Lupin. That'll impress him, right?
