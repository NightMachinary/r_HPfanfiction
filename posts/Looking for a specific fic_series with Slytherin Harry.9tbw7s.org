It's a fic where Harry is sorted into Slytherin and Tracy Davis likes Harry, but gets tired of waiting for him and dates Theodore Nott instead. Harry might (?) have a pet snake as well and the fic extends until at least 6th year


** you probably mean [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2711324/DrizzleWizzle][this ones]] (idk how to use the bot, sorry). It goes on till year 6 but does look abandoned. I remember reading it some weeks ago, and I'm pretty sure it's the series you search for

** Is it the They Shook Hands series? Tracy likes Harry big time in that one. They date in third year and break up, and Tracy remains sort of obsessed with him after. I can't recall if Harry has a snake or not.
