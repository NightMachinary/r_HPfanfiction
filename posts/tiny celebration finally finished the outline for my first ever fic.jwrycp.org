I know this isn't a huge celebration, but after two weeks of working with it, I've finally finished a 7k word outline for my first fic which is a long fic. I'm gonna sit down and write out at least the first chapter tonight or more if I'm feeling it with some good tunes and ice cream. So excited to create!


** I'm happy tor you! I know how hard it is to start writing.

I recently been thinking about writing my own fanfic because I've been getting a few random ideas of what to do, though I've always been a little worried about trying to come up with a whole plot.

*** you totally should!! I'm also new to all of this, but once I get in the groove of things, it always feels REALLY good to just sit there and let all the ideas come out on paper/screen, even if they ARE messy!

** Congrats! Glad to hear it. Plot outlines are important to ensuring cohesion, which unfortunately is a flaw for many discovery writers.

** What type of fic is it? And would you be able to link it here so that I'd be able to read it?

*** that's so kind of you!! it's a post-war, Voldemort wins AU (Harry dies in this one, I know that's not a popular choice, but I will be writing many other Fics where Harry lives bc I love him, and he WILL be involved in this story). But it will be a found family between Sirius, Remus, Draco and Hermione. Soooo it's quite canon divergent. It's not written yet, just planned, but I can come back to this when it's up and link it to you if you'd still like to read it :) thank you kind human!
