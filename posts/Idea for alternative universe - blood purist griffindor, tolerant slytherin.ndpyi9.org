There is nothing in the virtues of slytherin that would make them be blood purists - this was more like personal opinion of Salazar. Therefore, we could imagine alternative continuity where Godrick was blood purist instead.

Virtues of houses woule stay largely the same - griffindors would still be brave and reckless (in protecting their fellow pureblood wizards), while slytherins would be ambitious and machivellian (doesnt matter if you are muggleborn or pureblood, only thing that maters is skill and ambition).


** I like this idea. Historically, the institution of knighthood - which purports to uphold the Gryffindor values of bravery and chivalry - was a classist, corrupt, and highly exclusive club with a high buy-in. The Knights of Godric could make a suitably Gryffindor counterpoint to the Death Eaters.

Meanwhile, ambition and cunning have always been the way for the determined to climb up society. Your skills and your willingness to play the game, to improve yourself and society, would be an awesome mirror to canonical Slytherin. Slytherin being all about purity, inheritance and entitlement never made much sense to me; surely Slytherin would be meritocratic as fuck? Hmm. Might write something now.

** In the next-gen James Potter series (by G. Norman Lippert) the Slytherins are more aligned with a progressive muggleborn activist movement focusing on empowering Muggles and Muggleborns, whereas the Gryffindors continue the canon HP message of tolerance and inclusion, which is criticized by the Slytherins as systemically blood-purist.

Unfortunately, the handling of this gets pretty heavy-handed and it's never really used as a big plot point; it's one of many wasted opportunities in that series. But I really liked the idea.

** Oh my God yes I've been thinking this for years, ambition for centuries was considered against the natural order exactly because it goes against aristocracy and the kind of upper class snootery that is associated with the slytherins in canon anyway, after all ambition implies a desire to improve your own social standing and class, something that was literally illegal under feudal law, you were born a serf you died a serf, and later with the advent of early capitalism and the growth of a middle class bourgeoisie those who had earned their money through work were looked down upon as nouveau-riche. It makes much more sense in a historical perspective to have muggleborns going to slytherin as after all they literally /have/ to be ambitious to get anywhere in their new society.

** I'm honestly not sure if much would change, the traits are largely irrelevant (you can do the mental gymnastics to explain any behaviour for any house). The Death Eaters might be a tad more blunt force and less hiding in the shadows, but given the overall plot the impact of that change would be minor. Voldemort might just use a different scapegoat. And if you change everyone and everything, you've basically just changed some colour schemes and nametags.
