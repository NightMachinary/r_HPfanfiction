  Cara is a young muggleborn who hasn't had very many breaks in her life. Then she dives head first into the weirdest world she could never have imagined by accepting a letter to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she is sorted into Hufflepuff and proceeds to be a wrecking ball to a school where age old house prejudices still exist. OC nearly all the way.

  It's 3003 and Rowena Potter is nearly finished with her sixth year at Hogwarts. A mysterious object found in the Forbidden Forest opens her up to a world of adventure - one with implications about her past, the history of the world she thought she knew, and a future she has to make for herself. (Second place in the Original Character Competition!)

** [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/538465][It's Tea Time]] - The third story focuses on the Next Gen (namely, James, Albus, Lily, and their significant others) having children, and has some moments with their children, especially James'.
