Are there any gamer fics that involve harry being MoD like linkffn(Game On)


** Excellent fic. But no. Not really. Gamer fics are already extremely hard to find. Even harder to find active or finished, and throwing on MoD is making it harder. ): I would truly love more too. I don't know of any, but I'll keep an eye out.

*** I find it much harder to find video game fics about actual video games, like Ash Ketchum living life like he was playing the games, or Shepard being able to sit back and select from up to six predetermined dialog options.

***** Mostly because that kind of stuff tends to be a specific type of parody that pretty much requires the writer to be quite good at writing stuff. As such, I have no doubt that things “like that” do exist but they are all crap and thus nobody cares.

And to help her, they'll give her a tool : the Gamer's Ability. First stop : the Mafia World. fem!Harry, MoD!Harry, gamer!Harry
