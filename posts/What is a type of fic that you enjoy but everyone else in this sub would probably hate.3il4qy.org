** Non-Harry centric fics. I love Harry as much as the next fan, but he's far from the most interesting character imo. Most popular AUs tend to use him as a Harry-in-name-only blank slate anyway. And there are some great fics out there that have nothing to do with him and are still amazing reads. Sadly most of then go massively underappreciated.

Asides from being famous and unlucky Harry doesn't have any outlying traits that would indicate crazy adventure possibility.

I like Harry, but I like other characters as well, so I read non Harry centric fics too. Still waiting for that elusive Ron-centric story that either hasn't been written or I haven't found yet.

EDIT: Looks like the bot doesn't pick German. Here:

**** A few decent ones I've read:

- linkffn(The Adventures of Harry Potter, the Video Game: Exploited) is promising, but the action hasn't really started yet
- linkffn(Harry Potter, Gaming Wizard Extraordinair) is good if you don't mind some spelling/grammar issues
- linkffn(Harry Potter: The RPG) is decent, but a little creepy (Harry takes the /Lecherous/ GURPS disadvantage)
- linkffn(Harry Potter: Game of the Year Edition) is very good but short and seems abandoned.

All of those are WIP, and none barring possibly the first two seem like they're going to update soon, so I'm probably going to try to write my own in the coming months. Still trying to decide if I should base the system on GURPS, d20, another existing system, or complete homebrew.

I think she'd have developed vastly differently in Slytherin than any of the other houses, on the condition that she be accepted into it by the other students.

From what I've seen here and on other forums, people seem to not like a) Hermione as something other than Gryffindor or Ravenclaw, b) Tom Riddle as an actual character instead of a kinda one dimensional, one track villain, c) the idea of Slytherin being far more political than just superficial concern about blood purify, d) making the war political at all instead of just blood fanaticism

Highly political from what I remember, and she was sorted into Slytherin and used it well. I've read a significantly more fitting fic, if I track it down I'll edit it in.

Edit: you might find something in [[https://m.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/326p9o/death_eaterhermione_and_slytherinhermione/][this]] rec thread. Part of the problem really is that either other Slytherins are horribly OOC (as is in the case with the one I linked), or Hermione as a character doesn't change from her nurtured Gryffindor traits (which would not be there in the same form if she were in Slytherin).

I actually like Hermione, but I think in canon a lot of her more ruthless traits were down played or ignored since she was one of the "good guys", so it's always interesting to see other characterisations. She's not a Slytherin in this story, but she certainly acts in a lot of ways like one following an unusual discovery.

Overall this is an interesting fic since it is basically a pretty major critique on most characters and on the post DH canon we've got. Not in the same vein of what i usually read but love interesting stuff nonetheless. I always remember it that's for sure.

All of them have more upvotes than downvotes, and all of them have at least a couple of upvoted recs. I see recommendations for slash fic that don't get downvoted in other threads as well.

I'm not trying to dismiss your feelings about this, and maybe the really downvoted threads are just not showing up in my search, but from my POV, it seems that the lack of slash is more that it simply doesn't get requested or recommended as often.

*** I'm not sure that slash, on its own, is what draws the downvotes on average. It might be that a lot of slash fanfiction uses and reuses ridiculous tropes and doesn't really draw in new ideas. Also, slash can tend to overshadow het ships in the larger communities, making it hard for people who aren't slash fans to fit in.

That said, I adore overused slash fic tropes like HPDM accidental bonding, soulmates, and veela!Draco. Just throw 'em at me and I will love you forever.

  HPDM slash. There is no reason for the Ministry to pull Unspeakable Draco Malfoy off his Dark artifacts detail and assign him to negotiate with Harry Potter's werewolf pack. Draco suspects a set up. When he meets Harry, however, he has to wonder if it's a different kind of set up than he anticipated. Updated every Tuesday. COMPLETE.

  This thread is about fics that would be unpopular in this subreddit hence the mention of bashing and the like.
#+end_quote

Except judging by the responses and upvotes, not so unpopular after all.

Thank You. At least you admit that you aren't very smart. Admittance it is the first step to recovery after all. Maybe there's hope for you yet.

I've read some where Molly and Arthur are paid by Dumbledore to befriend Harry, or promised that Harry will end up marrying Ginny in return for caring for him. Some fics have Ron being paid off in some form for befriending Harry.

Generally the Weasley's turn their back on him as soon as Harry stops being useful to them. These types of fics are generally considered AU and have a huge canon divergence so.... yeah. Not really the same.

Yeah, if you turn them into cardboard cut out villains, then it makes sense to want revenge on them. But in that case, you might as well make up your own characters, because you're writing OCs anyway. And if you're going to make up your own characters, it'd be cool if you wrote more interesting and plausible villains, but that might be too much to ask.

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=18801][The Enchanted Tower Room]] --- half sshg, half Severus/Lily flashback (which I skip over, but to each their own)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/676157/1/The-Fire-and-the-Rose][The Fire and the Rose]] --- body swap

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2070236/1/TwentyFour-Little-Hours][Twenty-Four Little Hours]] --- short, trapped in a jail cell, admitting to mutual attraction

[[http://www.restrictedsection.org/story.php?story=1284][For Someone Special]] --- weaker on plot, stronger on smut than my other recs; more of a guilty pleasure ;)

And two not-so-smutty, more bittersweet/dark ones:

[[http://ashwinder.sycophanthex.com/viewstory.php?sid=6501][Getting the Hang of Thursdays]] --- shor-tish, Groundhog Day esque, where Snape has to deal with Hermione dying every day in various ways; has two "canonical" endings, hopeful vs ... not.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10643632/1/We-Were-Ghosts][We Were Ghosts]] --- dealing with psychological wounds after the Final Battle and wanting to feel alive

** My very first ship I decided to read when I was 12 was H/Hr. For reference, I'm 23 now. I think (?) it was right around the time the whole Harmony wars and shit were dying down, so I missed out on that crazy, thank god, but I was still flamed mercilessly every time I posted something H/Hr-related. To be fair, I was 12-14 years old so I'm sure I was a shit writer, but god damn it was ridiculous. I deleted every single fic on my account and now I just shame read H/Hr fics a couple times a year. Can't help it. It's not like I ever thought that they "belonged together 4eva" or something, I just liked the idea of them together in general. Friends, siblings, lovers, I really didn't care, because I felt they were the two kids out of the trio that truly understood each other.

Now I'm a grown up and I read smutty Hermione/Lucius or Snape or Sirius because I'm apparently fucking insatiable.

***** Hate HPMOR? I think people don't care for it, most of the time when people comment on how they feel about the fic the overwhelming response is "I got bored after chapter 6-12"

I've never heard of anyone asking for a bondage harem bashing fic - although I did complain about the overabundance of said fics on AFFO at one point - usually what I see is somebody asking for a good harem fic and honestly unless you're looking for smut I can't think of any. Although I'm of the opinion that if you don't have anything to contribute to a request thread, you shouldn't contribute.

As to the less popular pairings like like Harry/Snape, Harry/Voldemort, Hermione/Snape, Hermione/Voldemort or any other cross generational pairing. People find those squiky and are more likely to respond negatively to it, at least on this subreddit but a quick look at the sheer volume of stories that are Hermione/Snape and Harry/Snape shows that our little group is an oddity in the fandom.

Once again I don't thing bigotry is involved, just a group of people with similar tastes have found each other here.
