Yes I spelled it like that on purpose

The best is the Through the Gate series by Preelikeswriting. It's a crossover with Fullmetal Alchemist. The two stories (Magic and Mind & Sorcery and Sigils) have very different plots. The first one, Magic and Mind, is about Ed arriving in the wizarding world and trying to find his way around. Also has some really clever world-building. And the second is about Ed at Hogwarts. He's sorted into Slytherin and though his somewhat rocky relationship with Draco is a really interesting read.

And the worst story I ever read was an Albus Severus/Delphi smut fic I accidentally read before I figured out how ratings worked on Ao3... ü§¢

Please don't ever again.

Best is Vox Corporis, worst is Methods of Rationality.
