not an Gay Bulge but the mythical spear G치e Bulg


** This seems pretty random. Have you tried checking out HP/FSN crossovers? I haven't seen one where Harry is Lancer (who has the spear) specifically, but it probably exists.

*** Or a HP/FFXIV Crossover where Harry is a Dragoon and promptly dies in every fight by standing in random shit on the ground!

** I wish i could help you, i do remember this occuring in one fic i read years ago but i dont remember the name.

I remember the basic premise being Harry trained and raised by Scathatch and when he proved himself as a worthy inheritor he became the carrier of Gae Bulg, M칩ralltach, and Beagalltach. I distinctly remember it wasnt a F/SN crossover but i dont remember the name or catagory.
