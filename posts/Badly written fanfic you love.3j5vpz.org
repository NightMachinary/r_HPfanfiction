** Honestly, Deprived linkffn(7402590). It's filled with cliches (mega-wands, wrong BWL, mega angst etc) the dialogue is dodgy as hell, especially when Harry speaks. Also to add on top of that he has a living emotion called Hate, tames a fucking dragon and gets fealty from some random Japanese woman for no reason because author is a weab. Also the bounty hunter names are just cheesy.

However, up to the parts before the Japanese woman appeared I found that it was an enjoyable read, and though far from a good story, it was like my guilty pleasure.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Manipulator of Destiny).

My god, it's so terrible but so good. I dont know why I love it. I have a weakness for trunk spaces? I'm not sure, but it's honestly one of my favorite 'worst' fics of all time. The ending is...just....wat. BUT I STILL LOVE IT

To be fair, it was written in 2006. TWO THOUSAND SIX.

** Linkffn(30 minutes that changed everything).

Not so much badly written grammatically but by age 11 Harry is mentally like 40 with an insane amount of education from a time compressed training session in Japan guided by his ghost future self. Really shows when he goes to Hogwarts with the rest of his stupidly OP year (cause why wouldn't everyone go?) and humiliates Dumbledore on the second day and Voldemort is neutered pretty quick the ...nothing My cause the author realised there's nowhere to go. Then the fics abandoned because the author wanted to write a really creepy sexist harem fic.
