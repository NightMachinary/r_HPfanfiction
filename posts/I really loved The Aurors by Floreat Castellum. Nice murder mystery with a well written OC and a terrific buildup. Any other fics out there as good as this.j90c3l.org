  When a mysterious woman comes to the Auror office claiming to be the victim of a terrible crime, Theia and Harry want to do everything they can to help her. The problem is, she has no memory of what has happened. As they piece together the sinister events, their own troubles and traumas rise to the surface, causing them to question who they really are. Sequel to The Aurors.

  The war is over and the summer is just getting started for Harry. Things should be better, but Harry's summer looks as dismal as ever. Hermione is in Australia - Ron and Ginny are holed up at the Burrow helping the family 'mend'. And trouble - loads of it, is just around the corner. HP/OC Rated M for adult themes and content.

** Harry Potter and the Conspiracy of Blood by cambangst

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6701647]]

Features 60+ Harry and his generation with adult children and grandkids of Hogwarts age. Canon pairings. The beginning is a bit confusing, but this is intentional since this is a murder mystery. Stick with it, it will become clear about a third in. Really well written with plot twists until the end.

**** If you love Conspiracy of Blood, maybe consider "Fate is a four letter word" by Philo afterwards. The fics are very similar to each other in general themes. I actually prefer "Fate" over "Conspiracy" and think Fate is the better-written fic.

The main reason I did not recommend "Fate" is because Fate is slash, heavy on graphic scenes and just looking at the main pairing can be really off-putting and make you go "WTF? No way I am reading that! There is no way this can be good.". I had this reaction myself for several years whenever I saw "Fate" recommended bc most authors write threesomes bc they could, not because they stopped and thought whether they should. Not in this case.

"Fate is a four letter word" starts with canon pairings and a 40+ year old Harry who has a career as a carpenter. James and Al have graduated but Lily is still at Hogwarts. Ginny is a professional quidditch player, Ron an Auror. A grisly murder happens. for the Aurors it is an open-and-shut case, but for Harry and Kingsley Shacklebolt it quickly becomes clear that something else is going on. Harry, his family and friends must team up with old enemies to catch the real killer and prevent another pureblood supremacist movement from rising to power.
