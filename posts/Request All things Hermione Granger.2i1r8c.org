I HATE it when fanfic authors make Hermione into some bimbo or show her as less than Ron/Harry/Draco/anyone. So, I request any long fanfics with a kick-ass Hermione. These can be time-travel/slytherin Hermione/anything really. Please and thankyou!


** This is absolutely what you are looking for and is, in my opinion, one of the best fics out there.

Summary: James Potter would never forget the first time he met Hermione Granger. Nor would he forget just how much he owed her for all she had done for him, his world, his family, and his future.

One Hundred and Sixty Nine. I love it. It's long, it develops well in my opinion, isn't too sappy, has pretty steady pacing.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. COMPLETE!

  Rated: Fiction M - English - Adventure/Romance - [Harry P., Hermione G.] Luna L. - Chapters: 13 - Words: 150,495

  --------------

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.
#+end_quote

It has sometimes been called /too/ loving a take on a StrongHermione. Still in the first year, but Harry has a lot of flashbacks to the Dark Future universe's Hermione, Witch Queen of the Isles and Dark Enchantress of the Seven Paths.

Harry's trying to /prevent/ that future, if things weren't clear, so it isn't a DarkHarry/DarkHermione story exactly. Some scenes from Hermione's point of view, but most from Harry's. Still, very much a story about Hermione.

Lots of original ideas, lots of riffs and subversions of classic tropes, and unfinished but updating (if slowly).

/Really/ didn't mean to push your buttons so, bro.

Your story is definitely an original and worth reading in the context of this thread.

A few other good portrayals of Hermione:

Larry Huss's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8127137/1/Palimpsest][Palimpsest]]. Hermione-centric story. 114k words, WIP (updated last month). He has a Jack Vance sort of indirectness to his writing that is appealing to some.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione gets some of the answers early. She has trouble understanding what all the questions are.
#+end_quote

Myst Shadow's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], 152k words, WIP (updated in August). Jump-off point is the end of 2nd year, when Ginny dies (Harry kills her to stop Tom Riddle). In this one, Harry, Hermione, and Ron are all driven, co-equal partners who get deadly serious about learning magic. Hermione's role is not diminished.

#+begin_quote
  What does it take, to reshape a child? And if reshaped, what then is formed? Down in the Chamber, a choice is made. (Harry's Gryffindor traits were always so much scarier than other peoples'.)
#+end_quote

Kwan Li's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School][Hogwarts Battle School]], 275k words, WIP (updated in August). Hermione is at once Harry's greatest partner and greatest rival. The story is an /Ender's Game/ fusion, though one needn't read Card's book to enjoy. It's presently in its second major arc.

#+begin_quote
  AU. Voldemort kills Dumbledore but is defeated by a child. In the aftermath, Snape becomes the Headmaster and radically changes Hogwarts. Harry Potter of House Slytherin begins his Third Year at Hogwarts Battle School and realizes that friend and foe are too similar for his liking. Competing with allies and enemies, Harry finds there is a cost to winning.
#+end_quote

Perspicacity's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4889913/1/Hallows-and-Pathos][Hallows and Pathos]], 17k words, complete. Hermione is pretty kickass, considering she [[/s][Spoiler]].

#+begin_quote
  A mistake by a dying man drives Hermione to obsession as she seeks to unlock the secrets of the Deathly Hallows. Harry, wanting only peace, tries to rid himself of the taint of death. Two friends clash in a tragic struggle for identity and destiny.

I think yours was a totally fair evaluation. I accept it and wear it like a badge.

I wasn't shooting for anything balanced or realistic in my writing. Instead, I aimed for sort of an anti-Harry Crow message.

Mysterious Fae instead of obvious goblins, StrongHermione instead of GodHarry, radical feminist rhetoric instead of grotesque hat-tipping, women with actual goals and ideals instead of thinly-veiled stage props.

It is a primary feature of the story, but it also makes it mostly about Hermione instead of Harry, even though he is the POV character most of the time.

** This story [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer]] is a good one for you, it's one I'm currently reading as well. Hermione is the primary protagonist in it and the word count is currently at 217k. There is a lot of math talk in it though, lol.

I have a few other stories that I can also recommend but I'll have to look for them later on tonight!

**** Yeah, that one is... Well, I tried reading it a while ago, and I found it to be one of the most *degrading* readings of Hermione's character that I have ever seen outside of a bashfic, at least among writers who do not appear to actively hate her character.

To quote from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/28080f/harry_and_hermione_pairing_where_they_meet_later/cij8m0d][my own rant on this topic]], while Harry is off being trained and growing his "magical core" and learning amazing wandless magic for the first four would have been Hogwarts years, Hermione has almost everybody in her year (particularly Draco and Ron) lining up to bully her, with the few that don't limiting themselves to merely ignoring and ostracizing her, all of which she appears to be helpless to do anything about. She dates Krum in her fourth year, but he merely takes advantage of her and breaks her heart in the end, leaving her pining for a good man who would treat her right (which is where Harry comes in). Fortunately, Harry shows up and immediately begins defending her honor and fixing all her problems. Isn't she fortunate?

** There was [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/29uddz/hermiones_perspective/][a thread on fics from Hermine's perspective]] a few months ago. Here are some that fit the bill that haven't been mentioned already:

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] by AlphaEph19: Salazar Slytherin takes over Wizarding England. Heavy AU with the characters remaining /very/ recognizeable.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9238861/1/Applied-Cultural-Anthropology-or][Applied Cultural Anthropology]] by jacobk: Best Slytherin!Hermione so far.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9323348/1/For-The-Only-Hope][For The Only Hope]] by ausland: Snape recruits Hermione to be Harry's bodyguard. Ends up being SS/HG albeit after years of accelerated aging from abusing a Time-Turner, but Hermione kicks a lot of arse. Speaking of which,

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5724097/1/Kick-in-the-arse-of-the-Wizarding-World][Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World]] by Alrissa: Future!Hermione sends a care package to her past self, maybe a little too much of a good thing, but a very fun read, branching out in interesting ways.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9767794/1/Hermione-Granger-The-Witching-Hour][Hermione Granger: The Witching Hour]] by Temairine, for the obligatory Video Game fic.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10462402][The Snake Pit]] by cupcake0118: A promising Slytherin!Hermione, though just starting out.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5537755/][Amends, or Truth and Reconcilliation]] by Vera Rozhalsky: Post-Hogwarts, Hermione deals with politics, Dementors, and all sorts of other things.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9821720/][The Stark Effect]] by NexusNebulous: Hermione adopted by Tony Stark. MadScientist!Hermione.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6948912/1/][Reconnaisance]] by Albernheit: Hermione talks to Hogwarts. Kind of surreal, but I like it.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8724634/1/][The Snow Queen]] by DarkLooshkin: Features a paranoid technomage Hermione as a deuteragonist.

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9045882/1/][A Pound of Flesh]] and the sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9672145/1/][Ill Met by Moonlight]] by Thomas M Riddle: A psychological struggle between Diary!Tom and Hermione.

- [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8137134/1/][Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents]] by CreatorZorah: May or may not be readable, depending on your tolerance for a non-native speaker's word choice issues. Basically, Harry becomes a winged basilisk animagus, who gets himself adopted by Hermione. Better than it sounds.
