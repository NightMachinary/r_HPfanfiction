You know, of the "Mary Poppins is a renegade witch" sort.

Mine is that Garden Gnomes aren't native to Earth at all --- they're miniaturized Sontarans (from /Doctor Who/) who have been performing the world's most conspicuous infiltration on the Wizarding World for decades. Because, I mean... grumpy potato-headed little men who yell at people, are really stupid, and quite vindictive. What is one supposed to think?


** After reading "The Wasteland" (an HP/LOTR crossover) by The Carnivorous Muffin, my headcannon is that the One Ring is a sentient horcrux.

Also, I like to think that the Philosopher's Stone is people à la /Fullmetal Alchemist/, with false stories of an alchemical recipe spread around to ensure that no one suspects the truth and tries to reproduce it.

******* No, because the ring wants to be with Sauron and works to get its bearers to Him. Its shown that Sauron knows where the wearer is when they put the ring on but he doesnt know exactly where they are if the ring isnt being worn. At the same time the ring does everything in its power to corrupt the person holding it by making false promises. Its why Hobbits make the best ring bearers they tend to be content with life compared to humans dwarfs and elves who all will want something (power for elfs, immortality and power for men and riches for dwarves)

** HP/SG1

- The SG1 team blows up Apophis' ships on the same day Voldemort is killed. Some wizards see the flash of light but just assume some idiot was celebrating the end of the war.

- In America, both the President and Vice President are told about wizards. Kinsey is horrified when he finds out and part of his plans involve using alien weapons against what he calls 'godless beings'. He is seriously the 'thou shalt not suffer a witch to live' type. He's a fanatic, but there's actually a lot of heads of government who view the Stargate as their way of becoming equal with wizards.

- Nirrti is so obsessed with advanced humans (hok'taur) because she found some early wizards while the Goa'uld still ruled earth.

- The Veil is a result of those early wizards trying to use magic to replicate the Stargate. Sirius is on some planet very far away.

- Plus, since I headcanon that the Ancients are just an advanced form of the Force Ghosts from Star Wars, I guess Star Wars also exists in this reality.

***** You're welcome. But, ah, how does that work? At what point did wizards get so confused as to think their pseudo-Stargate was actually a door to the Afterlife? Considering that A) doors to the Afterlife are supposed to be impossible, so wizards would have very strong initial skepticism for such an idea, and B) the Veil is studied by Unspeakables, whom we have every reason to believe know their stuff.

Also, it seems that Sirius's interplanetary adventures must have ended in tragedy not too long after the beginning of his journey... since we do get confirmation he's quite dead by /Deathly Hallows/. Do you have any particular idea of how it all went?

Well, that part of the world has been held by lots of people over the centuries. The Britons, the Romans, the Britons again, the Saxons, the Danes - back and forth between them and the Anglo-Saxon proto-english for about a century - and then the Normans. Written records being lost would be more likely than not, frankly. Thereafter, guesswork and conjecture being elevated to the status of Known Fact takes care of the rest. The Unspeakables may be clever wizards, but they're still wizards, a breed capable of clinging to startlingly obvious nonsense in the name of tradition.

****** The actual Stargate was buried and forgotten to keep Earth safe. It's possible wizards did the same with the veil. While I don't consider interviews canon, I do remember Rowling saying saying something about the veil being there as long as there was a DoM, leading to the idea that it was maybe rediscovered much later and the DoM was built around its biggest mystery. Note that unspeakables studying it doesn't really mean they understand it yet. It's in a research area. Something falls through and cannot be located anywhere on Earth: it no longer being a part of this world is a logical idea.

As for the second part, the resurrection stone is the most suspect hallow to me. The idea that people who loved and died trying to save Harry walked him to his death is creepy and wrong. The suggestion is that it's not really made by death and the other Hallows don't work as intended either. Moody can see through the cloak and the wand is not unbeatable. It's a wizard trying to make something with a human's limited knowledge. It's a fake, an echo from your own memory and controlled by your own needs and emotional state. That's why Lily/James/Sirius walked Harry to his death. That's why the third brother didn't get what he wanted from his echo and ultimately killed himself. None of the Hallows do what the legend says they do.

******* I think the Resurrection Stone is flawed enough as it is --- it only brings back ghost-like shades, rather than perform /actual/ resurrection. Plus, since Heaven is awesome, not only do none of them want to stick around the Earth, but they'll have a tendency to make death sound so great that they'll drive whoever they talk to to suicide.

From the way the scene is played off, I think Rowling really didn't mean for the Stone-Ghosts to be fakes; the sadness, the flaw in the Stone is in the very idea of bringing people back from the dead, because it's against the natural order and none of the people involved will be happy with the results, least of all the dead people. As for their "walking Harry to his death"... first, it was kind of necessary under the circumstances; so I'd liken it to family members standing around someone dying of an untreatable illness or something like that. The death is inevitable and it's sweet that they're there with them till the end. Second, for a slightly edgier take on it: they've all been dead for a while and clearly love their Next Great Adventure in the Afterlife... so of /course/ their attitude towards death would seem creepy and flippant to the living.

As for Moody seeing through the Cloak, in fairness, we never find out where /the Eye itself/ came from. It's popularly reckoned that it's an artifact as unique and powerful as the Hallows themselves, either created by Dumbledore for him (which, as Dumbledore could dispose of the Cloak for study, would explain it) or an ancient relic Moody got on an adventure.
