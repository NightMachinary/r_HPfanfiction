Preferably minimal roles for Hermione and Ron No H/G


** On mobile so no links atm, but Grow Young With Me by taliesin19 and Strangers at Drakeshaugh by Northumbrian are both quite good. Don't read the sequel to SaD if you dislike cliffhangers, it's dead as a coffin nail.

**** Oh. Didn't notice that. Ngl, even if I had, I would have recommended it anyway. That fic is too good for something like shipping wars to get in the way, and it does a good job with their relationship.

  Living a frugal life in a small cottage out in the middle of nowhere, is Harry Potter really who he seems? New recruit Laura Madley finds an odd file going through the tax records and begins to investigate. She doesn't know what to think, but something about him keeps pulling her back.

  If Harry had gone to see his godson after the Battle of Hogwarts, could Harry abandon Teddy like he had been abandoned? And how does Andromeda Tonks deal with the death of her husband and daughter? This is a story of broken people putting each other back together. No godmoding,no time travel, no Epilogue,no Cursed Child, no moving countries. Percy dies not Fred. Harry at 17 onwards
