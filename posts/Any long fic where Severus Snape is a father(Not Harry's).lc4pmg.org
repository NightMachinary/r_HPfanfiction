****** "Weasley! Keep your mouth away from my daughter!"

"Now I'm your daughter! What happened to 'that thickheaded girl who couldn't make a Calming Draught for the live of her'? Just leave me alone!"

No, wait... That's too soap opera... Better keep it crack

** I have written a whole [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/952881][series]] where he's married with daughters and also raising a much younger sister. The first one is heavily in his pov, but he plays a large role in many of the other stories in the series too.

*** Hey, a bit of spoiler ahead.

You killed Lottie in summer skeletons.

Does she stay that way in all of your fics or is this one just an AU to your AU?

***** I'm not sure if I want to spoil it for myself since I've only read first few chapters of Long Way From Home.

So will she find her way back home which will eventually lead to Summer Skeletons? or does she stay where she has found herself?

****** Ah, well, it's really only a little spoiler. Whether she goes home or not of course matters, but there's a lot else that happens worth reading for too I think. Lottie will be going home and then the events of "Summer Skeletons" happen a couple of years after.

******* Cool. I hope someday you'll also write an AU where she leads a fulfilling life. It's fanfiction after all. She is one the very few OCs that I've got attached to.

******** Maybe. I certainly can't say no, it won't happen. I often end up surprising myself by writing a story and seeing the possibility for more stories based on the original story. I had no intention of writing more stories in the universe Lottie's found herself in when I began "Long Way From Home", but now that I'm getting near to the end of the story, I do have some ideas for a story for Ren that I might end up doing in the future.

All of that said, I do see Lottie as having led a fulfilling life (as short as it is) she loved, was loved, and leaves a meaningful imprint on the lives of so many.

I'm happy you've come to like her character as much as you have. She's a fun one.

** Maybe Calista Snape series? I can't remember the author but it was very long. It was centered more on the daughter.

  AU, where nothing as simple as good vs. evil. A summer spent trapped in Number 4 and barred from contact with his friends leads to Harry accepting an offer to correspond with a Death Eater. The consequences of thinking for oneself are far reaching.
