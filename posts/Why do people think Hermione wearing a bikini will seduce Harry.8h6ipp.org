** Cuz canon implies that Harry didn't think of Hermione as a 'girl' till the Yule Ball. So since wearing a bikini is the opposite of robes, that serves as proof of her 'girlishness'?

Dunno, don't try to explain poor writing choices

** Nope. There is no indication in the book that they're wearing swimming costumes, let alone a bikini (in /February/ in *Scotland*). The only one noted to be wearing anything that isn't robes is Krum.

Fleur is explicitly wearing robes both before and after the task.

*** If she wore robes into the lake, then no wonder she failed the task.

** TIL: It's weird for teenage boys to be attracted to girls in bikinis.

I learn something new from your wonderful threads everyday. Please never stop.
