Mine is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7151727/1/The-Magic-Of-Torchwood][The Magic of Torchwood]] by Bella The Strange. It's a crossover between Torchwood and Harry Potter and I just have always loved it for two reasons:

1. It's funny as hell.

2. The author clearly loves both fandoms and it just shows.

So the plot is your basic crossover story, the characters end up going to Hogwarts and get sorted into houses during the third book. I love how Hogwarts is written in this story and especially as the characters grow up into this world, Hogwarts becomes much darker and more realistic. Harry ends up growing closer to the characters and while I won't spoil it for others I will say that if you want a Harry who is starting to think of the world outside of the black and white of Voldemort bad and Dumbledore good then you will like this book.

As for the humor, the book is filled with it. Bella The Strange ends up bringing the Torchwood characters' dark comedy up several notches and it works amazingly. Ianto and Owen definitely get a lot of good snipes at each other, but everyone really does get one, even Draco.

So I love this book, even if it's been unfinished for so long. Even if the author never gives us an ending, I am still in love with this book and it will always make me want to reread it.

What about y'all? What fanfiction keeps drawing you back?


** Seventh Horcrux. It's so hilarious, and when I'm in a bad mood, it never fails to cheer me up. I didn't like the idea of Harrymort at first, but once I read the first chapter, I could NOT stop laughing all the way through.

** The Denarian Trilogy. Perfect anti-hero!Harry, great wit, great plot, etc. It's not perfect, but I know if I ever get bored, it'll be there waiting for me to cheer me up.

** linkffn(C'est La Vie)

It makes me feel good to read. I think the author really captures the essence of the characters. The OCs are really well done as well. I really hope the author comes back some time.

Luna especially is probably my favorite in fanfiction.

#+begin_quote
  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

** For me, it's always been nonjon's 'A Black Comedy'. It laughs at most of the other 'into another dimension' fanfics out there, it shows one of the best interactions between Harry and Sirius as friends (plus partners-in-crime), and the background for 'That Fucker' (won't spoil it for those who haven't read it) is unique for this story as far as I know.

Plus, it's funny as fuck. 10/10, will always laugh until I cry at the 'Midget Detention' scene.

*** Seconding this. I've reread all of nonjon's stuff about every six months since I discovered it. A Black Comedy and Browncoat, Green Eyes are the only two stories that consistently come to mind when I think of my top fanfic list.

I still have yet to find another story that does any justice to the circumstances behind That Fucker. A well done [[/spoiler][Dark Lord Ginnymort]] would easily be my favorite character ever.

I absolutely love the prose in both fics. The fast pace, the snappy one-liners and the slightly sarcastic authorial voice never fail to engage me. Also, the characterization of main character is awesome in both stories.

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle.

** linkffn(The Thorny Rose) trilogy. It isn't the best written and there's some bashing in it, which I usually hate, but it's very lighthearted and cheerful overall, and while I do love me some really depressed and deep literature, that stuff just isn't what I'm looking for in HP fanfiction. Whenever I need a pick-me-up or just want to lose myself in very happy and sappy teenage romance, I just read that.
