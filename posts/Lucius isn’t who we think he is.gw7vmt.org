I like to think that Lucius Malfoy is totally and utterly under Narcisa's thumb. He likes to think he is this big bad politician, spooky former death eater but truthfully he avoids 1 thing at all costs: pissing off his wife. Good thing Narcisa is so far above her childish husband that really, she doesn't care about what he does. Join the death eaters? Why Lucius if that's what you want, just be sure to not drip blood in the carpets. Safeguarding a book for the Dark Lord? Yes of course, just don't let little Draco find it. What is it this time? You will fund the ministers campaign? Sure just don't touch the money for the rose garden. Lucius runs everything through Narcisa, but really she just doesn't care. She only cares about her son, her garden and the antiques.


** "Yes, I think we'll hold meetings here quite often from now on," Voldemort sat down on the couch, and casually put his feet up on the coffee table. He didn't notice all the color drain from Lucius Malfoy's face. He simply continued talking until Lucius cleared his throat loudly.

"Something you wish to say, Lucius?" Voldemort, being a Dark Lord, was not used to being interrupted in such a way. Lucius looked like a frightened deer, but spoke anyway, his words coming out like a squeak "My Lord... Forgive me, it's just that- my wife... Doesn't like when people put their feet on the coffee table."

Voldemort glared at him for what seemed like minutes, then to his surprise, began to laugh. And after a few seconds, Lucius started to laugh as well, though more nervously. Soon all the eaters were laughing. Until Voldemort was sent flying into the wall.

"Dear, haven't I asked you not to let your little friends put their feet on my clean coffee table?" At that voice, Lucius once again stiffened.

"Sweetie, I did warn him, but he just laughed," Lucius quickly pointed out. He knew it wouldn't absolve him completely, but at least most of her wrath would be directed at Voldemort.

"Oh did he? You obviously didn't get the point across well enough then, don't worry dear, I'll take care of it." Narcissa said, and conjured thousands of needles, which she quickly banished at Voldemort.

With as many terrible things as Lucius had seen, you wouldn't think seeing his master turned into a human pin cushion would make him vomit, but he quickly ran off to the bathroom to do so. (The last time he vomited on the floor, his loving wife had nearly neutered him like a dog.)

Voldemort coughed weakly, the greatest wizard of all time, reduced to a puddle, he looked up at Narcissa, who smiled down at him. "You aren't going to do that again, are you?"

Voldemort shook his head. What else could he do?

"Great. Now I want to discuss some concerns I have about my son joining your little group..."

Why did Voldemort get the feeling this was going to be a long night?

It came to mind so I wrote it. I can't help but hate my own writing it seems, but I hope someone at least found it funny...

*** You reminded me of an old fic where Lucius is totally terrified of his wife, I don't remember if it is Harry/Draco or Hermione/Draco but in the fic she is secretly the “head” of the family so to speak. I wanted one where Lucius is still afraid to upset her but she is apathetic of him and his comings and goings at most.

**** Yeah. I always imagined her aloof and unsatisfied with her marriage, but one thing she does have is a very strong motherly instinct, and she loves her son dearly, woe betide anyone who harms him.

***** Totally, I don't think she was that bad of a person. After all a family that can produce both bella and Andy can't be so simple. Lucius we can all agree was a huge evil fuck. But her I always pictured as making the most of her situation and being the picture of a slytherin, self-serving and selfish. She did love Draco, that nobody can take away.

*** I imagine her being like an indulgent mother: of course you and your little friends can launch a terrorist campaign from the living room Lucius!does mrs. Voldemort know about it tho? As long as little Tom has her permission. But mind the furniture sweetheart, you are all so cute with your masks and costumes.
