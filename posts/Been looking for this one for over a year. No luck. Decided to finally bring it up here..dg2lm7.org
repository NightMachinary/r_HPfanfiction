:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
There's a fic where Harry has to travel back in time but then has to live and experience all the years forward until the time he disappeared. Here's what I remember:

1. He meets with Merlin after travel and goes to the Druidic era

2. He is taught their magic and later travels the globe

3. Helps goblins in a fight and helps set up Gringotts.

4. He is the Pater Familias (don't think that's the right spelling) of the Potter family

5. He becomes Lord Slytherin and also adopts Tom Riddle

6. When he reaches his time he sends the current Harry back to complete the cycle and then is forced back into his younger form with memories locked.

7. He meets Headmaster Dumbledore in his office where Dumbledore somehow gets injured and then he somehow taps into his knowledge and uses a Druidic ritual to save Dumbledore's life.

8. There's also something about him becoming a Warlock. Or being called and referred to as one at least.

That's all I remember and there is a very slight chance I may have mixed two stories. But the odds of that are very low. Been looking for this for the last year and haven't found it. But I did find several other fics that led me to others and so on (you know how it is). Thanks for the help!!!


** Some of that sounds like linkffn(Basilisk-born)

** This sounds like linkffn(Basilisk-Born), which in-an-of-itself is an honestly hard to stomach riff of linkffn(The Long Journey Home) but with canon-bashing.

*** Both stories are similar in terms of the plot and how the story unfolds. It has the concept of going to the past and living the years forward. But it's not the one I'm looking for. Thanks for the help though!!

P.S: I've read both of them.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)
