:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Particularly looking for a specific fic but open to other suggestions too. The only part of the fic I remember is what the title says. A few ghosts decide to teach history of magic despite Dumbledore not being happy about it. It wasn't any of the house ghosts I believe? But I might be wrong.

I would appreciate it if someone can tell me which fanfiction it is. Thanks!


** In “Accidental Animagus by [[/u/TheWhiteSquirrel]]” linkao3(14078862), they help to teach with the full blessing of Dumbledore.
