** A Difference in the Familyï¼š The Snape Chronicles. Seriously, I never want it to end. I just know it's going to break my heart when it does. It grips you right from the first chapter with the realism. My only criticisms are that Hagrid's dialect seems off, not that it's easy to get right, and young Sevvie's a touch too nice. Maybe. Go read it if you haven't. Let's be heartbroken together.

**** The part where he inherits the "monster" or whatever is pretty interesting, though, and seems pretty plausible. I wish that had been played with a bit more. But yeah, I found his reasoning for joining the Death Eaters a bit too innocent. I don't consider this head-canon, though, merely one possible way in which he could have developed as a character. A more realistic way would be more complex and darker, but it's well-written enough that I could forgive this and quite a bit more very easily.

****** True, the Marauder thing was not developed too well. The author made an effort, but the book dialogue didn't fit the characters they wrote. I also don't agree that severus is a natural Occlumens.

**** according to when I replied to the op, it's only been four hours, but it feels like days. I read this story all the way through in that time. the only way to describe it both as a whole and the last words: hauntingly beautiful. I'm seriously crying right now. It is definitely good enough to read again, and I obviously just couldn't put it down.

*** I started reading this the day you posted and I've more or less finished it now. It's bloody fantastic. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Harry/Hermione relationship, and I know that sounds silly considering the nature of the fic, but still... the other elements are great.

** DAYD. Not my favorite fic by any mean, and it has lots of problems, but once you pick it up, you can't put it down until ya done. Also, the current Firebird Trilogy fic. The first was pretty good, the second had some pacing problem mid-way, and this one is rapidly reaching epic status (and its updated weekly).

** I just read The Fallout by sage (or everythursday, depending on where it's hosted) and it consumed all of my nonessential brainspace for a week. Be warned, it's Draco/Hermione, but it is excellent writing and a great plot and most importantly, everyone is mostly in character and believable. Srsly go read it and love it. It is rated M, though, for sexual situations.

** This one is really good. Author's synopsis: "This story is being written as a response to JKR's comment in an interview where she said if Snape could choose to live his life over, he would choose Lily over the Death Eaters."

** I'm always entranced by the classics: Nonjon, Rorschach, Sarah1281, Robst, GenkaiFan, Jbern, and many others on my user page on FFN. just pretend my own fics don't exist lol.

I can honestly read Browncoat, Green Eyes and A Black Comedy over and over again. Every time I do I find myself hours and hours later with only my internet history hinting at where the time went.

If you check out ARedHair's profile, they have hundreds of fics favorited, and the majority of the completed ones are solid page turners.
