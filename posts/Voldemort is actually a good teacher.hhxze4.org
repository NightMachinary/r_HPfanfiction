***** I think part of that divide stems from an important but easily overlooked distinction: a skilled author does not always agree with the protagonist. If you read HPMoR thinking that Eliezer Yudkowsky agrees with everything that Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres says or does, then you'll likely end up hating it. But if you step back a bit and see how the story recognises Harry's many mistakes and inflicts consequences for them, the picture becomes clearer. After all, the "rationality" community that Yudkowsky was promoting is called Less Wrong - ie it's about recognising ways that we're doing things wrong, and trying to do /less/ things wrong.

A snippet from the conclusion:

#+begin_quote
  He'd failed to reach what Harry was starting to realise was a /shockingly/ high standard of being so incredibly, unbelievably rational that you actually started to /get things right/, as opposed to having a handy language in which to describe afterwards everything you'd just done wrong.

**** Whatever do you mean? His job was to teach the students to defend themselves, and he did that very effectively. In terms of actual spellwork, he may have taught only a few mostly harmless basics, which seems /entirely appropriate/ for 11-year-olds, but spell repertoire isn't what he really wanted them to learn.

  The old witch did not move her eyes from where she was gazing at the Defense Professor's balding head. "The Stunning Hex is not a first-year spell, Lord Greengrass, but that is not the skill I had in mind. They supported each other with those simple spells, they reacted at speed to surprises..." The Director of the DMLE paused, as though searching for words that a mere civilian could understand. "In the midst of battle," she said finally, "with spells flying in every direction... those children seemed quite at home."

  "Indeed, Director Bones," said the Defense Professor. "Some arts are best begun in youth."

  The old witch's eyes narrowed. "You are readying them to become a military force, Professor. To what end?"

  "Now hold on!" interjected Lord Greengrass. "There's plenty of schools where they teach dueling in first year!"

  "Dueling?" said the Defense Professor. From behind it wasn't visible if the pale face was smiling. "That is nothing, Lord Greengrass, to what my students have learned. They have learned not to hesitate in the face of ambushes and greater foes. They have learned to adapt when combat conditions change and change again. They have learned to protect their allies, to protect more those who are more valuable, to abandon pieces which cannot be rescued. They have learned that to survive they must follow orders. Some have even learned a little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass, /these/ wizards will not hide in their manors and wait to be protected, when the next threat comes. They will know that they know how to fight."

**** Considering that he was teaching magic, which isn't a real thing, it's hard to see how the author could have shown his teaching more explicitly.

We do see him giving his students ample opportunity to apply what they've learned in realistic scenarios, which is a component of good teaching. Umbridge, a canon example of a bad teacher, pointedly didn't do that.

  AU: Voldemort had no idea what she was starting when she attacked the Potters on Halloween night. Not only did she create a living legend in Charlus Potter, The Boy Who Lived, but she unknowingly touched the life of another just as deeply. Harry Potter grew up anonymous and alone, and when he reached Hogwarts, he was not quite what everyone would have expected. WBWL, Fem!Voldemort.
