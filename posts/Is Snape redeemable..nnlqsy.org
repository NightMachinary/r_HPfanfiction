He's worse than the Dursley's and it's not really close.


** On the whole, yes. He's just an asshole, not actually a murderer. This may be an unpopular opinion, but there's a lot of worse things one can be other than a bullying teacher, so Snape's not that bad really. And I say this as someone who met one's fair share of Umbridge-like teachers growing up, and then some. (Seriously, when I look back, I want to slap my younger self for not telling my parents the kind of shit that went on.)

**** Yeah, I know, and to this day I haven't forgiven some of my teachers for being absolute utter shits of human beings, but still, in the big scheme of things, there really is a lot worse things one can be. There are also many people out there who are super nice to kids whom I would rank below Snape, for being cowardly little goody two shoes who talk big about good and evil but would run a mile rather than fight. Whatever the motives, Snape did put his life on the line.

*** Actually he IS a murderer.

Do you think he could be in Voldemort inner circle without killing, and torturing hundred of innocents?

Snape is a monster who fight against his old boss because he killed his teenager sexual obsession.

** I used to be a huge Snape fan( as you can see from my username) but I got an teacher who was exactly like Snape, I mean he used to bully one of the best students in our class and preferred his neighbour's daughter who was a good student but not that much and extremely snooty.I used to take note of the interaction and saw that it really doesn't matter if your bully of a teacher had a crush on your mother. Snape hated Harry just for looking like James(does that mean he wouldn't have if he looked like Lily?) and compared him to his "dead" father who died protecting his family, whom Harry idolized and asked him questions on his first day at class! My parents are teacher, believe me, and I know that you just not ask questions on the first day of class. And that excuse about his being in good books of Voldemort, Voldemort himself was in the school that year!He didn't instruct Quirell to do so! And Crouch? And if you are fixated on the same woman even after 15 years, that's obsession, not love. And that werewolf incident, if Hermione in third year can figure out he is one, I bet plenty of older years and atleast some Ravenclaws would have figure it out, and his housemates? Werewolves can't touch silver, they must have noticed during potions. Did they report Remus?No! But Snape had to follow them to expel them. Yes Sirius was a immature boy, I can agree with that, but still. James being a bully? We don't have any point of view other than Snape's and we don't know what Snape had done to James and his friends! Lily is seen informing Snape about how her friends do not like their friendship, surely she would have told them about their previous friendship? And Snape's friends just plainly did some " cruel" things to Lily's friends, but he just evaded it by saying that James has a crush on her! And him being a spy and risking his life? Voldemort thought that Snape was his spy in Dumbledore's Order and Snape does give him some correct informations, or else Voldemort wouldn't have trusted him regarding the flight of seven harrys. Sorry if I went into rant, but forever grudge holding people are very hard to be redeemed...

** Depends from who's perspective you're looking. He's shitty to students that are outside his house but he is respected by the Slytherins. He also seems to be quite, at least, appreciated within the staff, within the Order and by the Death Eaters. Harry hates him and he hates Harry and the Gryffindors. As for being worse than the Dursleys I don't know, but I know that his detentions involve doing mundane tasks without magic and not sending a bunch of kids at night in the Forbidden Forest while a unicorn killer is on the loose such as some other more beloved teachers do.

** Questions you need to clarify before even /attempting/ to discuss:

- What do you think are the relevant actions

- By what moral metric are you evaluating his behaviour

- And finally, what does it mean to be redeemed

Depending on the combination, you end up anywhere between yes and no. About the only detail you provided was an (implicit) judgement of his actions: If he had done nothing wrong, by your standards, there would be no need for redemption.

So let's question that first: /Why/ are the relevant actions of Snape wrong?

**** Dumbledore was also a blood supremacist for a cool few years before it had consequences to a person he cared about. He was probably projecting.

And there were plenty of awful teachers and unsuitable punishments for children in that school. If you take into account Dumbledore was the headmasters ALL those actions are ultimately his responsibility and yet he is a much more redeemable character?

**** That's not my point though.

The question is, why is "bullying his (non-Slytherin) students" and "being a blood supremacist" /wrong/. In other words, what is your (or the hypothetical, if you're asking about possibilities) moral framework you operate in.

It's not usually an issue; usually, you'd agree by and large most people adhere to a certain standard, and by that standard something is unforgivably wrong or it isn't, but that doesn't help you here, if you want to know if it all /can/ be forgiven. In particular, to take the most extreme stance, Lucius Malfoy would not think those two things needed to be forgiven, since they weren't wrong in the first place.

** Depends of what you mean by "redeemable".

Snape is an asshole, a petty man who took pleasure into tormenting his students and who probably only kept his job because Dumbledore /really/ needed him close for reasons unrelated to his talent in potions. He is clearly a "bad" man who the start to the end. Though whenever he is worse than the Dursley is up to debate since, while both assholes, they are of a different kind.

But at the same time, Snape played his role perfectly. While he hated Harry from the start, he did everything in his power to protect his life. On Dumbledore's orders, he came back in the rank of the Death Eaters, managing to fool Voldemort in the process, and managed to become one of Voldemort's "most trusted". In DH, he even use his position as a Headmaster to "limit" the damages made by the Carrows, at least until the Trio escape from Malfoy's Manor. An example of that is the "detention" he gave the Neville, Ginny and Luna after they tried to steal Gryffindor's sword in his office. He knew very well that a night in the forest with Hagrid is barely a punishment, especially when compared to whatever they Carrows would have done (with the Cruciatus probably involved).

​

So, if you only judge Snape character, he is probably irredeemable. Losing his Blood Purist views was probably the maximum he could do in term of improvement, and he was still a petty, bitter man that should probably not have been in charge of children. But if you judge his actions, Snape was a key actor of the war (I don't think anyone outside of Harry, Voldemort and Dumbledore played a bigger role), who took every risk possible for his side to win. Even at the very end, when being bitten by Nagini, his last moments were not spend trying to save his life, but making sure Harry gets the last information he needs to play his own role. And with it, I think he redeemed himself.

*** Snape is very much like a tragic hero and his heroic deeds and acts are negated by the fact if he didn't tell about the prophecy then Lily and James don't die on halloween that day and the longbottoms aren't tortured so early

**** Another important point is that, while Snape is indubitably on the right side, his motivations are just terrible :

- Snape didn't betray Voldemort because he stopped believing in blood purity or didn't want to kill a child, he changed side for Lily.
- He didn't protect Harry because protecting a child was his responsability, or even because he truly believed that Harry was important for the war, he did it because Harry was Lily's son.
- And in the end, he wasn't opposed to Harry having to sacrifice himself because he liked the boy, he was opposed because of Lily.

Even if his character did have some development in the story (the fact he asked Phineas Black to not use the word "Mudblood" even when they were alone show that he became at least opposed to Blood Purity), pretty much everything Snape did was motivated by his feelings for Lily. Which may seem kinda weak when compared to the others "/Stopping a genocide may be the right thing to do?/", not to mention it raises the question about whenever Snape would have been nearly as usefull if Neville had happened to be the BWL.

That's the reason why I think Snape's life may be summarised by "/A bad man, who did the right thing, for the wrong reason/".

Also, while totally accidental, Snape's actions may have saved the Ministry. From what we learn from Canon, the Ministry was barely holding up even after starting the use the Unforgiveables when Voldemort vanished. Which means that without the Prophecy, Harry may have had a better childhood (hard to be worse than the Dursley), but it would have sucked for pretty much everyone else.

** Snape was a high rank D.E. How many innocent did he raped, tortured and killed to reach this position?

He only changed sides because his boss killed his sexual obsession. If Voldemort had decided to go after Neville, Snape would have remained a happy murderer until the end. ...

And seriously. What was Snape plan with Lily? Voldemort would kill James and Harry... and then? What would do Snape with a destroyed woman? To make her his sexual slave? To brainwash her? Obliate and imperiuse her?... Because he couldn't think she would want anything to do with the murderers of her loving husband and son...

Luckily for Lily, Snape plan didn't work. ..

So no redemption. Snape was a monster who fought on the right side of the war just to get revenge.

** Sure, if you're willing to change his actions in a story you can redeem him, but one of the things about canon Snape is that he chooses not to move on from the heartbreaks in his life and he wallows in bitterness and contempt for himself and literally everyone else on the planet.

I feel like a defining thing about his character is that at any point he could actually choose not to be a complete and utter cunt, but he makes that choice.

There are environmental and social factors outside of his control but the sheer enthusiasm with which he embraces being a bitter and caustic human is definitely a choice. And not just one but a continual choosing of the low road.

So in short, yes, I do believe he's redeemable but I also think he chooses not to actually go after true redemption.

** You are assuming that redemption depends on the gravity of the transgression but there are people that believe that everything is redeemable.

"Everything that can be understood can be forgiven."

If you think like that there's no such a thing as unredeemable, so this is a question about personal beliefs. If you assume that redemption is just for some people that weren't /that bad/ it really depends on where you draw your line about wrong doings. Being a bully? Murder? Bigotry? And which rule are you using to measure? law? divine law? your own?

Or are you asking if it can be done in fics? Definitely. It's fiction /everything/ can be accomplish with enough writing skills and convincing prose. In the books his redemption was a bit up in the air, but I also think it has a lot to do with the generational gap that new readers have with the original work and JKR.
