** Boy, I sure do wish Checkmated had done the same, rather than just letting the domain expire.

**** Not that I know of. The whole site was custom coded by one person and my beta was pretty friendly with her. Apparently it would have been a lot of work to even make the stories available for importing and she had more important things to do. Oh well.

*** Because it's still technically in "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Open_and_closed_beta][open beta]]". Presumably it'll be out of beta once it gets a 1.0 stable release, but right now it's still [[https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/commits/v0.9.218.10][v0.9.218.10]].

** Oh, fantastic! Those forums were great also back in the day, guess they fizzled out like a lot of the fandom stuff did
