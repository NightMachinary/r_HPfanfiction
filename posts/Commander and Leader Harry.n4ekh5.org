I was wondering if their was any fanfictions out there where Harry leads his own Potters Army. Basically him following Voldemort's path where Harry gathers his own followers into his own group which he uses to wage war against the Ministry or another group.

  AU. Harry was born with a power the Dark Lord knows not: the magic to see into shadows, to walk the shadows, and to send the shadows everywhere. This changes his life rather dramatically.

*** And this one is adult Harry goes back in time so it's not specifically what you asked for, but he does somewhat accidentally collect followers, and you might enjoy the way that goes linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21527806/chapters/51317527]])
