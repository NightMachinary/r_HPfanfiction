Any fics where Snape is "properly" sorted into Gryffindor?


** Snape time travels to his pre-Hogwarts days after his death and is sorted into Gryffindor: linkffn(6548167) Goes until after Hogwarts graduation & is complete.

** I remember reading one fic, in which Snape went back in time and got sorted into Gryffindor, but Marauder bashing was so bad, that I couldn't read it:( Would be nice if there was a fic where Snape is a fourth marauder instead of wormtail... and without time-travel, it was positively creepy reading Lily/Snape romance, when he is actually 40 years old, and she is 13.

*** The one where he goes back in time and becomes a Gryff is His Greatest Wish by AndromedaMarine, the one [[/u/mergirl007][u/mergirl007]] linked.

I agree, it would be cool to read a Gyffindor!Snape that doesn't involve time travel. Too bad they're not as prevalent as Slytherin!Harry.

**** It just doesn't feel right that almost 40 years old Snape would be interested in a relationship with Lily, who is obviously not the same woman he came to love in his time. She would be just a small girl and he wouldn't be a boy who is desperate for a friend and someone to understand him. Lily was his one true love maybe, but he wouldn't be able to build the same relationship with young Lily.

***** Yea, thinking about it now I guess that is pretty creepy. Funny enough, Snape relives his life fics are what got me into fanfiction. O_O

******* Alas, they all have a heavy focus on Snape/Lily romance. And at least one bashes James Potter into a very early grave.

It would be interesting to see one where Snape goes back and Lily STILL falls for James. Watching him deal with losing her to romance/happiness while still trying to prevent her early death would be pretty neat.

******** Sadly, as much as I like canon Snape, I can't read fanfics, authors of which are big Snape fans. They tend to portray James as complete arse, while Snape is a victim. I think the tragedy is that they are both brilliant but couldn't find the common ground.

********* I don't like it when all people get lumped into one category. I am a Snape fan, but I like the character of James too and I think the James bashing serves no purpose whatsoever other than creating a bad story.

********* A Difference in the Family: A Snape Chronicles. Definitely paints Snape as a victim, mostly of circumstance and bad environment and many things, but I don't think it does much of the James bashing. There's rightful criticism in the whitewashing of some of Snape's horrible decisions, but it really is a good fic that gives you a great conflicted Snape.

**** I'm more creeped out by the whitewashing done on him to make him palatable.

On the other side of the coin, I'd be impressed if anyone manages to write a Snape romance where he's in-character and has his canon appearance.

I'm /almost/ tempted to write it just to push against the 99.9% of stuff that has him OOC ... but then I'm not sure what poor character I could possibly inflict him upon. Plus, I don't think I have enough skill for it.

***** Why does there need to be requited romance? I'll never get it. The books were as romantic as possible when it came to the character of Snape - bordering on sappy. Unrequited romance is romance, too. That said every fic in which Snape is close to his canon self is worth reading, so I think you should just try it.
