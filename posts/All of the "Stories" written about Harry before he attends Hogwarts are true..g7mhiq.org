Harry really did beat a Nundu at 5, is married to a Fairy Princess, has tamed Dragons, and is secretly the next incarnation of Merlin. He just acts humble in order to be polite and not lord it over everyone. But everything is revealed during the Triwizard Tournament, when the Dragon bows to him, hands him the egg casually, and salutes, and then when his Fairy Wife turns up for the Yule Ball as his date, and then when the 2nd task starts and the Merpeople instantly bring up Harry's hostage the moment his foot touches the water, and in the third task, the Sphinx warns him about the Cup being a trap, and the Nundu he defeated at age 5 goes to the Graveyard in his place.

  Harry has learned the prophesy and he does not believe that a schoolboy can defeat Voldemort, so he decides that if he is going to die then he is first going to live.

** Well, there was Escapologist Harry who kind-of did all that... He was mostly focused on getting away from Privet Drive, but he did some truly unusual things in the process.

But if anyone writes a dedicated story... Yummy.

*** The list is in the post description . In the books it was said there were a few stories regarding Harrys life before Hogwarts although they did not specify exactly what his supposed adventures entailed. Then again my memory aint perfect so perhaps i am wrong. Anyway i am quite interested in your future fanfic. I do hope you share a link to it once you get into writing it :)
