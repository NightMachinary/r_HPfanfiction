Upon discovering that Harry was left with Petunia, Snape balks and immediately goes to check on him. Upon seeing him worked lile a slave and living in a cupboard, Snape's conscience takes over and he whisks the boy away; vowing to raise the boy himself if he has to (much to Dumbledore's eager agreement).

He very quickly comes to care for "Lily's boy" but is adamant that nothing of James should ever shine through. So, in a sadistic twist (knowing his father hated both subjects) he devotes the boys early education to potions, for which he has a knack, and some entry level dark arts, of which he is even more talented...

Yes! His true revenge against the Potter's. He'll turn James' son into a prodigious Potions Master and the greatest Dark Wizard in history!!! Snape sleeps smugly and soundly every night...

...until ghosts, of Potter's long since passed, visit him in his dreams and thank him for forging Harry into the ideal Potter. He receives blessings for keeping the long standing traditions of Potions making alive in their family, as well as training him to see magic "objectively" as his father was seemingly unable to.

All culminating in James himself bashfully thanking the man for making his son into the Potter his father wanted but he wasn't able to be...

Snape proceeds to have a conniption...


** I think I've actually read this fanfic at some point, but I can't remember specifically what it was.

I've read many fanfics that involved Snape taking in Harry once he was aware how unsuitable they were as guardians, but only one off the top of my head ever had any ghosts of James or Lily involved, and that one had Lily rescue Harry by taking him to Snape.

*** I've seen some (adoptive) Severitus fics that start with Lily reaching out to him through dreams showing him Harry's poor treatment, and asks him to save Harry. She thanks him afterwards and is then never brought up again beyond the inevitable "I knew your mother" talks (the can of worms that is his feelings for her is thankfully usually left alone -- they'd detract from the main focus on the fic).

**** The founder of the family was [[https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Linfred_of_Stinchcombe#cite_note-PM-0][Linfred of Stinchcomb]], whose nickname was "The Potterer" which is where the name "Potter" comes from. According to the Wiki he was a pioneering potioneer. So there's definitely some sort of legacy regarding potions and the Potters going back at least 8 centuries or so.

**** Sure, but this is a prompt where he DOES learn it from Snape... And also in this universe, it does seem like certain people are better at certain branches of magic, seemingly somewhat innately without any sort of explanation as to why. It does seem likely that maybe with the right guidance, Harry could have been pretty good at Potions. It's just that as you say, Snape was a terrible teacher, Harry never had the basics taught to him, and just sort of shut down. Even then, he was good enough at it to get into NEWT level Potions - albeit with Slughorn's admittedly less strict requirements. Harry isn't BAD at potions in canon, he simply doesn't live up to Snape's ridiculously high standards.

Edit: also, as pointed out in the original prompt, James Potter seems to be an atypical Potter from what we understand. Several other Potters that we know of (an admittedly small list) seem to have a knack for potions.

** I've read the first half in quite a few fics.

Also, this really matches my headcanon for the Potters in history! Knowing that they're descended from the Peverells, along with bonemeal for necromancy being held in pots in many RPG iterations, really gives me the "Dark family that only turned light recently" vibe. I mean, it certainly makes for a better reading then "Your earliest known ancestor made pots."
