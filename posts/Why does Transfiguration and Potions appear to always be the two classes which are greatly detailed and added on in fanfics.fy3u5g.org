** Well, Mcgonagall and Snape are the most developed and popular of all the teachers. Flitwick is almost a blank slate, Trelawney is incompetent, and Care of Magical Creatures is a limited subject, though I'd love to read a fic where the MC excels in it. Hagrid is also more of a friend of Harry than an actual teacher/mentor figure.

Other than that, I think the contents of the subjects are pretty important as well. The only classes that teach actual spellcasting are Transfiguration, Charms and DADA. DADA teachers change yearly so a student-mentor relationship is very difficult to write, and Transfiguration is much more interesting and versatile to write about than Charms. Being able to change matter as you wish, conjuring etc generally leads to more creative fight scenes than just different coloured beams of light. Then again, I've seen a lot of fics where the Charms class plays a major role, too. And potions are just as versatile as Transfiguration, while being more suited for a more subtle character, which fits perfectly for Harry's portrayal in most fanfics.

** I guess because Snape and McGonagall are the two most talked about teachers in the books... Flitwick, Binns, Trelawney, Grubbly-Plank and Sprout are usually just mentioned in passing. The only times Astronomy is mentioned is when Harry is filling out star charts as his homework and during the O.W.L.s when Hagrid and McGonagall get attacked. The Care for Magical Creatures gets some attention in fanfics as well when Hagrid tries to teach kids about some monster or he's up to his shenanigans, but I think Hagrid is seen more as a friend than a teacher. And the DADA teachers just change yearly and together with them the teaching style.

** There's also Ancient Runes and Arithmancy, in my experience - given they're canonically a language class and a Numerology class, wards and spell-crafting are quite the 'add-on's to that.

Mainly, I'd say it's probably because most fics have people needing to kill other people/things and it's hard to kill things easily with divination or potions or astronomy.

** You basically have 4 canon classes that use 'real' magic, and 2 possible fanon ones. Those are Charms, Transfiguration, DADA and Potions for the canon ones, and Runes and Arithmancy for fanon.

If the author wants to add more magic and theory, it'll be almost certainly going into one of these. One of the things canon didn't do much of was going into the mechanics of magic - and you'll find people falling on both sides of their opinion of that, as it's pretty much up to personal taste.

Now, back to the classes, from the canon ones, DADA has a varying set of teachers - though I have seen it get fleshed out a good bit in some fics involving either Voldemort in Year 1 expanding it, or Lupin in Year 3. Charms has Flitwick, who's a character of /just/ enough importance that we know who he is, but not enough that people care much about him. That leaves Snape and McGonagall as the last two, who are important, memorable, and skilled - and teach interesting branches of magic, which obviously some people would love to see more of.

Runes and Arithmancy are also commonly added on to, as fanon versions of them offer a ton of great opportunities for magic. Runes offer a completely different set of magical possibilities, by using written instead of spoken magic - and arithmancy offers the potential of spell creation, again opening up great possibilities. (Neither are canon interpretations, but the canon one is boring ;) ).

** I dunno, considering how little attention is given to Flitwick in Canon I think Charms is one of the most over done classes in fanfiction, which makes sense it's where 99% of all the actual spells are. Defence has incompetent teacher who generally teach nothing, and transfiguration while interesting is mostly the same spell, just changing things shape an conjuring stuff, charms has a spell for every occasion, and they're all different with whatever effects you want.
