When they get to know him and then suddenly they find themselves calling him Draco

Its just so GOOD

and extra points if the author does it so that the reader realizes it first not the characters yk what i mean


** I agree with you. Alternatively, I really dislike it when the change is super obvious. It's not a rare occurrence in fanfiction for Harry or someone to call Draco "Draco" and then Draco makes a big deal out of it like "OMG You called me Draco!!" I just want to crawl out of my skin whenever this happens. It's so much better when it's subtle, because it shows that the characters are growing comfortable with each other without even realizing it.

** That sounds interesting. Do you have an example of a fic that does it well?
