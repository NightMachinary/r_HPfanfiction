Anyone got a fic about Harry falling in love with a Veela (preferably fleur or Gabrielle), and traveling to France but also have other Veela in the story. Where they basically save him and protect him. Perfect example would be When a Veela Cries by EC Scrubb. If you haven't read it you should go check it out. Would also like it to be a decent length. Any fics with Harry in love with fleur, daphne or Gabrielle would work too, examples of those include, His Angel, and The half-blood romantic

  As the threat of Voldemort grows, Harry does his best to prepare for their inevitable showdown. At Dumbledore's side, Harry travels through the mysteries of the past and the conflicts of the present, all while growing into the wizard he was destined to be. The life of the Chosen One is not what he expected, as new challenges and the weight of war test his strength of will.

** There's linkffn(Vitam Paramus) but this one takes the 'quarter veela' to mean Gabrielle doesn't actually have Veela powers
