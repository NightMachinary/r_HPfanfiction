Hi! Could someone recommend some good fics where Harry travel back in time to Voldemort's Hogwarts years. I DONT want some slash fic, but maybe where Harry finds his inner Slytherin without turning evil. Maybe befriend riddle for some plan to destroy him or something. Sorry if my English isn't perfect. It's not my first language Thanks in advance

  Seized by Voldemort at the end of his fifth year, in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was transformed into a cat and sent tumbling through time. Armed with nothing except teeth and claws, Harry has to handle the threat posed by Tom Riddle and his teenage followers. He intends to stop the genius young Dark Lord and sabotage him at every turn...in the form of a cat. Sounds simple?

** It's surprisingly rare to find non-slash versions of that trope. Aside from a few fem!Harry fics, these are the two I'd recommend:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15499683/][The Unwinding Golden Thread]] - Harry accidentally travels back in time to the year Tom Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets. His actions have further reaching consequences than anyone anticipated. linkao3(15499683)

- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2550563/1/Welcome-to-Hogwarts-1949][Welcome to Hogwarts 1949]] - Harry is pulled into a simulation of the year Tom Riddle opened the Chamber of Secrets. Harry is willing to do almost anything to keep his own secrets and ensure he can return safely to the present. After all, if none of this is real then his actions don't really matter; that makes it ok... right? linkffn(2550563)

  In his fifth year Tom Riddle discovers his destiny and meets the cold, alarming, and bizarre transfer student Harry Evans. But sometimes things unravel in ways we do not expect.

  Harry is accidently transported fifty years back in time through a fluke with the mauraders map. Here he runs into and befriends Tom Riddle, hoping to find his only weakness. No Slash.
