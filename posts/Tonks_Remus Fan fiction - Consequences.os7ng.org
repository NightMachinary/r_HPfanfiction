While I usually don't read a lot of fan fiction that isn't Ron/Hermione centric - but [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/2008/08/10/][Consequences]] is easily one of my favorite fics of all time.

It deals with Tonk's life from the end of Order of the Phoenix to end of the Half Blood Prince.

It can be found on this livejournal account I linked to, as well as Simplyundeniable. However, since some chapters are NC-17, you have to get access to it on Simplyundeniable - something you don't need on the live journal account.

Has anyone else read this one in the past? What were your thoughts?

*** I don't think there was. I noticed on the writer's lj that she posted a few fics about Tonks and Charlie pre-Consequences.

You are right about how emotional Tonks is throughout the story. Her nerves always seemed on edge. It definitely was a different take than how I thought of her when I read the book - but I found it pretty fitting. I always felt there was something a little deeper/darker to Tonks, and I found this author's take pretty interesting.

***** There's entire series on checkmated that is also one of my top fav fics of all time. I've definitely gone through the series at least twice a year. They are all a collection of fics that are part of the same universe. It's R/Hr. It basically takes after the end of book 6 and goes into the future (15 years later). Since there are multiple stories, they kinda jump/skip around with time. It's a darker take to how death and war can affect relationships. If you liked Consequences, you might like this too. Here's the link on [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/678195/Chanel19][fanfiction.net]]. It could laso be found on checkmated (where I first read it) but like Consequences, it's also in the "restricted" section.

I may also post this up on this subreddit. Some others might like it too.

**** I'm so glad you posted this! I posted a long list of Lupin fics [[http://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/nknx2/a_collection_of_fics_for_remus_lupin_fans/][here]], and while Consequences was one of them, it truly deserves its own post. It's one of my all-time faves.

For anyone wishing to delve a little further into this story, there's [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/10996.html#cutid1][A Christmas Carol]], a smutty fun one-shot with Tonks and Charlie from years earlier, then [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/946.html#cutid1][The Middle of Nowhere]] which takes place immediately before Consequences, when Tonks sleeps with Charlie in Romania. There's also two outtakes from during the story: [[http://www.checkmated.com/story.php?story=5196][Undone]] by [[http://www.checkmated.com/authors.php?name=jenorama&cat=stories][Jenorama]], which is Charlie's point-of-view after Chapter 4 (you'll need to register to read it) and [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/pandora_j/choices01.html][Choices]], which is Remus' point-of-view after Chapter 25. And if you still want more, read the gut-wrenchingly tear-inducing follow up [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/667.html#cutid1][Finite Incantatem]] which occurs directly after the battle of Hogwarts. Then read her final follow up with Charlie and young Teddy [[http://pandoras-fic.livejournal.com/2592.html][here]].

*** Definitely. It's this type of work that makes fan fiction what it is.
