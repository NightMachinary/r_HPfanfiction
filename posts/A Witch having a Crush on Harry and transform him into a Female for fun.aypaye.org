and possibly because she dont like Men, but can "see the female inner beauty in the males body". I would like her to be an OC


** I don't think I've ever read magical feminization out of attraction. I've seen "polyjuice shenanigan", "Harry gets turned into a girl by Malfoy but enjoys her new persona" and "the assistant of Dr Granger makes Harry act like a girl because she's into it", but not what you are describing. And especially not with magic.

*** hmm, Harry gets turned into a female by Malfoy....and he enjoys it. Interesting. Do you know Fics with that Content, that have Harry using his new appearance to tease Malfoy (who might indeed get attracted to her lookings), for retaliation and not because she wants has serious intentions?

**** I remember one where Harry teases Malfoy to fuck with his head after voluntarily taking a gender swap potion to mess with the TWT, but that one is kinda a double-edged sword. It has some very sweet interactions between Harry and her honorary sister Luna, but it also constantly spouts "all boys are stupid/perverts" to the point where it gets annoying and you wonder if perhaps the author has some underlying trauma. I mean, we are perverts, but not more so than women.

The "Malfoy turns him into a girl has a drunken shopping trip with Bellatrix Lestrange though. And throws a lot less shade.

  When Harry learns something that could prove he didn't enter himself into the Triwizard Tournament, he decides to take it once step further and prank everyone in retaliation. However, his prank may have some unforeseen side effects.

** Honestly, if not consensual and not portrayed as appropriately creepy, this has the the possibility to go mega uncomfortable fast...

  6th year AU, Harry puts the puzzle together slightly faster. Now he just needs to come up with a plan of action. Fortunately, help comes from an unexpected source. Rated M for a reason. Smut/adult situations.
