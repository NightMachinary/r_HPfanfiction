Thanks.


** /A Necessary Gift: A Harry Potter Story/ has blood adoption and Black Family politics, but is Harry being reincarnated instead of saved from the Dursleys. linkffn(6671596)

/Black Luminary/ has Harry being rescued from an unfavorable home life and raised as a Black but the similarities end there as it is massively AU. linkffn(12125300)

**** Be careful starting /Black Luminary/ if you actually have work to do, I couldn't stop reading it and my problem sets suffered as a result.

  The war drags on after Voldemort's defeat and the Order of the Phoenix is fighting a losing battle. When Harry is hit by yet another killing curse, he wakes up years in the past and in an alternate reality. As an unknown child in a foreign world, Harry has a chance to change the outcome of the war - while dealing with new magical talents, pureblood politics and Black family drama.

  The war against the Dark Lord was the last straw. The oppressed, fed up with oligarchy, corruption, and injustice, sharpened their knives, rallying behind those who promised change. They won. Today, Magical Britain is a changed country -- for the better. Hail and praise to our saviours! Finally, all is well. But listen! Can't you hear the grindstone turning still ...?
