The reasoning for this position usually goes something like this:

In CoS we learn that the Ministry can't tell who cast the Hovering Charm at the Dursleys. As a result they blame Harry, who is the only Wizard in the household.

Obviously both House Elves and Witches/Wizards will regularly cast such spells in a Magical household and certainly won't be receiving such letters each time they do.

The monitoring also seems extremely invasive, since they can tell which exact spell was performed at which exact time. It is hard to imagine that the Malfoys would stand for this. Surely there are personal hygiene spells or sexual spells (that aren't mentioned because these are children's books). Of course Lucius also wouldn't want the Ministry to be able to see in detail how and when he tortures a prisoner or casts Dark Magic for other purposes. Ergo there's a way to avoid detection (wards?) or the Ministry doesn't even bother monitoring magical households.

This gives pure-blood children an unfair advantage and puts further hurdles for successful integration in front of already disadvantaged Muggleborn.

Is this a symptom of an oppressive or tyrannical regime? It is very typical for such governments to create vague or unenforceable laws, which can then be applied to critics and undesirables arbitrarily and when convenient.

What do you think?


** Is it designed to be oppressive to Muggle-borns? No. But is it useful for underage Purebloods who do want to use magic at home? Yes. It's not really hard for anyone with magical parents to get around the restriction. But that does not mean that it is designed to be tyrannical or oppressive to Muggle-borns.

** Meh, it is yet another one of Cannon's not fully thought out ideas. The Harry Potter series is many things, but it does not exemplify "Author did the research".

In cannon, it is just another plot-convenient device with some glaring holes. Artifacts that can entice you into a magically binding contest? Why not enter problematic dark lord #3 and hold the contest over a weekend under the school. A lot of things seem like they are broken / could be munchkined if you tried. (/cough Fidelius cough/)

This one is just as bad: If you really had a way to monitor magic, how in the world does anyone commit a magical crime?

Anyway, filling in such holes in fanfiction can be fun! Go with whatever works for the story you are trying to tell. For this one, the popular ones are: 1) No-one in the magical world ever really thought about the other uses. This is usually used in a "Harry Potter or Hermione Granger use out of the box muggle thinking to take over the world" fics 2) The spell is on the wands. (Violated pretty hard by cannon, but you still see it around). 3) Muggle Areas are warded, detecting magic. Thus allowing the memory erasing wizards to arrive and such 4) Wizarding Areas (such as Hogwarts or old houses) are shielded so the monitoring charms can't get through.

I have seen a few fics use the idea you are playing with: Magical children can practice magic in their houses because the charm can't see through the wards, giving them a leg up on studying magic. No-one cares that muggle-born children are excluded. Usually it is another way to show discrimination or unfairness. And it usually doesn't really have intent attached, just 'the way things are'.

*** My theory is that most magical houses are indeed monitored (unless they're unplottable or something, since then they can't pinpoint where the charm was triggered), but there's no way they can determine whether it was the kids doing magic or their parents doing magic close to them (or on them).

#+end_quote

No.

1. Magic is difficult. Magic is dangerous.

2. The single most important rule in the Wizarding World is the Statute of Secrecy. So yes, I'd imagine that the authorities would probably be more harsh on Muggleborns who violate the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery not because they are Muggleborns /but because if a Muggleborn is doing magic outside of school, they are likely near/around Muggles and thus are potentially breaking or risking the integrity of the Statute/.

3. From all the evidence present, in the /time in which the Harry Potter books take place/ (don't even fucking try to bring up Voldemort killing the Riddles, we are not fucking going to discuss that here), the Trace only keeps track of magic used when the underaged witch/wizard are present. And no matter what people say, Lucius Malfoy is an intelligent person, so I highly fucking doubt he would torture a prisoner or use dark magic around his son.

4. Tying back to point 1, magic is difficult and with magic as powerful as the Trace it must be even more difficult to bamboozle. Therefore, for

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

to be true, you'd have to have a skilled enough witch or wizard present to do so. And that list would be Dumbledore (see him with Harry during the beginning of /HBP/), Grindlewald (the evil, only a hair less skillful Dumbledore) and Voldemort. End of fucking story.

And finally, 5. Correct me if I'm wrong (paging [[/u/Taure][u/Taure]]), but isn't

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

straight up canon?

EDIT: For formatting and below conclusion.

No, the Decree isn't being used to oppress Muggleborn. It is to protect those who have yet to complete their magical education from potentially harming themselves or others with magic (1) and it is to protect the Statute (2). As for the other concerns: most dark witches and wizards with children don't need to worry about the Trace catching them using dark magic because they aren't as dumb as most people in the fandom think (3); unless you are a part of a very, very, very small magical elite there is no way to magically bamboozle the Trace (4) and finally, of course the fucking Ministry expects parents to keep their children from doing illegal shit in the house the same way governments in the real fuckling world expect parents to keep their children from doing illegal shit in the house (5).

Let's be fucking real: Blood prejudice as a political movement is fucking dying from before the time the books take place, which is why they had to stage fucking coups to try and reverse that.

That's a strange line to draw, considering he is fine housing the Dark Lord in his mansion. I have zero doubt that he would torture prisoners while Draco is present... Lucius might even consider it educational. Edit: Also they seem to really enjoy torturing house-elves. I imagine they are pretty laid back about suffering and pain in general.

You made some good points otherwise, though it seems to me that the law is still not fit for purpose if they can't even tell who performed the magic.

If they were actually worried about safety, why not collect the wands of all underage children at the end of term and return them in the Hogwarts Express (or wherever?). This actually works and is enforceable.

Re-read point 4. He's "fine" with Voldemort being in his mansion (he isn't during 6th and 7th year, but that has more to do with the fact that he is low on the totem pole now, though I assume that's where Voldemort was during /OotP/) because with Voldemort around, you don't need to worry about the Ministry learning shit Voldemort doesn't want them to know.

1. Clause Seven of the Decree.

2. It is also about a certain measure of trust. Having magic is the ability to warp reality as you please, as long as you are skilled enough. That means, to a point, you have to trust them with responsibility. And you do that by giving them just enough leeway to see if they are trustworthy enough and responsible enough.

thats how its done in America, but the British allow underage wizards to use magic in emergencies. And confiscating the wands wouldnt stop people from wizarding families to use magic with someone else wand, and they wouldn't have to worry about muggleborns anyway because they can detect their magic.

Its also dangerous for the child in case someone sees them use magic and becomes violent (like it happened with Arianna)

Tracking muggleborns use of magic is better for everyone.

  This gives pure-blood children an unfair advantage and puts further hurdles for successful integration in front of already disadvantaged Muggleborn.
#+end_quote

This is a common thing claimed about the Decree by fanon which. while making sense, doesn't explain how no pure-blood in canon is ever shown to have an unfair advantage over a muggleborn.

People always say that pure-bloods have an unfair advantage by being able to do underaged magic. If that was the case, it doesn't explain how Hermione (a muggleborn) was the most skilled and intelligent student of the student in her year, outclassing pure-bloods of the same age as her. If muggle-borns are actually disadvantaged, then how could Hermione be the best student out of those in her year? The very fact that a muggle-born can ever be considered the best in her year is all the canonical proof needed to show that the Decree doesn't disadvantage muggleborns nor give either pure-bloods or half-bloods an 'unfair advantage'.

Moreover, I'll be the first in this topic to mention *half-blood witches and wizards*. I don't know why people mention pure-blood wizards like they are special or have advantages, given that half-blood wizards live in wizarding families too. All the term "half-blood" means is that a wizard has traceable muggle/muggle-born ancestry back to either their parents or grandparents. Despite the lives lived by Harry and Voldemort, most half-bloods would be born to two wizarding parents, such as the children of Harry and Ginny, or the children of Ron and Hermione.

In the case of Harry and Ginny's children, they are genetically-speaking the closest that a half-blood can get to being pure-blood. Some wizards might unofficially consider Harry's children to be pure-blood even if they would be legally deemed half-bloods (due to having a muggle-born maternal grandmother). I'd argue that Harry's children get more advantages by being the children of Harry Potter than they would from being raised in what is basically a pure-blood family.

The Decree was obviously not made to screw over muggleborns, and it certainly wasn't made to give pure-bloods an advantage. Its a peeve of mine when people have Harry or Hermione rant about the Decree (typically bashing the Ministry, Dumbledore, all the Weasleys except the Twins, and the wizarding world), then find a loophole around it to show how SUPAH SPESHAEL they are. Ironically, the Decree in fanon is used to bash wizards using faulty logic and to have Harry and/or Hermione be a generically overpowered self-insert.

It's just interesting that so many people think that the Decree handicaps muggleborns and/or gives unfair benefits to pure-bloods and half-bloods... while being unable to provide any canonical examples of pure-bloods or half-bloods getting actual unfair advantages. Ron never got to learn any magic from Molly or Arthur prior to starting Hogwarts. Draco never got any tutoring from Lucius or Narcissa prior to Hogwarts. The fact that Neville is so comically bad in Potions despite being raised by his grandmother already shows that she obviously didn't teach him any magic.

The fact that Hermione was the best in her year is enough to prove both that muggle-borns aren't disadvantages and that pure-bloods/half-bloods don't get advantages at all. Otherwise, it raises another question: why did Lucius and Narcissa not actually teach Draco anything about magic? Why did Molly and Arthur not teach Ron a few basic spells (i.e. Wingardium Leviosa, Lumos, etc) before he entered Hogwarts. Why did Augusta Longbottom not teach Neville anything at Potions? Neither Ron, Draco or Neville learnt anything prior to Hogwarts, meaning they entered with as little knowledge as anyone else their age. I could understand Molly and Arthur wanting to follow the law, but Lucius and Narcissa would have given Draco a head-start if it were possible. The fact that Draco comes in to Hogwarts as ignorant as Harry proves his parents taught him nothing. Same goes for Ron and Neville too.

*TL;DR: Muggle-borns are never disadvantaged by any laws in canon. Pure-bloods or half-bloods don't get any advantages from being raised in a magical home.*

Muggleborns overcoming their systemic disadvantage doesn't make the systemic disadvantage disappear. Considering they are about equal to pure-bloods now, then if they had the same opportunities as the pure-bloods they'd probably surpass them.

Is that a real question? Hermione is a genius, duh. She managed to successfully cast a few spells before even attending Hogwarts, while Ron believes "Sunshine, daisies..." could be a real spell (what's going on in that household? He has multiple brothers who went to Hogwarts and two Magical parents?!). Wizards are retarded... there's probably some kind of inbreeding going on (which also explains why Muggleborns can keep up).

Furthermore: Pure-blood Wizards don't appear to have any formal schooling before the age of 11. Muggleborn have been going to school for years, with modern teaching methods that aren't rooted in the previous century. I doubt Muggleborn children would stand a chance at school if pure/half-blood wizards were smart enough to send their children to Muggle schooling before Hogwarts. Frankly I'm surprised that there aren't any an-alphabets in Hogwarts considering how spotty Homeschooling can be.

Well, he knows how to read and write at least?! I would also assume that basic Maths are a requirement for Hogwarts.

In any case, you can bet your ass that if my child went to Hogwarts and I heard what kind of education was on offer in DADA with Umbridge I'd hire a tutor over the summer. The only reason pure/half-blooded households don't do this is because they are stupid, lazy or poor (and surprise surprise, the Weasleys have all 3).

** Arguably, but you could also argue that it makes more sense to monitor muggle places more strictly, because risk of breach is higher there.

There /is/ honestly no reason for the decree to exists for places like the burrow or Malfoy manor. Any muggle close enough to see would already be a breach.

It's still unfair though. It would make more sense for the decree to only apply to magic-less places only, if you were to try and make it fair.

Because if I actually go by cannon and how purebloods who make the laws feel about muggleborn, it would be obviously be a deliberate loophole filled law that is only enforceable against muggleborn. Since any pureblood or wizarding raised would have standard wards up on their property that would most likely protect against any sort of detection.
