Ginny couldn't stomach the thought of joining Voldemort and she overheard Arthur talking to Bill about timeturners from Department of Mysteries. She borrows Harry's cloak ( with or without permission) and steals one from the Ministry (or Hermione) and kidnaps a newborn Tom Riddle from Wool's orphanage and returns to her time.

The diary's compulsion recognizes the baby as the actual Tom Riddle ( instead of the one inhabiting a deformed foetus, Harry's forehead, a snake and four historical artifacts) and the baby Tom is accepted by the Weasley's.

The idea of the diary rewiring Ginny's brain to inspire loyalty to Tom Riddle is taken from Black Ink, Red Rose by bolshevikmuppet99 linkao3(19381933).

  Try as she might, Ginny can't make herself stop loving Tom. The knowledge of his true identity doesn't prevent the memories of how wonderful he was from consuming her thoughts. Even though it makes her a monster, she can't stop thinking about him. And if the opportunity to help him came up, well. She was always told to listen to her heart. Eventual Ginny/Bellatrix

** Sounds like a cool idea, but we'll deal with some serious time paradox here. At least in time travel stories where the people don't return to the future we get a rewriting of what is happening, while here the horcruxes oc the old time line exist together with a new born Tom Riddle in the "new" time line...

Does somebody have a good idea how to deal with that problem?

**** Hmm, possible.

Or, I thought of something myself.

So, in many time travel stories the person who time travels becomes a paradox themselves. They remember a world that never will exist. Sometimes this is explained or solved by the multiverse idea. The person travelled back in time and their actions in the past now split of a new universe, while the old still exists. So, the changes they make won't influence their original universe at all. But, because they are now in this new world they would not be able to travel back in to their original future even if it still exists. As soon as they changed things they closed the exit.

So, what if the Unspeakables took attention to solve that problem when they created whatever model of Time Turner Ginny got her hands on (and she needs a special Tine Turner, because the original ones just turned back time and then you had to take the slow way forward from the past)? When you travel back in time and change things you still split of universes. But, as long as you wear your Time Turner you are connected to your original universe and can travel back there. (So, don't take it off if you want to get back home.) Ginny travels back in time and takes baby Tommy. That creates a universe in which Voldemort never existed (because he was taken from it). A universe that is decisively different from canon. BUT, we won't explore it, because Ginny wore her Time Turner which led her back home into the universe where Voldemort DID exist. So, we have two Tom Riddles and a semi-logical explanation as to why that is possible.

Could that work?
