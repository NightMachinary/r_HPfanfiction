** One of the few nuggets of bullshit I absolutely love about pre-2007ish fan-fiction. That arrangement makes it easy to start a great drama, if done right.

*** I only really ever liked the head student rooms just off the common room between the stairs. That worked for me and I still use that version in a few of mine. Though I don't think I will for Darkness Ascendant. For that one I think the heads won't have private rooms but will have a personal Office near the library.

** Hate the private shared rooms for the Head Kids thing. I prefer each house having 2 private dorms away from the others but still connected to the Houses Common rooms.

I would also expect the heads to have a Office that is probably shared between them so they can talk to the other prefects from the other houses and have a room to have office hours for younger students.
