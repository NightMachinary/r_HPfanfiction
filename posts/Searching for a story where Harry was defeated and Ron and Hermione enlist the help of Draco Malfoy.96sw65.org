From what I can remember, Hermione and Ron enlist Draco's help in freeing Harry from the ministry after his defeat by Voldemort (either this or it was the diadem they get from the ministry but I'm fairly confident Harry was still alive). They later work together to bring down Voldemort, storming the mansion and miraculously defeating him. The twist, however, is that Draco was only seeking to destroy his competition and now he becomes the new Dark Lord.

It was on Ao3. Draco worked at a muggle-born concentration camp and I think that after Voldemort's defeat they discover Draco's true evil through the radio (he procedeed to continue killing muggle-borns at the camp and declares himself Minister for Magic). I believe it might have been a series, but it was incomplete so I'd like to see if there is now more, I do remember liking the story.

Oh and they hide out at Grimmauld Place.

Please feel free to post anything with a similarly surprising twist as well/Harry loses stories.


** I definitely know this story but I'm struggling to remember when I read it.

*** I feel like it was recently posted when I read-so 2015/2016 (though may have been posted elsewhere beforehand) and someone in the sub suggested it as well I believe.

** That sounds like [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/288347][The Rewards of Perseverance]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Pitry/pseuds/Pitry][Pitry]] (which does in fact have a sequel, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/374837][The Mirror of Erised]]).
