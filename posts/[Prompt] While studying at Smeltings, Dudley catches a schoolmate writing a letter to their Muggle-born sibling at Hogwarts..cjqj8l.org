** A lot of people are mentioning Justin, who was Eton bound. I don't know much about school districts and English society but is it realistic that a boy rich enough for Eton would be friends with someone from lesser means, like a neighborhood friend? In America it's not uncommon for someone in a middle class neighborhood to be neighbors and good friends with another kid who goes to a private school instead of the local middle/high school and sees him on weekends and during summer. If so, Dudley's classmate writing to his boyhood best friend Justin would make a lot of sense.

**** Justin could still be really smart but Hogwart's subject aren't exactly normal. English isn't taught or math or chemistry. He could be a wiz (lol) in all of those and we wouldn't have a clue. Hermione was just a lot more vocal about how smart she was.
