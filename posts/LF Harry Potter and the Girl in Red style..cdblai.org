Fantastic book, HPTGR [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6835726/chapters/15603322]]

I'm looking for books similar to this one, like Natural 20, which is another DND style book.

It doesn't have to be DnD, though it's preferred to have some gamer elements or at least Reincarnation original character/body transmigration going on, however what is the most important is the ABSOLUTE SELF RIGHTEOUS MUNCHKINRY.

PS: Longer stories are better. 30,000 pages of meh with a sprinkle of woo is better than 300 pages of 10/10.
