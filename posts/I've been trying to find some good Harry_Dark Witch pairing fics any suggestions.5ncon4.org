I've read the more popular Bellatrix fics and most Daphne fics have her either grey or light leaning. I want stories where Harry is paired with a real dark witch who has a soft spot for Harry


** Real dark witch ?! How dare you...Bellatrix IS a real dark witch!

lol, nah I understand what you mean. Most authors make bellatrix oc when they write her.

** Hmm... a fic with a Bellatrix that is as batshit crazy as the original one?

Honestly, the only ones I know are Hermione/Bella fics for some reason. Would you be interested in those?

I gotta say, its pretty angsty, so there is that. But it also deals with the only reason Hermione could become the real Bellatrix's lover - massive Stockholm Syndrome. Bella is the same crazed, violent but very cunning maniac in this one.

  The moment Hermione ran smack into Bellatrix Lestrange in the midst of a war was the moment she knew things were about to go very badly, very quickly. Rated M for more than one reason.

  Are Murderers born? Or are they made? When Hermione is sent to the past she is forced to become acquainted with someone she knew she'd hate for the rest of her life. Rated M for later chapters.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

  Hermione Granger knows she's not a good person. Disillusioned with life at only twelve years old; she is cynical, manipulative, ruthless and, above all else, a survivor. For six years she has lived on the streets of London with only her sharp mind and her sharper knives to keep her alive, but a letter from an owl changes everything for Hermione, and the bond she forms on the Hogwarts Express with a timid boy with broken glasses, skinny wrists and a lightning-shaped scar will change the whole of Wizarding Britain.  Main Pairing: Harry Potter/Hermione Granger/Tom Riddle*Warning: Rating R*DISCLAIMER: I do not own Harry Potter. I am only writing this for my amusement, and for others amusement. I am not writing this for a profit of any kind.DISCLAIMER: I do not own any of the images used.
