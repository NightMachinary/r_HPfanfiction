I'm looking for believable characterizations for Albus Dumbledore and Ron Weasley, two very different characters I know, I enjoy their characters and they tend to be bashed a lot in fics though which is unfortunate.

Any rating is fine. Am fine with het/slash/femslash

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione because I don't care for it, but any other pairing is fine

Would rather it be completed but if not a bunch of chapters is fine

Anyone can be the main character, not just Harry

The story should be interesting with good/believable characterizations

No character bashing


** I'm not sure Eldritch has the most canonical of characterizations -- it's been a while, really -- but believable? Yeah, I'd say so. Albus has logical flaws, he tries his best and worries but isn't always right or justified, and while he isn't all-powerful he also isn't the scum of the earth. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6864054/]])

  Albus is thrown back to 1934, where he meets the troubled orphan, Tom Riddle. Albus discovers that this parenting business isn't half as easy as he thought it might be, especially when the child involved is Tom.

*** That sounds like my kind of Dumbledore. He makes mistakes but he isn't a monster for them. He does feel bad about the mistakes he makes. (At least that's my Dumbledore). Thanks, will check it out.

****** ah, yeah, I saw your request post for it. Well, you could try eldritcher's other works? I haven't read them all yet, but there's probably at least /some/ similarities in characterization throughout, since it'd be the same writer. I'll see if I can't find anything else tomorrow.

  Harry proudly accepted the title of 'Dumbledore's man through and through' but how little does he, do we realize that Dumbledore was 'Harry's man through and through? Their years together, now through Albus's eyes, see the bond that these two share.
