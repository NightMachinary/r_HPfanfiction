Looking for a fic where being a human horcux is something between a hostile takeover and a vulcan mind meld, and as a horcux of Voldemort who pushed the boundary far beyond any other and shattered his soul so many times...

Basically Harry is Harry (meaning none of Voldemort's memories) but magically he is Voldemort. Technically a horcux but he's an independent agent and not Voldemort 2.0.

I've seen a couple fics touch on the idea but none of them really hash it out. Anyone read a fic like this?


** !linkao3(Runic War Warding). This fic delves into it pretty well, but it may or may not be abandoned. The author is not exactly known for having a consistent update structure.

** linkffn(Toxicology) explores what Harry being a Horcrux means. It's not precisely what you want, but it is well-written and tries to delve deep into the general topic.
