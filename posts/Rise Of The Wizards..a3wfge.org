Hey there, I thought this would be a good place to ask some questions I have about the story so far. One of which is people describing him as OP. I'm up to chapter 12 already, and he doesn't seem particulary OP. I mean there are the hints that he's got Voldemorts "magical muscle memory", but he still has to work for it, and apart from an increase in his magical core, he's still relatively average. He's got no real advantaged over say an Auror. So why are people always describing this Harry as OP. Does it happen later in the story, what?

Thanks,\\
Warryn.


** Typically, a complete story contains a beginning, a middle, and an end. You haven't even gotten to the middle, so just be patient. If you really can't stand to not know for a few chapters: yes, he gets more powerful.

** Harry doesn't get OP until the mid-late chapters (30+?)

  Dumbledore wanted a saviour for the wizarding world. Someone who would step up and save the wizarding world from prejudice. Well, you know what they say, Be Careful What You Wish For... preface of 'Rise of the Wizards'. Darkish and manipulative Harry,
