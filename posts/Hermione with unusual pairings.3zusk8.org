** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6713559/1/The-Soul-Mate-Law][Hermione/Crookshanks]] - Sorry, I had to...

A slightly more serious suggestion: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5497778/1/Bookends][Hermione/Arthur]]

if you want well written fics I would suggest [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/5869599/ShayaLonnie][Shayalonnie]], so far she's completed a sirimione, a dramione and a jamione story and she's working on pairings with theo nott, remus and neville.

Aside from her own stories she also has a great list of recommended fics on her tumblr: [[http://shayalonnie.tumblr.com/fic-recs]]

**** My reply to [[/u/Midnightnox]] reminded me, I forgot one of my favourite authors, even though her stories are shorter than I'd like: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/429821/sarhea]]

Hermione with Spock, Smaug (yes, the dragon), Percy, Batman, Sherlock, Salazar Slytherin, Regulus, Rabastan Lestrange, Loki. I think all of those count as unusual too ;)

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/2573990][Hermione/Luna, "Crazy Little Things"]]

I'm not even a fan of this pairing (is it unusual? I kind of think so) but this is probably one of the better stories I've read recently. It focuses a lot on Luna but has a very in-character Hermione/told from her POV and a well developed romance, it's really good.

** Hey, what do you know, something I can do! How unusual is unusual for you? I'll break this down by pairing, and include what percentage of completed fics on FFN they encompass. These are all complete, none abandoned, and should all be above 50k words. I believe *all* of these that have an age gap use time travel to eliminate that age gap, though there may be a bit of an age gap at some point before or after that time travel.

  It was no accident. She was Hermione Granger - as if she'd do anything this insane without the proper research and reference charts. Arriving on the 14th of May 1981, She had given herself 169 days. An ample amount of time to commit murder if one had a strict schedule, the correct notes and the help of one possibly reluctant, estranged heir. **2015 Fanatic Fanfics Awards Nominee**

*** I see someone likes time-turning. I don't read Hermione/Marauders, so yeah unusual.

A good Hermione/Viktor is a holy grail of mine. I started reading that fic, but stopped, it had a problematic beginning for me...

EDIT - I just read what the percentages were... quantitative proof of the unusual.

**** The Viktor fic took a few tries for me to actually get sucked in, but once it did, I enjoyed it. That Hermione is far more of an OC than anything, but I thought the story itself was good. I thought the percentages might be a good idea, because some of us who ship a certain ship might be a bit vocal about it, making it seem like there's more out there than there is!

** There is a really long one with hermione/AU Cedric (paralysed after GoF rather than dead) and aside from a few things I would Britpick, it was an enjoyable read.

I think it's Finding Himself. Not 100% sure.
