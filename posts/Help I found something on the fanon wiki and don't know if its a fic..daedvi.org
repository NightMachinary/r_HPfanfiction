I just recently discovered the Harry Potter Fanon wiki, and i found this:

[[https://harrypotterfanon.fandom.com/wiki/Cycle_of_the_Blood]]


** Well, I went googling. If there's any fanfics titled 'Cycle of the Blood' or 'Mystery of the White Magus', they aren't indexed. I think it might just be story details and characters someone's come up with rather than a full fic (or series of fics).
