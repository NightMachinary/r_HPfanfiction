In almost all time travel stories, the time traveler eventually reveals that they are from the future. However, it usually is a choice they make, it doesn't tend to have much impact on the plot, and it often doesn't happen until you are already like 50,000 words into the story.

I'm looking for stories where someone learns that a time traveler is from the future, someone finds out, and it's a big deal. If the time traveler didn't mean to reveal it, but gets caught, even better.

  "Knockturn Alley," Hermione breathed, and a rush of relief flooded inside of her. At least she didn't end up amongst cavemen or dinosaurs. Time-turner fic. Sirius Black falls behind the veil, the time-turners are destroyed, and a Gryffindor is going to change history.

  His life had been a mockery to itself, as too his death it seemed. For what kind of twisted humour would force Severus Snape to relive his greatest regret? To return him to the point in his life when the only person that ever mattered in his life had already turned away.

** I know I have a couple more, but I'll have to re-read because I /really/ love time travel, I have a lot saved, and I want to make sure I'm giving you ones that do what you want.

The one that I know has her being found out as a plot point is Divergence by abovetheserpentine, wherin Hermione ends up going back mostly by accident, attempts to fit into the Maurader era as a teacher, and eventually gets rumbled by a student. It takes awhile to get to that point, but what happens after that definitely effects the plot. linkffn(11655125)

Questions: Do you want stuff that's causal loop/closed loop travel (ie, the traveler's presence doesn't change anything from what already happened, even though people know the character is a time traveler)? What about travel forward? (I read a ridiculous one that's set after Harry went back to Tom Riddle's era and then returned, and teenage Riddle got pissed off and figured out how to follow Harry forward) Is showing up in front of the Order / the Mauraders with "I'm from the future and I've got a plan, fuck this everybody dies shit" im the first chapter good?

** Here's my own favorite story that fits this category: linkffn(5396819) This is actually what got me so interested in this idea.

What makes it unique (according to my father faint memory, it's been a while since I read it): The story doesn't take forever to go through the Hogwarts years. It keeps things interesting, and refrains from telling you /every detail of every single thing that has changed./ Harry travels back in time, but not by himself! Draco is also there! And, he's pretty in character! As in, he's still a jerk and is definitely not in love with Harry. Harry isn't an unlikeable, overpowered emo!

Unfortunately, this story definitely appears to be abandoned. What's worse, is right before it ended, the story got /very/ interesting. :( Practically ended on a cliffhanger.
