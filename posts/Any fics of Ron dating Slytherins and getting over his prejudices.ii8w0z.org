I find the dynamic interesting because it forces both Ron and the Slytherin in question to challenge their prejudices.

I have no qualms about who he dates (Draco, Zabini, Millicent, Daphne, Pansy, etc.) though I will admit (since these fics tend to have multiple pairings) that I find it difficult to read Draco/Hermione fics, so a heads up if that's a side pairing would be appreciated


** Ron (more) biased against Slytherins is a fanon misconception. In the books, Harry dislikes them a lot more. As a side note, Ron's grandmother is Cedrella Black, very likely a Slytherin herself.

That being said, the Ron/Pansy romance in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542), is very well done. This Pansy still starts out as the canon bully, but gets lots of character development later on, [[/spoiler][especially so after Dumbledore personally assassinated Narcissa and Draco Malfoy]]. The Voldemort in this fic has his good look back and is utterly terrifying

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** Very interesting short story about Ron and Daphne Greengrass going to the yule ball together, and the consequences of that date: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13122145/1/Bet-for-a-Dance]]

Also Ron/Daphne but also an incredibly long, regularly updated seer(ish)!Ron story. It even has its own discord. Imo it's starts slow but once you power through the first few chapters, it's fantastic: [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13170637/1/Fate]]

  It was just a stupid bet. He hadn't expected to get the date, much less anticipate what came next. But he'd make the best of his situation---he always did.

  When Ron discovers that he can see the future, his entire fate is thrown off of its course. A story about adventure, friendship, growing up, and pushing forward through hardships. This story will get darker as it progresses, just like the original Harry Potter novels. It will cover all Seven Years of Hogwarts, but mostly from Ron's perspective. No Mary Sues, no Character bashing.

** Rebuilding, by Colubrina, has a GREAT Stealth Slytherin girlfriend for Ron. :D Doesn't come up until quite late in the fic (and it's a big long fic, and it'sonly a subplot- but one of the things that makes that fic at all decent is watching characters grow. EVERYONE has growth.) It's on both AO3 and FF.n

*** I've heard of this one, but I also heard the main pairing is Draco/Hermione and I don't know if I can read 300 chapters of it lol I can enjoy it fine enough as a side pairing, but I don't think I've ever enjoyed a fic that actually focuses on it.

Thanks for the rec though! Maybe I'll bring myself to check it out.

**** it's pretty slow burn and most of the chapters are VERY short (single scene)- it was a chapter-a-day writing exercise. :P But there's a lot of pairings in there that are exceedingly unpopular on this board, so YMMV.
