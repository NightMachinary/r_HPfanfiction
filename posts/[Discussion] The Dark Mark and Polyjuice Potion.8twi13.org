If someone with the dark mark took Polyjuice to become someone else, would the mark carry over into the person they become? Like with Barty Crouch Jr, if there was a way to detect the dark mark, would they be able to detect it on Polyjuice Moody/Crouch?

Background for the question:

I've been working on a fan fic on and off for a few years, where Harry makes friends with a boy that lives a few streets away from the Dursley's, long story short. Lex always got a bad feeling about certain people well he and Harry were hanging out and stirred Harry away from them. He moves away before Harry finds out he's a wizard. Fast forward to Harry's third year, they reunite and it turns out those people Lex kept having bad feelings about, were Death Eaters and he can tell if a witch or wizard is Voldemort's. Well I just realized that I wrote myself into a corner with that, not thinking about Barty/Moody until I just started on Harry's fourth year this morning. Because for consistency sake, if Lex can detect Death Eaters he should have been able to tell something was up with Moody... But that kind of derails the events of the TriWizard tournament if Harry is tipped off too early. Unless the Polyjuice potion does something to prevent it, but I'm not sure if that's too big of a copout or a reasonable explanation?


** First off, why is it so bad to derail the Triwizard Tournament? That sounds a lot more interesting.

Second, Polyjuice appears to change the very nature of whoever drinks it. So if Moody did not have the Dark Mark, it should not be "detectable"

More importantly, to a degree you have boxed yourself in, with another wizard being able to inexplicably detect the Dark Mark. There is no reason to believe such a thing is possible, other than "because magic." After all. the Dark Mark was not a well known thing. It appears to have been largely unknown to the wizarding world, and someone having the ability to detect it would have likely changed the political landscape and the course of the war drastically.

I understand why you might put something like this in a fic. Its like authors who write "someone can only willingly take the Dark Mark," as a way around the imperius defense. But if that was true, its less likely the death eaters would have gotten off so easily. These sorts of inexplicable revelations always create more problems than they solve.

*** As of yet the character Lex doesn't know why he can detect those with the mark. I'm still undecided if I'm going to have him discover that the only reason he can sense the death eaters is because Voldemort is his grandfather. (yeah I know, but I'm trying to be as non clich√© as possible about it.)

I just liked the idea of playing around with a character that had the same basic genetics as Voldy, who grew up in the foster system and had every reason to go the way that Voldemort did, but chose to back Harry from the sidelines. He is a wizard, but never got a letter to Hogwarts. (So Harry snuck him in to the castle and there is a lot of near misses were he's almost discovered, that kind of thing.)

Which is were the snafu comes in of Barty/Moody. I like your reasoning on the nature of polyjuice. Maybe, I could just have him be more suspicious of Moody, but have it be muted enough to were its not the usual feeling he gets so he's not sure?

** The mark wouldn't physically, but I'll bet there's a magical signature still there or something like that.

** Actually, you could just say that Lex detects the Dark Arts that surround Moody since he's been hunting Dark Wizards for so long. Like, throughout Moody's adventures, he gets immersed in Dark Magic, and while he doesn't really use it, his magical signature makes it seem like he does. Or at least, that's what they think.

** It should still be detectable. Transfiguration doesn't seem to change everything about a person, at least with certain magical effects. The Marauders Map still gives the names of Animagi and Polyjuiced people, Harry's scar still hurts when Polyjuiced, etc.

Of course, how this person knows about the Dark Mark, when even the Order didn't seem to, is going to be... difficult to explain.

*** That makes sense, Just been wracking my brains all day trying to come up with a reasonable way around it now that I've dug over 100,000 words into that plot hole.

The character Lex doesn't necessarily know about the mark, just that he gets a bad feeling about those that have it. (As for how/why I explained in my reply to XeshTrill)

** Perhaps you could just make Barty immune to the ability? Or there could be a mixture of light and dark and people presume it's because Moody's been fighting it for so long and has seen too much, but maybe there's a tiny little bit of non-evil in there that gets picked up on?
