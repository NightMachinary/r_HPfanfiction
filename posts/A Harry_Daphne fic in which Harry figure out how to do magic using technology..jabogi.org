:END:
I remember the fic having WBWL in it. Also something about Harry almost blowing up Hogwarts trying to give muggles magic and then having his magic suppressed. Anyone have any ideas?


** Sounds like one of Myrddin le Fay's.

  The world was changing, but mage didn't want to change. They forced Harry away, banished from the magical world when he was 17. He had a dream too big for the 'light' or the 'dark' wishing to bring magic to all humans. However, he was a genius & though sealed, he created new technologies to build magic. Then with the SGC he envisioned a unified earth to expand into the universe.
