** Someone told me I was a whore and should get back into the kitchen, then some rather graphic rape threats. There were no obviously feminist themes that I could see in the fic, so I think they were probably annoyed with me for some other reason.

I have also had a lot of upset reviewers lamenting the fact that I'm not writing their preferred pairing (despite being clearly canon compliant), or including random fanon things they believe ought to be in the fic, such as lordships or particular spells.

Edit: oh! Also someone who sent me several furious paragraphs about how awful it was that I had Harry acknowledge that Teddy was effectively one of his children, and how I surely hated James and why don't I realise how painful it is to know that your parents prefer another child when you should be the eldest, which, holy projection batman...

** I think the strangest I've gotten are actually super wholesome, one of my readers basically writes whole paragraphs of what basically amounts to fan fic of my fan fic in the comments of my fic, and it's gotten to the point where I look forward to reading what they've seen in the chapter in question that they're going to expound on. It's very baffling as that isn't how I process the fics I read, but just so incredibly flattering (and also interesting as they seem to see things that I don't within my own work sometimes, which is super cool)

I'm sure there have been other baffling moments that weren't quite so positive, but my memory is terrible and I can't think of any right at the moment

** Someone got pissed off that I dared to say that Harry and Ron were friends, and that Hermione is much better and that I should have used her instead.

I really dislike Hermione and her over-use in fanfiction, so there was no chance of me using her anyway (especially since this was both Post-War and a Warcraft crossover).

He really didn't like the (clearly labeled!) femslash and kept saying I have pent up energy that should be for a man, doing a line by line deconstruction of proof of this in my writing.

** Someone commented on my book that snape's middle name is sunshine (I had Tobias after his father like many fanfics) after I told them it wasn't sunshine, that snape had no canon middle name. They whent on a long rant that took me almost 20 minutes to read on how I'm an idiot and a cunt and should just give my book to someone like them who actually knows what there doing (I have done hours of research for my books) my spelling mistakes make me deserve to be shot (I have dislexea and sometimes my computer doesn't tell me something is misspelled). They left links to other fanfictions that had snape's middle name as Sunshine as "proof" that I was wrong. I ended up blocking them and deleting the coment because it was geting a lot of attention that I didn't want for my book.

** For me, I think the most baffling thing I've ever seen was someone flaming the author over shipping wars.

Namely, they supported Hinny, and it was a Harmony fic.

That's sort of par for course, but what particularly baffled me was the reviewer's insistence that Harry had a crush on Ginny since 3rd year.

From my own reading of the books, before he started getting really jealous in 5th year, the only girl I can recall Harry expressing any attraction towards was Cho Chang(whom gave him butterflies in the stomach).

** I had one baffling review that flamed me for not writing the story like they envisioned it. It was a long diatribe that started at completely rewriting chapter one.

Which would be odd, but not something I would mind for much longer, if it hadn't been done on chapter 10 with details of each and every chapterbin the review.

Guy literally read my entire story, and then practically wrote me how he would have wanted it written (since he was also very adamant about not writing himself).

I wrote back ‚Äúk, thanks for the review‚Äú and left it at that.

** I wrote a fic recently that someone condemned for being transphobic because I had two characters make an offhand remark about crossdressers...despite both of these characters being teenagers in a fic set in the 90s...

What was worse was that three paragraphs later, another character chastised them for making said remark.

I think said person was just trying to be angry or something. I really don't know.

deleted the comment, but it kinda took some of the fun out of writing the fic so i haven't updated in about a year.

** The reviews asking stuff that was very clearly talked about the AN used to baffle me until I actually joined this sub and found out just how many people completely ignore ANs.

Probably explains the "This fic should be Thing A!" reviews on fics that are clearly marked as 'Thing B' too, come to think of it. If people will just ignore everything other than the actual narrative for one thing, they'll ignore it for others and continue to speak from that place of unawareness.

*** I don't read many fics on the actual website they're posted in: I download it and read them on my kindle.

If it's an ao3 fic, the calibre plugin for fanfiction will flat out not download the notes or chapter summaries. If for some reason I still get notes AND they're disruptive (as in, an entire page as dictated by my paperwhite), either I'll stop reading the story or go back to the computer and edit the damned things out.

I'm sure authors mean well, and I'm sure that some people actually read them and like the interactions they can provide on FFN, but in my opinion there is literally NO reason to write ANYTHING in the notes beyond "Beta'd by X" or "Thanks for the reviews!" imo.

**** Yeah, and that's completely fair. Like I said in the response to Vercalos below, I fully acknowledge that everyone has a reason for doing it that makes sense to them and I'm not saying the practice is good or bad. It was just an example of something that baffled me before I started engaging with the reddit side of fandom.

I've heard this topic discussed enough times in threads to know the vast majority of the arguments on both sides by now, so I understand why people do it. I still read and write them myself and prefer it that way, but that doesn't in any way mean that you shouldn't do what makes sense to you or that I'm saying you're wrong to do so.

It's just important to acknowledge the other side of not reading the ANs and missing out on information given. Cost vs benefit and all that.

** I think i wrote one once that had the author put a 4 paragraph rant about how they were being canon compliant at the start of the next chapter. I checked the other reviews and i was the only one who mentioned it, though they could have gotten pms...

‚Äã

Anyways, the review was basically "I've loved the story so far but this chapter basically jumped the rails.. the MC who has spent all but the first chapter acting with supreme confidence and belief that they can figure anything out just abandoned all that and spent the chapter panicking after one try at "escape". All so he could be rescued by the women(including an OC made for this chapter who was basically the strongest being in the story)"

‚Äã

I know not the most polite way(im also leaving out details so if the author is still around they don't have to hear about it) of stating it, but i did write it just after reading a story i was pretty invested in...
