Harry Potter learns he excels at cooking, and gets Dumbledore to agree to let him open a cooking place at Hogwarts. Leading to a variety of people asking him to cook/bake them something.

Cho Chang, Blaise Zabini, Alicia Spinnet, Oliver Wood, Luna Lovegood, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, Neville Longbottom, Even Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape etc, ask him to bake/cook them something.

I figured it'd be based on related one-shots or something fun like that.


** You should definitely read Harry Potter and the Lack of Lamb Sauce, which kind of starts as crack (Slughorn is replaced by Gordon Ramsey in HBP) and ends up a fully realized fic. But rather than Harry it's Ron who is the member of the trio with culinary talents. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/12805206/chapters/29228961]]

** He was four the first time he had cooked for them. The boy have have been a freak but by God did he have a truly magical talent at cooking. By age five he had completely taken over the cooking in the household.

While they were not fans of his freakish magic, they were more than happy to let him watch telly all day provided it was a cooking show.

It had gotten so bad they had just had a third (Dudley needed one as well) telly in the second bedroom and stuffed the boy up there.

His room was packed with cooking books and various recorded cooking shows. The Dursleys were reluctant at first to speak up about the boy, until he was eight at least.

Then he had gotten a slot in a local youth cooking competition, which he had swept by miles.

That had gotten him noticed by the local news, which had blown up across the isle.

Next thing they know the boy was having to get a tutor since he missed half the school year traveling about for competitions in cooking and getting on shows. He had even made late night a few times!

Petunia and Vernon had of course taken all the credit but Harry didn't care. He loved to cook and had his life mapped out before him.

When his Hogwarts Letter had arrived his Aunt and Uncle had been ecstatic to help him write back a letter of denial. Afterall he was set to finish secondary schooling be testing out the end of this summer. Next year he would be going to Birmingham for his first semester on a rare, as in he was the first ever, Culinary Scholarship.

He had no time at all for magic when there was more to learn about food!

‎(ﾉಥ益ಥ）ﾉ﻿ ┻━┻

Minerva settled herself as she approached the house of the Dursley Family where Harry was staying.

His rejection letter had been short and to the point without being rude. That he was slated to go to a University already, and for cooking, was a bit of a wonder around the staff room. Until Sprout had mentioned what a genius his mother had been at potions. Perhaps it had carried over and the boy was simply applying the talent to a more muggle endeavor?

Honestly, cooking, the chore of the poor, innkeepers, and house elves. James would be ashamed to find their family name drug down to the level of being cooks. Or perhaps we would view it as an excellent prank, that was entirely possible.

( ꒪Д꒪)ノ

She had been forced to excuse herself and asked to return in a few days. That the smug look on Vernon and Petunia's face at the facts they had laid out for her shocked her didn't help.

The boy was making several thousands of Galleons a year already in show fees and competion awards. Then that he would be making even more paid to him as 'living expenses' for a scholarship by his university. Well that had been an absolute mind twister.

Before her students would have sat their NEWTS Harry was already guaranteed jobs paying multiple tens of times more then he was already making.

The boy was a wonder star of the muggle world. Apparently he was a near household name in Muggle Europe. Even appearing in shows in France, Sweden and Spain! All of which were languages he had learned it seems.

When Petunia had laid out a normal weekly schedule of Harry's she had nearly fainted.

He slept about 6 hours a day and was busy nearly every hour of the day until he slept again!

What she had thought was a rather strict Hogwarts schedule, would be a vacation for the boy. One that he did not seem to want to take!

(ꐦ°᷄д°᷅)

The staff room was silent as they realized that not only did Harry Potter not want to come to Hogwarts, he was so well connected in the Muggle world they literally could not force him without a nation wide manhunt going underway.

The boy had several contracts already to attend various talk shows that would be seen by millions. He could not disappeared quietly, it was impossible. Even the oblivators would find the task impossible to pull off with the time frame they had to work with.

However, there was absolutely no way Harry Potter could skip on attending Hogwarts!

The talk about him attending this school year had been ramping up for years. People could do basic math! It was an easy calculation to figure out what year he would start!

"Perhaps some Portkeys so he can attend to his responsibilities?"

Flitwick had always been a brutally practical sort. If the boy had responsibilities, then find a way to make it work.

"He spends more time each day practicing and recieving tutoring then we have classes! That's not even counting the insane amounts of other activities he keeps up with! Or his dietary habits which as you can see from his last months food journal put anything we could offer to shame!"

Minerva settled back down after her outburst. She had been desperately trying to find a way to make it all work and kept hitting a wall.

Sprout hmmmed and everyone looked at her.

"Perhaps he should just be given the same level of responsibility as a Full Course Load Student. He is obviously more than capable and responsible enough based off his schedule."

Everyone thought about that, giving a time turner to a first year! Though they all had to admit, it would solve their dilemna handily.

"We would need to get a full time minder to travel to the muggle world with him. Someone who has experience in the muggle world yet is politically capable of pulling it off."

They all realized it was true, there was no escaping the politics of the situation. They would need a pureblood that was happily muggle or a rather well connected half-blood.

"We will also need to get another kitchen! The elves would be in a riot if we tried to let someone intrude into their kitchen!"

Bleeding hell, another thing to smash together. Snape wanted to sneer and snipe about the privileges being set aside for the boy.

Yet two things kept his mouth firmly closed. The practical side of the situation as he was well aware the boy was tied up heavily into the muggle world. He had discovered this fact last year, and kept quiet about it ever since.

It was the second reason that was the most important one.

The fools he worked with had it backwards. Lily wasn't skilled at potions and her son was using the muggle side of it.

Lily was the single greatest cook he had ever met. She had applied that skill, love and passion to potions. They had spent years as kids cooking and baking. All three of them, Severus, Lily and Petunia.

He was sure it was only the boys talent in cooking that had kept him in her good graces.

So yes, he would work quietly, discreetly and with all the subtlety he had, to support the son of Lily in his drive to be a world class chef.

*** I love it. It makes me upset but it's realistic that the Magical folks would scoff at something as basic as cooking. I really liked the added d detail of Snape, Lily, and Petunia learning how to cook as a kid.

  'Food has a magical quality of its own' so Harry thought. So what might happen when he finds out that magic is real and that hearts and minds can be adjusted by serving the perfect dish? AD/RW/DU bashing, Good Dursleys, recipes are real!
