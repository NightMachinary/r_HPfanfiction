  Albus Dumbledore's hiring habits leave a lot to be desired. Even if the choice of teachers weren't questionable, the methods are. Who would expect a headmaster to use blackmail quite so masterfully to keep his staff quiet about his regular bouts of negligence and ideas that put his students at risk?Thankfully there is one professor who has the heart and the means to help.

*** Along that vein but fics where regulus lives and either has a hand in raising Harry or becomes a mentor to Harry in Sirius' absence. I suppose it is a really specific type of fics and the ones that are out there are usually unfinished.

** The ones I can't find are often ones that I write down as plot bunnies, because I really want to read them and feel they should exist in the world but don't really have the talent or wherewithal to write.

The one I regularly hunt for, but haven't found yet is a stellar Theo/Neville story. I also think Charlie/adult Regulus.

Charlie/Bucky Barnes (hello Romania? Charlie mothering the shit out of a beautiful bewildered no longer brainwashed soldier as only a Weasley could?)

And a good Percy/Autistic!Hermione

And I have this picture of a really magnificently sexy Millicent Bulstrode in my head, and no one else seems to have seen it. That's the beauty and pain of minor characters!

Anyway I think more clearly articulated, these feelings often have to do with rare pairs that I'm convinced would be amazing, wonderful absolutely magical together; but I've tried to write them,and haven't quite cracked the code yet and wish someone else would also think of it so I can read it

** Due to freak accident, all of voldemort's horcruxes obtain bodies at the same time.

Quirrelmort gets the stone.

Diary possesses Ginny permanently.

Ring corrupts Dumbledore.

Locket possesses Sirius or Umbridge.

Cup possesses a goblin.

Diadem possesses...Hogwarts?

Nagini gets mutated into a kaiju or something idk.

Harry gets taken over by the scarcrux.

Basically this wild battle royale.

Ginnymort and Harrymort have a weird soul bond thing that keeps them from hurting each other, so they are forced to cooperate.

Goblinmort leads a Goblin rebellion.

Dumbledore lives up to ever super evil manipulative dumbles trope.

Umbridge (or Sirius via Lord Black and his 247 Wizengamot votes) takes control of the government and all the Aurors and Hit Wizards.

Hogwarts is granted sentience by the diadem and turns into some kind of huge golem colossus thing and is playing Pacific Rim in the background with Kaiju!Nagini.

Quirrelmort is seriously wondering what the fuck he did wrong.

Just utter chaos. Directed by Michael Bay type shit.

** I like post-Hogwarts fics in which Harry is single, isn't involved in raising Teddy or any other child, isn't so attached to Weasleys and Hermione, and gets to enjoy his life. Partying, clubbing, having new friends, that kind of stuff. *A Black Comedy* is the only really good one fic I ever found featuring these things.

** I want an MCU crossover where Tony Stark is Harry's biological father, but no one finds out until Harry is at Hogwarts. I'd like Tony to try to help and advise Harry as well as maybe get him away from the dangerous situation with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. So far I haven't found anything that fits what I want, so I may have to write it myself after I finish my female Harry series and my time travel fix it.

** Ever since I read the "Accidental Horcrux", I have always liked the idea of a sentiant Scarcrux. An Horcrux that is not just a gataway toward Voldemort, but its own consciousness with its own mind and goals. Sadly, this trope is very rare and besides the Accidental Horcrux, I can only think of 2 or 3 series that use this trope (like "The Devil Went Down to Hogwarts" series).

I also have a lot of problem to find a good Harry/ Tracey fic. I know the character is barely canon at best, but I really like the idea of a Half Blood, banal Slytherin ending up with Harry. With all the Harry/ Daphne fics using her as a third wheel or a part of the harem, it's a shame there is barely any fics where Harry is just with her (between 10 and 20 I think?).

** _ What you said about TMR being a good guy

_ A TMR raising Harry but as TMR, not Voldemort trying to protect Harry b/c he's a horcrux

-Percy bonding with his siblings somehow or Harry

_ Percy and Oliver friendship

Basically more happy Percy fics

_ Audrey Weasley bashing

** Sarcastic/Sassy Harry, where he just gets fed up with the Wizarding World's complete and utter lack of common sense.Snapped by The Feisty Rogue is a good one, but it is hard to find others. Or ones where Harry doesn't really care about the Potter Stinks badges, because honestly, that's a pretty childish insult for a 14 year old to come up with, and Harry tells Malfoy that. And really?!the older students don't call Malfoy on it?!

** The whimsical light hearted feel of the first two books applied to years 3 to 7. If defeating Voldemort is important but not more important than avoiding Snape as the heroes rush back to their dorm after curfew then the tone is right.

Harry maintaining his intelligent, wisecracking but generally friendly personality from the first two books throughout years 3 to 7. If he Becomes an edge lord (or any kind of lord), or engages in training montages then I don't want to know.

Stories where Harry is just Harry. No lordships, ancient bloodlines, secret techniques, training montages, vast piles of wealth or politics of any kind. Just a teenager going to a magical school and solving the occasional mystery.
