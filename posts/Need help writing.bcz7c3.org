Hello everyone! I'm not necessarily sure i used the right flair for this, if I didn't, my apologies.

I just finished the Harry Potter book and movie series and an idea had come to mind. I really like it and really want to make it into a fan fiction. I'm still deciding whether or not I want to follow most of the original plot of the series or make my own, or just incorporate both. One thing I really need help/advice on is how to write a certain character.

So, i was planning on making an OC, and i decided I want her to be affiliated with Draco. I don't want them as love interests, but more like two people whom grew up together. I kinda imagine my OC looking up to Draco and seeing him as an older brother. She likes to impress him and looks for his approval. I don't want to change Draco's personality, I still want him to be how J.K Rowling wrote him, but i also want him to also see her as a younger sister. I feel I have an idea of how his relationship with her would be. I feel maybe he'd see her as a sister, as he did grow up an only child, but he sees her as an annoying little sister. I feel he would care for her and see her as family, but he shows this in a different way.

I was wondering if I could have some advice/insight/help with how to write this relationship between the two? I really like the idea of it and would love to write it in my fanfiction. Also, any ideas in general would be super appreciated!


** I see that you said you don't want it to change his personality, but are you thinking this would change his actions as he now has someone who he is a role model to? Would he feel guilty if she followed his example and then had negative consequences? Or would he teach her to be as arrogant and nasty as he is?

Presumably she is a pureblood, since he is not exposed to non pureblood families. And presumably her family is also "well to do." Bouncing off what the other commenter said, it could be someone who was orphaned during the First War - say, because her parents were Death Eaters. Maybe she grew up hating the Order of the Phoenix because they killed her parents - which is what she's taught by Narcissa and Lucius, who raise her.

Or maybe she only lost one parent, say her dad, but her mother is raising her on her own and so brings her over for play dates a lot and to talk with Narcissa.

If Draco is older, maybe he is bossy toward her when they play. But, maybe his mom also tries to drill into him to treat girls gently, as they are very traditional.

Maybe they have some sort of adventure or background thing involving accidental magic.

Maybe when she finally gets to Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat puts her somewhere other than Slytherin and it strains her relationship with him. Or it at least considers it, but she begs for Slytherin to be close to him.

Are these ideas helpful?

*** Oh one more thing, instead of having her parent(s) die in the first war, you could also have one or both of them go to Azkaban. Or one dead, one in Azkaban.

*** Those are very helpful, thank you so much! I really like the idea that the Malfoys raised her or maybe even helped raise her. I was thinking of the Sorting Hat putting her in Ravenclaw or even Gryffindor because the way i imagine her, I feel she'd resemble either of them more than a Slytherin.

**** If she and her family were close to the Malfoys I think you would really need to justify that hard and show her arguing with the hat even. Ravenclaw would be easier than Gryffindor, since Gryffindor has such a reputation for being anti-Slytherin.

Any other stuck areas you want to brainstorm?

***** That's actually a really good point. I've never fully thought of having to justify why she was sorted in to a different house. Thank you for bringing that up!

Hm. I also need a bit of help of how she'd interact with the Golden Trio. I feel maybe she would have a negative attitude towards them, having had listened to Draco talk bad about them at home. Or if she would seem them a bit more differently than he does.

****** I imagine she would have a negative view of them coming in, but then, say, if she goes into Ravenclaw - well, maybe she would make friends with Luna? Hmm, no, probably not because Luna is so weird. But some Ravenclaw that has connections with the Golden Trio, or there is a chain of connection. Could be a really slow burn, where she makes friends with one Ravenclaw, and then is slowly introduced to another, and another, i.e. to Padma, which then connects her to Parvati, which then connects her to Lavender, and from there she has an interaction with Hermione. And if she is younger than them, especially by a few years, I could see Hermione being mature about it, and actually pitying the girl for being raised by bigots, possibly. And then challenging the girl's stereotypes about muggle borns.

******* I think a lot of people found Luna really odd at first,but grew quite fond of her after a while. She was a pretty good friend towards many of them. So, i think it is still possible to have the two become acquainted in some way.

I was definitely leaning towards her slowly becoming more fond of them eventually. It would lead to problems given the higher pure-blood families views of "blood traitors". Hermione being the mature one and challenging her could possible help with her character development as well so i really like that idea!

** Best bet is a cousin who's parents died early and is fostered with them.

** I'd write her in a way that will change the plot. But not in a Mary sue esc. Integral to the downfall of voldemort way. More subtle.

Some decisions that Draco makes may change because he has a sister. He's got to think about her when it comes to his future and motivation to join the deatheaters. What he deems the safest option. If you write him as caring about her. Or she could do something to change his mind. I think a large part of what Draco did in Canon came with the liberty of being an only child.

On the reverse, it could encourage him to be a deatheater even more so that she doesn't have to. Or maybe she even supports his endeavours. It could go anyway really.

Then this change in Draco's decisions snowballs and changes elements of the story and shifts the plot.

One small thing can change the entire course of the story and imo you're best changing the plot anyways because people generally don't turn to fan fiction for reruns of a plot they're already really familiar with. It gets boring. Think if the butterfly/domino effect.

That's how I would write the two of them anyway.

*** I agree, writing a different plot would probably be better than just following the orginal one. And probably easier as well. Thank you so much, this really helped a lot!
