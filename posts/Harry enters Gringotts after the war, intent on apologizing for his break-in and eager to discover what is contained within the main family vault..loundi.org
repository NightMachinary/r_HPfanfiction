To his surprise, the goblins are willing to forgive him after explaining the purpose of his break-in, asking only for compensation for the destroyed roof and floor, not the dragon or the cup. Harry agrees, and is led to the main Potter vault.

After a lengthy process of unsealing the door, Harry enters, and is immediately surprised - there are no mountains of gold, no stacks of books or antique furniture. No racks of wands or family grimoires. The only thing within the vault is a small, rickedy table, upon it an age-yellowed letter, sealed with red wax and stamped in a strange symbol he'd never seen before.

He breaks the seal, and pulls out two sheafs of parchment. One is an ancient deed, stamped and signed with the same symbol as on the seal, and the other is a letter written in shaky, spidery handwriting.

Harry begins to read.

/"Ruin has come to our family./

/You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial..."/

** Conversely: The only thing within the vault is a small, rickety table, upon it a purple wax seal inscribed with the letters "PT".

He breaks the seal and pulls out two sheaves of parchment. One is a land deed stamped with the same seal, the other is a letter, written front and back, covered in shakey, spidery handwriting.

Harry begins to read:

/"Dear Harry,/

/If you're reading this, you must be in dire need of change./

/The same thing happened to me, long ago..."/

** Sounds like Robst goblins, not JKR goblins. The latter are neither friendly nor forgiving.

*** No, they aren't. The whole "GOBLINS HATE PEOPLE" thing is as much a fandom meme as the opposite.

In the books, goblins are brusque and to the point. In the books, there are multiple goblin rebellions throughout history, but no real details on why. In the book, /one/ goblin betrays Harry, one who, y'know, was just kidnapped and tortured so might have a reason to hate people.

Goblins could be great guys. They could hate people. For canon, there's little sign.

Both types of goblins are equally valid, as is a more middle of the road interpretation.

  HATE PEOPLE

I never said that they hate people. I said that they aren't friendly or forgiving. They have armed guards at the door and a sign that says they'll fuck you up if you steal from them. Then Harry not only steals from them, but also frees their captive dragon, totally screws up their building, and embarrasses them in public. Thinking that they'll forgive and forget with minimal fuss after that is far more Robst fanwank than JKR. Hell, /I/ wouldn't forgive and forget that just because the idiot teenager has "a good explanation" (that isn't really all that good).

***** Hey, so you responded to this, but not my response. Read that please instead of blindly continuing to insinuate that I want robst-tier goblins.

Because I don't. And I'm not requesting those either.

Again, if you tried /reading/ and /informing yourself/, then you might see how letting Harry agree to an unspecified debt amount and getting him to take over a stretch of land that's festering with monsters isn't exactly very kind of them. But you're obviously not a big fan of doing those things.

*** Well, they never told him how much the ceiling and floor cost. Harry just assumed he would be able to pay for it with the riches in the family vault - the financial situation of which was another fact they neglected to inform him about.

And if you know about what I'm referencing in the post, then you'll also know why the deed won't be all too useful for paying off that debt.
