** If it was me I would start from the moment he hears the truth about their deaths from Hagrid. He would be angry at being lied to and he would of course want to see the man responsible punished. The idea for actively seeking vengeance could come from a book he'd read or something he saw on tv. There's plenty of classical books he could've read by that age which revolve around that subject. The Iliad, The Count of Monte Cristo, etc. Whatever you happen to be familiar with that was written before that time or you could always just read a quick summary online and base it off that. If you like that idea anyway. Hope this helps.

** you might want to start at the end of the first year, with the meeting with Quirellmort having him feel inadiquate and force him to study, perhaps have him quit quidditch, and have him prepare himself for a summer where he needs to improve when his parents killer whos capable of attaining followers are around.

Summer can be him slowly but steadily coming with the plan, have him realise that Voldemort will come after him untill either are put into the ground.
