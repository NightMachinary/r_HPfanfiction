Alright, don't hate me or do it's okay. I actually like the Lord Potter trope. What I hate is when he gets all these ancient titles that no one has claimed just to get a billion galleons and do nothing with it all. Or worse, when he goes on rants and everyone just kind of claps and suck up to him.

Nobility in the magical world makes sense. Purebloods are already obsessed with blood status. During the separation, the UK had just signed the Bill of Rights so the magicals would still be used to a strong monarch and aristocracy. Wizards would have definitely used their powers to get titled and rich prior to the separation or just have been titled due to actions/birth, etc.

I'm looking for Lord Potter/nobility fic that actually makes use of the title. It definitely shouldn't be about Harry becoming Lord Potter and now he's King of the Magical Word because of look he's Lord Hogwarts-Merlin-Black-Fuckall but if it's about inheriting votes (and he uses those powers) and alliances then that's cool. It'd be nice to see a feudal setup where Harry inherits a territory that he's the ruling Lord.

So anyway, give me your best nobility fics that aren't whiny/angry Harry.


** The best Lord Potter I can recommend is linkffn(The Accidental Animagus) and it's sequel. There are realistic Wizengamot politics and typical aristocracy courtesy as well as Harry using what he inherits wisely (money, books, etc.). But there isn't any really feudal setup. Harry doesn't inherit anything that doesn't fit in a vault, no manor or castle.

**** Then I think you will quite like it. It does a particularly good job at world building both Great Britain and the wizarding world in general and developing magic. Although you might want to go over a bit the first chapter because the author needed the Dursleys to be worse in their abuse for Harry to panic and his magic to react in the way it does in the story.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.

I want a fic where someone pisses off the Wizengamot by saying something like "Look at me, I'm a lord, my shoes can't even get tied without a house elf." And that person they were mocking responds with "Lord Fuckall more like." and it was legally binding.

It could be some ancient law about how to elevate your family to noble status and they fulfilled it, but needed a Wizengamot seat to bring it forth. And it spectacularly backfires because that person now has to deal with politics.

Edit: Plus, Lord Fuckall sounds hilarious.

*** Since this was pre-SOS, I would imagine that muggle and magical life was very similar. It was not thought of that nobles would have careers. The nobles would be educated, if outside a pseudo-apprenticeship, by a religious monk. I wouldn't think that magicals would be all that interested in religion due to persecution.

Anyway, my thought would be that the Founders would have to be either the third or later children. For the men, not directly in the line to inherit (the money, land, title?, or even the knowledge --- the last part might be why they were so focused on getting a school for everyone). If they weren't in the line to inherit then they would have more freedom to do what they wanted with their lives.

Anyway, in a world with a magical nobility I don't think the founders would have been titled nobility. I think they would have been highly respected and may even have some artifacts and ancient books that an “heir” might inherit but I think it would be poor writing to say that the Founders have a Lordship rather than the population to just take pride from descending from them.

**** There's a decent argument for nobility given the castle, the expense, and the education in that time period - but I agree, that doesn't mean the founders had to be the heads of their families.

I actually like how /Of a Linear Circle/ does it. linkao3(11284494) All four founders were titled nobility, and all of them abdicated in favor of squib relatives. Some so that they could focus on the school, some because the locals were anti-magic and a non-magical noble would be able to get more done.

** I don't think the trope itself is bad, the problem is that people don't use it well, they start by giving him a lot of titles, properties and names, that end up doing no difference AT ALL in the story. I mean what use is giving him 20 houses if he won't leave the Dursleys because Evil!Dumbles won't let him?

It's pretty logical for the magicals to have nobility, I mean, they place a LOT of importance on blood and genealogy, are longer lived and their society is pretty class oriented.

linkffn(Novocaine) has Harry inheriting the Potter and Black families and then pledges of allegiance from a lot of the DE families along with the seat of House Peverell by Right of Conquest from Voldemort, the fic is a Drama/Romance where Harry(and Lawyer!Daphne) uses these to repair the world and the people through philanthropism and politics, with subplots for Haphne and Harry along with others, from both sides, coming together to get past the trauma of the War.

** Well the Lord Potter trope done right is definitely better than nothing, I personally prefer Harry starting out with no power or influence except the fact that he is the Boy Who Lived and with a reasonable sum of money from his parents. Then he can build this all up throughout the course of the fic of course that's my preference but I agree there should be some good fics out there without the Lord Potter-Black-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Peverell thing, sadly I can't recommend any from the top of my head right now.

*** I honestly think that Gryffindor and Slytherin weren't nobles and that the Peverells were just really powerful but penniless witches and wizards. I think that Harry should either just be Lord Black as the Potters aren't named ancient or noble (though I do believe that they are) and Harry only has more pull with the Black name and money. That's only one idea, though. Being called Potter-Black is fine to me.

**** But the Peverell are the potters in theory and likely in canon and the potters are a very old family and responsible for several big and famous potions so that'll give them a lot of influence and power
