I'm looking for a fic I read a while ago. It was on ffn.net. The basic premise was fem!Harry, Hermione, Draco and Luna all managed to travel to another dimension (Middle Earth) via a ritual incorporating the Veil in the Department of Mysteries. The eventually end up founding a city called Haven (I think that's the name). I tried searching for it but I can't figure out the right keywords so Google keeps on giving me the wrong results. I want to show it to my sister because I really enjoyed it and I know she will too.

  Fem!Harry. Heather wants to hide in the bottom of the ocean. Hermione wants to change the world. Draco wants to be seen as himself and not his father. And Luna? Well...she's Luna. An idea starts a chain of events and none of them regret it.
