Length doesn't matter, although I would prefer a longer story. Appreciate it if the story was complete also.


** So, I'm just going to list a bunch, and give a little blurb about them. Not all of them are good, but that's just how it goes with +the best+ this pairing.

linkffn(The Legacy Preservation Act by James Spookie) A marriage law fic. WIP. Not the best, and it's a typical James Spookie fic. So grammar and what not is good, characterization is ok and plot could use work. Actually, just go check out his profile. Has a bunch, and I don't feel like typing them all out.

linkffn(Unatoned by SeriousScribble) This is a noir, EWE fic. Easily the best /written/ fic in the entire fandom. Doesn't mean it is the best fic, but the quality of the writing itself is topnotch. First chapter is an homage to the classic Raymond Chandler novel /The Big Sleep/ and its classic movie adaptation starring Humphrey Bogart.

linkffn(Duality by Anda Faith) A WIP. Has a very Cold War, spy v spy thing going on.

linkffn(The Grass is Always Greener by kb0) One of the more classic H/Daphne fics. A typical kb0 fic. Nice, kinda fluffy, very popcorn fic.

linkffn(The Lies that Bind by Zephros) A very dark take on the pairing.

linkffn(A Fine Spot of Trouble by Chilord) Another classic of the genre. An EWE fic. Super quippy. Lots of rapid fire dialogue.

linkffn(A Champion's New Hope by Rocag) A complete, GoF & OotP AU. Didn't age well.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lightning Scar) I've mentioned this in the Cult Classics thread. The H/D pairing isn't the focus, but is present. Feels very b-movie.

linkffn(The Legacy by StorytellerSpW) Another WIP, but is nearing the end and it is the longest one of these fics that I know of.

linkffn(The Reluctant Champion by The Unreal Insomniac) The first of a series. Second fic has just been started. A "James Potter lived" fic.

linkffn(Myrddin Emrys Returns) Probably the worst fic I'm recommending, but whatever, I do what I want.

And since I don't actually know how many fics the bot can link ([[/u/tusing]], could you please inform me of the limit?), I'm just going to stop here.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697407/1/Contractual-Invalidation][Contractual Invalidation]]: Good writing and character interactions, but I find both main characters unlikable. Worth a read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11185533/1/Uncle-Harry][Uncle Harry]]: By the same author above, this time with more likeable characters. Oneshot.

[[https://forums.darklordpotter.net/showthread.php?t=15341][Intoxication]]: Great writing; creepy and rather disturbing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][The Song of the Trees]]: My favorite of the bunch. One of the best written mysteries in the fandom, and some pretty great worldbuilding too.

** Linkffn(Days to Come by chris400ad)

WIP slow burn romance in the aftermath of Harry/Ginny breakup. Solid writing, decent characterization and slowish pacing(not as slow as Vox Corporis but you know).

  Harry Potter, famed auror and Boy-Who-Lived, was hoping after having won the war and got the girl he would find some peace. But life had other ideas. See how his life fell apart and how one simple chance encounter could change everything. Post-War and Non-epilogue compliant.

** "Intoxication" is probably the best, which is very telling of the pairing considering how the story ends. "Unatoned" is written well, but the plot itself is kind of meh. Those are pretty much the only ones that I would rate above average. Most of the stories are interchangeable.

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.
