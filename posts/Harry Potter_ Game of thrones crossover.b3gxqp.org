** Swords and Roses linkffn(12853038) This doesn't have the multi/smut, but it is a good crossover between the 2. I do know of what your looking for, but rule 8 is there for a reason

  AU. Harry Tyrell the counterpart to Harry Potter, born the second son of House Tyrell dares to dream. He will not be a sword at the side of his brother, a knight of the Kingsguard or what else his family plans. He will make his own destiny and show the world what 'Growing Strong' really means. Image is curtsey of NyxxNoxx.
