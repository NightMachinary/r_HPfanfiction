*** If abandoned fics hurt you, steer clear of 0800-rent-a-hero... I found it about a month before it was abandoned and I'm still bitter (and there's drama about the author starting a patreon). If you don't mind reading abandoned fics, I highly recommend it.

*** Except far better done in my opinion. I'm Still Here reads (for the most part) like a boring angsty dimension travelling power wank fic. Once you've read one of those you've kinda read them all.

** Linkffn (Dancing With Myself by Swordchucks)

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3992226/1/]]

I think is the best version of this, although it does have some Harry/Fem!Harry so if you're not into that, don't read

** The unfinished second part to " a stranger in an unholy land", "a stranger in the promised land", has a girl who lived. I can't link because it's 8 chapters are scattered across the web, but its worth searching for in my opinion. I think its pretty good and has one of the best fight scenes i've ever read( between harry and grindlewald).
