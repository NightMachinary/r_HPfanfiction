Like probably most FF readers I feel like I have cool ideas pop into my head while reading HP fics, but I either can't put them into a story properly, don't have time, or there are other authors I know could really do well with it.

I'm not talking about pairing up certain characters, or writing very specific one-shots/scenes, or anything like that: more a major twist to the plot itself, like perhaps Harry was born with a rare power that changes the direction of the story or there is some other very special types of magic that exist. I'm picturing [[/r/writingprompts][r/writingprompts]] but with really interesting and thought provoking fic ideas other people can run with.

So is there a (hopefully and probably well-known) tumblr or site where people can dump their plot ideas into and hope writers come and pick them, and also hopefully announce that they've picked an idea to give credit?

Thanks!

*** Definitely like this idea. Ive thought for a while that there should be a writing prompt sticky thread now and then on this subreddit to help jump start stories and breath new ideas into the mix.

I am another of the people who has a ton of ideas, but neither the time nor ability to really write most of them out. I try, and have 3 going right now I hope one day to finish but I have a list of like 30 other ideas waiting lol.

***** H.A.W.T.

Short for "Has Anyone Written This?".

(Perhaps a less awkward acronym would be in order, though...)

** I think someone from here made [[/r/HarryPrompter]] for this sort of purpose, but it never really got going.

**** I'd prefer to have it hosted here. This subreddit isn't supersaturated with posts and the offshoot subreddits (HPharmony, HarryandGinny, and AlexandraQuick) are even less active. We've also had threads similar to what OP mentions that have always been well received. I think a scheduled thread would make a nice addition to the book club and debate threads. It'd also help add diversity to the multitude of [LF] topics.

** I think this very subreddit would be the best? More like as a brainstorm to encourage authors to write, rather than suggest per say... but still.

** The only thing that pops into my head is live journal anonymous kink memes, and those usually revolve around sex.

Why not just write a oneshot depicting several scenes from your AU idea and post it like Rorschach's Blot does in Odd Ideas? Not every AU has to be a 7-years-in-Hogwarts 800k fanfic.

** You might be able to go onto fanfiction.net and post a challenge - but check the rules, they may only let you do that if you've posted stories of your own. They may also have communities where you can post requests.

** Depending on what authors you like, if you follow them on tumblr lots of us frequently put calls out for drabble prompts! Sure, you're not getting a full story. But I also know more than one person who has written a drabble for a prompt and then gone back and turned it into a longer fic. That said - there's also a place for drabbles as full stories in and of themselves and sometimes they can be really gratifying to read!

Anyways, the challenge with this is that authors might not accept your prompts or might not write them - authors don't owe readers anything after all! But, if you're not going to write it yourself, it could be an option.

I second the idea of having a monthly-ish or twice a month thread as a prompt-drop situation where authors can come in and look for inspiration!
