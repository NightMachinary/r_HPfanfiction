So I recently read a fanfic that had an explanation that made a lot more sense than the canon explanation of witch burnings, namely [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/11800899/chapters/26618625][/Hermione Granger, Demonologist/]]. That the canon explanation of wizards and witches being able to escape easily due to spells like the Flame-Freezing charm was actually propaganda, and the truth was that hundreds of people, including witches and wizards, died at the hands of the church, since witch burnings would frequently involve tying the victim to a stake, which generally would make spellcasting a lot more difficult.

It even made mention of the one witch mentioned in the context of witch burnings in canon, Wendelin the Weird, who got caught several times, but this version of the story notes that she was caught by a mob who recognized her from their previous attempts to burn her at the stake, and hung her to death instead.

So yeah, I honestly think the fanfic's notes on witch burnings makes more sense than canon.


** my guess is the burnings are considered a joke for the wizarding world since only those who managed to cast the flame freezing charm lived to tell the tale.

That still doesn't explain how the witches got tied in the first place. In a world with Disapparition, Obliviation and Confundus Charm, only incompetent morons will get caught by Muggles. And since some magical people like Lucius Malfoy are all for the elimination of the unworthy from the wizarding community, I'd say the 17th century Malfoys were most likely grateful to the Muggles for killing off the Mundungus Fletcher type wizards.

*** A lot of the modern spells probably didn't exist many centuries ago. Less efficient earlier versions might have been far more difficult to cast. Major difference between 10th century (Hogwarts founding) and 17th century (Secrecy begins).

**** Nothing in the Harry Potter canon suggests that magic is developing like science and technology are. Magical education ends at the age of 18 and seems to consist of the teaching of known methods. There are no magical universities and therefore no culture of researching the unknown. The Department of Mysteries does not share its discoveries, and Dumbledore is the only known magical inventor, and for him it's a hobby.

Somehow broomstick manufacturers bring new, faster brooms to the market every year. I'd say that's just one of those things that JKR put in the books to mimic this phenomenom in the real world, and she never realised how it makes so sense. The Firebolt was far superior to the previously best broomstick, Nimbus 2001, which was one year older, and if that's the development speed of broomstick manufacturing, broomsticks should have been invented in the 1980s.

A Quite a few spells are mentioned as having been created well after Hogwarts was founded.

*** Yeah, I suppose it would have only been a problem for those under 13 or so. But they lived pretty separately from Muggles anyway so I don't see why kids would have interacted with Muggles. If they were under real threat then I imagine the parents would have taken precautions like giving the kid a necklace with a Muggle repelling charm on it.

** I have a headcanon that floo powder was developed as a response to witch burnings. If you keep some floo powder stitched into the bottom hem of your robes, as soon as the fire reaches the robes youre no longer in a bonfire, you're in the floo system and can call out a safe destination. After 1692 and the Statute of Secrecy was passed, the floo network was developed to make use of the powder and avoid travelling through muggle areas.

** Except witches weren't burned in England And Wales. Heretics were burned, witches were hanged.

The occasional Scot was burned as a witch until the Protestant Reformation hit when the numbers shot up under James VI/I who took a personal interest. Even then, most Scottish witches were strangled before they were burned.

Wendelin must have been French or German
