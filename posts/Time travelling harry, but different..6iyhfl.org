Looking for stories where an enemy comes with harry to the past. The only requirement i ask for is that the enemy isn't stupid in how he gets things done. Basically not a bash fest on that front. If the enemy is dumbledore well for one harry would most likely lose, but most important is that a lot of writers including myself at times severley under estimate, and under sell dumbledore. If he was evil he would be like moriarty or palpatine, basically he would be a very good manipulator, and be very patient. So if you suggest any stories where he is the enemy who came back please make sure he actually IS dumbledore. Not an oc named dumbledore like most are.

This story has bashing, but it's the only one I know which has an enemy come back with Harry

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12388283/1/The-many-Deaths-of-Harry-Potter][The Many Deaths of Harry Potter]] is sort of what you're looking for. I can't say more than that without spoiling some stuff but it's pretty creative with what ends up going on.

*** Violates the “enemy isn't stupid” part though.

**** Still smarter than cannon. And besides they actually learned from their mistakes, Harry was just two steps ahead when it counted.

***** /(spoilers)/

Right after the cauldron resurrection, VD was literally at least a step ahead of Harry in terms of information. 1) he knew about Harry's TT 1.2) without Harry knowing that he knows about it 2) he knew were Harry was likely to show up (graveyard) and be susceptible to ambushes 3) he had three days to think of possible countermeasure plans against Harry and his game-breaking TT 4) it should've been a [[https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Rumsfeld][known unknown]] for him the amount of time-travelling, info-gathering and skill-practicing that Harry has managed to do after their double-death at the graveyard.

Even on an average (non-NPC, non-IdiotBall zombie, etc) intelligence he should've prioritized designing an ambush with maximal chances of capturing Potter alive. Even if VD was just of average intelligence, this story would've ended when Harry and Sirius went to check the graveyard for the first time: while HP and SB were trying to determine if the bones they've found were the real deal, a dozen or more minions would've blocked apparation and portkeys, surrounded them, and captured them. This would've been the Game-Over for Harry and the newest checkpoint for VD that'd lead to various Game Ends, depending on his further intelligence checks, choices, and so on.

This single decision alone was handled by VD so badly that it puts him even higher on the stupidity scale than where his canon version's at.
