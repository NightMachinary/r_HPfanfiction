I have over 500 stories in my fanfiction.net app and most of them are Dramione fanfics. Now the problem is not my obsession in Dramione but I can't find this story that I suddenly had the urge to reread. Please, help me!

The premise of the story is about the new marriage law (I'm a sucker of this one) proposed by the pureblood matriarchs, headed by Narcisa(my queen) to help unite the wizards and prevent all the dangers that are happening to their families. It has multiple pairings dramione, hansy, blinny, Luna and theo, and ron and daphne. This are some plot that I remember in the story; Narcissa and Draco helping Hermione to be the next minister, Ron and Daphne's cute marriage (this story does not have any douche ron, he's kinda cute in here actually(Daphne has some sad drama going about her also)) and Theo's obsession about his wife, Luna (he literally house arrest her to prevent her being harm because she is a wife of a pureblood slytherin and the current Nott mistress. There are also some funny interactions of every pureblood house elves and Pansy using them as her intelligence agents.
