Can be Gryffindor!Draco, or Slytherin!Harry or their canon houses, I dont mind. I want either for them to be genuinely good people or awful people. Either way have some humour, kind of like theyre the marauders of their generation. Well written. 60k+ words (or a good oneshot)


** Magical Relations is a Slytherin!Harry and Wizard!Dudley fic where Draco and Harry end up as friends (though it takes awhile to get there). It's a series that's complete up to the beginning of 6th year. There are jokes and stuff throughout the whole series, but it does get more serious as the series progresses.

I'll throw my own in the hat, it is very near completion and I have received quite a lot of positive feedback on it. Let me know what you think if you give it a shot.

  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

  Harry & Dudley flee an abusive Vernon to Severus Snape. Severus finds a new home for himself & the boys with dragons and hunt the Horcruxes from there. The dragons, especially one become their allies. Tom R is VERY different.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE
