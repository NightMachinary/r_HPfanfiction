Other than HPMOR, which I realize is probably the first thing that comes to mind, I'd love to hear recommendations on this kind of thing. It's something I like to think about.

In return, I suggest the (sadly abandoned) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093023/1/The-Book-of-Dobby-Reboot-Per-Arcana-ad-Astra][The Book of Dobby Reboot: Per Arcana ad Astra]] by the inestimable Doghead Thirteen, as the kind of thing for which I might be looking.

So whatcha got, Reddit?

** The Sherlock/HP crossover [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7578572/1/A-Study-in-Magic][A Study in Magic]] does use a lot of time on the whole tech and magic spiel. It's not focused on it as a major plotpoint as far as I can see, but it is there if you want it.

Not the best of fics, but it's alright.

** It's not really my thing, but you might enjoy Clell's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3933832/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Invincible-TechnoMage][Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage]]. 145k words, WIP.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter and the Marvel Universe. 5 year old Harry accompanies the Dursleys on a Business trip to Stark International, where an industrial accident kills all of Harry's living relatives. A very different Harry goes to Hogwarts. Dating, Romance, noship.
#+end_quote

Another is Ruskbyte's [[http://ruskbyte.fanficauthors.net/Culture_Shock/index/][Culture Shock]]. 70k words, abandoned.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has just received his Hogwarts letter, but really doesn't want to go. After all, who would want to live on a planet of all things? Especially one where the inhabitants still think nuclear energy is an advanced technology. And let's not forget the 42,000 light year commute.

*** I've seen the first one, and meant to get around to reading it. The second seems new. I'll give them both a shot. Thanks!

*** I like Harry Potter and the Invincible Technomage but was unsure about noship. I'm reading it nevertheless. It is interesting fanfic so far. Do you have any more fanfics like this? I already found some on Fanfiction Archives (or something) but well you know, most of them have too much lemons for my taste and basically PWP lol.

I don't mind crossovers as well. Thanks
