I'm always thought how certain characters (particularly Sirius, Remus, and Severus) would probably be prone to suffering an addiction due to the very dire hardships they'd faced from an early age. I think it's very possible they would have turned to drugs as a coping mechanism. I think it adds a depth of character/another dimension to the personality.

Do you know of any good FF that delves into the subject? I'm not particular about length of content or which characters. Could be during or after the wars. In general I prefer completed or recently updates, and adult characters, and... I like romance :) Hey, I'm a romantic girl at heart!

Thanks in advance :3

Personally, I'd recommend [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/][Stages of Hope]] by kayly silverstorm, in which Harry is addicted to Felix Felicis. He (and the rest) have a whole bunch of issues, but I think they dealt with the addiction well.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** In my fic linkffn(Poison and Cure by Blandge), Harry battles alcoholism. Luna and Harry are the main characters. It's only got two chapters up so far though.

#+begin_quote
  "I spent the last twenty months undercover as a Russian mafia contact for a Romanian crime syndicate. Sounds simple right? Wrong. Every wizard in Europe knows what Harry Potter looks like, so I can't just waltz into Eastern Europe pretending to be a criminal. I had to be in disguise under Polyjuice the entire time." The volume of his voice began rising. "And there's only one believable reason somebody drinks from a flask every hour, and that's if they are an alcoholic, so that's what I became."

  He shot to his feet. "And what does a Russian alcoholic drink? Vodka! Straight up! That's why I'm a fucking alcoholic! ..."
