Hi all.

I was recently reading a fic where Harry was well acquainted with the Malfoy family (as being a friend with an OC older brother of Draco). In this fic, Lucius Malfoy never became a death eater. The Nott family was chosen to be the 'new death eater/antagonistic Malfoy family' in their stead.

With this theme in mind, I was wondering if anyone could recommend fics with this theme. The Malfoy family must not be death eaters. Any other family (or alternatively no family at all) may be the 'replacement death eater/antagonistic family'.

Furthermore, Harry must be friends with Draco or, if Harry is older, then he must be friends with an older Malfoy sibling (though I don't think an older sibling is common).

Thanks in advance.

Cheers.


** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin) has the Malfoys abandoning Voldemort after the disaster in second year with the Diary when they find out that Voldemort is crazy enough to do Horcruxes and that they had one. Anyone with the mindset capable of creating Horcruxes is a threat to all of society and must be stopped at any cost.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

** linkao3(Stages of Hope)

Lily and Snape made their friendship work. They convince Lucius that muggleborns can be great, he becomes a staunch good guy, raises Draco into a great teddy bear type.

  “Your robes are...red,” Hermione finally said, strangely accusing. “Burgundy!” Severus protested. Red was tacky. Burgundy, however, had class.“And what did you do to your hair?” she asked in horrified fascination.Snape's hand rose to his scalp. “Nothing! What is wrong with you? I just washed it and blow-dried it like every morning...”“Ah, I see.” She nodded and stepped back. “Alternate dimension. It must be.”

** Linkffn(They shook hands). The Malfoys redeem themselves, and Harry befriends Draco and his older OC brother Ellan. Although other kids families appear kind to Harry at first, lately they must decide were their true loyalty as a former deatheaters lies.

  After swearing I was done tinkering with the first entry in the series, the Muse struck me. Essentially the same story, but with a more solid introduction to the new characters. Names changed to protect the innocent. Less canon text. More Snape!

** I am just struggling through linkffn(Royal Ward by Catstaff) (one of those stories which should be cut to one quarter or even more drastically) and it has this sympathetic Malfoy. It still feels like whitewashing of a terrorist.

  Based on "Hatal Fart Attack" by Corwalch, "Royal Ward" follows the changes in Harry's life after he gains the personal attention of the Queen. My thanks to Corwalch for permission to write a sequel. Reading "Hatal Fart Attack" first is recommended, but not absolutely required. Please note that this story begins in 1989, shortly before Harry turns 9.
