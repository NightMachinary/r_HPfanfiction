#+TITLE: The minister of magic is an elected position. One that happens every few years. In Harry's third year he finds out it only costs 12 gallions to put your name on ballet and there's no age limit. As a joke he paid the 12 gallions and threw his name in the running. Imagine his surprise when he won.

"Yes, sir," was all Harry said in response.

"Well, there were worse options for minister," Dumbledore mumbled, "Congratulations on becoming minister, Harry!"

  Finally, Remus was satisfied that they had the spell down. "Right, Neville. First things first: what would you say is the thing that frightens you most in the world?"

  "The thought of Harry as Minister of Magic," Neville replied immediately.

  "Hey!" Harry protested while the rest of the class laughed.

  "Harry as Minister of Magic...hmmm...Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother?"

  "Sure do," Neville said cheerfully. "But she'd be just as scary as Minister, though obviously for different reasons."

  "No, no, you misunderstand me," Remus explained. "I wonder, could you tell me what sort of clothes your grandmother usually wears?"

  Harry was starting to get a bad feeling about this...

  Sure enough, two minutes later an older-looking Harry stepped out of the wardrobe, beaming. "You know," Boggart-Harry said. "Monday is probably the most depressing day ever, let's cancel it. And what's this nonsense about not being able to own a dragon in Britain? I say we give one to anyone with a license. Oh! And we can add a dragon tax to the Pureblood tax! And how did the ghost community respond to my decree to allow Sir Nicholas into the Headless Hunt? I-"

** It was the usual morning in the Great Hall, the students chattering amongst themselves and eating the delicacies the school provided. The arrival of the owls turned the chatters to excited expectations, ready to receive the latest news of the current happenings.

A brown tawny owl carrying the latest Daily Prophet landed in front of the notorious Weasley twins who were busy concocting ideas for fresh pranks.

‚ÄúExactly! That was what I was thinking! How do you always know what I'm thinking?‚Äú

‚ÄúWe're identical! So---‚Äú

At the owl's hoot, the twins blinked at the owl before grabbing the paper and reading it.

‚ÄúOh! Hey, George look, the position for the Minister of Magic is open and to enter it's just 12 galleons! There's even no age limit!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait...really? I didn't expect that I thought---‚Äú

‚ÄúHey, hey, hey George,‚Äù Fred interrupted suddenly, his eyes staring wide-eyes at his brother, ‚ÄúRemember the prank we were thinking about?‚Äù

George stared at Fred for a minute before he immediately understood what his brother meant, ‚ÄúThat. Is. Mental. /Iloveit/‚Äù

‚ÄúBut then, who should we use as a candidate?‚Äù

Before they went on the going a long hour discussion on who could they take as their fake candidate, a familiar voice rung out.

‚ÄúThat's what I'm saying Hermione, I know its just a dream but it's really weird, it's making me quite unsettled‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry, how does a dream of Voldemort suddenly disguising himself to become a muggle woman to publish a book about your life before utterly destroying it years later by making stupid decisions and comments?‚Äù

‚ÄúHermione---‚Äú

At that, the Weasley twins' eyes shone.

------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúCome on Harry... please!‚Äù

‚ÄúFine! Fine! Fine! You two have been bugging me non-stop, fine! Just tell me what to do, and by the way, what is this even for?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust sign it‚Äù

‚ÄúVOTE FOR POTTER IF YOU WANT HIS BATH WATER!‚Äù

‚ÄúGeorge, how's the progress?‚Äù

‚ÄúEveryone in Hogsmeade completely believed it, they're even making their own posters and are sharing the joke‚Äù

‚ÄúMental! This is going to be the biggest joke ever! We should make it even grander‚Äù

‚ÄúI know exactly what you're thinking‚Äù

‚ÄúBut hey, how do we know that they actually think this is a joke and not something serious?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe wizarding world can't be that stupid, they wouldn't let a 13-year-old rule, besides, a 13-year-old can probably rule better than fudge‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, what's the worse that could happen?‚Äù

------------------------------------------------------------

‚ÄúWHAT IS THIS COMMOTION! WHAT ON MERLIN'S NAME IS THIS?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE GREAT HALL? WHY ARE THE PAINTINGS DRESSED AS POTTER?! WHY ARE THERE DANCING LIONS, CHANTING ‚ÄòPOTTER POTTER,' IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT HALL?! WHY ARE THE CANDLES DANCING AND SINGING?! WHY ARE THERE CONFETTI'S EVERYWHERE?! /FRED AND GEORGE WEASLEY!‚Äù/

‚ÄúCongratulations to the newest and youngest Minister of Magic! Harry James Potter! Let's us all give a round of applause to our newest Minister!‚Äù

Altogether, the people were chanting Potter's name in elation, faces alight for the boy to come out and give his speech. Meanwhile, somewhere backstage, Harry's left eye was twitching as he finally digested the recent turn of events.

‚ÄúFred, George, didn't you say this was just a /joke/?‚Äù

It's a real nightmare, not only does the boy not know the first thing about how the country is run, but he now had to redo the third year schedules so that Divination always matched up with Wizengamot sessions (it's not like that OWL is actually useful anyway).\\

  Young Harry liked numbers, he liked using numbers and working out the value of things. When he found out that he was a wizard and had a big pile of gold... well, he had something new to calculate. oneshot, complete, don't own.

*** He is 12 in this prompt. I love Harry and ha can be quite mature for his age, but there are way too much seemingly petty stuff he would not care about or even stop funding and 10 years from now, only extremely rich people can do potion safely because the market if flood with not thick enough cauldrons and there's incidents all the time everywhere.

St Mungo is ovewhelmed with dealing with those incidents, so much that they can't take proper care of everyone anymore and magical healthcare isn't reliable anymore.

People start dying from previously treatable but serious injuries and sickness.

People lose trust into St Mungo or simply can't afford the wait time. Scammers enter the party with fake healing spells and potions who maims more people than they heal, but they're quick, and more easily accessible.

A whole Black market develop and soon enough the aurors and DMLE as a whole are overwhelmed trying to stop it. So much that surveillance on Dark activities lessens because lack of ressources and people.

Of course they are competing criminal on this Black market, and murder, kidnapping etc happens.

TL;DR : Ignoring Percy leads to the raise of magical Pablo Escobar.

*** He's 13 and put his name on the ballot as a joke.
