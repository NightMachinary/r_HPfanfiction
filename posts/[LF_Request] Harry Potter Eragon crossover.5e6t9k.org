Any good Eragon crossovers out there?

Preferably 60k+ words

Bonus if harry is immortal

Thanks redditors.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9622073/1/To-Train-A-Dragon-Rider]] Is one of my favourite crossovers. Immortal harry, 200k words.

Harry/arya and it's tagging eragon/nasuada but so far the latter pairing is hinted but not fully materialised.
