Like, the hover charm doesn't need a spell to stop levitating something, you just let it drop. Why can't you just let the light turn off?


** I guess we could think of Lumos like a light switch, and the Hover Charm as holding something with your hand. Lumos just doesn't turn off on its own, just as a light in your house wouldn't. It would be like Transfiguration. It doesn't turn off/change until you tell it to. But with the Hover Charm, like holding up something up, you just have to stop putting in effort.

**** But a lot of minor jinxes and charms can be cancelled with Finite Incantatem, so would those also be categorized as a SET/STATIC? If so, then why would Nox be needed ? Also, wouldn't cutting of the flow of magic or dropping the wand also turn off Lumos ? If not, then we could assume that when you cast Lumos, you creat a pseudo-battery made of magic to enable the wand being lit, so it would make sense that eventually the spell would end. Or am I talking out of my ass? Kinda confused here.

****** Yeah, I had that thought as well. I'd assume that yes, you could, but the thing is, is Finite a straight line spell or is it (to use gaming terms) point-and-click targetable spell, instead of a skillshot with chance to miss? If so, does that mean that for it to have an effect you have to hit the Finite on the person casting Lumos or on the wand that was used to cast it in the first place?

** Lumos is unusual in that it doesn't cast a spell somewhere else- it merely activates light at the tip of the wand itself. It's like a different function than spellcasting; something that a wand does all on its own.

This also explains how Harry could get his wand to light up from across an alley. The wand is used to getting instructions from him, and in that case there was no ambiguity about what he wanted.

But there may be variations on hover charms that keep objects suspended even when the caster's wand isn't on them. We know there are at least two hover charms - "Wingardium Leviosa" and "Mobili-" (we see mobilicorpus and mobiliarbus in POA).

**** Well, sure, it can work that way. To be honest, we've no guarantee that the Lumos spell /doesn't/ turn itself off if given sufficient time. Every in-book example is short term; the caster no longer needs the light so they extinguish it. It's a simple spell; there's every chance that, even for an eleven year old, casting it pushes enough energy into the spell that it takes quite a while to run out, but no one ever needs to keep their wand lit for that long so there's a countercharm for it.

Try finding instances of people levitating heavier objects, much less for long durations. Crouch Jr. confirmed that spells need a certain amount of power to work, so we know magical power is finite and develops over maturation. And conjured objects don't last forever, they fade with time. Aguamenti does not last indefinitely. Nor did I say it transferred water, i said it conjured water.

Matter isn't created from nothing though, you're using magic to make it. That's why even Vanished objects aren't truly annihilated. They dispersed into everything, according to McGonagall.

******** You're making the assumption that magic is a form of energy, and finite at that. Unless you're going to follow through with the claim that Harry Potter is in fact some extremely powerful simulation, then neither Felix Felicis, prophecy, nor souls and the Ressurection Stone work. All of them require something beyond a form of energy to work, an ability to manipulate multiple objects at once, akin to a simulation.

And it's not magical power that grows with age, but rather ability to manipulate magic that seems to increase with age.

Magical power does grow with age, that's how we know it's finite. Crouch Jr. explains that 4th year students can't use the Killing Curse because "it requires a large amount of power. I doubt I'd get so much as a nosebleed if you all said the words" (paraphrase).

*********** How am I ignoring the point? Crouch explicitly cleared up this issue, magic power grows with age meaning no magic is infinite, nor is the capacity to use it. All magic uses some kind of energy, so I don't really see what the issue is; we aren't told how most magics work, we are just told what they do not how they do it. They use energy to make one lucky (though this is never shown to be absolute), temporarily return a soul as a sort of ghost, brief vision of a possible future. These are all limited things. Nothing about these are infinite nor require a simulation... not sure why you think that's the only possibility.

********** I think you're confusing what Crouch means by a powerful bit of magic. He's not talking about a large /volume/ of magic, but powerful intent. We learn this when Harry tries to use Cruciatus on Bellatrix after Sirius's death. From Order of the Phoenix, ch 36

#+begin_quote
  Hatred rose in Harry such as he had never known before. He flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed “Crucio!”\\
  Bellatrix screamed. The spell had knocked her off her feet, but she did not writhe and shriek with pain as Neville had --- she was already on her feet again, breathless, no longer laughing. Harry dodged behind the golden fountain again --- her counterspell hit the head of the handsome wizard, which was blown off and landed twenty feet away, gouging long scratches into the wooden floor.\\
  “Never used an Unforgivable Curse before, have you, boy?” she yelled. She had abandoned her baby voice now. “You need to mean them, Potter! You need to really want to cause pain --- to enjoy it --- righteous anger won't hurt me for long --- I'll show you how it is done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson ---”
#+end_quote

Harry's Cruciatus fails, not because his magic is insufficient, but because he lacks the intent needed to perform it correctly. Note that she doesn't specify that the Cruciatus uniquely requires this powerful magic behind it. We see the same thing again in the climax of Half Blood Prince, where Snape requires a moment to generate the hate necessary to perform Avada Kedavra.

#+begin_quote
  Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.\\
  Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.\\
  “Severus ... please ...”\\
  Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore. “Avada Kedavra!”

It at the very least suggests that one's magic has a certain level of strength that bars what spells one can do.

You'd think so, except for the fact that:

/‘But for heaven's sake -- you're wizards! You can do magic! Surely you can sort out -- well -- anything!' Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as he said kindly, ‘The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.' (HBP, Ch.1, p.24)/

Almost all HP magic can be countered with other magic, save one or two spells. Education and other factors aside, every in-universe problem becomes more difficult when faced with Jinxes that are specifically intended to thwart your attempts.

********* I don't see how this addresses what I said at all. I was referring to the fact that magic has limits, ergo isn't infinite.

Consider the exchange you quoted. It betrays a misunderstanding of magic (that was a Muggle he was talking to), because by that point we had been made well aware that magic can't do anything one wants. From resurrection to food conjuration, we see limits to magic because it and it's capabilities have to taper off at some level. When I said that infinite magic would make all problems easy to solve, these are the sorts of things I meant. Or heck, why not kill a Horcrux with a simple offensive spell that has been made infinitely powerful? But that would make the whole Horcrux business a non-issue.

** The Wand-Lighting Charm isn't like a magical flashlight, it's more like turning your wand into a magical torch (of the burning stick variety, not the British English term for a flashlight). In essence, the light at the tip of your wand is closer to a magical flame than it is a light bulb. Casting it improperly can actually set your wand on fire, and even a proper /Lumos/ is warm. Like a torch, once it's lit, you don't really need to do anything else. The Wand-Extinguishing Charm just puts it out.

** My two cents (i.e. the following is my headcanon):

The first spells taught to students are extremely simply, and are intended to teach them by experience how to do certain things instinctively.

For example, the Lumos spell, once cast, requires a small, constant stream of magic to maintain. However, to a beginner, it is not necessarily clear or easy how to end a spell.

Lumos is easy to cast, and has a low mana cost, and Nox is not really a spell at all - it merely acts to end the supply of magic to the currently-on spell. Practice with it allows the magical to do that for any spell without requiring a spell-action at all.
