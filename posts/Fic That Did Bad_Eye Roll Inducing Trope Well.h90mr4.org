At this point, with the size and the age of this fandom, there's a fairly big set of tropes, motifs, and nonsense that we all know and joke about seeing in fic.

Manipulative/Evil Dumbledore, Lord Hadrian Potter, Inheritance Tests, Marriage Contracts, Super Savvy Slytherins, Extra Powers!Harry, Turned Into A Girl!Harry, Easily Befriended Goblins, etc. Too many to list, but y'know what I'm talking about.

Have any of y'all found any such fics that did one or more of these things well? Not all of them, perhaps, but something that managed to take one of the old fandom chestnuts and spruce it up a good bit. I'm always interested to see fic that takes nonsense and makes it good.


** linkffn(Albus and Harry's World Trip) kind of double subverts the easily befriended goblins trope. In that particular fanfic, Goblins are more like humans than most wizards believe, and a lot of those beliefs are based on misunderstandings(Like the concept of ownership of goblin-made items is actually the result of a wizard overhearing a joke and misunderstanding it, and goblins not being above exploiting that misconception with wizards that look down on them

Also, Harry learns extra powers, but mostly because he's told to do something and /not/ told it's impossible.

  After defeating the basilisk, Harry is expelled for his efforts. Dumbledore was unable to get his job back as Headmaster. The two set off on a trip together around the world, where Harry will discover the benefits of being the only student of a brilliant former Headmaster who no longer feels the need to avoid sharing information.

** linkffn(Subversion by Myricle) is really well written and puts a twist on the Slytherins and manipulative Dumbledore tropes.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived) is simultaneously the best WBWL and different school fic out there. It doesn't subvert any tropes, just executes them all really well and creates some more.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** linkffn(A Dramatic Reading) is famous for actually wringing a decent fic out of the tired old "characters read the books" format.

linkffn(Dementors by Myranya) doesn't execute the setup of the old "hero is betrayed and sent to Azkaban" premise very gracefully, but what happens /once/ Hermione gets there is quite unexpected, and fascinating --- namely, the story turns into an exploration of the Dementors and their culture, considered as a fundamentally inhuman, but not necessarily evil race.

linkffn(Harry in the Vaults of Stone), though tragically unfinished, is a really fun, non-Robstian take on a Goblin-raised Harry.

*** /blinks/ I had no idea 'Characters read the books' was a tired old format. Until just now, the only one I'd encountered was /A Little Light Reading/. And here I was thinking I'd do a fic of Snape, Bellatrix, Lupin, and Sirius getting the books while at Hogwarts and their reactions. Good to know that that plot's stupid and boring now, thanks! And thanks for the recs as well!

EDIT: Oh, also, what's Robstian mean?

**** RobSt is someone who writes a lot of fanfics that use most of the above “tired tropes”(helpful goblins, love potions, manipulative Dumbledore, etc), and is especially heavy on bashing Dumbledore and the Weasleys(he's supposed to be manipulative, but keeps on just being a bullheaded and forceful idiot).

As a result, he tends to be a divisive figure, to the point where suggesting anything he writes typically gets a negative response.

**** Reading the Books used to be a much more common trope but I think ffn purged them at some point (maybe for straying too close to copyright violation? I don't know). Not sure why A Dramatic Reading survived, maybe it was posted after the purges.

**** Oh, the plot's /not/ stupid and boring! As /A Dramatic Reading/ demonstrates, it can be done quite well. It's just that most of the time the execution is stupid and boring. Especially provided you educate yourself on the usual failings of these stories, I'd be quite interested to read your story, especially as that is a very unusual roster of characters to be doing the reading.

***** Fair enough! Know of any of the bad ones by name, or care to summarize, so I can familiarize myself with the usual failings?

As for the roster, well, /A Little Light Reading/ uses the situation by having Snape get an unfinished copy of the first book partway through the first year, and having him have a realization of both the Dursley's abuse and what an ass and a bully he's allowed himself to become. So I rather thought that taking that, rewinding the clock to when it would most matter, and having it be used to 'scare straight' Bellatrix, Snape, and Sirius with Lupin as the straight man as it were could present some interesting options.

****** Ah, I see! You're picturing the books materializing during the First War/before the First War? That's definitely novel territory as far as I know. The usual flaws are that these end up being empty /How It Should Have Ended/esque exercise where the author's OOC versions of the canon characters make easy jabs at canon. Using the books as unlikely omens of a potential /future/, and focusing the story on the material consequences thereof, already sidesteps most of these issues.
