** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3953548/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-BoyWhoLived][Harry Potter and the BoyWhoLived]] is pretty good, has a fairly badass Harry.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]] has that exact entrance, except it's Harry and Sirius, not Harry and Blaise.
