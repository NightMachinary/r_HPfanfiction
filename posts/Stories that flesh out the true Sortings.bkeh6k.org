  The Sorting Hat (or Brian to his friends) has had enough of being told by Albus Too-Many-Names Dumbledore exactly how certain new students should be sorted. For once, he's going to take matters into his own, um, hands? The incoming class of 1991 isn't going to know what hit them. Get ready for a Sorting like no other! One Shot.

** Well, I happen to be writing such a fic. I'm not too far into it, yet, but I'm still working on it and have every intention of seeing it through.

  The houses of Hogwarts are growing stagnant, and a certain sentient Hat is dismayed over this turn of events. It decides to take matters into its own hands, taking advantage of several obscure rules to sort students where the Hat wants them, not where heredity or their own desires want them to be. The result? A mess that gradually pulls the student body into utter chaos.

** Not exactly the same, but the [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/704082][Switchverse]] does pretty well at changing up the houses (Fred and George dunk a Confunding potion on the Sorting Hat and it all goes haywire from there). It only goes to year three, but it still feels fleshed out at how the changed houses still work for the characters.
