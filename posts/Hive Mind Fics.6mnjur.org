Where are the hive minds, the conglomerate consciousnesses, the creepy extreme soul bond, etc?

Where are the fics involving a protagonist who is one mind with multiple bodies rather than a single person?


** *Harry Potter*

I remember house elves having a hivemind in something, and I think Harry could connect to it, but I can't remember the name of it.

Found one! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11373351/1/][/Warning: Past Soul Bind Performance Not Indicative of Future Prophets/]] Not the one I was thinking of, admittedly.

*Crossovers*

linkffn(Fate's Gamble by Lupine Horror) Type-Moon crossover. It's more heavily featured in the sequel. Harry is a hivemind with himself and has multiple bodies. It makes sense. I promise.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Swarm by Beyogi) Starcraft crossover. Zerg.

*Non-HP*

linkffn(Transcendent Humanity by Solaris242) HFY Mass Effect. Technological hivemind.

linkffn(Biomass Effect by Beastrider9) Mass Effect/Prototype. Biotechnology and a hivemind.

linkffn(Enemy Returned by Palladius) Mass Effect/X-COM. Chapter 8 describes an artificial hivemind.

  Harry is fed up with watching memories about Voldemort in Dumbledores pensieve. Watching movies in holographic quality doesn't help him survive whatever the Dark Lord has planned next. Looking for help, Harry stumbles into the Room of Requirement, finding a mysterious book about summoning rituals... The Zerg are a mighty help indeed, but this help doesn't come cheap. Please R&R.

  Humanity never developed FTL. The Prothean archives contained no technology, no Element Zero, just a warning. Isolated from the rest of the galaxy for two thousand years, restricted to their only system, how will humanity have changed when they first meet the Turians? AU, alternate history of humanity and First Contact.

  When Zelretch conducts an experiment and the being known to all as Fate intervenes Harry Potter's life is changed irrevocably. Now being raised by those who don't fit the definition of 'Normal' it is a very different Harry that is unleashed on the world. Or is it worlds? Disclaimer: This is fan fiction, I only own the plot.

  All life on Earth had been consumed by Blacklight. With no Biomass to feed on, Blacklight had to evolve, adapt, and grow. Now a collective Council of Aliens discovers the existence of such a life form. How do the aliens see a form of life that is viral, how they deal with it, what are the consequences to the galaxy of such a race existing at all.
