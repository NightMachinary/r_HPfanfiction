Keeping in mind that I would much prefer not to be judged, are there any romantic Parvati/Padma fics out there?

Everyone is judged. Most just don't speak up about it.

But no, I have no idea about any fics with this pairing. Have you tried Scryer?

EDIT: Only found threesomes, not just the twins. if you want.

** Well, I seatched that as a pairing at FFN, and got 4 results. Longest was 1k+ long. One was in Polish.

I then searched as not a pairing because some people don't list it. There are only 218 fics on FFN that have both as characters. Only one is over40k words, and that is a Harry/Padma/Parvati fic.

When it comes to FFN, think you're out of luck. Since I can't find it within me to give enough of a fuck to deal with AO3's tagging system, can't help you there.

*** Thank for the help. You'd think there would be more, right? Presumably attractive twin sisters would have be an interest subject for a fic.

** Linkao3(Swung by Serafim) has a bit of Ron/Padma/Parvati but it's Snape-centric and not very shippy besides.

  In 1993, Gilderoy Lockhart points a stolen wand at Harry Potter and Ron Weasley with the intent to Obliviate them.The wand doesn't backfire. Gilderoy's "discovery" of the Chamber of Secrets is a short-term success.Other consequences are not short-term at all.
