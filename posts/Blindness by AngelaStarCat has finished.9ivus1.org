** Does anyone feel like this story kinda forgot what it was about? I think the last chapter I've read was 36 and I'm pretty surprised that it's finished now, but I don't even remember properly what was going on. Just a bit all over the place.

** I stopped following that story around the time the Afterlife stuff started (I simply could not keep rooting for a Harry who thought that nigh-oblivion afterlife was a /good/ thing to strive towards), but if you're fine with that, yeah, that was a nice, competently-told story with creative worldbuilding.

**** Because near oblivion is a pretty shitty afterlife, all things considered. You could have heaven, or the infamous 72 virgins.

** I've been a massive fan of the premise and the execution of how Angela handled the disability/ability she gave Harry. The way she conveyed his "sight" was incredibly novel and interesting to read. The H/Hr relationship had a nice, slow build up and felt genuine. The exploration as to the nature of the Hallows was also very unique and intriguing to ponder.

Though I have to agree that the story did seem to get away from itself after a while. I'm not adverse to powerful!Harry fics, and I believe that at first this fic handled that quite well, but after a while Harry became less and less human and sympathetic, which, while it ultimately makes perfect sense and even seems fitting and logical given the progression of the nature of his abilities and the depths they go to, in the end made the story a bit harder to enjoy. Thankfully Angela still left plenty of humanity in his behavior by the end, particularly in regards to his interactions with Hermione, but I'll admit I was put off by the borderline nihilistic sentiments Harry was beginning to express.

The author's note at the end made it clear that Angela's had a very, very rough time and I'm sure that impacted the story to some degree. So rather than simply whine about the tonal shift or the somewhat unsatisfying ending (though she did express a possibility of more in the future if she feels like it) I'll say thank you, AngelaStarCat, for an amazing read and for taking up your very limited time to share with us so utterly unique and wondrous a story!

Honestly, I thought the author was actually going for this specifically, specially with Harry collecting the Hallows. He's becoming OP, not in a cool badass way but in a scary creepy way. He's slowly transcending humanity, becoming some sort of death god.

**** Oh, I'm in complete agreement that it was an intentional narrative decision (for the less human bit, at any rate) it's explicitly stated at the end that Harry doesn't believe himself to be human, after all, and I'd argue that his path to dehumanization became somewhat apparent once it was revealed he no longer needed to eat. I'm just saying it made the story very slightly less enjoyable for me, as I preferred it the earlier chapters when his abilities could be explained through his unique perspective into magic and it's workings.

As I said in my post I find Angela's exploration of the hallows to be incredibly fascinating and by far the most unique approach I've come across in the fandom yet. I thoroughly enjoyed all the creative lore Angela introduced or expanded on. I just found the narrative prior to the introduction of the hallows and their merging with Harry a bit more endearing.

*** In a way this depiction of OP Harry with nihilistic views made me think of Dr. Manhattan as depicted in the movie (I say this because I don't know if it was the same in the comics).

**** Ooh, I totally see the comparison! I wonder if it was an intentional source of inspiration for Angela or just the natural progression of a person who develops such an understanding of and control over the natural world.

**** Dr. Manhattan went through a nihilistic period in the graphic novel as well. I definitely recommend reading it at some point, because the arc of his epiphany on Mars is amazing. There's a lot of symbolism and connections that didn't make it into the movie.

I'm a bit surprised that you would compare Harry to Dr. Manhattan, though. Rather than feeling disconnected from humanity and caring too little, Harry's problem during the final three chapters seems to be that he cares too deeply.

** Sad to see a story that started out with such optimistic and utopian leanings end on such a note. The story I fell in love with was about Harry and Hermione's struggle in reuniting the magic and mundane world. Sure Harry can kill with a look and Voldy becomes a non-issue very quickly, but trying to change the world would have taken a different type of power. That's the story I signed up for.

But it's clear from the authors note that Angelastarcat isn't in the right space to write something like that. Its left me with the same type of disappointment that For Love Of Magic did. I think I would rather both of those fics go unfinished that have the rushed, depressive endings we got.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)
