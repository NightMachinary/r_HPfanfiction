Been out of the writing loop for a while, I miss it terribly. Give me prompts that will fit in with the Harry Potter universe.

Could be anything from a proposal, or something more specific like: "Ginny pulls a prank on Fred and George." Or Sirius can't say I love you to Marlene McKinnon or a snowstorm or Valentine's Day or whatever you can think of.

I'd appreciate as many of these kind of prompts as you can think of.

Been out of writing for way too long, need help please!


** I hate that in every Hermione going back to Tom's era, she ended up shagging him. I want something different: She killed Tom and many others that would support him in the future, but dealt Magical Britain such big losses that Grindelwald had it a lot easier. Magical Britain, reeling from the carnage she had inflicted, retreated into a shell and refused to aid others on the continent.

After WW2 began, she watched in horror how easily Beauxbaton fell to Grindelwald's horde, how Hitler's army crushed the British Expeditionary Force at Dunkirk, how RAF slowly but inadvertently lost the Battle of Britain, and how the Operation Sealion succeeded under Grindelwald's assistance. Magical Britain, under Albus Dumbledore and Armando Dippett, put up a valiant defense, but was hopelessly outnumbered. Dippett perished in the ensuing fight, although Grindelwald decided to imprison his old buddy Albus in Nurmengard and tried to persuade him to join for the time being.

Hermione managed to evacuate Fleamont Potter, Septimus Weasley, and a few others to America, where she put her hope in the Manhattan Project...

That would be my idea of time travelers achieving their primary objective easily, but causing much bigger mess down the road.

** 1. Instead of just killing her mother, the "spell that went wrong" kills both of Luna Lovegood's parents, leading her to be taken in by the Weasleys. Alternatively, an orphaned Luna is taken in by the Diggorys. (Just imagine little Luna in a Weasley sweater, or a little Luna tagging along after Cedric)

2. Ginny confronts Hermione over the latter's callous behavior towards Luna in /Order of the Phoenix./

3. Dudley's child gets a Hogwarts letter

4. Ginny invites Luna for a sleepover at the Burrow (most likely during the summer between /OotP/ and /HBP./

5. Dobby's Sacrifice spurns a revival in the SPEW movement.

6. Damocles Belby and his attempts to create the Wolfsbane Potion

Harry is extremely pleased to have Dumbledore on board, but Dumbledore seems to have an agenda of his own that involves the Deathly Hallows, Gellert Grindelwald, the statute of secrecy and world domination.

McGonagall is surprised to have her rose-colored Dumbledore glasses come off (she knows he's gay she's just never seen him so /awkward/) but she's also highly amused and wondering how much she can make by selling pensieve copies.

** While doing research on Horcruxes, Hermione discovers that destroying a Horcrux requires the death of someone else in the process. For the diary in the Chamber, it was the Basilisk. Gaunt's ring eventually killed Dumbledore.

What concerns her most at the moment is that destroying the locket didn't kill anyone yet, and the only ones near enough to count are Harry, Ron and herself.

In Final Destination fashion, more and more bizarre things are happening that could kill one of the trio, and they've yet to lose one of them to these 'accidents'.

2.  Tonks and Remus meet for the very first time in the most ridiculous of circumstances.

3.  Sirius imperius the Drusleys to be nice to Harry.

4.  Ginny's POV of Harry's 'I'm death but not really'. Instead of sadness, righteous murderous rage fills her and the Death eaters pay the price.

5.  That Ron left in DH is forgiven, yet the trust in him remains shattered for a longtime. 5 years later Harry and Ron have a fight about that.

6.  Harry accidentally got's pregnant a girl while they're both in animagus form.

7.  AU. When Dumbledore leaves Harry in the Drusley's doorstep he didn't realized that they were on holiday. So the Britiish Child services find him instead.

8.  Peter's betrayal is found out just in time. Sirius takes his time in 'rewarding' Petegrew's loyalty.

9.  Harry finds Pansy crying because Malfoy is dating 'that greengrass slut'. He does his best to comfort her.

After the First War, the public went easy on them. After this time, even vigilante justice and proscriptions should be expected. Once the torture of Hogwarts students became publicized, most people in Magical Britain would be out for blood and revenge.

** 1. Peter Pettigrew isn't guilty of betraying the Potters; though the Secret Keeper, confundus/obliviate/polyjuice/etc were used to make him believe that Sirius was the traitor, and that he had a choice of telling Voldemort the secret or being killed so that the 'traitor' Sirius would become a Secret Keeper instead.

2. After losing his wand at the Quidditch World Cup, only surviving the graveyard because Voldemort gave him his wand back, and being put at risk of having his wand snapped in a kangaroo trial, Harry decides he has a good reason to try and learn some wandless magic to protect himself. To learn, he turns to the only wandless-magic-user he knows; Dobby, who promises to /squeeze/ some wandless magic out of Harry no matter what.

3. Zelda/Harry Potter crossover; in Twilight Princess when Zant ambushes Link & Midna and takes the Fused Shadows, he goes one step further and banishes the two to another dimension using a corrupted magic mirror. Said other dimension ends up being the Harry Potter world in 3rd year, in the midst of the Sirius Black incident; how do Lupin & Sirius deal with the appearance of a third canine and the strange imp that comes with him?

4. Harry Potter is fitted with a magic-suppressing bracelet, as punishment for a crime or insanity or whatever, only having it removed temporarily for supervised classes...except the bracelet doesn't actually work on Harry, he can use magic whenever he wants, and everyone is so convinced the bracelet is working that they think the magic obviously coming from Harry is their own accidental magic or someone invisible or whatever.

Luna as a Weasley or Diggory sounds interesting as well, makes me want to write a multi-chapter though, and I'm not too good at writing multi-chapters and sticking with them. Although I suppose I could write a rather long oneshot or a twoshot if necessary.
