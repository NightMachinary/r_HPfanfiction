Im looking for some fic where it has the OC character be a regular person from our reality enter the HP reality and kind of just change the plot as he goes sinve he know whats gonna happen. Like just, "merry christmas Harry! Also Quirell has a dark lord in his turban. Just thought you should know".


** Well, as I discussed [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7bc5ef/how_would_you_survive_in_the_harry_potter_world/dpguscm/][here]] about an hour ago, that genre is called "Self Insert", in the linked comment I link multiple such SIs as well as a thread where more of them are recommended.
