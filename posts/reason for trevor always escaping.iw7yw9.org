or prompt, I dont know

anyways i had a thought that the reason trevor is always escaping is because Neville keeps licking him to get high.

or even further Uncle Algie gave Neville trevor as a bribe/with intent to get him high, so that Neville doesn't rat on all the ways Uncle Algie tried to kill him.


** I think I saw another explanation somewhere...
