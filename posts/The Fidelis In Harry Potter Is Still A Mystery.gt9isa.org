Who was the Potter's secret keeper? Was it Pettigrew? If it was, then how come everyone can see the Potter house?

How does the Fidelis actually work? In canon, it's been said to hide any place through anything as long as the secret keeper is alive. Once they die, then it unravels. However, are there hidden rules to this? If you think back, everyone can see that Potter house, but yet Peter Pettigrew is still alive. Why is this when canon says that it only unravels from the death of the secret keeper? That's why I'd like us as a community to discuss it and maybe figure out how it actually works, in canon. Is there loopholes or ways of penetrating it? Can you hide yourself without gifting someone else the responsibility? Questions like these that really just are strange. So onward we go.


** I remember a theory about how the secret was "The Potter Family lives in Godric's Hollow". After Voldemort passage, there wasn't really any family to speak of (only Harry), so with the disparition of the secret, the charm broke and the house turned visible.

** Not sure in general but I think in the case of the potter house the explosion of magic after the failed killing curse broke the charm. Also I'm not sure if the charm was placed on the house or the potters themselves. It was mentioned that unless told the secret voldy could have been looking through their front window and not seen them whether that was an exaggeration to explain the charm to someone who didnt fully understand it or not is up for debate though

** Can you mind read the secret keeper? Can you get a secret keeper of secret keeper? Can you just leave the country and live somewhere else if death is looking for you? For your child at least. What about making Dumbledore a secret keeper? Bet he backed out to keep the prophecy alive. Went straight to Potter to get the cloak to leave nothing to chances. Maybe that would give a reason for Potter to stay in the country for a while so that he can imperious Pettigrew to run to Voldy.

** What if you know that Potters live at their home and it is in Godric's hollow and exact location, like, opposite to Dumbledore house. Can you shoot a very powerful bombarda maxima and wreck it? Can you then destroy the magic in place? Can you not apparate from said house instead of taking your baby to the floor above?

Fidelis is a very strong charm. It's something on the level of time travel. Used with caution and detrimental to fictions.

Well JKR miscalculated the strength.

*** Lily couldn't disapparate, there was an anti-apparation ward up I'm pretty sure. I feel like you should be able to damage to the house itself without knowing where it is. I imagine any physical or magical attack, like a bomb or spell, that hits it would damage it. You shouldn't have to know where your target is exactly as long as you know the general area in order to affect it. Though this is purely conjecture and my own opinion.

**** I think wards can be detected. Magic leaves mark. Why place it anyway? No one can see the house anyway. Only trusted can go in. You want the people inside to die? Apparition is bread and butter stuff for duels and a Wizards way of living, pun intended.

Well if you are pretty sure then I'll see myself out.

***** I think the whole point of it was so they didn't escape and run. Doesn't matter if no one can really see the house because it doesn't change the fact Lily could've ran away.

****** Why not escape and run? I mean why not? Don't.......explode...... but why? Why? Why? Leave the country and come back with a trained and powerful wizard killer and set him loose on the freak with no nose.
