** I like the idea. I also like wikis.

Personally, I don't have time to read every fanfic that gets posted here. I save a lot of posts to go back and read later. I'd love to have some of the best of the best on the wiki. And sure, there's other sites with that, but we could divide it up so if you like mostly canon compatible fanfics, there's a section for that. AU or Fem!Harry could be another section.

*** Not the OP, but it sounds like people could create pages and add links to good fanfics that they've read/recommend. I'm assuming it would be category based or something, like all good fanfics for dramione goes on one page, all good fanfics for evil Harry go on another page, etc.

****** We could also compile a list of these lists and a list of fanfiction websites/dedicated sites for particular ships (so like three sections on our wiki: 1 - [[/r/hpfanfiction]] lists; 2 - others' lists; 3 - websites to find more fics). I've seen some of both mentioned in comments here and there, but I agree that it'd be nice to have all of this in one place and linked on the sidebar!

** Sounds interesting, but none of the subreddits I subscribe to use the wiki feature and I can't find any examples just by searching. Could you link to an example wiki?

Edit: Some more perseverance and I've found two examples. [[http://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/wiki/index][/r/asoiaf]] and [[http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/wiki/index][/r/leagueoflegends]] both have wikis, and they're both really, really ugly. I think it'd be cool to have a [[/r/HPfanfiction]] community rec site, but not using Reddit's wiki tool.

**** Oh, I'm not sure! I guess it would depend on exactly what kind of format we'd want. [[http://www.wikia.com/Wikia][Wikia]] is easy to use, but it's not really ideal in terms of format. Livejournal is a possibility, but I doubt enough people actually use LJ anymore to make it feasible. My very favorite rec format is the one used by [[http://dhr.accio.nu/][accioDHR]], but that kind of thing really looks like it'd require a lot of time and effort (and money) to set up, plus constant upkeep.

I honestly don't know. I guess Wikia is the only thing I see as a practical option at this point... but I'm sure there must be something better out there.

Edit: The more I think about it, the better Wikia looks. I'm searching for any other fan fiction rec Wikias, but there don't seem to be any, so we'd have to come up with our own system. The only big downside is that there doesn't seem to be any kind of rating system, so you couldn't sort stories from most recommended or anything like that... which is basically /the/ most important feature that a rec site needs to be useful. Without that, we might as well just not make a directory at all. There may be some kind of... I don't know, third-party rating widget that we could use, but... I don't know.

***** I feel like a rating system would be arbitrary at best, considering everyone has different tastes. If there just a list, people can scroll through the list and see what might appeal to them. Additionally, if we allow comments, people can comment about what they liked and disliked, allowing for a more nuanced system.

But yeah! An [[/r/HPFanfiction]] wikia sounds like a great idea.

****** Well, without some kind of rating system, what would a wiki do that we couldn't do just by making a list of links to all of the recs that have already been posted here and adding it to the sidebar? Anybody can comment on the threads with their thoughts. The only thing that we'd have to do is categorize links and maybe provide summaries or ratings. Making a list would certainly be easier than creating a wiki.

Plus, I think some kind of rating system is important in that you're exactly right -- everybody /does/ have different tastes, so how can we ever have a list of "good dramione fics" or "good canon-compliant fics?" Who would determine what is "good" and deserves to be on the list? If we allow any and all fics to be listed, we're guaranteed to get some wild variation in terms of quality, but if there's no way for readers to easily differentiate between shitty recs and quality recs, then the list becomes meaningless. If we choose moderators to weed out shitty recs, they're obviously going to be subjective, and there will certainly be disagreements over what deserves to be included. I'm not sure how you can address that problem without a rating system.

And I certainly agree that there should be comments! I didn't mean that we should swap comments for ratings. They're both important. No point in having a five-star rating if nobody can describe why the story's so good!

Edit: Oh, you actually made a Wikia! I have a tiny bit of experience as a Wikia mod, so I'm totally willing to help out in getting stuff set up. I've never set one up from scratch, though, so I may end up being useless. But hey! I learn fast! :D

******* Man, you're heaven-sent. Like I wrote above, I'll start editing it whenever I can, but I have limited access at work.

I think the difference between just making a list of all the links of all the recs that have been posted here is that anyone can post a rec or make a list on the wiki. Here, however, only the mods can add things to the sidebar, and I think that they're busier with the main Harry Potter subreddit to do much moderating here. This removes the problem where a list becomes inactive or is no longer updated due to a missing moderator.

I was hoping that we /would/ have various recs, but I suppose you're right about quality. I did a quick Google search, but there doesn't seem to be any way of simply placing a rating poll on the a page itself. Normally when I search for fics through lists, I check how many comments or reviews a fic has, as that's a reasonable check for quality.

Worst comes to worst, we could get a free rating applet and install it on each page?

I think that may be the best option, but it's still unfortunate that stories couldn't be sorted by that rating. One way to get around that may be to place pages in "5-star," "4-star," etc. categories and update weekly or monthly or as needed so that the categories reflect the ratings. Since it's not like there are brand new fics coming out all the time, that task shouldn't be difficult once the wiki gets on its feet. The same could also possibly be done for number of comments or something like that.
