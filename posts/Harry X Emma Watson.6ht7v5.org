idk how maybe he someone gets into real world and gets together with her? or she goes into the hp universe


** I really want this to be a thing. I know this wouldn't be a serious fic but I think it has the potential to be hilarious as all can be.

Edit:

Maybe the story could revolve around the cliche of the characters watching the movies and Harry deciding that Emma is really attractive. He then proceeds to obsess over her creating awkward situations between him, Ron and Hermione because Harry is attracted to an actor portraying Hermione.

Eventually, Harry caves and reveals himself to her in some way (maybe after deciding that some of her social work is attractive?) Crazy shenanigans than ensue

*** Oh wow, I don't know how I'd feel if my friend became obsessed with the actor who plays me in the movies. That's got potential.

** Hermione is Emma Watson's celebrity look-alike? Hogwarts is a school for magical celebrity look-alikes.

** There was a story I found once that had Daniel Radcliffe, Tom Felton, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint star as time travelers. Can't for the life of me remember the story.

  What if the world of Harry Potter WAS real . . . what if Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Tom Felton were asked by the REAL Harry, Hermione, Ron & Draco to go back and tell their younger wizard selves how to change everything?

** Wasn't there one about Emma Watson being hit by a car on the philosopher stone set, and when she woke up she really was Hermione?

Actually everything being her delusion while she was comatose?

** Reminds me of a story idea I had that I wrote down a few months ago.

"Someone starts publishing a not quite accurate version of Harry's story, and then wants to make a movie, so Harry takes on the fake name of Daniel Radcliffe and gets his own role in the movie while slowly trying to get the full truth into the script."
