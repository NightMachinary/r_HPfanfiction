Maybe a little niche but I'm interested? Especially his arrest at the end, if he talked with Dumbledore and the ministry before he escaped?

I read Remus Lupin and the Prisoner of Azkaban and loved it so any similar fics of the books from a different perspective would be good?

Any and all suggestions welcome ðŸ˜Š regardless of pairing/slash/gender etc etc etc....


** Can you provide a link to the Remus fic? I've been wanting to read something from his POV.

*** Sorry yes!!

It's really good! Almost a verbatim redo of the book but from Remus's angle with a lot of flashbacks to Marauder era. It's sad though.

They've also started a Sirius Black Goblet of Fire one which I'm on now ðŸ˜Š. Hense the request for more, I didn't realise I needed it ðŸ˜‚
