Hey there!

I am really desperate for some Triad Fics of Draco, Hermione and Harry üòÇ

I‚Äòve read a lot of stuff at AO3 and it‚Äòs my favorite pairing.

I struggle with fanfiction.net and hp.adult-fanfiction.org (uagh... I can‚Äòt find anything üòÖ)

Maybe someone can recommend a few stories - preferable longer, mature ones üòè

Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è


** I doubt I have any new ones to add, but in case you missed them:

Linkao3(Fourteen Thousand Galleons) complete

Linkao3(The Hedgehog's Dilemma by shadukiam) sadly this might be abandoned since it last updated in 2017

Linkao3(Changing Scenery by aethling) this is a Veela!Draco fic. It is still alive, although it updates sporadically.

Sorry, I don't know any more. I also enjoy this pairing. I am sorry you have been downvoted.

#+begin_quote
  Azula openly admits to her insecurities during 'The Beach' episode, setting off a chain of events that make her question everything she's ever believed in. How will this effect her going forward? Can she avoid the path of self destruction before it's too late? Slight AU. Rated T for adult themes

**** Sorry, this is the one I meant [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3911007/1/Catalyst]]

"I seem to remember telling you that I "liked blokes" yet I don't seem to remember me telling you that I stopped liking women as well." HPHGDM...SMUTSEX, Threesome, DH Compatable, not Epilogue

** There's a number of them, though by far my favorite is fourteen thousand galleons, like mentioned above :)

If you want something that's from a long time ago, you can try What a Witch Needs by Petalsoft

Also check the Facebook groups

It's a good triad :)
