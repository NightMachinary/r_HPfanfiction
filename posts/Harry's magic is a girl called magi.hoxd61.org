:END:
I have read this fanfiction a long time ago in fanfiction.net. The story starts with Harry's magic taking the form of a girl, she used to bring food when he was locked in the cupboard without food. Later on he discovers he doesn't like wands to do magic as it practically forces magi to do so.

Later he befriends Salazar Slytherin photo in the chamber of secrets and he enters into Harry's mind along with magi. He trains Hermione, Luna, Neville and another OC character in wandless magic and their experience in Hogwarts is portrayed in a different way and fun.

The story ends with them being pioneers of wandless magic which helps in restoring magic to the flora and fauna of the world.

Any help would be appreciated, thank you for the help.


** I don't remember many other details, but in this one Harry's magic is a girl called Magie. It's pretty darn weird.

  Harry must have been lonely while living at the Dursley's. What if he wished a friend and it worked? "Inquisitive, unconventional Harry. Lots of humour" like someone said. Writing gets better later on, said another. In the end H/Hr, some N/L.
