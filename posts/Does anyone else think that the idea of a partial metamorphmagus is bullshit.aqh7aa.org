In my mind your a Metaphorphmagus or your not their is no middle ground.

From what we hear about teddy Tonks he was morphing the moment he was born.


** Yes it's bullshit. How would a partial even occur? It's not like both of Tonk's parents are one, or their parent's parents. And besides, I can't think of a single story out there that actually benefits from adding the trait onto a character who doesn't normally have it.

*** I bet there's a bit of back magic somewhere in fanon that'll let you sacrifice Tonks for the desired effect. I'm not saying you Should do it, but magic is limitless in my eyes, so I'm sure it Could be done, if you were willing to pay the price. How does half your humanity sound? Half your magic? Half your sanity? Have your sense-of-self? Or maybe just Tonks' lifeblood and a crack to your soul.

Who knows what'll happen if you're experimenting with ritual magic. Didn't Pandora die while spell crafting? Maybe it'll kill you, maybe it'll drive you mad, maybe you'll lose sight in one eye. Maybe your hair will turn blue.

** I wouldn't write it myself, but I don't think it is a bad concept. I mean, Hagrid establishes that you can be part-giant and Fleur is either quarter or half Veela, so why not different levels of metamorphs? And if you want to argue that it is an ability and not a genetic trait, why would metamorphs be binary? I mean, there are various skill levels in everything. Football isn't "not playing" or "star player of Manchester United", so why would a specific magical ability be?

Canon even has partial werewolves.

*** I don't think it's a good or a bad concept, it's a nothing concept. There's nothing inherently wrong with the idea of partial metamorphmagi, it's that nobody really ever does anything with it beyond adding a little bit of flavour to a character or explaining something that happened in canon, like Harry's haircut incident.

These two are by sheer virtue of birth. A metamorph is by virtue of magic, as in it's a magical ability like Parseltongue or tha ability to become an Animagus.

Parseltongue is a magical ability, so how would a partial Parselmouth sound like? Being able to speak half sentences in the language? Being able to speak only at night, or on select days of the week?

You definitely cannot learn the language through instruction, otherwise someone like Crouch or Albus would have tried asking Harry to teach them - they're both established as polyglots.

***** I'm not sure how having a different taste for meat, and being more moody can be compared with being a partial werewolf, to be honest - there's no transformation (partial or otherwise), and no reaction to the full moon.

I mean, the moodiness is most easily explained. He was green before, a young man who thought he was playing the hero, and finds out that no glory will be found in battle, not the kind of glory he thought of, anyway. Or the fact that he and his family are in constant danger - that can make anyone have a bit shorter temper and be more stoic.

I think it's just HS being HS.

*** I don't like he idea of a quarter or half Veela because unless there is such a thing as a male Veela there would be no such thing as a full veela.

I prefer the idea that every daughter of a Veela is a Veela and that there is no such thing as a quarter or half or full Veela.

but we don't see enough of Victoire Weasley Fleur and bills Daughter to prove or disprove this.

I know its not Canon but I just find the idea more logical.

**** You still fail to explain WHY you dislike the idea of partial metamorphmagi. Why is this idea so bad? I mean, I get why Draco in leather pants sucks, or rape which turns into love and not bloody vengeance, but not what is so inherently bad in making Harry a metamorph without the "full potential". For all we know the killing curse did the damage there.

As for the half/quarter Veela thing, just assume that Veela can reproduce through mind magic with another Veela like the Asari (monogendered aliens) from Mass Effect (or some futa stuff) and regularly with non-veela, resulting in partial Veela.

***** Its mainly just the way its used like harry walks up to Tonks and is like "look what I can do" and then changes his hair or its just something that comes up on one of the terrible Goblins inheritance test and then it never relevant again.

I would love for a story were Harry changes his Hair in front of Tonks its like " That's some impressive self transfigeration kid but you aren't a metamorphmagus".(Really to me the Self transfiguration is more impressive)

In both cases its almost always irrelevant to the plot so basically chekhov's gun.

*** Generally it comes up in fanfiction because Harry regrew his hair after Petunia cut it off and someone along the way decided that Harry must therefore be a Metamorphmagus and it has been poping up in fanfiction ever since.

But because Harry dosent constantly morph like Tonks and teddy do they make him a partial Metaphorphmagus.

**** I like the idea of old wizarding families having strange or peculiar genetic traits caused by family magic gone wrong or just plain curses; the Potters have their unruly hair that always grows back in a day, the Marchbanks live incredibly long, the Dumbledores are magically gifted but with a few screws loose, Greengrasses have the blood curse but one in a generation isn't affected, Blacks are historically more prone to being Animagus but a bit insane, etc.

It's another reason for purebloods vilify the muggleborns. No family magic, no old traditions, they are sort of like wildcards when it comes to magical ability and expectations.

Because since there's not a “Harry gets a haircut” chapter in any of the books, he's never had one, natch.

If it was completely, consciously controlled by the individual, then Sleekeazy wouldn't be a thing and Hermione's hair, at least, would be a bit more manageable. I think it's a representation both of how they want to look and also their magic. Like Harry's is wild powerful, whereas Lucius Malfoy's (seems to be) controlled and refined.

I think her magic was actually keeping her more sane and when suppressed by dementors, along with the depression they cause, she went nuts. I noticed that the portrayal of her immediately after leaving Azkaban and the way she behaved after being out for a year or so are slightly different. Immediately after Azkaban, she seems completely unhinged, then as the finale approaches, she's still a nut job, but she is more level-headed and methodical. While she's totally evil, she is more in control of herself.
