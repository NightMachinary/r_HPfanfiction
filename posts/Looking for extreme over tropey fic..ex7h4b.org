:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So, I remember ages ago reading a ff about harry getting called into gringotts (sp?), and the goblins have him do an inheritance test thing.

It comes back with him being lord to like 8 houses, having billions of galleons (sp?), excessive amounts of property, having been under compusions and blocks etc placed on him by dumbledore. It was just the trope but turned up to 11.

Im looking for this fic so I can show a friend how over done the trope has gotten.

I also think it was Harry/Tom or Harry/Draco, and impretty sure i read it on AO3, though it felt like it came from wattpad...

EDIT: was found. Harry Potter and the Shadowed Light
