I'm looking for "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them" fanfiction that actually have Harry as a character, whether it be through time travel shenanigans or just Harry meeting the characters later in his life or something.

I've read linkffn(Against My Nature by Araceil) and it is the only story I've found that is well written, though I only browse ffn. Please tell me any stories that you might have found on other websites, if any.

Thank you and Happy New Year!

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.
