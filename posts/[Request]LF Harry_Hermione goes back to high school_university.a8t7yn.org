As much as I love reading Harry/Hermione adapt to living in the magical world,I want to read some fics showing them in the muggleworld with the following. 1) Not wanting to deal with his fame anymore Harry leaves the magical world to live a normal life.

2)Hermione not wanting to be the only member of her family to not have her degrees follows Harry and convinces him to go back to school with her.

4)No Slash

5)Not a lot of bashing

6)20 to 50k words

7)Pairing HHr :) Any recommendations?
