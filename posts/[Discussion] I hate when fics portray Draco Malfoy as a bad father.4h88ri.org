** While I disagree with you on Astoria, I do agree that the Malfoys are a very close-knit family. A lot of readers just don't like to think that the bad guys are people too.

Lucius and Narcissa loved their kid, perhaps /too/ much (they spoiled the shit out of him). There's zero reason beyond "he's a Death Eater/bigot, herp derp" to make Draco an abusive, especially physically abusive, parent. Dude is positively squeamish around violence, to begin with.

** If Draco Malfoy were tried in the Muggle world, he would be likely found guilty of three counts of attempted murder (Katie Bell, Horace Slughorn and Ron Weasley) and one count of murder (Albus Dumbledore). On top of that he would also be guilty of treason and potentially crimes against humanity.

The Muggle analogy is an enthusiastic SS Guard who attempted to murder several of his classmates and teachers and succeeded in killing one of them.

That he had a change of heart when things got dangerous for him does not really do much to indicate that he has the potential to become a good person. If you met someone like this in the Muggle world, even years after their crimes, you would steer clear of them.

****** This is blatantly NOT true. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duress_in_English_law#Criminal_law][Here are the rules for English law regarding duress]]

A couple of highlights:

About murder

- in the case of the most serious crimes such as murder, no threat to the defendant, however extreme, should excuse commission of the crime

About Gang Membership

- "A person may become associated with a sinister group of men with criminal objectives and coercive methods of ensuring that their lawless enterprises are carried out and thereby voluntarily expose himself to illegal compulsion, whether or not the group is or becomes a proscribed organisation... if a person voluntarily exposes and submits himself, as the appellant did, to illegal compulsion, he cannot rely on the duress to which he has voluntarily exposed himself as an excuse either in respect of the crimes he commits against his will or in respect of his continued but unwilling association with those capable of exercising upon him the duress which he calls in aid."

So no, Draco Malfoy would not be able to use duress as a defense under English law.

**** It's entirely possible. The issue is causation: did Draco cause Dumbledore's death?

The law splits this into two categories: factual causation and legal causation.

The issue of factual causation is definitely fulfilled in this case. It follows the "but for" test: but for Draco's actions, would Dumbledore have died? If the answer is "no" then Draco factually caused Dumbledore's death. And in this case the answer is no.

The issue of legal causation places limits so that factual causes that are too remote from the result do not result in legal culpability. For something to be a legal cause it must be a significant contribution to the result, or an operating and substantial cause. In this case Draco Malfoy's lawyers would argue "novus actus interveniens" - that the death was caused by an intervening third party i.e. Snape. This third party act breaks the chain of causation from Draco's actions to Dumbledore's death. However, there's an exception to the novus actus interveniens argument: where the third party's act was foreseeable, it does not break the chain of causation. Draco Malfoy knew that Snape had sworn an unbreakable vow to complete his mission. He also knew that there were plenty of Death Eaters in the castle to finish the job for him. So it was entirely foreseeable that his actions would allow one of them, including Snape, to complete the course of events he initiated.

The other issue is that of intent: did Draco Malfoy intend to kill Dumbledore? The meaning of intent here is not synonymous with motive but rather with deliberate action. It's not about whether Draco wanted Dumbledore to die, it's about whether he deliberately took acts to cause Dumbledore's death. Arguably he had intent at the start of the course of events, when he let the Death Eaters into the castle, but lost his intent before Dumbledore died. The law has something to say about this in the doctrine of /continuing intent/ - where having intent to kill at one point in a course of events covers that entire course of events as a single transaction. It is not strictly necessary for the intent to kill and the death to coincide in time if they're part of the same course of events.

I mean, Lucius Malfoy was an unrepentant bigot who wanted to wipe out an entire group of people but he didn't go around thrashing his son.

Being evil doesn't mean you have to be every kind of evil at once. That's the sort of over-the-top thing that leads to baby-eating villains who are more boring than scary.

And if you're going to judge people for the rest of their lives for something they did at sixteen, Dumbledore's hands are hardly squeaky clean either. Infact, I always thought the reason Dumbledore was so adamant on not punishing Draco was /because/ their situations were similar: they both got swept up in philosophies of charismatic dark lords, they both disliked muggles (albeit for different reasons) and they both desired power and glory. At least Draco always prioritized family above all, something that Dumbledore cannot claim.

In the UK, euthanasia is not legal, and you cannot assent to it. Even if it was, Malfoy was not aware of it, so it doesn't affect determining he had the intent to commit murder.

I don't think Draco would be as an indulgent a father as Lucius, but I definitely think he'd do his best to raise Scorpius to be a better man than him in every respect, and he'd do his best the whole way through to make sure that Scorpius was happy.

I think that's the thing about Draco - we don't truly see him redeemed in the story, but just as Narcissa&Lucius' redeeming features are in their devotion to family, I feel his redemption would be in raising his son to fit more into the modern world than he was himself.

I think redemption via decent parenting is much more in character (and interesting!) for Draco than him being portrayed as an awful father. I don't think he'd be perfect- maybe toeing around things his own father says at family dinners, or maybe being distant with regards to explaining his past mistakes- but he would try.

I think [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5760301/1/A-Better-World][this fic]] is probably one of my favorite takes on "Draco as a parent," though it... really only shows him dealing with other people's kids, haha. But it does show character growth and how much he cares for Scorpius, at the very least.

There's every chance he would be a good dad, but just a good a chance that he would be a shit one. People with better childhoods than Draco have grown up to be shitty parents.

Draco's parents spoilt him nearly to death, which could affect his parenting in alot of different ways. They taught him he was more important than everyone else, which could very well lead him valuing himself over his kid, or it might have taught him that parents are supposed to treat their child like they're the king of the world. What he would do is up for debate.

************ There is nothing "wrong" per se with them. Its just that naming your child like that is like painting a target on their back. Its in the same category as the name "North" for Kanye Wests child. You pity the child and question the sanity of the parent.

And yes, Draco, Scorpius and Sirius aren't the only poor sods with horrible names in this universe.

  Theres also the animal, but I can't see any sort of positive aspect from that. A ugly, poisonous bug

A scorpion isn't actually a bug, it's an arachnid.

  He even married a woman who doesn't believe in pureblood superiority.

That is 100% fanon... and Pottermore whitewashing bullshit.

#+begin_quote
  Obviously, this was not explored in the books.
#+end_quote

Yes, it was. Its actually part of the reason Dumbledore let himself be murdered in HBP.

#+begin_quote
  Don't you think Draco would have learned from his experiences?
#+end_quote

No, actually I don't, given experience with similar people. Yes, he may have a mental scar for life, but eventually he would find a way to wash himself free of guilt and let others have all of it. People like Malfoy can't shoulder burdens.

If anything I would expect Scorpius to be as spoiled as his father was.
