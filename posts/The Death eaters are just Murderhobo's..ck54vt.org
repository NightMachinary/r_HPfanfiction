No matter the situation (in canon), the first thought that seemingly springs to mind is violence. The Death Eathers are just a group of Murderhobo DnD pc's.


** They can't be murderhobos if they have established homes. The thing about murderhobos is that they show up, kill whoever they feel like, and then leave to the next adventure, never having to deal with the consequences of their actions.

*** True. In my defense, its 5 am right now for me, and about 3 am when i posted. It was a thought, not necessarily a well thought out thought though.

** In fanfiction, you can make them whatever you need them to be. Faceless NPCs who just spam the killing curse, or nuanced characters with families and thought-provoking motivations.

*** Thought provoking motivations for genocide and deporting an entire race? I know that the Death Eaters are a carbon copy of the Nazis, but unlike with the Nazis there had been no Versailles for the purebloods, no street fighting between revolutionaries for over a decade and so on. The Nazis rose because everyone was fed up with the open warfare with the Communists, the economic crisis and a series of failed governments as well as the "unfair" peace treaty forced upon their country.

The magical world lacks that nuance and retconning a muggleborn revolutionary group as well as government hardships of the worst order in just to flesh out the Death Eaters feels very cheap since canonically, they are little more than a terrorist group.

**** You could look on it another way

the muggleborns are immigrants, every year more and more Muggleborns enter wizarding society and bring muggle culture with them while wizarding culture slowly errodes

But Jk stuck with generic bad guys

***** There is no pureblood culture beyond war crimes, inbreeding and genocide in canon. The Wizengamot is not hereditary, the whole ancient and noble houses thing is one line which might or might not be a joke from Sirius and even the sacred 28 thing is a retcon.

Also, having a different culture is no reason to murder someone and exterminate his entire people.

You know how you could double the number of people raised in pureblood culture? Procreate with Muggles, take the children and raise them without Muggle influences. Sperm banks are a thing, as are surrogate mothers.

****** I never said those things, I am saying Jk rowling wanted simple black and white story which is fine

realistically wizards have been separated from muggles for hundreds of years

australia has been apart from britan far less, and australian culture and attitudes are different from british culture and attitudes which are different from american culture and attitudes

Lets be honest, Jk is an amazing story teller but she is a shitty world builder

** Not all of them. Lucius and I am sure some of the others (maybe Snape and Regulus when they were still DE) went about achieving their goals in a less violent, more manipulative manner.

*** In canon, Regulus had no issues with Voldemort or his methods until he mistreated Kreacher. And even then it was a personal issue, not a sudden change of heart regarding the Muggleborn.

**** Irrelevant, I was just saying they did not appear to be the Fenrir/Bellatrix violent types, but rather more subtle, using money or power to influence rather than torture and murder.

***** Snape almost killed James with Sectumsepra in "worst memory". Only bad aim prevented that as the spell only nicked him. And Regulus is a total unknown.

****** I doubt he would have killed him. And he could have tried again, it's not like he only knew the spell in that second. It's also not because he enjoyed torturing people. We don't know much about Regulus, but I only said Snape and Regulus were PERHAPS examples, not definitely. He sacrificed himself for a house elf and was a spoilt teenager, I doubt he tortured people in his free time.

******* Regulus is kind of like a young Draco he got told all his life about the glory of the Voldemort cause hen he saw the reality of it, Sirius black was lucky he got sorted into gryffindor as it allowed him to get good influences and support into his life

Regulus at home was surrounded by people who believed in Voldemort cause and at school he was as well

I do think regulus was a bit braver then a young draco as regulus actually attempted to go against voldemort

*** Honestly, in my head, the inner circle arent even considered DE's. Like, I know they ARE, but I consider the death eaters to be more the rank and file. ( And Bellatrix, who actually was the first to receive the prestigious title of Murderhobo Most Foule in my mental designations, and really kicked this whole crazy train off)
