  What if Harry had been rescued from the Dursleys at age six and raised as the heir of the Noble and Most Ancient, etc.? This is the story of Aries Sirius Black. AU. Part I complete. Part II in progress.

**** Thank you for your recommendation! I tried to read this story but didn't get into it very far awhile back. I'll get on to attacking it now though, seeing as Harry's close to the Malfoys.

** There was one where malfoy and potter were students at durmstrang and then ran when luscious, who had adopted harry, tried to sacrifice him. They end up at hogwarts and i basically stopped reading five pages in cuz the premise was shit to me. But maybe someone else knows the name.

*** I don't recall reading this story before. Your description of the story leads to me not finding the story appealing, but if someone knows the title, I'll try it.
