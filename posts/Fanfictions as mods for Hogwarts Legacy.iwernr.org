I'm a Skyrim modder, making quest and new lands mods. Such mods are basically fanfiction in video game form.

Having spent so long reading Harry Potter fanfics, I can only hope the new Hogwarts Legacy game will be heavily moddable, so that we can finally bring all that fanfiction creativity to a video game.


** I think there will be very little chance of modding being catered to in a game this costly, from this dev team or publisher. GAAS seems to be the way these larger IP based games are headed and making your own stuff directly inhibits the publisher's ability to sell that same stuff to you.

I can still be hopeful and indeed a love the idea, I just don't see it happening.

Here's a single player RPG GAAS: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(2020_video_game][Avengers (2020)]]). Or as I like to call it: ‚Ç≥¬•‚Ç¨‚Ç¶‚Ç≤¬£∆í$.

There's been no confirmation that HL will have any online features.

****** oof. I stopped paying attention to the game once I heard about microtransactions.

There are lots of single player GAAS. +The new God of War+, Assassin's Creed, MGSV (and survive), Middle Earth: Shadow of War.

******* I can't speak for the last three games, since I haven't played them, but the new God of War game is definitely not a game as a service.

Games as a service are games that have regular monetized content updates. God of War 4 doesn't have any paid dlc or microtransactions.

God of War 4 did introduce rpg mechanics but that doesn't make it a GaaS.

******* Bro. You do not know what a GAAS game is.

Assassin's Creed you could consider a GAAS but even that is tenuous, all the quest and content updates are free and the microtransactions are a very tiny part of the game that give you cosmetics and xp skips, but they're not really incentivized at all.

MGSV and Shadow of War are just not Games as a service at all, shadow of war had completely useless microtransactions that were removed from the game entirely after launch and there are no regular updates like a GAAS game, just two expansions.

Hogwarts Legacy is being developed by Avalanche who haven't made a GAAS game ever, maybe they're starting now but there's nothing to indicate it whatsoever.

**** So with modding, it doesn't have to stay limited to HP world, and if base gameplay elements are good, people will come. E.g. Skyrim has mods to add gunfights and robots, ESO brought in lot of non-elder scrolls fans to the game/world

As to non-gamers, when you can explore hogwarts in person, and even see fan content based on their favourite, say, fanfiction, they're bound to try it. E.g. order of phoenix wasn't a great game but majority of it's appeal was that you could experience hogwarts and explore it's secrets in a way

****** Oh, they'll absolutely make bank, but they're missing out on legions of people buying a PS5 with this as their core reason. Granted it's the case with an exclusive on any big title, but HP has a bit bigger of a fanbase then the average series.

******* It was never funded by Sony at all tho, they just hosted the reveal. Plus, they're launching with the Spider-Man, and you couldn't have a better IP than Marvel to launch with. They also have their own catalog of very popular exclusive games with sequels coming up.

Although considering the age of students in Hogwarts, this particular game should probably be an exception to the rule.
