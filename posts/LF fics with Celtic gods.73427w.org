I'm looking for fics that include Celtic mythology, any of the branches are fine and any level of similarity to the original myths. Some 'various gods fight over the hero' action might be nice, though preferably no 'harry is secretly a god and is uber-powerful now'.

** I have a little bit of Celtic Mythology in a couple of stories. It's not super heavy, so it might not be quite what you're looking for.

  Harry is the younger brother of the Boy Who Lived and is a little strange. He hears voices no one else can hear, he knows things no one else should know and he's just this side of crazy. Oh, and everyone thinks he's a squib. When it comes to Harry, however, all bets are off and nothing is entirely certain.

** I swear there was a fic with a blind, necromancer/Peverell-connected? type Harry that had gods, and I think they were Celtic, though they might've been from some other pantheon. The fic's picture on ffnet was of Harry wearing sunglasses. Can't find it right now for the life of me, though I swore I saw it a while ago.
