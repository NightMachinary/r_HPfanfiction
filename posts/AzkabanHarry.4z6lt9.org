Looking for stories where Harry goes to Azkaban. I really don't care what happens next. Preferably 100k+ words.


** Seeing the title, I initially thought you meant a fic where Harry /became/ Azkaban. As in, his mind or soul was detached from his body, and possessed the building of Azkaban, overlooking the inmates, and owning the dementors.

Sounds like it could be cool.

*** I always like the fics where after being released, he goes batshit insane and fucks the entire world up. Nightmare Man and its prequel do a lovely job of bringing psycho Harry to our computer screens.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

The only thing about this story is it was maybe two chapters short of completion and the author hasn't touched it in a year and a half. Still a great read.

I like this fic. It's a one shot but it's a good one shot.

Edit: sorry didn't read your 100k preferable word count. I'll leave it up, maybe someone else is interested.
