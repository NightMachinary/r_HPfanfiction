:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
... And there's one or multiple scenes where the girl (which could be the MC, I don't recall) puts a rubber band on his D. You know, to extend the art.

I don't honest know if this was a crossover, or if it was HP or even if it wasn't even from HP.

I do think it was maybe a femHarry xover, but I can't be sure. It was a longer fic, def multi-chapter, maybe 30k+

Sorry for not having more info, but this is driving me crazy. I don't even care about it from the smut perspective, I just NEED to know to satisfy my mind.
