:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I remember that harry got pulled from his world into another, the journey left him badly scarred, and he became the divination teacher, only he managed to be way better that trelawney. That's literally all I remember.

Anyone know it and can link it??


** I read that before, it was a good fanfic. I believe this is the one you are looking for...

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP
