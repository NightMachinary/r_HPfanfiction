Being Master of Death, Harry Potter comes back from the dead in the battle of Hogwarts. He comes back as a living person, not a ghost...but suppose there is still a side effect normally felt only by ghosts? That he is still tied to his place of death, i.e. Hogwarts (including the Forbidden Forest). Disregarding the epilogue, it could take a while to notice after book 7 ends!

I wasn't sure about the "place of death" constraint since obviously the Grey Lady and Bloody Baron were in Albania not Hogwarts, but according to Pottermore, the idea of having to haunt a fixed location could fit the canon. I suppose one would just make it either the most significant location, or a magic-users' location one has lived in.

Clearly it's mostly a crack fic idea, but serious fics about it could be quite good. Any recs? If not, /would/ anyone write a story with this prompt? Or loosen it so that he just has to spend a lot of time at Hogwarts and keeps getting drawn back?

Failing that, other side effects of having died and come back living?
