**** You might have noticed that nukes weren't actually dropped on major cities during the Cold War. That's because the goal was never to "fuck everything" but only to threaten to. Look up nuclear brinkmanship.

You want your enemy to know that you can match their weapons capabilities (mutually assured destruction) and you want to keep your technological advances secret for as long as you can while also collecting intelligence to make sure they haven't surpassed your capabilities (arms race and espionage.)

So I stand by the original statement. Magic would be better applied in espionage than bombing.

Also, what's stopping him from transfiguring iron into uranium U235and building his own bomb (rather difficult, but should be doable with enough trial and error) or simply creating a dirty bomb? You might be able to defend the storage sites against wizards, but there are so many ways how they could get around it that actually bothering to construct any defences seems pointless.

This is a fantasy. Outside of very obviously problematic times (The Voldemort Wars), muggleborns didn't have any reason to abandon the wizarding world. Hell Wizarding UK, which seems to be more conservative than other magical societies, had a Muggleborn Minister of Magic a few decades before the start of the series. There was no glass ceiling mentioned for them in workplaces the way we see in real life so again they've no reason to leave (especially since the Muggle world would inescapably treat them as bad or worse as blood supremacists do).

In Jim Crow, African Americans couldn't become president, yet just a decade or so before Voldemort, Muggle-borns attained the highest office in the land, and thus (unless we're being silly) also managed to get whatever positions come before that individual got up to Minister. Those are too disanalogous situations.

That they reached the Wizengamot and Minister of Magic is literally proof of this because if they barred them from advancing at all there would be no way for them to get into the high Court and the highest political office.

** Initial paranoia, but giving way to rational thought before doing anything rash. That's /if/ they understand enough about the magical world to make that assessment. The only canon indication we have of that is Fudge's interactions with the Prime Minister, and Fudge (we hope) isn't a representative sample.

A national security chief will recognize that the greatest nuclear threat actually comes from muggle-borns. The magical population is so small that nukes could wipe it out almost completely, and no would-be dark lord would be stupid enough to use them. Indeed, purebloods might undertake actions to detect and/or stop missile launches.

A muggle-born, on the other hand, could easily be a true believer in Soviet communism/American capitalism and might have means and motive to Apparate a nuke into Washingon/Moscow, thinking the sneak attack would be enough to swing the inevitable nuclear war.

Now presumably, for whatever reason, there's no way to transfigure a nuclear weapon. If that were possible, someone would have tried it by now and more than likely blown themselves up by accident. However, the existing nukes would be a very great security risk, so it would be important to load them up with enough security to thwart a lone or small group of magical attackers--enough guards that they can't subdue or memory wipe all of them before they sound an alarm and enough computer failsafes that even a muggle-born wouldn't know how to disable them all.

Of course, the weak link is leader of the magical government. If they try to pull a Fudge, grab them or call security on them if you can, and impress upon them that wizards are under greater threat from "unimportant" muggle politics than the muggles are. It's far from a sure thing, but then it was far from a sure thing that we made it through the Cold War without nuking ourselves on purpose either, so it's probably the best you're going to get.

Worst comes to worst and the Muggles are willing to nuke themselves to take the wizards with them (which could probably be stopped by just transfiguring the bombs into something harmless, or using Fidelius over every magic home).

It wouldn't work. Even with the witch burnings wizards mostly seemed immune to it, with one book in-universe mentioning how a simple Charm made them ineffective. Wizards were almost never caught in witch burnings in HP. And as I mentioned, Imperius makes it trivial for wizards to get at any muggle, in addition to this assymstrey: wizards can blend in, Muggles can't blend in, nor even find, wizards.

Fidelius was only brought up to show how even if Muggles were willing to nuke /themselves/ to kill wizards with them, wizards have a defense than can stop it. But even barring that, typical defense (Muggle repelling, /Protego Horribilis/, Muffliato and the like) will stop any muggle attempt at getting at any wizard who intended to defend their home.

***** The discussion prompt says that we're head of the National Security Council and we know about magic. The next time a wizard apparates into the office we could tranq them, take their wand and remove them to a secure location. They're still human and vulnerable to interrogation. I mean, there are so many ways this could go, but witches and wizards are clearly not invulnerable to muggles who know they exist.

And about the witch burning... How explicit were your school textbooks about the history of genocide and slavery and labour conditions (e.g. coal mining in the 1900s) when you were in school? I can tell you that mine were pretty tame. We don't want to traumatize children with actual knowledge of how awful the world can be. Even if this doesn't apply to fictional witch burning in HP, what happens if you don't know the flame freeze charm? What happens if while you're running from the mob you drop your wand? What happens to the kids you've left at home? Assuming you manage to get away you'll still have to leave the community, now you're stuck alone in the medieval countryside having to build a house, farm and find supplies. You are isolated from human contact and vulnerable to attack by marauders and the only magic you have access to is whatever you can still remember from highschool.

You realize tranquilizers don't act instantly, right? They could just Apparate away. Not to mention the issue of keeping a team permanently on watch for a teleporting being who can also manipulate them into leaving several different ways (Obliviate, Muggle repelling, Imperius, etc.).

It's noted to be a simple Charm in the textbook. Again, this requires them to be completely caught off guard by attempts. If they tried to.come after their kids (somehow, given magic dwellings are hidden from muggles) they would be more apt in their response given the witches burnings already happened and were, in HP history, regarded as mostly failing since Muggles aren't good at spotting magic.

This is incorrect and it annoys me how.many fans get this wrong. The Shield Charm is a /physical/ wall, it doesn't simply block spells.

People are charged for apparating without a licence because they've splinched themselves, and legilimency is so rare that occlumency doesn't seem to be a standard part of the Hogwarts curriculum. The muggle repelling though, I'll give you, because I don't think there's ever a scene when a muggle accidentally stumbles into the magical world.

So given how most witches and wizards are not prepared to fend off trained muggles do you really think that in a contest between Stan Shunpike and intelligence operatives, or Fudge and the head of the NSC the muggles really have no change of winning? And once you've capture one wizard it becomes easier to capture others.

On the second point about the Shield Spell, you were so emphatic that I thought I'd better check. There is never a single occasion when Protego is used to repel anything material from the non-magical world. It repels spells, the enchanted waterfall at Gringotts and other magical humans. It never repels anything remotely like a small highly energetic bullet. It might be able to, but it's certainly not silly to question whether it could, let alone whether it would work against gases or non-frontal attacks.

It's possible that the wall doesn't do anything other than repel magic. That would be consistent with the way a strongly cast protego forces magical humans back, like magnetic poles repelling.

It looks to me like these examples (and I didn't include them all) are consistent with magical repulsion, but I guess it could be a physical barrier too.

************ I think I've already kinda addressed this. The problem is simple. If they capture the wizard, eventually they have to give him back the wand if they're to be useful at all. And then in that case it's over because then they can escape or fight out. Fudge isn't a weak wizard so mentioning him alongside Stan is kinda silly.

The examples you gave seem pretty clear. The Shield Charm creates.an actual wall that's invisible and deflects minor spells at a minimum. The wall knocks away physical objects too. JKR has said a bunch in Pottermore that, as a general rule in HP, the magical trumps the non-magical. There's no real reason a Shield Charm can physically keep out hundreds of Wizards when Harry cast it yet a bullet or explosive gets through it. It has nothing to do with the person being magical or not, it's a wall.

************* You addressed the issue of capture by assuming that the wizard would get his wand back. And I didn't bother explaining that if you were the first wizard I caught I might never give you back your wand, you might not even survive the interrogation. But I would definitely learn more about the magical world and it would become easier to capture other witches/wizards (or muggleborn children) and use them differently.

As for the issue of the wall, two points: we might draw the boundaries around what constitutes canon source material in different ways (I don't include Pottermore, but would be willing to consider anything you quote).\\
This second thing is that the examples I gave are consistent with multiple explanations about how the physics of the magical environment works. It could be an invisible wall, it could also be magical repulsion field, it could also be an invisible spot that moves around to deflect material so quickly that it looks like a wall. Not all of the millions of possible explanations are equally likely, but you don't get to call them silly and rule them out without counter-evidence...which I don't think you have.

And I still think brains beats magic, so a smart muggle could catch a stupid wizard. (What evidence is there that Fudge is a powerful wizard? he's political ly powerful, but is he a good spellcaster?)

************** If they're trying to use the wizard to deliver nukes (as mentioned in the OP) they're going to need their wands. Unless that wizard is experienced at wandless magic, they're basically a Muggle without the wand. And once that person goes missing, the Ministry isn't going to be blindsided by Muggles again because they've already seen they can be brutal towards them.

I don't really see how a Pottermore article written by JKR can be considered anything other than canon. That said, I'll try and find it later, but she has said before that in general magic triumphs over mundane things (and has elsewhere given examples of this, such as saying they can cure any non-magical illness).

Except you quote exactly what clears this up from canon. Look (emphasis added):

  He was still having trouble with the Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, /invisible wall/ around himself that deflected minor curses; Hermione managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx CH31GoF

Stan is clearly made out to be not particularly noteworthy with magic. Fudge isn't just politically powerful, he holds the top office in the land. Subpar wizards can't get that far, the entrance requirements to get into various Ministry positions makes that nearly impossible (he was a junior Minister before he became the Minister for Magic). Remember, Fudge arrived on the scene to catch Sirius when Pettigrew blew up the entire street they were on, he came with the Hit Wizards.
