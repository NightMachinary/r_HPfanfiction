Looking for works about an older Harry kicking ass, as an Auror or otherwise. Preferably at least 60k words.


** - 1, There is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/41/Emperor][Emperor]] (W: 619,123; abandoned for 5 months), in which Harry sets himself a goal of becoming --- well, an Emperor. You may have problems with the OoC-ed characters and their morality though.

- 2, +There was another rather original story the name of which I don't remember,+ [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time][HP & the Wastelands of Time]] (W:346,090; abandoned for 7 months), in which an adult-“Harry” was stuck in a time loop, I think. The author seemed to have pretty good writing skills, but the story was rather different from the original universe, both in terms of character personalities and magical system.

*** I don't think Emperor is abandoned. Sometimes the author disappears for a time, but always comes back. Plus, one of their other stories was updated in Feb, so they do still come back every so often.

*** Already read both, and Emperor is probably my favorite fanfic of all time. Thanks for the recommendations though!

The Coven of Echoes. Harry and Ron are badass aurors and Harry and Ginny are estranged, but still brokenhearted over each other. It's pretty awesome.

*** Seconding this. It's been years since I read it, but I recall it being one of the best stories on the site.

Harry's definitely badass in this one, but it is more focused on his relationship with Sirius and thanks to that it escapes the god-emperor!harry trope
