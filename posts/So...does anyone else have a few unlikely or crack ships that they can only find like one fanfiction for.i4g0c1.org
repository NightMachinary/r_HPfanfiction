A lot of my ships are canon, or pretty close to it (Deamus, for example). However, I have a few odd pairs, and although I don't think any of them are "crack" per say, they are a bit hard to find.

For example, Colin and Justin. Why? I...honestly have no clue. I think I saw a post that said maybe they'd be cute together and ran with it. However, I've only found one fanfiction for it, when they both wake up in the hospital wing after the attacks, and even that can be seen as friendship.

Another example is Parvati and Lavender. More likely, considering they were best friends, but still not exactly common. I've read maybe three fanfictions with this as a side pair?

Anyways, just wondering if you guys can relate or if I'm just crazy.


** To be fair, I don't think that Colin and Justin ever canonically interact with each other, and neither of them get much screen time or character development, so I'm not surprised that there aren't many fics shipping them. I am more surprised there isn't more Parvati/Lavender though.

Personally, I just hate that when I search for fics shipping Harry with any girl besides the five-ish typical ones, all I get are massive harems.

Like Katie Bell. Up until OotP, she should be the girl Harry is closest to after Hermione, but no one ever puts them together.

And then there's Parvati and Cho, who each actually went on a date with Harry. It would be simple to just make the date go right and turn into a relationship, but it hardly ever happens.

Also, anyone/a muggle. Everyone talks about bringing in new blood/genes and how it's wrong to hate muggles and muggleborns, but no one actually wants to date one. Unless they're a crossover character. And I know there are obvious problems with the Statute of Secrecy and long distance relationships, but there are still some interesting stories waiting to be told there.

Consider this my vote in favor of Harry/Katie.

*** Yeah, I get why there aren't many fics shipping Colin and Justin, the only reason I don't call it crack is because between the hospital wing and Dumbledore's Army they probably would've at least known who the other was. Parvati and Lavender is one I thought for sure would have more, but then again, we don't get to see much of them other then Lavender in book 6, where she's drooling over Ron. Harem is something I try to avoid as much as possible, I don't really care for it.

You make a good point with Katie, I hadn't really thought about it until now, but with Quidditch and her being the closest chaser to Harry in terms of age, it would be quite adorable! I'll have to see if I can't find a fic shipping them together...

Parvati and Cho I feel weren't given justice by the narrative. Harry and Cho, controversial opinion, I know, actually had chemistry, and I feel like he was a bit of a jerk to her considering she was trying to get over Cedric by moving forward, while he was pretty rude to even his friends because he didn't want to confront it. Parvati is more difficult, since Harry essentially ditched her upon arrival, but I can see it working.

I see what you mean with muggles. On the one hand, I like that the characters felt more realistic in this sense, but on the other hand it's so frustrating! I've seen a few Harry x OC Muggle oneshots, and they honestly are pretty well-done, but I'd like a full-out fic that develops the differences and frustration with trying to date a non-magical person without putting them in danger, breaking the Statue of Secrecy, and dealing with the subsequent prejudice that comes with it.

Overall, there are a lot of unexplored opportunities when it comes to relationships, but then again, this is mostly an adventure/mystery series, so unfortunately romance had to take a backseat.

**** And Harry and Katie were the two new kids on the team Harry's first year. It would be perfectly natural for them to just stick together on the team, and that could easily develop into friendship and then romance. But Rowling seemed to largely forget that she exists when not on a broom, and the fandom has followed suit.

Cho and Parvati both could easily work if Harry had been a bit less clueless and less of an arse. I am really surprised that "what could have been" fics with them aren't more popular, but I guess neither of them did enough in the books to attract much interest. I'd even be down for a Parvati/Cho crackfic where they bond over their awful dates with Harry.

** Millicent/Harry. Seriously there's like 3 where they wind up together, two of which are short stories. Along with linkffn(Harry Potter and the Sun Source) where he thinks Millicent is the most beautiful girl at Hogwarts. Hey Half-Orc girls need loving too.

Hermione/Padma

Katie/Harry is one that should make sense from canon, but doesn't seem to be popular at all.
