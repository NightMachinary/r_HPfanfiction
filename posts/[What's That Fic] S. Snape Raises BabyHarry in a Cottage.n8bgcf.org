Okay! So, this is one I read around 2+ years ago, and while I'll never be much of a Snape fan, it always warmed my heart. The funniest part is, I can remember most of it word-for-word; but while that's nice, I really miss re-reading it over and over again.

What I can remember is Severus either finds Harry at the Dursleys or takes him right after Lily and James's untimely demise. He goes through the process of getting stewardship/guardianship of the baby!Harry, and while going through the Potter family's portfolio; finds a little cottage, in a small town- which has a brewing lab, a greenhouse, and the likes. They check it out, and quickly acclimate to their small town, cottage-living lifestyle. I vividly remember the house being multi-storied, and that the gate out front needed to be oiled.

Minerva pops up many a time, proclaiming herself as Harry's grandma, and always brings little biscuits and treats for Harry and Snape. Overall, very fluffy. Sirius gets released at one point, and he and Remus spend time with Harry as he grows up, often spoiling him rotten or getting into mischief. There are no main pairings, at least that I can remember, but I know Sirius and/or Remus settle down nearby. There was a lot of emphasis on the holidays, both Muggle and Wizarding, and I remember there was a Yule and Samhain scene that helped Severus and Harry bond and come to terms with the Potters' death.

I hope I was descriptive enough! Any help would be wonderful, as I've been scouring the internet and most FF websites for this fic.


** I feel like this one has a title along the lines of the saying â€˜the best revenge is living well'?

*** The thing Is, I thought the title was along those lines too! I know it's not 'Best Revenge' , and 'The Best Revenge is Living Well' was a OFC story.

Thank you for the help, though!
