** And then the monologuing...

I can't remember the fic, but it stated the "bone of the father" ritual had to have the chosen enemy be in a state of fear/terror/etc for the period the potion is being brewed up until the ritual point.

In [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5554780/1/Poison-Pen][Poison Pen]], it's said that "flesh of the servant" is supposed to be from a magical servant, like a house elf, because they are completely magical instead of magical only in blood. "Bone of the Father" came from a muggle, so no magic there. "Blood of the enemy" was from Harry, which is a source of magic.

I can't go any further without major spoilers. There's only one major ritual comprised of two steps. It's very interesting though.
