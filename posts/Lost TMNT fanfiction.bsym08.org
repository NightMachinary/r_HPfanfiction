I'm looking for a fanfiction where mikey has raw talent but hides it and becomes a goofball so his brothers can each have their own thing and be happy, but his brothers don't know this and get mad at mikey for some reason, then during a meditation training session mikey is able to lock away his light in a way, he does this because he thinks it will make his brothers happy but he ends up becoming an emotionless perfect ninja and his brothers try to get back the old mikey by bringing down like a mental/spiritual door of some kind. Also in this fanfiction master splinter knows exactly what mikey gave up so his brothers could be happy and so has a special relationship with mikey. Also I'm pretty sure I read this on ff.net if that helps. Please try and help me find this fanfiction, I've been looking for days and I'm desperate to find it


** I think you're on the wrong subreddit? Try [[/r/fanfiction][r/fanfiction]] and you might get more results. I don't recall ever reading a fic like what you're describing though.
