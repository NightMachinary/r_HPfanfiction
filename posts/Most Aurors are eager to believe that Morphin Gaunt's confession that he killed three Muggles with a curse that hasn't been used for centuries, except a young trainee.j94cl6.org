She finds it suspicious that the male victims shared similar names with a prodigy student at Hogwarts who happens to also be able to talk to snakes (according to reliable eyewitnesses including Professor Albus Dumbledore) just like the perpetrator. Furthermore this student happens to share the middle name of the perpetrator's father and it is known that the perpetrator had a sister who disappeared after having an affair with one of the victims. Another suspicious thing is the fact that the Trace got activated around the time of the murders despite no knowledge on Ministry's side of a magical child living in the vicinity... yet some Muggle eyewitnesses say that they saw a young man resembling this student's appearance loitering around the Riddle house the evening before the murder. She goes to Hogwarts to ask the student Tom Riddle some questions.

*** Right? If it hasn't been used in centuries, then how did the ministry know it was a wizard's murder when the curse leaves no sign of damage? And why would they have been classified in 1717 as unforgivable if no one has used the killing curse in centuries?

Unless you make this an au where voldemort does a different curse

Or just modify it with it being marvolo and morfin

and the new auror working on that connection between marvolo and that slytherin a few years below her with that same name

**** Priori incantatem on Morphin's wand (since Tom used that wand according to Dumbledore) or he could have just told them when he confessed. It's not that the Unforgivable curses (especially Avada Kedavra) are unknown. It's that they are not commonly used by anyone else than Voldemort and the Death Eaters and the Aurors during Crouch's term. Even in the books no one but Voldemort readily uses the killing curse. Even Sirius's death at the hands of Bellatrix is an accident since her curse just pushes him beyond the veil but (unlike the movie) it's not specifically stated that it's intent was to kill.

*** It is stated in the books that they have been used often during Voldemort's reign. My headcanon is that it's not the go to killing spell because people tend to avoid Unforgivable Curses according to fake-Moody

Edit: I don't get what I said so badly

*** I assume there are records of Merope's birth and since the whole Little Hangleton knew about Tom's and her affair, it's not that hard to find out if you hang around the local pub and ask the right questions. Tom was at Hogwarts in his sixth year. If she's a trainee, Tom and her have overlapped at Hogwarts. He was quite popular so that even older students respected him according to HBP so his name was not a secret.

**** That does make sense , especially if the Trainee Auror was a former Slytherin and had been around to have first hand experience of what kind of person Riddle was in the privacy of the common room.
