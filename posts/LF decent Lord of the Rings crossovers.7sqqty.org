*** Six, although two of them are very short.

- linkffn(Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous by Steelbadger)

- linkffn(Failsafe by Hannanora-Potter)

- linkffn(Doomsman's Herald by Morta's Priest)

- linkffn(The Next Great Adventure by Taure)

There's also this one which is HP/The Hobbit, but to call it a Harry Potter crossover is a stretch. I'm not sure if HP get's mentioned more than a handful of times. I've not read it in a long time though.

Linkffn(Fate Be Changed by Araceil)

  Harry sacrifices himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest expecting to die. Instead he wakes up in the Third Age of Middle Earth, lost and confused. Realistic crossover with canon Harry. No power-ups, elfling Harry or tenth walker. No slash.

  PART 2: She slayed the dragon, reclaimed the Mountain, birthed a forest, and won a war. But that was just the beginning. The past has a funny way of coming back to haunt you. Horcruxes and Dark Lords and quests to destroy them both, this time though, she's not alone. She has a Fellowship at her side.

#+begin_quote
  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

  A decade ago Harry Potter found himself in a beautiful and pristine land. After giving up hope of finding his friends he settled upon the wide plains below the mountains. Peaceful years pass before a Ranger brings an army to his door and he feels compelled once again to fight. Perhaps there is more to be found here than solitude alone. Harry/Ã‰owyn.

** I enjoyed linkffn(Black Magic by Lunatic Howling in the Night), unfinished and a while since the last update but what is there is readable and entertaining. There is also linkffn(The Grim Traveler by depressedchildren), which is a crossover with Naruto but it isn't half bad. Other than that all my bookmarked ones have been listed already, though I will say that Harry Potter and the Elves Most Fabulous is my very favourite, really wish he would update it soon.

  Kakashi was a relic of the past, a time where children were prepared for devastating war; in fact, his career had revolved around keeping back the threat or war. His brief tenure as Hokage only showed just how dated he was in this new era of peace and technological growth. So...this seemed fitting, a fitting end for a man who had known war for most of his life.

**** Not necessarily nonsense. The Black Speech is most certainly Dark, by design, by nature, whatever. However, any particular user of said speech is not necessarily /evil/. It would be difficult to say that Gandalf, for instance, is evil for having spoken the Black Speech. Thus, a not-evil Harry Potter in the body of Sauron, with Sauron's skills, abilities, resources, and followers, is not necessarily evil, even though he uses all those things which are unquestionably /Dark/.
