:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! I'm looking for a fic where Harry discovers he is an horcrux and Snape helps him destroy horcruxes through a more complex form of Occlumency. I remember that Harry has bridges in his mind that leads to all the horcruxes and that there's more sort of black goo that's trying to contaminate him (so he sometimes acts off after his sessions with Snape). He conjures his patronus in his mind to fight the goo and horcrux and towards the end, he leaves his invisibility cloak in his mind since that helps destabilize the horcrux faster.

I've been looking everywhere, but I can't find it! I don't remember if there's a pairing.

Thank you for your help!

*** Thanks for replying. It is sadly not World in Pieces, although that's a great fic.
