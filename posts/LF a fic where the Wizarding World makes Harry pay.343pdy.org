Basically the Ministry puts Harry on trial for not ending the war quickly enough and basically makes him pay a Million Galleons(999,999) which is all he has. He tries to make some money by signing with a crappy broom company.

Ringing any bells?


** I don't know the fic in question but that sounds like an awful reason to put someone on trial.

*** They needed money to rebuild the WW and didn't want to pay it themselves. Its actually not that stupid considering the general masses need to blame a scapegoat (or rather the ministry's need for a scapegoat). I don't remember much of it tbh but I think it was actually well written. Hell at this point I'm not even sure I didn't dream this happening

It is a one shot but had most of what you asked for. Not the exact fix though
