So as I was laying awake the others day and reading some Fic that I can't remember if the top of my head, a thought hit me

During Harry's walk to his death he physically owns 2 of the 3 hollows, while he owns the wand only by conquest from Draco.

Now phisicly the wand is with Lord Voldemort but now that the stone is in the hands of Harry does that mean he is the master of death since the ownership of wands is not a physical one but more of a link that can be won?


** I always preferred my own theory on this; that the whole “Master of Death” thing was not a title that was bestowed upon the person who gathered all three, but instead a prophecy about the man who would unite them. The only man known to survive the Killing Curse, twice no less, being the one who did it, that's no co inky dink.

** There is no 'Master of Death', Harry owned all three Hallows, but the only thing benefit that gave him was the usefulness of the Objects themselves.

*** It's about the concept of things, it's a story alright but if we look at it would the situation fit the criteria

** The epitaph Master of Death is canonically just that: a title. They all revolve around giving one a way to defy death, but not control it. The title itself is merely useful thematically in the story to contrast Dumbledore (and by proxy Harry) and Voldemort's divergent view on death.

This has been hammered home since the end of PoS. Voldemort thinks life and death is about victory and conquest, or rather that it is a zero-sum game. Dumbledore thinks trying to defy death is like trying to stop the sun from rising - maybe it won't rise tomorrow, you can't be completely sure, but its better to accept the inevitable and go into the twilight peacefully.

Of course, considering the potential views of the afterlife in the wizarding world, another way to view this is that Voldemort doesn't believe/know or fears what would come after death (like literally everyone else), and prefers the known to the unknown. Dumbledore by contrast accepts that not even he can know everything, and to go forward with optimism in his heart.

TL;DR: Its just a title in universe. Thematically its meant to represent the difference between defiance and acceptance.

** I've seen Master of Death used 2 ways: making someone immortal as long as all objects are owned, or gives the person a single-use full resurrection of a person of their choice.

However, my headcanon is that there's no such thing as a Master of Death beyond the title itself -- it doesn't actually /mean/ anything beyond owning 3 powerful magical artifacts. I have, however, been curious about fics that does the latter and gives Harry the power -- what would he do with it, if anything? Who decides who is more worthy? Does the person even want to be resurrected?

*** I have to see some more imagination regarding that would be nice

I mean there are some great immortal fics, but I mean you can make him a reaper of souls like the flamels for example. Souls that have lived to long and death wants to finally see returned to him
