Throw me what you have!! For some reason I have the most problems searching this pairing. I prefer multi-chapter fics but honestly just some good “fremione” content. Or Fred centric fics. Thank you in advance!


** Have you read Falling Through Time? LinkAo3(4475078)

It was the first Fred/Hermione story I read and nothing else I've found has lived up to it. Would love any recs you have too!

  In what was supposed to be her first ski trip since the war, Hermione wakes up from an avalanche to find herself back in time. Despite her search to return home to her time, she is forced to relive her last years at Hogwarts and the War that she knows will claim the faces that now haunt her. In Particular, the face of a certain Weasley that she finds herself slowly falling for.If you were forced back in time, would you try to save him?

  "Oh, my poor old heart can't take this," Fred says, clutching his chest."You're thirteen," Hermione scoffs, rolling her eyes. "There's nothing old about you.""I'm a twin. Combined we're twenty-six years old.""That's still not old, and that's still not how it works."*\ (or: the rewrite of the books where the twins befriend hermione early on. some things change, some things stay the same, some things... do a little bit of both.)
