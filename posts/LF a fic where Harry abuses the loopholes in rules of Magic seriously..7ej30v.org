I'm looking for a Harry where he seriously abuses the loopholes about the magic in J.K. Rowling's worldbuilding. A fic where he becomes seriously OP just by abusing the loopholes. Not Political power but magical/physcial power and spell knowledge. It could be runes carved to his skin, metamorphmagus muchined to full-blown self-biokinesis, stealing his enemies' magic, Legimency upper students to gain their spell knowledge, creating artefacts... the possibilitires are endless. And yes, I read For love of Magic by NoodleHammer.

** I have a philosophical issue with this. We are not privy to every detail and every limitation of every magical spell and artifact that appears in canon. A fanfic writer must therefore interpolate those from what can be gathered from what happened and didn't happen in canon. That includes what we saw spells do and not do, what we heard the characters say and not say about the spells, /and/ what actions canon characters (who know a lot more about magic than we possibly can) took or didn't take.

In particular, when declaring something an "abusable loophole", one is /choosing/ to interpolate them in a way that makes it one, but, especially when it involves paths to power available to everyone, it raises the question of why isn't everyone abusing them them already, radically transforming the wizarding society. Why is Harry the only one who gets to do it?

If one can't answer that question, it means that the interpolation is not consistent with the setting as a whole, so there is no loophole for Harry to abuse.

*** It's fiction, and magic. In what world can anyone ever truly know 100% if there is a loophole to begin with. Basically here in the real world there are loopholes in the law, and even laws that no-one knew existed, and in an insular society that HP wizards seem to have it's possible, if not highly likely that there are such 'loopholes' in their magic system that haven't been found yet. It's what pushes society's forward, discovery is all about loopholes becoming fact.

**** Nobody can know 100%, but the idea that the fic writer, who knows less about the mechanics of magic than a reasonably curious 1th-year Hogwarts student, would notice a simple loophole for their protagonist to exploit (and they are always simple) that all the adults in the wizarding world somehow missed strikes me as fundamentally implausible.

All advances that we do see happen in-universe are made by highly skilled and knowledgeable people, after a lot of work and experimentation, and, most importantly, are /incremental/: they do not revolutionize magic or provide an easy path to power.

***** Two words: nuclear bomb.

While made by an intelligent person, it did supply a temporary easy path to power until everyone learnt how to make one. Also this is magic, and while I can see your point to a degree, there is a story which used what Harry knew of magical contracts from the GOF, and he basically sent postages to Death Eaters that they'd have to sign for, and long of the short of it, the note had hidden in it's writing that said person gives up there magic to him.

In the movies/books it's clearly stated that the GOF can rip someones magic from them via magical contract, and it was never explained where the magic goes, so the writer could do whatever they wanted with it. Similarly if a 'easy' path to power is a loophole, but it was never explained fully in the movies/books, you can write what you want to happen. Nothing wrong with that.

How come only four wizard children became animagus's, but full grown adult wizards don't, or even the biggest 'deus ex machina' in the series, explain the room of requirement, a room that can become anything you want. Who's to say it can't warp time as well as space, I mean time turners exist, so obviously manipulating time isn't outside the capability of the series.

Basically when you put the whole series into perspective, they had paths to easy power if they wanted it without the so called 'loopholes'. We're talking about a series where they casually manipulate time,space, and reality, who's to say there aren't a few loopholes. Unless JKR says it herself, any loopholes found should be considered that, a loophole.

The Manhattan Project cost 30 billion 2012 US dollars and involved hundreds of thousands of people. It was a path to power, but it certainly wasn't easy. This analogy seems to me to support my argument better than yours.

#+end_quote

Magical contracts are hundreds of years old (as the Goblet is). If what you describe were possible in the first place, the Death Eaters in question would know about it and have countermeasures, because if they didn't, their own enemies would have used this trick on them a long time ago.

We never get to find out what the penalty clause is in GoF, but loss of magic is pure fanon. In fact, the Ministry under Voldemort only took people's wands, not their magic, which suggests that it's fundamentally impossible. GoF penalty could be a public humiliation and a 5 Galleon fine, for all we know.

#+begin_quote

As long as you can explain how is it that this thing that you (a Muggle) thought of is something that no wizard had thought of first. (Well, you /could/ write it without that, but then your story would have a gaping plothole at its very core and your universe wouldn't make any sense.)

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

I guess you can invest the months required, risk getting stuck in a partial transformation, and hope for a form that's more powerful than a wizard with a wand (as opposed to, say, a kangaroo). Considering that all animagi we see are ordinary animals, the odds are against you. It's a lot of effort for a modest reward that's not even very useful unless you have special circumstances (e.g., your friend is a werewolf, and you want to keep him company).

A RoR hack is a bit more plausible, since not many people know that it exists in the first place. However, while an amazing bit of magic, RoR doesn't actually do anything that space-expansion charms, conjuration, and transfiguration don't, and those are well-known to everyone in Potterverse with a modicum of curiosity.

In other words, it's of more benefit to a bunch of students who want a convenient place to practice spells than it is to a wizard or a which who is already competent and wants a huge power-up.

When you put the whole series into perspective, the only paths to easy power we saw were the Dark Arts, which required almost as much talent and hard work as non-Dark approaches, but people who practiced them came to bad ends.

Canon is to say that, because nobody is exploiting them in canon. There are thousands of wizards who spend a lot of time searching for easy paths to power. (They are called "Slytherins".) Pretty much every idea for a loophole would have been thought of many times over, and the fact that it doesn't get exploited in canon means that it's not actually a loophole in the canon setting. If you want to escape that conundrum, you have to explain why none of those wizards had tried this idea in the first place /but your protagonist did/ based on an idea by a Muggle (yourself).

******* Okay, i'm not going to argue every individual point like you are, all i'm going to point out is that once again someone(you) is trying to apply logic, and reasoning to magic, and a fictional universe. While i'd disagree with Hermione, and her views on the lack of logic in wizards/witches. I am going to point out that a society which has lived with magic will have different ways of viewing the world than muggles, the same way that the people in china have a different perspective than americans do.

"Purebloods" are used to magic, and what it can do including limitations. Why don't there enemies not use magical contracts, maybe they thought the same thing you did, that it's been tried, but there is no proof that it's impossible or possible. Basically unless you can show me proof that any loophole you've read has been tried there's no point in trying to prove me wrong since I don't see proof that magical contracts won't work.

Last point, this is fiction in a universe where magic exists. If you're going to reply to a sentence, and nitpick reply to this, how can you be expected to not find loopholes in a universe with magic.

******** Well, Warryn, you gave some specific examples (some of which were fanon-based), and those merited specific replies.

More generally, wizards, for all their weird values and perspectives, are still humans (albeit with superpowers), and this, I think, is an important theme throughout the books. No amount of magic (short of some mass brainwashing that affects all sides of all conflicts all over the world) is going to change that. Thus, they would do human things like look for easy ways to get ahead and to hurt those they don't like. And, for all that they lack formal logic (which is what Hermione was talking about), they do not lack the creativity and the ambition needed to explore the so-called loopholes.

As for demanding proofs, I think that the burden of proof is on the person pushing the idea that there's this world-changing loophole that's just sitting out there in the open for the Muggle fic writer and their adolescent protagonist to find, but that everyone, including Dumbledore, Voldemort, the Order, the Death Eaters, and the Unspeakables alike had completely missed.

And, of course, yes, I've thought up some "loopholes" myself, but I am not so arrogant as to think that I am smarter than all of the above-listed wizards and witches who would actually know something about how magic works, which a Muggle like myself would not. So, if I could think of it, so would have /someone/ in the wizarding world, and since they haven't implemented it, it probably doesn't work in a way that permits the "loophole".

My very thoughts shape that universe, because said universe doesn't exist. Get this through your head, it's not real. Those loopholes you talk about don't exist, just like that universe doesn't exist. If I want Harry to be a blacklight animagus he will, because that's what I want, just like you want a loophole free story, make one, but I can't say this strongly enough. It's not real. Why do you argue so much about something which doesn't exist. It's like me arguing that Homer Simpson is actually god. If I want it to be true, than it is.

*********** Stories can be good, but even without loopholes stories can be bad just as much as the opposite is true. As long as you write why such a seemingly obvious loophole hasn't been used.

For example we'll go with what we know, why not make Harry become an Animagus. The benefits for spying, and escape are there.

For others the answer is obvious, they're not taught about such advanced magic until the later years of schooling, and by that point they are too busy with friends, OWLS, NEWTS. For most purebloods they're taught more important things to do with their family, and estate. For Muggle raised Wizards/Witches they're either too busy at school, or at home where they're not allowed to do magic.

Harry though has a godfather who's trying desperately to connect to one of the few links to his friends, and maybe he see's teaching Harry how to be an animagus as a way to bond/connect with him. You could even bring Sirius earlier in the story as long as there is a reason why he either escaped, or was freed earlier than canon.

That is one loophole sorted, and while others might be more difficult to explain, as long as there is an actual reason behind it I don't see why he can't abuse these "loopholes".

Let's come from left field, and further expand on this Animagus loophole, and make it cliche. Harry discovers he's a phoenix Animagus, and has the strength, healing, immortality, and flame teleport(whether fanon or not) carry over to his human form, unlike with others who've become an Animagus.

Maybe the reason he has such a form, and why it carries over is, because it is connected to the prophecy, and a part of the power he knows not. When a story introduces prophecy there is so much you can do. If prophecy exists, there is a high chance that divinity, or some guiding force exists, and if that exists, why not more unbelievable things.

So my point is that even if you hate such loopholes/cliches/tropes(generalizing here), as long as there is a reason for it, and it's explained it can still be a good story.

************ That's not a loophole. That's Harry doing some fairly well-understood magic (done by James, Sirius, Peter, McGonagall, and Skeeter) in an ordinary way and then winning the lottery and ending up with a super-powerful form, as opposed to, say, a stag like his father and his Patronus or a random bird because he loves flying.

To me, a loophole implies at least some deliberate cleverness on the part of the protagonist, and what you've described sounds more like an arbitrary power-up. You might as well just skip the whole "loophole" business and say that Harry has a ginormous Magical Core from the start. Of course, that doesn't make for very good fic either.

I think your complaining for the sake of complaining, or whining for the sake of whining, either be clearer or don't reply back at all. Like you said, it's a path to power, why isn't anyone abusing it already. I mean it gives either great spying ability, so knowledge is power, or a dangerous creature, could be good for a fight, and physical power. I'm sure even a poodle could offer something in the power department, so yes this is a canon loophole, so please, either be clearer, or stop whining, and complaining just for the sake of it.

************** I'd say a that loophole has to be a combination of some aspects of the rules of magic and of the setting in general that can be used to reliably obtain or wield power out of proportion to the amount of talent, time, work, and luck involved. That is, the loophole is something that should make it easy to accomplish something that someone not using the loophole would consider very difficult or even impossible.

For story purposes, I would add an additional proviso that it has to be something that nobody or almost nobody in the setting is already doing. For example, a wand would be a loophole, until everyone had one.

Cleverness is not a part of the definition, but it's implied.

You've described a bunch of things that I would consider loopholes, if they worked. For example, the magical contract attack thing, if it worked, would be a loophole: a way to cripple your enemies that penetrates their defenses regardless of how skilled they are, without requiring any more skill than Hermione had in OotP. I just don't think that it would work for reasons I gave upthread, several times over.

Now that I think about it, what happened in DH can be considered one, but it wasn't Harry who was taking advantage of it but Dumbledore (in order to slay Voldemort while saving Harry). Notice that Dumbledore is vastly more intelligent and knowledgeable than Harry, and it still took a lot of luck.

Your animagus example doesn't count as one, IMO, because the power-up comes is only loosely a consequence of Harry's decision to become an animagus: the part that actually gives him the power-up is the extremely improbable bit of luck that he gets a very powerful form that transfers over to his human form as well.

Now, unless Harry had some way of controlling or predicting that, that's just him being lucky. If he /did have/ some way of controlling or predicting this form, that, again, raises the question why nobody else before him was able to.

In the end they're called loopholes for a reason, and if they didn't exist, then the word wouldn't. I'm just sick of this conversation, and how you change your answer to suit your logic, thereby making it unreliable.

You even contradict yourself with "For story purposes, I would add an additional proviso that it has to be something that nobody or almost nobody in the setting is already doing. For example, a wand would be a loophole, until everyone had one." That's the animagus right there, and yet it isn't a "loophole". Also with Sirius being experienced it would also make it easy to accomplish when usually it's difficult. Sirius is the loophole here. So i'm done.

**************** Sigh... I am honestly not sure why you keep missing the point. Perhaps I am just not communicating well.

OK, suppose that Harry becomes an animagus. His Patronus suggests that his form would be a stag, though I can also see it being a bird of some kind. Is that a power-up? Kind of. He wouldn't gain any abilities he wouldn't have without a decent broomstick, and his fighting ability would be better served by spending the time practicing DADA instead. Would it be a game-changing loophole? Definitely not.

If his form turns out to be a phoenix, then yes, that would be a huge power-up, but that's not him exploiting a loophole any more than a guy buying a lottery ticket and winning the jackpot has found a loophole in the economic system. He just got lucky.

Now, if he uses some clever way to figure out how to force his animagus form to be a phoenix, /that/ would be a loophole. You see the difference?

But, if you have him used that approach, you have to ask why there aren't any other phoenix animagi out there --- why is Harry the only one who gets to choose his animagus form.

** The whole thing is a little long if you just want the loophole stuff, but there's a great sequence in chapter 65 of linkffn(angry harry and the seven by sinyk) (that's the chapter with the first task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Awesome exploitation of laws and contracts.)

  Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

***** Hey, there was a reason I gave the specific chapter. It was a great example of what's being requested, really. And doesn't require any context other than canon (well, and some familiarity with fanon tropes). The loophole exploited was basically [[/spoiler][that the tri-wiz contract had a month-day date, but not a year. And then there was a fantastic domino effect of legal ramifications]]
