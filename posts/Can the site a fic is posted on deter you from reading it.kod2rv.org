Reworded: Do you have a strong enough bias towards [[https://FF.net][FF.net]], AO3, etc. that reading on other platforms feels a little wrong to you? Just curious!


** I never read in on wattpad. It's terrible to read on and the layout is annoying.

*** I find wattpad intolerable also...

Ao3 has better line spacing so is more comfortable. I'll read ffnet if the story is good but it's cramped and the ads are a nightmare.

***** Noted for ffnet thank you üòä. Yeah j find it's easier for me to find stories I like on Ao3... Ffnet has less slash/pairing stories so I'd prefer that but finding ones I like is difficult.

This thread has been great for recs tho.

******* It's always fun when you look up a new fandom you get into, sort by kudos, and then count how many pages of depraved smut or "whump" you have to wade to before you can find a decently written AU.

Ffn is so much harder to search than ao3, but at least sorting by favourites gives you well written long fics rather than the equivalent of Hogwarts/Giant Squid

** I'm happy to use ffn or AO3 but I only actually go and look for stories on AO3 (rather than following a link). This is because I've saved a favourite with all of my included/excluded tags set up - and AO3 is really good with filtering - so I just click on my favourite and I only see results that I'm interested in.

I think there would need to be a substantial cash incentive to persuade me to read anything on wattpad. (Assuming that I could find it in the first place).

** FFN is harder to read because I can't have all the chapters move into one long read like AO3.

I read a lot of the time where there is no WiFi or data, so not having to click next chapter is really essential.

** I will go against the crowd and say I prefer reading on FFN. The text on FFN is a little bolder/blacker than the text on AO3, and that just makes it slightly easier to read for me.

But it's not as though AO3 is bad, just a slight preference for FFN.

Any other site, though...ugh.

ETA: I mostly read on my mobile at the website itself. (No apps.). So not sure if my experience is reflective of everyone's.

** Yup. I prefer [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] because I've been established there for so long. It's second nature for me to use it, so I'm more likely to give a chance to a fic that's a "maybe" there. I have to really want to read a fic to make the extra effort to visit ao3. And if it's wattpad, I probably won't read it even if I find the summary very intriguing.

** Yeah, sadly, I do. I really don't like [[https://ff.net][ff.net]], and the story must have a really interesting premise for me to even try to read it if it's only on [[https://ff.net][ff.net]].

I won't even touch anything on Wattpad.

I really love ao3, so whenever I see an interesting rec here, the first thing I do is look if it's posted on ao3 too.

** There was a time were I really tried to teach myself how to search and use Wattpad and ff.net, and while I still read on ff if the story is good enough I hate the site. Because I read in phone, the text is waaaay too small and doesn't change even if I adjust the configuration in the phone, doesn't even let me put it in night mode. Also, ads... Wattpad has a friendly format and my most famous work is posted there, but I hate the "sorting". AO3 is so convenient with the tags and everything else that since I started reading there a couple of years ago I haven't looked back. I love how you can do your own collections, bookmarks and you even have a history and Read Later option, that's what really does it for me.
