The only I've read are "Grave Days",its sequel, "Snape's Memories" and "Dudley's memories"

Also any interesting story that is a good read, please link it


** linkffn(Seven Smple Years), and it's companion (well, I just really think they work well together) linkffn(Harmony). Most stories by this author are also canon compliant, I just ahven't read much of it, so I can't vouch for them.

There's linkffn(Ginny Weasley and Half-Blood Prince) for GInny's view of the sixth year, and linkffn(Not From Others) for her view of the seventh.

[[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=2023&chapno=1][Mind's eye soul's reflection]] it's not canon compliant, simply because it was written before we learned about Luna's father and house. It's still a very good story, though.

  A confessed regret. A rejection. A conversation that was meant to be private - overheard by the one person Chloe never wanted to hear it. But perhaps - perhaps - it was for the best. Where will the future lead Beca and Chloe? Only time will tell.

  The story of "Harry Potter and the HBP", but told from the 3rd person POV of Ginny Weasley. Strictly in-canon. Suitable for anyone whom the "Harry Potter" novels themselves would be suitable for.
