Being my first (and most recommended) fic, I absolutely enjoyed HP and the Boy who Lived. What intrigued me about it the most was how in depth and how much detail the author puts into exploring magic. Charms, Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Spell Creation, Occulomency, Dueling, and much more details of very advanced magic is displayed in this fic. What really won me over was the whole use of "intent" of a spell as well as learning about how specific wand movements and emotions affect spells and whatnot really played an important role in the story as a whole, especially when it came to dueling.

â€‹

Just looking for recommendations of other fics that are similar as the one above especially when it comes to detailing learning advanced magic, and growing with the main characters wether it be in a school setting or out of one.

Thank you!


** I think Prince of Slytherin does a good job of detailing the learning of advanced magic, but it's more in the "research projects" in the second year and Harry's lessons with Moody before and during third year.

I think you'll enjoy [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/72wsc4yrwetp4yw/MHP%20Distribution%20Copy%20PDF%2022%20April%202018.pdf?dl=0][Taure's headcanon magic document.]] Not a fanfic, but it's a fun read, and his actual fics like "The One He Feared" and "Victoria Potter" are commonly recommended here. Or for common recommendations in general, check out the most recommended fics on this sub.

One of the Book Club fics last year that had a fun dive into magic was Magicks of the Arcane. The middle of the fic where Harry is basically adventuring with Dumbledore, is great. A lot of other commonly recommended fics also try to dive into magic with varying degrees of success, even if they make it AU. Pureblood Pretense, The Arithmancer (didn't like this one), the ever controversial Harry Potter and The Methods of Rationality, the crossover Crosswinds of Fate, etc. are worth checking out.

Could you narrow down what else you liked about HP and the Boy Who Lived?

*** Well aside from a huge dive into magic, giving way more detail then the original books did and the end of the year projects at drumstrang, I really enjoyed HP in the sense that he was an intelligent MC, and sometimes that came to bite him in the ass. But honestly I can't narrow down exactly what else I liked, sure I liked being at another school and having to deal with Calypso's dad as a former DE teaching was a cool dynamic but that seems way too strict haha. I will look into both of your main suggestions a little and see if its more of what I was looking for and then leave some detail then! Thank you very much for helping me out!

**** Thanks bud. I dunno if it's what you're looking for, but I recommend the fic "antithesis" to every Harry Potter fan I come across. Give it a shot if you want.
