So I vaguely remember an old Harry Potter Fanfiction that had Harry as a mix of I think angel, Demon, elf, and tiger creature. He came into his creatureness and learns he is a true immortal as in he dies and wakes up, he dies again(Like Jack from Doctor Who). He is so powerful death comes to him and says yeah you're never going to died and you can jump through time. It might be best if you go back in time to the founders and get some better magic training. Harry can only time travel like once very so many years on his birthday.

The scenes that I remember are one of the founders finding Harry and going 'good lord what is that'

Then harry shows how immortal he is by showing all of the plaques that Salazer put in the great hall, all of them say things like 'here is where the great harry died' then another says 'here is where he died again' and on and on.

Last I saw of it it was on Fanfiction.net and had like 50 - 100 chapters. Any help would be awesome.


** From the title I didn't think you were looking for a specific fic. Thought you might be playing badtrope bingo or something.
