I know in canon we don't really have information that goes against Lily being "the perfect woman" and for James we have things like bullying Snape to use against him, but I want a fic where James is shown as a good guy, and Lily is shown in a bad light, so the opposite of a lot of fics out there. Bonus if Lily and James are both alive.


** Not exactly a bad light but you might be interested in linkffn(toreachwithout) it's not finished but still worth the read.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." ON INDEFINITE HIATUS.

** This fic hasn't aged very well. Tropes include WBWL, magical cores, Slytherin!Harry, eventual Drarry, Manipulative!Dumbledore, Pureblood Society, eventual Indy!Harry, Severitus... and you have to wait several books for Lily to have her comeuppance.

That being said, this series has a soft spot in my heart. I enjoyed it immensely. But it's very long, so you'll have a long wait to get what you wanted.

  AU, eventual HPDM slash, very Slytherin!Harry. Harry's twin Connor is the Boy Who Lived, and Harry is devoted to protecting him by making himself look ordinary. But certain people won't let Harry stay in the shadows... COMPLETE

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.

** I feel like that shouldn't be so difficult, even if you stick close to canon, you'd just have to change the point of view away from the Snape centered one of the books and to someone around them, maybe another muggleborn in their year, someone that is called mudblood by Snape and has to fear him and his other Junior Death Eater buddies.

from their pov Lily is that kid that sticks with the bigot and who doesn't care that he is a terrible person as long as he adores her. Someone that willingly became 'the muggleborn friend' in the saying 'I can't be racist I have a muggleborn friend'. Someone who was happy to be the exception, maybe even felt better about herself that she wasn't like the rest of muggleborns. The way she hung out with Snape and defended him could easily make that impression on others.

James, on the other hand, would be the kid that stands up against those bigots. Who allows muggleborn that live in fear to actually laugh at those that follow the death eater ideas, like a ridiculous spell against a boggart.
