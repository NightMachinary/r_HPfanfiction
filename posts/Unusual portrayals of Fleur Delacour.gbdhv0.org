I feel as if, from what I've read, most fanfiction only ever portrays Fleur in one specific way, when they bother to portray her at all. She didn't do all that much in canon from what I recall, but are there any fics you're aware of that characterize her differently? A villain, perhaps, or someone who acts haughty for reasons that aren't just a mask because woe is me I make people drool upon visual contact, or however they choose to portray veela?


** Try Fleur Delacour and the "Precious Leetle Boy" by IceWaterJetty. Fleur is murderously crazy in this story.

  Ten years of life at the Dursleys have healed Alexandra Potter of any good feelings she might have towards her aunt, uncle and cousin, leaving her friendless and sarcastic about life. On her eleventh birthday, a letter sent by a school of magic may give her a providential escape. Except, of course, things may not be that simple for a girl fan of the Lord of the Rings...

*** I don't think when Op asked for unusual portrayals of Fleur Delacour, that he was asking for the classic trope "Veela like to fuck strong Wizard". FLOM is the "masterpiece" (/s) where Fleur let Harry fucks her, her mom and also her little sister, in exchange to let herself get bonned by Tonks's Big Metamorphagus dick.

Really Unusual...
