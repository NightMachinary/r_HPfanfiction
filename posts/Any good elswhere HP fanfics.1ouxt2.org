I really love elsewhere fanfiction, which is where none of the characters from the original are involved. So it's literally what's happening somewhere else, in the same universe, to someone else. Unfortunately, these types of stories are a bit difficult to find. So if anyone knows where I could find a list of them or knows of some specific instances, please let me know!

I know that some gen fics feature the kids of the originals but I'm more interested in some completely new characters.


** The Alexandra Quick series sounds exactly like what you are looking for.

I don't care for them, but many people consider them the pinnacle of HP fanfic.

*** Wow, I really love this series! I started reading it and it's great! I think what I like most about it is the author's sense of pacing and character development. Awesome!

** I always suggest [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=288707][With the Devil]] for those looking for a totally OC HP fic. It's set in 1600s Salem, about a daughter of a Minister who discovers she can do magic.

*** That sounds really cool! Looks like a novella style story. I'll have to start reading it after I've read a bit more of Alexandra Quick!

*** I was really disappointed to see how short it is. That sounded like an interesting story, but I don't really read anything under 100k words.
