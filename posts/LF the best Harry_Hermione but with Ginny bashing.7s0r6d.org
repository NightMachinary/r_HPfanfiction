Any help?


** The most popular author you're looking for is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1451358/robst][robst]]. He has a lot of words written that are at least close to your criteria.

Whether the works are interesting varies widely on the reader.

Most Harmony stories feature some level of Weasley bashing, especially Ron and Ginny. Just look for stories with the pairing and you'll probably be fine.

*** Robst is far better than this sub makes him look. The technical side of his writing is solid and he stays away from unbelievable relationships like anything that does involve Snape and Malfoy. His stories are not outstanding but not worse than Hitler either.

**** They're just boring. Which is a worse crime in a story than poor technical writing.

He often has an interesting premise, but it is never taken anywhere.

They're about as bland as a toast sandwich.

****** Obviously, but luckily it's not one ore the other.

There are so many decent to good fics, it means you don't ever have to keep reading something that's despairingly boring.

  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor, some bashing included; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
