I tired searching to see if anyone else had news, but is Portkey gone? It just times out when I try to load it.


** If worst comes to worst, here's an a[[https://web.archive.org/web/20150102183927/http://fanfiction.portkey.org/fanfiction][rchive]] of the site saved from just a few weeks ago.

*** Yeah, Wayback is how I had to read it when they had 500 issues a few weeks ago and the recent 522.

** +I just tried. Instead of the 522 error I've been getting the past few days, I straight up got a 404. I think they're done, guys. Thank the gods for archives.+

Just checked on a desktop. Specific pages, like stories or author profiles, will 404, but others, like portkey.org, will 522. Going to fanfiction.portkey.org will render the message "brb... restoring" so, not sure what that means. Hopefully I'm wrong and this is just one of those periodic hiccups.

*** Yeah. I was in the middle of reading a listing someone here did. And now. Nothing.

**** Yeah man, this sucks. My gf just recently showed me portkey and I got super into it, so I was pretty devastated when it went down.

** Its not gone, the Cloudflare account for it is still up. I would assume they are having some server or network difficulties.

*** But the admins have been absent from the site for years. I'm not sure much can be done without them.

** I just tried portkey again and it seems to be working again. Just a heads up.

*** Thanks for the update! Trying it out now.

Edit: Just confirmed it. Portkey appears to be back in working order. God, is this what mainlining heroin feels like?
