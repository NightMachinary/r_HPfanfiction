Are there any fanfictions in which Harry is very very interested in wand crafting or is a wand crafter? Thank you.

  Char. Ooc, AU/AR, still within JK's world - Harry is apprenticed to a Diagon Alley businessman at the tender age of seven. From there the story changes... very mild bashing of some regulars.

** Not exactly that, but [[https://aaran-st-vines.nsns.fanficauthors.net/Makers_of_Fine_Wands_since_382_BC/index/][Makers of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. by Aaran St Vines]] is about the first Ollivander and discovery of the very first wand and wandmaking. I would love some heavy editing (aka shortening) be done on it, but that's problem of 90 % of all fanfiction stories, and comparing with others it is very sweet story.

  Yuuri studies the man with silver hair and unbelievably blue eyes, and says, "Are you real then?" "I believe I should be asking you that." The man stares back at Yuuri with a mix of shock and awe, as if he were gazing upon a miracle. Under the intensity, the tips of Yuuri's ears flush red. It's not that he's unaccustomed to hero worship. Plenty of people have called Yuuri their idol before, but this is different. He doesn't know how yet, but it's different. "What's your name?" "Viktor." Yuuri Katsuki is a shounen manga hero. Viktor Nikiforov is a figure skating legend who has always been in love with him. By a twist of fate, the two manage to meet across universes.

  Cedric Diggory is dead, Voldemort is reborn. Narcissa Malfoy knows what this means for her son, and she will not let him be Marked. Even if it means fleeing Britain.With Amelia Bones' help, a safe haven welcomes six teenagers who have no wish to bow to Voldemort. The only catch? They'll need to adapt to a Muggle lifestyle.With private teachers to continue their schooling, isolated from the rest of the world, they certainly don't expect to enjoy themselves, especially after Harry Potter himself joins them. A story where Umbridge wreaks havoc on Hogwarts and Harry is not there to see it.
