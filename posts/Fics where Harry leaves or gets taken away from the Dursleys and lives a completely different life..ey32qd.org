The rare fanfictions where bashing isn't the main focus and harry grows up or is mentored by anyone but the Dursleys and then goes on to live a completely different life. Looking for stuff that's far from cannon compliant, lol, I just really like fics where authors let their creativity run wild and build from the wonderful world of harry potter. Some fics I'm rather fond of that fit this are *say a prayer* by mad_fairy and *No competition* by evilgoddss. Please help me out by sending me any stories that vaugly match.

** /Harry Potter and the Hermetic Arts/ linkffn(13230151) has Harry being mentored by a Tabletop RPG group that includes conspiracy theorists, an aspiring actress, a computer programmer, and a hobby shop store owner who may or may not be a former spy, before eventually striking out on his own when he comes into money. There's a bit of bashing, but for the most part, it's just Harry being cynical and kind of a prick.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter discovers the Player Handbook for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition after experiencing accidental magic and realizes he may have magic. Directed to a hobby shop, he develops his own style of magic based on tabletop RPGs and comics. Then, he gets his Hogwarts letter. Dark!Indie!Sarcastic!Paranoid!Pragmatic!Harry. Rated M for language and graphic violence.

** I know of one where he's Kabuto from the Naruto series. I don't like the harem that's in it, but the prose was fascinating enough that I could ignore it for the most part. Linkffn(The Serpent Sorcerer)
