I've read everything Nonjon and Jbern have to offer, and I want more of similar quality. Who do you recommend I read? I like stories with unusual pairings, divergent storylines that are well written.

Any ideas? And please if they can be complete, it'd be awesome. I usually devour these stories at work (night guardsmen).

Oh and Methods of Rationality...I don't get the draw of it. I find it very dry.


** First off, sorry for the mobile links.

Have you read BajaB? Some of his stories are similar to Jbern. I like them a lot. I get the same vibe from DobbyElfLord also.

These are off my favorite list, they may not be exactly what you are looking for but they are well written and fairly original.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5915140/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Cursed-Summer][Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer]] by BajaB After being cruelly abandoned by the Dursley's, Harry meets Bill and joins him on a Cursebreaking Adventure. Bill mentors Harry fic no slash. First FF Starts off a bit dark but lightens up quickly. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5846518/1/insurgere][insurgere]] by Silver Pard Hufflepuff is the house of the leftovers, the losers, the forgotten. Well, Tom Riddle thinks, it's time to change that. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5077573/1/RuneMaster][RuneMaster]] by Tigerman In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/5101357/1/The-Potter-Family-Grimoire][The Potter Family Grimoire]] by DisobedienceWriter Harry Potter has an unprecedented amount of freedom the summer before his Third Year. He stumbles into an odd shop in Diagon Alley that will change his life forever. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/4582403/1/Hero-Material][Hero Material]] by expiry 4.23 AU. What if Harry had been the one to grow up with Vernon's ideals while Dudley dreamed of magic? Very dark. But surprisingly, not slash. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/4544334/1/Harry-Potter-Mercenary][Harry Potter Mercenary]] by DobbyElfLord Harry Potter is sent to prision for a crime he did commit. Now they need their hero back but he's lost all interest in saving them. They threw him away and now its going to cost them. Note rating! One-shot. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] by Celebony Dudley begins to see his family in a different light. Warning: strong language and themes of child abuse. WINNER: Best One-Shot at Quibbler Awards. Complete.

[[http://m.fanfiction.net/s/2855603/1/Here-I-Stand][Here I Stand]] by Janiqua The story of how Lily Evans blossomed from the scared eleven year old girl who feared magic into the beautiful young woman who flourished in it, and who found the courage to defy the Darkest Lord of the century. Warning: Minimal Deathly Hallows spoilers! Complete. (I really think the author should go and make this book 7 compliant... It is a wonderful read and it really feels like it's cannon.)

**** Start with Cursed Summer. I just finished it and really liked it. It was refreshing as I hadn't read anything like that before.

I enjoyed Runemaster a lot too, although Harry becomes a bit too much (too intelligent, too powerful...) but it's well done and well written.

** MaraunderLover7's [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=321302][Innocent]]

#+begin_quote
  Mr and Mrs Dursley of Number Four, Privet Drive, were happy to say they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. The same could not be said for their eight year old nephew, but his godfather wanted him anyway.

S'TarKan's [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2636963/][Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past]]

#+begin_quote
  The war is over. Too bad no one is left to celebrate. Harry makes a desperate plan to go back in time, even though it means returning Voldemort to life. Now an 11 year old Harry with 30 year old memories is starting Hogwarts. Can he get it right?

I Know you said no H/G but check out [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/][Northumbrian]] works Specially Grave Days, Aurors and Schoolgirls and Strangers at Drakeshaugh. They follow cannon closely and are really well written

** *[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20][Harry Potter and the Natural 20]]*

Obvious reccomendation. A crossover with Dungeons and Dragons. I know nothing at all about D+D, but this is amazing. Seriously, just read it, it is made of pure 100% concentrated hilarious WIN. More than a crack-fic too: there's some real depth and (real!) character development that goes on. First year complete, all seven planned apparently.

*[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/Oh-God-Not-Again][Oh God Not Again!]]*

On a similar level of win to HPN20. A parody of Peggy-Sue stories. Harry accidentally goes back in time, and spends 50 chapters chewing the scenery, aided by Lockhart and the Weasley twins. Complete, the story comes to an end at the end of 4th year in the graveyard.

*[[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892925/1/Stages-of-Hope][Stages of Hope]]*

Mood change: this one is serious. TVTropes describes it as "a rare example of well done dimension travel" and this is right. It's dark, the main characters (Harry and Hermione) are badly broken (and awesome at the same time), and it has an absolutely beautiful and spooky interpretation of Luna (there's one line from her that sent shivers down my spine, I won't spoil it for you). It's also not too ambitious, which is the failing of so many stories.

No focus on romance in any of these (probably part of why I like them): Natural 20 is too early, being halfway through Chamber of Secrets, and won't take it too seriously as everyone gets older (though there's a very clear pairing between the main character and Hannah Abbott); Oh God Not Again! doesn't take itself nearly seriously enough and Harry acknowledges the real age difference is too much anyway; and in Stages of Hope... well the canon pairings are there... in the past.

*** I want to thank you for showing me Stages of Hope. Good lord I haven't felt so sad and giggled so much from a story in a long time. Awesome story, I read it all in one sitting.

** Try [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/1228238/DisobedienceWriter]] They're on the short side, but often funny in a way I found similar to Nonjon. Also [[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/686093/Rorschach-s-Blot]]

** [[http://fp.fanficauthors.net/Harry_Potter_and_the_Last_Horcrux_final/index/][Harry Potter and the Last Horcrux]], although it's H/HR.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/White_Knight_Grey_Queen/index/][White Knight, Grey Queen]] by Jeconais.

[[http://www.fanfiction.net/u/557425/joe6991][Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time]] by joe6991 is quite epic (sequel in progress).

Apprentice Potter / Journeyman Potter / Master Potter by Draco664 is amazing, but sadly the third part is incomplete. So you might want to skip it after all.
