My latest fanfic guilty pleasure are where Harry rejects or ends things with someone rather than the other way around.

It doesn't have to be anything tied to romance although I would prefer that but I will also accept rejection of a

-platonic Friendship,

-Family so like rejecting parent/s,

-Mates (e.g soul mate, Creature mate)

- Arranged Marriage

I really liked the choices we make where Harry is told he has to marry Snape or face getting the Kiss and he chooses to get the dementors Kiss rather than marry Snape who was actually in love with him. So something like that I guess for arranged marriage

As for rejecting family it can involve his canon biological parents, siblings etc. Or a Stepparent or someone who he discovers is actually his real father and not James.

Good example is Practicing Liars were Harry doesn't trust Snape and refuses to acknowledge him as his father. Fics where Snape is his stepfather and Harry makes his dislike known are also welcome.

I would like it if Harry doesn't give in and change his mind at all but if he does end up giving in its not so soon.


** Can you link the choices we make? I'm always up for reading about Snape getting rejected.

*** linkffn( The Choices We Make by seventhSINwrath)

â€‹

unfortunately, it's only a one-shot and doesn't get too much into snape personally getting rejected what I liked about it was the people who decided on the arranged marriage didn't get their way.

there's also another snape/harry arranged marriage one shot where Harry actually does go through the wedding about is not happy about it and makes his feelings known to everyone. Snape is in love with Harry in this one too and I loved how Harry didn't give a shit but I stopped reading halfway tho because of didn't like how Harry changed his mind about Snape. id send a link but forgot the name

It's Hermione, not Harry, but there's a marriage law, Dumbledore plans to marry her to Snape to prevent her getting pawned off on some death eater who was planning to torture her to death, she changes her name and moves to the US
