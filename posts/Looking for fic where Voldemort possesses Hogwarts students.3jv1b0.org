I believe there were two parts to this fic (6th and 7th year), during the 6th Voldemort loses his body again and he seems to be gone but he's actually just jumped bodies and starts possessing Hogwarts students in order to get closer to Harry (during his 7th year).

Other details I remember (I could be confusing these from other fics since it's been a long time): it's a Harry/Ginny fic, at the beginning of the first part Harry's death is faked using some kind of illusion spell, at some point Voldemort confronts a sick Dumbledore who then "merges" with Hogwarts and tries to bury Voldemort within its walls.

It's been driving me crazy that I don't remember what it was called and I haven't been able to find it amongst my old bookmarks, hopefully someone will recognize it from this info. Thanks!


** This sounds interesting. No idea which story you mean though.
