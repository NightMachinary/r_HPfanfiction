Hello, how are you?

Well, I would like to read some story that talks a little bit about Harry's relationship with his parents,

â€‹

examples: -Harry is presumed dead, but everyone discovers that he is alive.

or

-Harry is somewhat neglected by his parents, but seeing the mistake they made they try to make peace with Harry.


** I read this two days ago and I quite enjoyed it. Fair warning it's a WIP that hasn't been updated for a couple of years.

**** Saame. I've read two others that fit your original description, but unfortunately they're both unfinished. :(

They were on fanfiction net and titled "Love and Love Again," and "Light up the Sky."

** Ah! YES! I'll go ahead and drop my story here:

Harry is presumed dead after Oct 31st (because of the prophecy), when he, in fact, is actually alive (due to certain circumstances). Harry grows up with wizarding parents, but they are very different from canon Lily and James. He does eventually meet the Potters, though.

I'll let you check it out below:

  [Book 1 of HP & the Path of Knowledge] A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and a genuine passion for magic. His new life eventually throws him on a journey for answers - those relating to his mysterious cursed scar, his unknown parentage, and the intricacies of magic itself. Alas, if only it was ever that easy... (AU Pre-Hogwarts)
