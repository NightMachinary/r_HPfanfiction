So I need help finding some new fanfics that can occupy my time. There are a few things that I would like to see in these. Firstly I'd prefer if it was a Harry/Hermione fix although Harry/Anyone is fine as long as Hermione doesn't end up with Ron. Of all the fics I've read before, the two that stand out the most to me are Heart and Soul and Vox Corpus, mostly because of the lack of lemons every two chapters, there's real character development which I enjoy. Of course I'm not opposed to anything... adult, but I don't want the story to revolve around it. As for length, the longer the better.

Thanks in advance.


** Well as you are not opposed to anything...adult, I would like to recommend one of my all time favorite stories, Forever Knight. It certainly has /ahem/ adult moments and they are not entirely unfrequent but they add to the story rather than have the story revolve around it. Harry and Hermione are adults and adults have sex. You could easily skip those scenes and not miss too much but the plot and characterization in this is phenomenal. It is always my go to rec for H/Hr fans and I have not had a complaint yet.

*** It's a great story, but since I've seen people complain about sex under the age of 18 before, I think I should mention this: The characters have sex at the age of *17*.

**** Which I am pretty sure is the age of consent for them which is like 16 or something

***** I agree, but I've seen people complain about it... so I thought I'd mention it since I know it happens here. The age of consent is 16 here too.

**** I hope so, it is definetly one of my all time favorites. Let me know what you think about it? I love hearing other opinions on it. I promise, it is a really engaging story, especially once you get to the point in the story where the prologue is

** The age of Vox Corporis (I assume that's what you meant) makes me think of linkffn(Harry Potter and the Acceptance of Fate). It's quite old - and abandoned - but it's one of the best early Harry/Hermione stories. For something newer, I'd recommend linkffn(11318985). It's recently completed and very well written, although some posters on this subreddit believe the author's works belong on [[/r/iamverysmart]].

Edit: if you /really/ want a long fic, try [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/6048][Harry Potter and the Fifth Element]] by Bexis. It's 1.42 million words long. I got around 60% of the way through but couldn't finish it due to some of the characterizations but others certainly enjoy it.

  When a young green-eyed wizard and a minimally older brown-eyed witch, the best of friends for years, discover their mutual fondness for one particular armchair in front of one particular fireplace, it can inevitably mean one thing and one thing only: War. And then also -- eventually, potentially -- something else. Maybe. But first it's definitely war.

*** Thanks, I'm not even going to attempt the abandoned story as I absolutely hate reading stories that I know will not have ended to the authors standards. The other two, even the 1.4 million word one, are definitely on my reading list. Thank you.
