Not exactly looking for character bashing, but yeah, just in the mood for what's in the title. If it's Dumbledore bashing I'd be more okay with, but I'd rather not have Weasley bashing.

I don't want Harry to become super OP.

Can be on ANY site.

Am fine with Het/Slash/Femslash

Would rather not have Harry/Hermione or Draco/Hermione, but as long as there's no Weasley bashing, (NO Ron bashing). I'll allow it.

Would rather it be completed, but if not, that's fine.

Edit: Doesn't even have to be about Voldemort himself. It could be with Hagrid and the Dragon, just ignore it; none of his business. Could be telling McGonagall about the philosopher's stone, and McGonagall doesn't do anything, so Harry doesn't do anything either. Et cetra.


** This. I so just want this :) Hagrid hatches a dragon? Well he's an adult he knows what hes doing. Stone is in danger? Tell McG. She doesn't take it seriously? Well its not like 3 kids can get though the defences to the legendary item (lol) so its probaly fine. Basilisk is loose and you know the entrance location? Tell all the teachers (then send a letter to the dmle?) And wait for them to solve it. A MC that is perfectly fine with letting the teachers know of the problem, then sitting back and waiting for them to fuck it u... i mean solve it.

*** Yes! Exactly. I want this so much. Not even with just Voldemort, but everything you stated and other instances that happened in the books.

** Does it count if he's not op, but just extremely lucky? Cops think he's all powerful, assassin's die by accident... [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/2318355/1/Make-A-Wish]]

** For some reason I lol'd. If not a fic leaning towards comedy, this would go so horribly wrong.

*** A true Harry doesn't think that a teenager can defeat Voldemort, wouldn't look for Horcruxes, he might be on the run, because if he wasn't, Voldemort would kill him. But yeah, a real Harry doesn't think that a teenager can defeat Voldemort wouldn't look for Horcruxes.

Also Harry wouldn't help Hagrid out with the dragon, he wouldn't do anything about the Philosopher's stone, he wouldn't do the things he did in canon. He'd act more like an actual kid/teenager, who wouldn't try to do these things that could put him in danger.
