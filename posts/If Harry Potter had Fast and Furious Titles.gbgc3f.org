8. Harry Potter Presents: Snape and Sirius


** I would read Harry Potter presents: Snape and Sirius. Actually I wish there was a series called Harry Potter Presents. It would be like the Old DC O Comics presents. Showcase a character or concept from the HP world. Harry Potter Presents:Tales of the Unspeakables. Harry Potter Presents: Trials of the Tolly Witch Harry Potter Presents: Marauders Mayham. Etc....

** Harry snarled as he felt the tail of his firebolt catch in the wind, asserting its unavoidable and despaired drag on his velocity. The bristles whistled menacingly - a harsh consequence of competitive racing.

A single glance showed his lead was only just, and a single look at his foe, Fred Weasley, had made him aware that only one could be the better flier.

A single snap, a jostle; bits of splinters filled the sky as the competitors traded bark in the night sky. The Fliwizard Trophy would be his.
