Hi guys I recently searched up to see if a thread like this exists, so I could see if anyone could help me with something that's been bothering me for a loong time. I read a fanfic (from fanfiction.net) that was one of the most hilarious bashing fics I've seen. The only thing I can remember from it is that dumbledore had a marriage contract on harry/ginny that backfired and resulted in him being married to molly weasley. If anyone can remember the title of this, I'd be very appreciative. Thank you


** Now I just have to read this. Someone please has the title of that thing.

  Death the One Appointment we must all keep, unfortunately Harry keeps showing up early and is upsetting Raspy's boss. Raspy isn't happy and keeps sending Harry back. This time with his memories and a warning that if he comes early again, he ends up kissing a certain toad in a sweater for eternity. This time he is sure to get it right. Bashing of D and Molly,

**** The Weasley's getting Lestrange Manor is Knowledge is Power, by robst. They get Lestrange Manor in exchange for signing over the guardianship of Ginny (though Arthur had thought it was a marriage contract), who they had planned on forcing into a marriage contract at the age of twelve in order to get money to rebuild the Burrow after Molly destroyed it in a fit of rage. That fic (like a lot of robst fics) just shits all over the entire Weasley family, minus Ginny. Ron gets reformed by the end though.

** I took a peek at it, it's ridiculous. And the reviewers were talking about "could be Albus' son (Ron) with his arrogant pure-blood attitudes like Albus" when Albus HAD no such attitudes in canon after that thing with Grindelwald (that's what she's talking about). And how he never did anything to help Muggles and Muggle borns when the book states that he always voted on pro Muggle legislation. So much so that the pure-bloods call him the old Muggle lover as an insult, but she must've missed that. I tried to laugh guys, but Dumbledore bashing just pisses me off. But that thing with Molly smashing Dumbledore...WTF?! Now that's just silly, Molly clearly loves Arthur! And of course, the twins are spared from all bashing.

** Can't find the fic myself, but by searching Dumbledore marriage contract to Molly I found a Snarry fic where it turns out most of the Weasley kids are actually the children of Albus and Molly and not Arthur.

  Harry Potter finds out that Albus Dumbledore is trying to force him to marry Ginny Weasley. With the help from Sirius and Severus, they do all they can to stop that from happening and to show Albus Dumbledore for who he truly is. Warning: Non canon, slash, some language and sexual content, MA rating, just in case. Ginny, Ron, Hermione, Molly and Albus bashing. Complete.
