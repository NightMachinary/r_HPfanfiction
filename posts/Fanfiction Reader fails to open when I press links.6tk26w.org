As the title says, Fanfiction Reader fails to open when I press a link to fanfiction.net. This only occurs in incognito mode, and I can't find a setting to change this, neither in Fanfiction Reader's settings nor in Google Chrome's. Help! I haven't really read much fanfiction recently because of this.

*** Basically any link that would go to fanfiction.net, whether it's on Space Battles, Sufficient Velocity, Reddit, or some other website. For example, if I clicked this link: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7613196/1/The-Pureblood-Pretense][The Pureblood Pretense]], it'd go to fanfiction.net instead of opening up in my app.
