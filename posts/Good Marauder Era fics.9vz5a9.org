Was reading the Marauder fic gripes thread and realized I haven't read anything in that setting. Down for anything long as it's quality, though femslash is a huge plus.


** None of these have femslash, unfortunately, but I thoroughly enjoyed all of them.

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1110486][the lost generation]] - ensemble cast with changing POVs, James/Lily and Remus/Sirius later on, canon compliant (except for the Remus/Sirius, depending on how strictly you define "compliant"), currently 350k+ words, WIP

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9106972][Glass of Water]] - Lily-centric, set in her sixth year, canon compliant except for one timeline alteration, Lily/James at the end, 49k words, complete

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14760663][Blackpool]] - Regulus-centric, canon compliant until the last chapter, gen, 63k words, complete

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4885354][Where the Air is Rarefied]] - Lily/James fluff, canon compliant, 7k words, complete

Sadly, you will not find much. There are a few plotless one-shots of the Black sisters doing it together, but other than that it is looking bleak. I asked for Lily/any woman a couple of times and the "best" (and only results) were a few Lily/Narcissa stories, which each were just one or two scenes. Definitely not something to fill an evening with.

*** Honestly I figured as much. Gay girls are under represented in fanfic as is and there aren't even any obvious pairings in that time period.

This is the main issue. In Harry's time, there are more girls than you can ship. The Marauder Era has Lily (and the Black sisters if you want to include the 60s as well). That's it. We don't even have a dozen "name only" characters to choose from.

Well, on Ao3 there are 5000 pure f/f stories (no slash or het pairings) out of 190000. That's 2.6%, which is above even the highest estimates for the percentage of lesbian people. On the other hand, gay relationships have a 38.4% share on Archive, which is a massive overrepresentation (3% max). Heterosexual relationships make out 27,9%, which is way below the actual numbers (all sources agree on above 90).
