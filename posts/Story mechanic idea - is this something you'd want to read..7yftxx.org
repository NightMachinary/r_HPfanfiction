I had this idea about 45 seconds ago as of writing this sentence and it seems to be settling quite nicely inside my head.

*The gist of it*

MC = main character

/For whatever reason MC is unable to produce magical effects externally. MC can wave a wand and incant, nothing will happen. MC can brew potions, perform herbology, apparate, make a broom fly, and enchant/transfigure objects and creature (wand-tip/ */must/* /touch the thing to produce an effect)./

With this medley of limitations, imagine Harry suffering this. What creative ways might a plucky wizard subvert expectations and be effective in life/combat? This seems like an interesting premise to craft an intriguing study of both character and magic in the world of HP.

What are your thoughts on this?


** One of my favourite fics "Almost a squib" (will edit with link shortly) works with a very similar premise, and is great fun. I'd definitely read this fic if you wrote it

  What if Vernon and Petunia were even more successfull in 'beating all that nonsense' out of Harry? A silly AU story of a nonpowerful, but cunning, Harry.

Stealth and the Imperius curse. If Imperius mechanics permit, clever orders to create an exponentially multiplying army of minions.

MC tapes a rock to the side of his wand and transfigures it into a very long spear while pointing his wand at the enemy. Essentially Lust from Fullmetal Alchemist.

Hand grenades transfigured into dragonflies.

** MC attempts Blasting Curse and it explodes the tip of his wand, breaking it. He goes to Ollivander, who created some sort of wooden wand-gauntlet.

Casting a shield charm would cause the wand-gauntlet to be shielded, so he'd have to have good hand-eye coordination to actually defend properly (ahem, seeker).

Poking people with curses/jinxes would work the same, I guess? So if MC had an invisibility cloak, just imagine them apparating around poking people with Banishers and Stunners and Body-Binds ect.

If he's holding something, he can use Wingardium Leviosa or Locomotor on it, so hand him the Sword of Gryffindor and he can stab people easy-like.

Climb walls by touching them and Summoning them?

Take one or two of your golden coins, apparate to one of the former Warsaw Pact countries, buy yourself a couple guns. Congratulations, together with the Invisibility cloak, you are now close to invincible in a fight.

I mean, you could come up with some potion based grenades or rune clusters for combat use, but short of Fiendfyre and the killing curse, guns are better suited for life/death situations than most spells.

*** That's certainly one way to do it. Went on a bit of a rant below.

--------------

However if I was to write that, I would include various obstructions the MC would need to overcome so his magic-problem is more disabling.

#+begin_quote
  Take one or two of your golden coins, apparate to one of the former Warsaw Pact countries, buy yourself a couple guns.
#+end_quote

There are alternative ways to acquire firearms locally, farmers / military installations / police headquarters. MC has to learn how to operate the firearm, no easy thing - if he goes to someone dodgy they might cause him harm, learning legally will take longer (i.e. military recruit). I am of the opinion this cannot be learned through legillimency - and MC would have to learn how to use that skill effectively as a prerequisite - very difficult.

Apparating is similar - MC has to learn how to do it safely, but he also needs to have (I believe) visited the place before he can apparate there. From canon we know that not many mages use apparition due to it's danger - it is incredibly rare for Hogwarts aged-mages to learn it, and even after learning it they may resort to safer means of transportation. Image if MC splinched himself, wouldn't want to do it again. Apparition is also tracked, underage apparition is detectable, it can also be blocked. It is also very loud and identifiable for all but a handful of mages - useless for stealth.

#+begin_quote
  together with the Invisibility cloak, you are now close to invincible in a fight.
#+end_quote

Invisibility cloak is not infallible. If we can assume MC is Harry, then we know Dumbledore can see or detect his cloak, I would also assume Voldemort is at least comparable to Dumbledore and would detect use of the cloak too. If Voldemort can't detect the cloak - MC has literally one chance to use it to destroy Voldemort - Dark Lord would have a solution for overcoming the cloak in any later encounters - if that isn't the case he's a shit-tier Dark Lord.

"Invincible" is also a colossal stretch. It can make MC effective in a narrow dimension assuming he has complete control over his battles. But who's to say an opponent wouldn't simply try to stain the cloak through magical means so it's ineffectual for the rest of the fight? A gust of wind could be conjured and MC would need to focus on ensuring it isn't ripped from his grasp - and keep them-self hidden at the same time.

#+begin_quote
  you could come up with some potion based grenades or rune clusters for combat use
#+end_quote

Another problem is how MC learns this. Is MC kicked out of Hogwarts - does MC even begin at Hogwarts or are they rejected? While at Hogwarts there are dangers due to MCs magical disability - whose to say MC wouldn't be killed or fail-out before /reaching/ 3rd year to take the Ancient Runes class. We're also assuming that Ancient Runes are capable of being easily utilized offensively - they may well only have ready defensive application, but offensively they may be too slow, or cumbersome to use. MC may simply not have the time to get good enough to use them - assuming we're battling a Dark Lord and his followers - if MC can use it, we need to assume that they can too and that some of them are better at it than he - or that they can easily counter his moves when his methods are found out.

#+begin_quote
  but short of Fiendfyre and the killing curse,
#+end_quote

Fiendfyre = Dark Magic (note the capital D in Dark). I assume there is some malevolent by-product of using Dark Magic. Crabbe died when he used it. Killing Curse is the same thing - there's also the moral quandary of presuming those you use it against are not innocent, and therefore casting it carries the risk of fracturing your soul and whatever side-effects /that/ might have. Also - seen as though Death Eaters don't throw the Killing Curse around like candy I'm going to say it's difficult as fuck to cast, and it's immensely rare to use it as a go-to spell.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Nope. Mages would quickly adapt (note Fred and George's Shield Spell clothing. It would be trivial for the enemy to develop something similar, and therefore MC has to adapt his design and apply some kind of enchantment-busting modifications to his method of dispatching people. What if we don't want to kill people, just restrain them, or knock them out?

What is easier, breaking into a rather secure complex without magic or going to a black market shorty behind the Czech/German border and buy something there? I am not saying that it is impossible to get guns in the UK, but military grade hardware is easier to find in Eastern Europe, especially in the years after the collapse where corruption and crime were rather frequent, while rather rare in Britain.

Which boils down to the question whether a common shield charm can stop a bullet, especially a passive enchantment of rather low power. And I seriously doubt that a shield hat would withstand an AK magazine at close range.

To use your own words

#+end_quote

If people are trying to kill you, you fight to kill, not to stun. Combat implies a mortal struggle, not a pastime sporting competition. There's a reason why non-lethal weapons are not part of the standard equipment of frontline soldiers but a rifle is.
