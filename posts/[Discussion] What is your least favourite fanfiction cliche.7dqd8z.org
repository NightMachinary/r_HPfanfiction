The whole sequence of

Harry escapes "Durzkaban" > Gets a letter from gringotts about accounts > calls griphook by name, who remarks Harry is an unusual wizard and suddenly becomes ultra friendly with occasional sprouts of "feral" behavioral > inheriting half of wizarding worlds wealth and finding out why Dumbledore hid it > fake marriage contracts > Goblin healers > finding out Dumbledore "locked" his powers > removing block > suddenly becoming this 7 foot beast with 12 pack abs and magical power enough to flatten the entire world > gets to know he has a marriage contract(usually Daphne) and so on.

****** [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DracoInLeatherPants][Here]] is the TV Tropes page for Draco in Leather Pants (standard TVTropes warning, abandon hope all ye who enter here) and the dictionary definition of the verb Whitewashing is to "deliberately attempt to conceal unpleasant facts about (a person or organization)."

This means that to whitewash a character is to take an evil or otherwise terrible person and make them out to be the good guy, whether that's by completely ignoring all of the shit they did or trying to make it seem like they were a noble and heroic person who was forced to do that, and is still a better person than any other character despite the fact that they ordered the genocide of an entire country or committed some other war crime.

Draco in Leather Pants is whitewashing a character because they are physically attractive.

While it severely limits the fics that I read, I also have been feeling a lot happier with what I do read.

***** Oh, I definitely agree that he is manipulative in canon. There is a big difference though between people who write manipulative!Dumbledore fics and those who keep him manipulative and somewhat true to canon. I just really don't like the former while the latter can be really great and well written. I feel like too many people just use him being manipulative as an excuse to make him as manipulative and/or stupid as possible to bash the crap out of him. Like all those fics where lemon candy is laced with suggestion potions (I still can't believe people actually include that detail in serious fics).

Better fics recognize that he is human and while they write him as manipulative to an extent it's not overdone, it's more on the realistic side of manipulative and its not used as an excuse to bash him. I do enjoy fics that point out canon ridiculousness in regards to his character though. linkffn(A Dramatic Reading by White Squirrel) was a great take on the whole finding and reading the Harry Potter books trope. It really does a good job of pointing out how Dumbledores actions are kind of messed up if taken seriously. And the best part is that it doesn't read like a bashing fic, just one that makes fun a bit of canon and Dumbledore's actions without overdoing it.

****** I also don't like seeing Dumbledore offering candy laced with suggestion potions, however another common one is veritaserum. I was wondering where you would stand on that as it isn't so much a device for influencing a person to do something, but more a means of gathering accurate information. I know it also depends on the amount of veritaserum in the candy because I find it's just plain annoying when there's so much that the character just starts spilling their guts all over the place, but I don't mind so much when it's a small enough amount that the person feels inclined to tell the truth, but is not necessarily forced to, meaning someone with a strong enough mind would still be able to mince their words and not tell the whole truth - someone like Snape, possibly Harry, Hermione or McGonagall.

******* I have the same opinion, candy with veritaserum is a completely ridiculous concept and very OOC for Dumbledore. It's also illegal and Dumbledore doesn't need to stoop that low to get information. It would also be fairly easy for someone to realize that they just spilled all their secrets due to candy. There are very specific signs of veritaserum that are easy enough to recognize.

As for why people talk with him, maybe its because they are comfortable with him? Because he is a headmaster of Hogwarts and a famous, powerful wizard? He is also a nice person and tries to get people comfortable, relaxed and makes people feel like he likes and appreciates them. There are plenty of people in real life who are really good at getting information out of people without any magic candies helping them. And when do people spill all kinds of secrets to him in canon anyways? I don't really remember any scenes where he could actually be giving people truth potions without them noticing.

******** Exactly. I am tolerate - and sometimes write - the use of veritaserum, but only ever in such a small dose that it has little or no bearing on the outcome other than causing a character or group of characters to be wary. I mean, if someone like Lucius Malfoy was trying to come over to the light side, Dumbledore would probably be pretty wary, so I could understand him resorting to veritaserum then - although as far as I know, he didn't use it for Snape, which is a very similar situation.

** I like the idea of soul-bonding. I haven't read a fic yet that has soul-bonding that didn't make me roll my eyes within an hour. So I guess I'd say it's the most disappointing cliche.

The idea that a bond creates a connection between two people is fun, but my issue is that with pretty much all of these stories there is no basis for the connection to be made, and it's almost always accidental.

What I've been looking for is something that takes two characters who actually seem to know each other in the story (meaning that it doesn't start with the soul-bonding incident) and the then the bonding happens, so it makes the connection have an eventual deeper level. If you start out with it the entire relationship being shown feels shallow from beginning to end. They automatically understand each other to the furthest extent you can know someone.

Or somethink Crack-ish where a character is in a situation mixed with hate/lust accidental connection is made where magic just senses great passion between two people and BAM soul-bond with someone you actually hate. Sounds like a nice guilty pleasure story, but it's something I haven't found.

So yeah. Soul-bonding...ehhh. :(

** Least favorite fanfiction cliche?

Molly and Ginny were secretly giving Harry a love potion to make him love Ginny. Hermione and Ron weren't true friends of his and were just using him for his money and fame. Harry had a ton of bank accounts at Gringotts and was the lord/heir/inheritance of not only Potter, but Malfoy, Black, Slytherin ect extra.

Ice Princess/Ice Queen Daphne Greengrass. The fact that Daphne is written so much at all is pretty much a cliche since her name was mentioned what? Once in canon. But I don't see her as the Ice Princess/Ice Queen

After saving Hermione, Ginny, Gabrielle ect extra he gets to have his own harem basically.

Child Abuser James and Lily: I see them loving their son, even if he wasn't the Boy-Who-Lived and it was someone else.

The Wrong Boy/Girl Who Lived plot where everyone thinks that it's Harry's sister or brother but it turns out to be Harry all along (Gasp who would have thought). I'd love to read stories where people think it's Harry through out and it actually is. Or think it's Harry and it's actually his sister or brother. Now that would be a twist.

Goblins being nice because Harry was respectful to them and used a title for them and everything. (This normally ties into the whole everyone who was good was actually out to get his fame and fortune cliche).

Cliches where the only thing that Ron and Hermione do in the stories is argue with each other and that's all they do. I get that they argued a lot in the series, but that's not all they did in the series.

One of the reasons why I dislike Harry/Hermione as a pairing is because of how fanfiction has written them together. Harry suddenly ends up super powerful or super smart, Hermione ends up being the perfect girl just so Harry doesn't end with anyone else. I think I'd enjoy the pairing more if it was written believably, but unfortunately more often then not both characters just seem so out of character. And then the whole jealousy thing that writers have to do with Ron, that really throws me off. Sure I can see him getting jealous, that's what he does; but in the end he'll be happy for his friends and would still want to be friends with them. (That's how I see it anyway if they got together).

Also cliches where every Weasley except for Fred and George and sometimes Arthur are complete jerks to Harry for his fame and money; which ties back to the earlier thing I said.

I remember there was one fic where Hermione was thinking about why she and Ron couldn't work and her conclusion was that after he left them in the tent she just couldn't trust him to stick around when the shit hit the fan. Which is, imo, a legit concern.

Anyway there were a lot of comments accusing the author of bashing Ron.

And I mean, I can sort of understand why Ron fans would automatically be defensive of him, because he's an easy character to bash. But there's a difference between pointing out a character's flaws and bashing them.

** *Assuming an exploit*

This is more of a common /theme/ than a specific plot element. It is best illustrated by some examples:

- Magically binding agreements exist in canon but they are not used extensively to guarantee loyalty and honesty across society. Since the limitations on oaths/contracts are not explicitly explained, the author assumes that there are no limitations and wizards are just too stupid to have seen the exploit.

- Veritaserum exists in canon but is not used extensively in trials. Since its limitations are not explained (though actually they have been by JKR in interview) the author assumes that there are no limitations and wizards are just too stupid to have seen the exploit.

Basically it's where an author sees an absence of an explicit explanation in canon and assumes a plot hole rather than something that the reader just doesn't know (but which wizards do).

I think it's far more interesting worldbuilding to fill in the gaps in the reader's knowledge in ways which are consistent with the rest of the magic system and world, rather than assume that the world has huge holes in it.

**** There's a difference between stupidity and lacking logic. A logic is simply a formal system of reasoning. There are many different types of logical systems, depending on what axioms you assume.

It is probably more accurate to say that wizards use different logic to Muggles than to say they do not have logic at all. They use a logic which makes sense to them within the norms of their world.

For example, the law of excluded middle is a feature of most logical systems (but not all). Basically this states that something can be either true or false but it cannot be both or neither. That works pretty well for us Muggles because the world /generally/ behaves like that. But for wizards such a logical rule would seem nonsensical. They interact with things that are simultaneously in two different states on a daily basis.

*** I use glamours in my story to change the character's appearance in a way that makes other characters second-guess who they're looking at. I use minor changes, like adding or hiding freckles, making the face appear slightly longer or narrower, changing the shade of their hair a bit, hiding scars (very rarely do I create scars) using makeup to change the shape of the lips or eyes, or any combination of the above. The idea is that the person would look to most other characters like a familiar face that they can't quite place, but characters who are close to that person would recognise their voice and mannerisms. If I don't want close characters to recognise them, the character will consciously try to change their mannerisms and voice, sometimes successfully, sometimes not.

There's also doppelgängers to consider; most people are aware that everyone has a doppelgänger out there somewhere, or a very similar looking person. If they were to see, say, Hermione in a place where nobody would expect to find her - let's say, a strip club for example - but she looked ever-so-slightly off, most people would go, “Oh, they have a Hermione Granger dancer!” rather than, “Hermione Granger is a stripper?” - At least, that's what my friends and I thought when we went to a show with a Chris Hemsworth look alike.
