So we know that a pureblood is born to two purebloods, a muggleborn is born to two muggles, and a half blood is born to a muggle/muggleborn and a pureblood. But that hardly covers all bases.

So what is a wizard born to two muggleborns? A muggle and a half blood? A pureblood and a half blood? Two half bloods? Also is a non-magical person still a squib if born to a wizard/witch and a muggle?


** Blood statuses aren't exactly scientific classifications but rather whatever is convenient to discriminate against those who don't have the resources and connections to fight against it.

** You are muggleborn if all four grandparents are muggles, pureblood if all four are wizards, half-blood if any other configuration.

*** What about Squibs? Is the Son of a muggle and a Squib considered a Half Blood or a Muggleborn?

I remember a fic that made Tracey Davies the daughter of 2 Squibs. The fic called her "technically pure blood but treated as mudblood", but how would canon treat it? I don't think Rowling never was clear about the statues of Squibs.

**** Squibs are treated as wizards for the purpose of blood status unless they choose to live in the muggle world.

** Most authors have it be something like a pureblood being someone with all four grandparents and both parents being wizards and witches or if you know how closely you're related to muggles you're not a 'real' purebood.

Aa half-blood the same on at least one side.

Everything else a muggleborn pretty much .

Quarter-blood and all that I haven't seen used before honestly, sounds silly, then again muggleborn does too- it doesn't fit the blank-blood formula and Muggle sounds like an insult (because it is, dictionary: a person who is not conversant with a particular activity or skill. ). Instead Muggleborns should (and sometimes are, at least to and among themselves) be called New-Bloods. Hell, mudbloods fits the scheme better which makes me think it's only recently within the past few decades that it hasn't been a word spoken in polite company much like the N word.

There's also Creature-Blood aka Creature inheritance aka half-breed, some bits of goblin, elf, giant and such somewhere in your heritage as long as there's some form of visible manifestation or you're stupid enough to let it leak to the bigots.

Probably, I doubt they care to differentiate them as most consider both beneath their notice.. I think the difference it's more about having enough magic to see magical places like Hogwarts if not enough to do magic in such a case.

** I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that we never get any real explanation for how "half blood" is defined. My assumption/interpretation has always been that if you're not a pure blood and you're not a muggleborn, then you're a half blood. I think the real sticking point is defining just how "pure" your blood has to be, which, going by real world eugenics/general racism, is /very/. I, for instance, have pale skin and am generally super white, but I've got a black grandparent, and thus would be considered black by most people who care (ie racists).

** I did once create a pseudoscientific-sounding way of calculating that for a creepy fascist dictatorship I never wrote, based somewhat on the Nuremberg Laws. Basically, for every magical grandparent add 1/8th, and then for every magical parent add 1/4, and that gives you a fraction that tells you how pureblooded you are.
