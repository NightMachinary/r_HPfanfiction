With that, the boggart was gone, fleeing from the window to some deeper darkness, perhaps to give one of the venerable neighbors in Godric's Hollow a terrible fright. In the room lay only darkness and two young friends. They sat in silence, the two of them, save for choked sobs, muffled from beneath fair hair, held closely in Albus's arms.

How very strange it was, to see him so emotional, to see something besides a confident, easy smile on the boy's face. It was enough to give Albus a shameful sort of pleasure, to see something so rare, as if it would somehow tie them together irrevocably. His long, thin fingers worked their way into blonde hair, damp from rain and sweat. Gellert the cunning, Gellert the brave, Gellert the boy who was always sure that his course of action was the correct one, seemed so frail, so painfully human. Would that he had only seen Gellert's boggart, to steal a glance into that enigmatic mind. Albus's voice stole into the silence and dissolved it, as swiftly as sugar. "What did you see, friend?"

With the silence went Gellert's frailty, his weakness. All at once the sobbing ceased, and his body stiffened as he set himself apart from Albus's embrace. His expression turned hard, and his speech mechanical. "I saw an old man with nothing he had ever worked to earn. I saw one hundred thousand failures, all laid out before me plainly, though indescribably. He was at death's door with nothing. I saw a future of mine that I cannot allow." His arms went out in front of him, and he moved to stand. "Leave me. I should like to read in quiet."

At this, Albus was wiser than to press his friend for more. He did as he was bidden and left, deciding to feel content over the moment of vulnerability they had shared.


** I really like it! The dynamic between Albus and Gellert is so unexplored, and even when I do see stories about them they just feel like extended versions of what we already know happened. I like that you're already starting off with something new that wasn't mentioned in canon.

I really like the old-fashioned sounding dialogue. It seems appropriate, as long as you can do it consistently.

Great job, I can't wait to read more! Where will you post it?

** Interesting idea.

Some comments:

#+begin_quote
  the boggart was gone, fleeing from the window to some deeper darkness
#+end_quote

I don't think they would be able to see the boggart fleeing since no one knows its true form because they can never see it without it turning into their fear. Do you mean as a mist-like creature from the movies?

#+begin_quote
  Gellert the cunning, Gellert the brave, Gellert the boy who was always sure that his course of action was the correct one, seemed so frail, so painfully human.
#+end_quote

Are you going to give some sort of backstory on this? Not many people knew about Grindelwald's origins, so I don't believe that people would say those sorts of things.

#+begin_quote
  "What did you see, friend?"
#+end_quote

Did Albus look away? He would have seen Grindelwald's boggart.

#+begin_quote
  I saw a future of mine that I cannot allow.
#+end_quote

I think you should expand on this. A boggart shows its viewer's greatest fear. Make it more substantial.

#+begin_quote
  Leave me. I should like to read in quiet.
#+end_quote

I know the times were different but I don't think Grindelwald would command Dumbledore like that. They were equals.

I don't mean to belittle or anything, just giving some constructive criticism. I enjoyed reading it and liked your style of writing. Is this going to be a complete fic? I recommend reading into The Snape Chronicles. (I'll link below.) Looking forward to future updates!

*** It's going to be a complete fic. This bit was without context because the context is a bit dry. In the complete version the following points are addressed:

#+begin_quote
  boggart was gone
#+end_quote

When it left, it was the "riddikulus" version of Albus's boggart, which it shifted to as soon as Albus entered the room as he heard Gellert scream.

#+begin_quote
  Gellert the Cunning
#+end_quote

A big theme in the story is going to be Gellert as he is vs Gellert as he is perceived by Albus. It's like any abusive relationship; you're blind to someone's flaws until it is far, far too late.

#+begin_quote
  What did you see, friend?
#+end_quote

See above

#+begin_quote
  I saw a future of mine that I cannot allow.
#+end_quote

A few boggarts are somewhat insubstantial, and invoke inexplicable psychosomatic associations. Hermoine's was stated to be a sense of failure, or McGonagall telling her that she had failed an exam of some sort. Gellert is hesitant to explain the whole of it because he is very guarded. Essentially, he sees himself as the emaciated old man he becomes, close to death, without any of the Hallows.

#+begin_quote
  Leave me. I should like to read in quiet.
#+end_quote

Another theme I'm going to push. Dumbledore is older, if only by a year, Dumbledore graduated, Dumbledore is already accomplished as a junior wizard, but Grindelwald is something unattainably brilliant to him. Abeforth sees Gellert for the harder sides of him, for his pathos and his disregard for human well-being, but Albus sees his intelligence, his ambition, and what he believes is a guarded spark of emotion. In those early days, before Ariana dies, he would follow Gellert to the end of the world. Edit: And he is so desperate, after his mother's death robbed him of his chance for immediate adventure, so self absorbed, that he would let Gellert push him around a bit for the sake of riding on his coat tails. And a future evil wizard overlord would be nothing if not commanding.

As someone with direct experience in this regard, you've got Albus pegged:

#+begin_quote
  It was enough to give Albus a shameful sort of pleasure, to see something so rare, as if it would somehow tie them together irrevocably ... He did as he was bidden and left, deciding to feel content over the moment of vulnerability they had shared.

These lines gave me chills. Really well done to convey Albus' side of the relationship.

Are you interested in a second beta? I love editing things. (: PM me, and I'll give you my email.

#+begin_quote
  We have the testimony of Harry, but witnesses can be notoriously unreliable, especially when they have only part of the story. This is a biography of Severus Snape from his birth until his death. It is canon-compatible, and it is Snape's point of view.
