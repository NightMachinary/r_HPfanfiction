And if you're already busy with a story or two, how annoyed are you at this new idea?


** I'm a graduate student and I have a small online business that I run. So I'm a fairly busy guy. But I had an idea that I couldn't give up to someone else and I wanted to write it. I've never written a fanfic before.

I've only written a 1000 words so far (at best 1% of the story). I'll probably actually get into writing it after this semester ends for me (in a week, actually). But right now it's definitely annoying in that it distracts me from things that are actually a priority.

*** I used to run like that, unwilling to share my ideas. Then i realized that no one will steal my idea because even if someone else writes the idea and potentially better than I can, they still can't write MY story.

**** Well, I don't mind someone writing the same story better than me. But I kind of wanted to be first (assuming that I am first). Not that my story is wholly original either, but its something that I definitely haven't seen in fanfic.

** I saw a request for fics where Harry is a Dragon Animagus,and i was so tempted to post "There should be a HP and HTTYD crossover where Harry's Animagus form is a Night Fury."

*** I've been kicking around an httyd/hp crossover for a while where harry's souls is stuck in hiccups body after hiccup is killed by a lightning strike.

I also have the hpverse and the berkverse taking part in my [[http://colesint.blogspot.com/2016/01/literary-high-ennealogy.html][literary high]] series.

I would love to see that, in fact, i may use it if I ever have need of animagus!harry---oooh, actually, i WILL be using it, in linkffn(stranger in a strange land by cole pascal) when Astrid joins our castaways.

** Hogwarts, her surroundings land (farms, forbidden forest), residents (teachers, students, animals from forest, elf etc) transport to empty peninsula (or some land) of somewhere Westeros.

Headmistress McGonagall is nothing if not defensive of Hogwarts, and send people (read adults) to spy on world outside, and prepare to inevitability.

(Every year they find new children on their doorstep and news is world is somehow being destroyed. Hogwarts's disappearing act is magic saving their children- or find another cause, author's choice)

They do small business of cloth, colored glasses etc to outside world (7 kingdom), but stay discreet.

Few years later little by little people find about Hogwarts's people (give some awesome name), and story begins.

Game of Thrones/Harry Potter crossover, BAMF!McGonagall, Lady of House Hogwarts. Sneaky use of magic. Discreet magic people.

This plotbunny was eating me alive. Someone please make it happen.

** Mine is:

#+begin_quote
  When Ciri realizes she's immortal, a sorceress tells her the only way to finally age and die is to find her soulmate.

  Enter Harry Potter, battlescarred master Auror and world champion duelist, freshly realizing he's immortal and suicidal after an AK does nothing again.

  Ciri, Mistress of Space and Time, jumping from world to world finally finds her soulmate in the Master of Death who's more than ready to leave his world behind in hopes he'll age with the most beautiful woman he's ever met.

  The two soon find themselves hunted by a new threat out to harvest both their talents and conquer to multiverse to instill 'order.'

  Told from ciri's pov with occasional switches to harry's? Or swap with each chapter where that character would be more comfortable(harry would be more comfortable on warehouse 13 world, ciri would be more comfortable on sword of truth world(mmmm kahlan!)).

  She teaches him how to fight with a sword, he teaches her how to pair it with a magically modified guns and rifles, and a custom wand that works by intent but has to be recharged with the blood of monsters.

  Lots of jumping from world to world as each world will have a person or an item that is necessary to battle the oncoming order, perhaps becoming a mega crossover with sisko, prof x, nick fury(or skye for a poly fic?), an item from warehouse 13(potentially with myka coming along for controlling it/more poly?), and so on. Each chapter/world is a self contained adventure but advances the overall plot.

*** I once had the idea for a multiverse fic in which Harry and Hermione have the amulet stolen during the Horcrux hunt, and he follows the thieve through his dimension jump. Harry ends up jumping into the Avengers universe where he gets SHIELD to help him find the dimension jumper. They find out he jumped again and follow only to stumble into a world of Ice and Fire.

It just goes on and on. The next world is a spacestation from The Expanse, Gotham City, then they end up in Middle Earth, on Coruscant, in the Witcher universe, in Hyrule, the Dragon Age universe, Fallout, Skyrim, and so on and so forth.

I wanted him to get a bunch of allies throughout the story. I especially loved the idea of Harley Quinn being possessed by Majora and running off to smash some moons into some worlds.

***** That they do. And honestly, I would just be annoyed if I'd had to fabricate some ritual every time they take a jump.
