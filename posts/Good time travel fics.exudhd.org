It seems like a lot of time travel fics are overly clich√©, lack grammar, or both. Are there any really good time travel fics out there? Must be harry centric, preferably over 20k words and preferably not hinny


** [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19364248/chapters/46071916][Kings Cross Redux]] To Maurarder's era

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/3155057/1/][Altered Destinies]] Goes back in time during Tom's younger years, cannot recommend this one enough!!

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5511855/1/][Delenda Est]] Marauder era, tangled in with Bellatrix

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4536005/1/][Oh god not again]] Back to Hogwarts years, crack fic but sooo funny. It's probably what you were talking about with the cliches, but it adds all of them and makes fun of it.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12813755/1/][Disorder of the Phoenix]] Back to 5th year, but as an adult not to his past body

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11434139/1/][Brand New Start]] Goes back to raise himself

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6820445/1/][Harry Potter and the Phoenix Burning]] Marauder era, but at age of 11

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12868582/1/][Easier than falling asleep]] Wakes up on morning of last task

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/6985795/1/][Xerosis]] Dark Harry do-over

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1922112/1/][Crumbling Pedestal]] Goes back to Founders era

I have more (and even more non-Harry centric) but there was way too many to do, so if you liked any just let me know and I can do more!!

If anyone else in this thread wants the non-harry ones let me know too!

** Nightmares of Futures Past used the cliches before they were cool ;). Its biggest weakness IMO is that it's incomplete and only updates once every few years.

#+begin_quote
  Hermione quite literally crashes her way back through time by roughly twenty years. There is no going back; the only way is to go forward. And when one unwittingly interferes with time, what one expects may not be what time finds...
