Anyone know of any good fics (preferably long and complete) that feature a Voldemort who is ruthless and cunning - or alternatively, one who retains Tom Riddle's charming persona?

A good example would be The Many Deaths of Harry Potter. n


** linkffn(3766574)

Prince of the Dark Kingdom. Lily and James Potter fled Britain shortly after harry's birth. With no Harry to stop him, Voldemort wins the war and drives Dumbledore from Britain.

Appearing as a handsome man who couldn't possibly be older than 30, Lord Voldemort rules over Magical Britain with something approaching an iron fist. he is simultaneously charming and terrifying, incredibly powerful with a penchant for flexing his magical muscles at the slightest provocation. He also has something of a soft spot for the newly-returned-to-Britain Harry Potter.

unfortunately, it seems to have been abandoned, though there is still 147 chapters, so its a decent read.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/Emperor][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185): he retained his good look, he rebuilt a much larger power base, and [[/spoiler][he was playing the same role as Sauron in Numenor with the Russians]].

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11080542/1/Patron][Patron]], linkffn(11080542): Dumbledore was on top of his game, Harry was proactive, Fudge wasn't an idiot, Lockhart wasn't a fraud, Umbridge wasn't nearly that bad, but that would still not be enough if Aberforth and Hermione didn't pick up the slack. Voldemort was terrifying in this story.

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

** My fic is still in its infancy, but it will feature a ruthless and cunning Voldemort, and one who retains Tom's charming persona, to an extent.
