Can be anything in the title, would prefer the british emire, the roman empire and ww1 and 2.


** The best story in this category is in my opion linkffn(A long journey home), and by a large margin.

fem!Harry is sent back to ancient Egypt, and we get glimpses as she lives forward through time, until she finally arrives in the present.

Highlights include the well written and alive worlds, the great characters (including Jasmine) and overall compelling plot.

The story begins in the present, but you can simply start at the first chapter of the Merlin arc (look at the chapter titles for that) if you want to.

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

*** I tried reading that one, but since flash backs and non-linear storylines drive me nuts, I couldn't get past the first few chapters. I would have preferred it if the story had just followed Jasmine to the past and then went through her adventures in sequence.

** In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/284278/chapters/453146][If Them's the Rules]] Harry travels back in time to the period before/during WWII. He takes up service as a "Witness" for the seer Cassandra Trelawney, meaning that it's his duty to go witness the important events in her visions and record his memories of them for posterity. He experiences what life was like in England as the war was ramping up, and he witnesses some important speeches and attacks during the war.

  Unable to accept the aftermath of the war, Harry decides to travel back in time to become the parent Tom Riddle obviously should have had. Except that things don't go as planned and Harry finds himself part of a game with hidden rules, trying to survive while raising a boy whose understanding of family has nothing to do with love.
