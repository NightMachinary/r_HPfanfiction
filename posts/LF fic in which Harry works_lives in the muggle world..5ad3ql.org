I'm looking for a fic that's half wizarding world half muggle world. Anyone got something? I already read that really popular one which name I forgot. Harry gets a muggle GF and its still WIP. Anyway, does someone have a nice fic for me? Don't care for pairings or if it's romance or action or drama.

Thanks!

Edit: it's Grow Young With Me!


** linkffn(Betrayed by kateydidnt) - Harry is screwed over, saves the day and then does a runner. Years later, a young muggleborn girl new to Hogwarts tries to contact him and unlike every other attempt, he answers her.

linkffn(Behind Blue Eyes by paffy) A local Surrey girl catches Harry's eye and they have a very realistic 90's British thing, until he has to go back to school and she comes along for her own safety. Complete but with partial sequel; this might be the one OP referenced.

linkffn(The Refiner's Fire by Abraxan) First dozen or so chapters feature Harry in a summertime job/romance that then turns tragic, activating his buried Super Saiyan... I mean, Sorcerer powers.
