Hello all,\\
Working on a story for the first time in a long time and I am wondering if Muggleborn wizards who are 21ish in 1992 would be familiar with the Indiana Jones movie. I know it came out in '81 when these characters were about 11 and would still have been involved enough in Muggle world to see a new movie, but don't know if it was popular in Britain at all\\
As an aside I hope this question is okay here if anyone had a good resource for such "Britpick" questions, please let me know.


** I would say so - I was born in '89 (in the UK) and am familiar with Indiana Jones despite never having actively sought out any of the movies. They're on telly quite often so I imagine they might have caught them during the school holidays at some point even if they never saw them at the cinema!

*** Perfect! I have some muggle born acquaintances of Bill Weasley laughing at a Pureblood elitist who is rocking the Indiana Jones look while they are working Egypt.

** Almost certainly yes. The films are on TV almost constantly, plus there were a lot of adverts, comedy sketches and so on that played with elements from the series. I don't think I ever saw any of the films on the big screen but I've seen them several times anyway.

** One Britpicking (or perhaps '90spicking) point which bothers me lately: in 1990s nobody (at least in Europe) would call any woman “Ms.”, we were still pretty sticky to “Mrs.”, “Miss” duality. Especially with a stiff conservative Professor McGonagall it is absolutely impossible her calling Ginny Weasley as “Ms. Weasley”. It was “Miss Weasley” always.

**** I did too at first, but it actually came about because women wanted something neutral, that didn't encode marital status (miss being unmarried, mrs. being married).

**** No, it's the post-feminist creature, because authors claimed (and they were mostly right) that distinguishing women on pre-marriage and post-marriage is sexist. And as a Czech, where we still mostly do slečna/paní (Czech equivalents), it is also horrible bother: will you offend this lady to call her Miss (and she is just so proud to be married) or Mrs. (and she will kill you, because she is trying hide her age).

*** Another thing is tattoos. They definitely weren't mainstream in the seventies, so I find it kinda jarring in marauders era fics. Maybe Sirius would get one as a big "fuck you!" to his ultra-conservative parents, but otherwise I'm not buying it.

*** It's interesting how the Mrs/Miss distinction disappeared in different countries at different times. My mum told me she was pretty annoyed when people called her "Fräulein" (the German equivalent for Miss) in the 1980s.

*** While we're at it, can we mention that British English uses "write /to/ me" rather than "write me", and so on? I see that one so much.

** Someone that age would have been absolutely ALL OVER Indiana Jones when it came out, as the first movie was released while they were at Primary School. Source: I was at Primary School when that movie came out, and was all over it.

** No. Indiana Jones is stricltly verboten

The only movie that can exist in fanfiction is Jurassic Park.

Maybe the occasional Star Wars reference
