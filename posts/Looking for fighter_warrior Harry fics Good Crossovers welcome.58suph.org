I really love fics that kind of play with the idea of Harry having some kind of combat skill. It can be a bit rare these days but i really want to find more.

Any of the things on this list that you know where to find, Please! send my way.

- Sword wielder
- martial artist
- battle mage
- physical augmentation
- anything where fights are more common, but aren't dependent on spell slinging

Things i absolutely want to stay away from

- Any of the standard Bad Fic Tropes
- Harem
- godlike harry
- Original Characters ( this includes bullshit like Daphne or Susan, Fleur and tonks are ok though)
- preferably no Harry/Ginny

Also any long crossovers that you like that have Harry develop new skills would be very much enjoyed! Primarily in this regard i try to keep the story at Hogwarts for the most part, and i try to keep the crossovered world from completely dominating the HP one. things like having half the Bleach/ Naruto/ Percy Jackson cast showing up for a year at Hogwarts, Not Welcome unless its a phenomenal story.


** You could always try the HP/Witcher crossover I've been writing linkffn(The Lesser Kindness), which features Harry as a swordsman. That being said it is a very heavy crossover: it takes place in the crossover universe, and there's little to no dependence on HP lore beyond the characters and their personalities. That and I'm not sure how friendly the fic is to people who aren't super familiar The Witcher series, so if you're not familiar with TW, the fic might not be for you.

  It goes without saying that a witcher's life is one of thankless peril: brutal training, mutations, vagrancy, and all they get for it are insults and a few coins to tide them over to the next contract. Still, to be a witcher is to lead an fascinating life, and Harry tries to make the most of his. Heavy AU.

*** Daphne and Susan EXIST, yes but they were given almost no development or personality beyond a few lines across the series. For me and some others, when authors use them, its nothing more than giving an OC a name and face from the original series.

I'll admit i have a bit of a double standard, i dont mind an OOC main character, but if a character had no personality in the original series, i dont want them to be a big player in the story.

**** Yep, that sounds pretty hypocritical. Harry is very likely to make friends with people he wouldn't have if he was OOC, it's like saying that he should get the same wand, even though he is OOC, it's just an excuse for writers to not have creativity.

***** Its not always a lack of creativity, Some people just like to see the changes an action can cause. Mostly i try to find stories, that take place within the base series, with one or two changes that at some point change the skills of characters but does not fuck up the characters complete personality. Its why i read so many crossovers.

mostly i dont read a story to read an original work, i read fanfiction to moreso see the reactions of characters when introduced to a new event/power. I love to see a good portrayal of how hogwarts reacts to events of change, Harry has always been Our eyes into the series, and i dont mind him being different, as long as we get to see how everyone else changes with it. I dont get that with Susan or Daphne because they werent in the original series, i have no connection to them and since so many people use what is essentially the Fannon personalities for them, i never care for them once i read the names.

****** This is what I love about fanfic. Everyone can find what they like. Different people have different tastes. There are dozens of kinds of HP fic. Some people like the freedom to play around more than others do. Some people are looking for mpreg slash with OCs in a world where Harry is half goblin, some people want stuff that's very close to canon and very original flavor. Whatever you want, it's out there. Unfortunately sometimes it's very badly written, but it /is/ out there.

******* Well said!

Personally my flair for fanfiction lends itself more toward Anime Crossovers because of the ability to add in powers and events without changing the entire world.

Seems to me that someone like SuperAlexIY lends themselves to more original takes on the HP universe with strong character interaction.

Neither are bad takes on fanfiction, they are just for different people.

** You might like the matou shinji series, it's 5 fics covering years 1-5 each between 100-270k words; is a fate stay night crossover where mc lacks magic circuits so thinks he is failure then gets hog warts letter, and leaves Japan. lots of good magical fights, and exploration of both traditional magic and the eastern magic from fate stay; features a very competent Lockhart as mentor as well. It kinda seems haremy at points but the mc is denser than a black hole and just views them as friends is eventual mc/Luna and Harry/daphne but no smut scenes. On mobile or would link

*** Thanks for the rec but I've seen the Shinji series in the Fate/HP crossover guide pretty regularly and I just cant bring myself to read them. I love Fate, but Shinji is one of those characters that i hate beyond hate. And because of that even if he doesn't act like the Rape happy asshole from the source, i cant enjoy him.

One of my major rules for fanfiction, if i dont like a character in the base series, i will rarely/ not read a fic that focuses on them. Its one reason why i do not enjoy Good!Draco stories, i hated that prat in the books, i dont care if hes a good guy in a fanfic, i cant differentiate the two in my mind.

** Well, best one /I/ know of is linkffn(The Black Prince by cxjenious), an HP/GoT crossover where Harry is Prince Harrold Baratheon, son of King Robert Baratheon and Queen Cersei Lannister, basically replacing Tommen. I know virtually nothing of GoT, yet found this to be a great read.

  He remembers being Harry Potter. He dreams of it. He dreams of the Great Other too, a beast borne of ice and death with eyes red as blood and an army of cold dead things. He is the second son of the king, a spare, but his fortunes change when secrets rather left in the dark come to light, and Westeros is torn asunder by treachery and ambition. Winter is coming, but magic is might.
