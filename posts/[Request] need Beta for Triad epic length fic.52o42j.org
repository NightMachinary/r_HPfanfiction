Hi!

I'm currently working on a WIP that hasn't been uploaded yet. (I'd like to make a decent dent in it before posting) It is a HP triad fic, with the likelihood to go over 100K+ words (actually probably over that too).

*Summary:* Hermione pieces the conspiracies surrounding Harry, and does the only thing she can to ensure the safety of Harry: sending him with Sirius as he's escaping. AU

*Rating:* NC-17 (MA)

*Pairing:* Harry/Hermione/Draco (Triad)

*Genre:* Friendship / Adventure / Romance / Action / Fantasy

*Need Help With:* Grammar, Spelling, Character growth and etc, Plotting, Courtship (Pureblood/magical etiquette)

*Warnings/Contains:*

- 100k+ fic
- Strong explicit language (though I try not to be crude)
- Major AU-- different school
- Magical racism -- a lot of mythology from all over the world
- Mental and Emotional turmoil (we're talking major character development)
- Blood, death and gore
- Slash
- Polyamorous relationships
- Explicit sexual content (though nothing will happen until their magical majority)-- D/s undertones

*Other:* Team player I'm looking to have a min of two betas. So it's important to get along. You need to be able to bounce ideas around. There will be a lot of mythology (from all around the world) and species in the fic--so if you have some knowledge in that--/Yay Bonus!/

If you're interested, I can send you further notes.

Cheers!

*** I played around with it a lot and am still figuring it out. If it's not Draco, it'll probably be an OC unless the fic manages to develop a different way.

Personally, I love redemption characters--which is why I have been leaning towards Draco.

**** That's a fantastic trio! Don't change it just because some people don't like slash. One of my favorite WIPs is Harry/Hermione/Draco.

***** That can be an option as well. I'm a firm believer in letting relationship build before having a solid pairing. I'm pretty much open to most if not all pairings.

The way I have the story mapped out, Hermione will need some character to help her through the mental and emotional stress.

Harry will also need something to tie him down to Britain (Hogwarts) when he leaves--because in reality Voldemort and DE are creating a civil war. He's going to be fairly busy with international issues.

*** I have plans for Ron and his growth doesn't angle in a way that his character would be open to the idea.
