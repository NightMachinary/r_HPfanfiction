Maybe genius is too strong, more like gifted or talented. Sirius said he didn't need to study for the o.w.l.s and wasn't stressed out at all. I myself was the type of student who did minimal amounts of studying but got good grades. Bonus points for interactions with Hermione where she's baffled at how Harry manages to get solid grades, despite not studying.

Hermione is smart and works harder than everyone so it makes sense that she would be the best in their year. But it would be interesting to see a Harry who is just as smart but doesn't try as hard and still gets good grades. Kinda like the marauders or the Weasley twins.


** This is Harry the Hufflepuff, exactly... for a given definition of lazy.

  Luckily, lazy came up in Petunia's tirades slightly more often than freak, otherwise, this could have been a very different story. AU. Not your usual Hufflepuff!Harry story.
