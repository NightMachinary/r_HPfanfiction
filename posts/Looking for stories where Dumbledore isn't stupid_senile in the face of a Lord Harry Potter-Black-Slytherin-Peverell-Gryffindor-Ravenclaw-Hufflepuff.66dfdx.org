Looking for Lord Harry-That's-A-Huge-Number-Of-Fucking-Titles where Dumbledore isn't stupid or senile, and doesn't just roll over oblivious like Humpty Dumpty when Harry does stuff.

TL;DR - OP!Harry stories Dumbledore actually has a brain and a pair of balls. Sometimes I wonder whether Grindelwald ripped them off while he and Dumbledore were a thing.

  What if when Draco challenged Harry to a duel at the beginning of first year it had a lot more significance then either realized? A duel not only for bragging rights but for injustice and eventual love. Harry/Harem

** If he was really evil and manipulative and not stupid and senile this is what he would do: "Hello Harry. Want a lemon drop?" Harry thinks lemon drops are drugged. He is wrong.

/Chloroform gas starts flowing into the room from panels in the floor./

/Dumbledore uses a localized bubble head charm to purify air for himself while Harry is knocked out/

Dumbledore obliviates Harry until he is basically canon Harry.

THERE PROBLEM SOLVED

** I think Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw is what your looking for. Dumbledore doesn't Harry is Lord bla bla bla, but he's not an idiot either, IMO anyway.

Prince of Slytherin also has a pretty smart and active Dumbledore, though Harry doesn't have a bunch of titles he acts like he does.

How is suspecting Harry as a potential “dark lord” and pre-emtpively organising for him to be sent to Azkaban not a sign of a stupid and cliche Dumbledore?

This is a somewhat entertainingly written crackfic that uses the Rightful Indignation™ Indulgence to kick-start the badass indie-Harry plot, and the stupid Dumbledore trope is a rather frequent visitor in it.

#+begin_quote
  (1.1) Fate sighed. “Dumbledore saw the rise of two Dark Lords in his life, both of which he felt partly responsible for, and he was terrified to see another. When a prophecy spoke of a boy who was the Dark Lord's equal, who'd have a power the Dark Lord knew not, he tried to control events such that the prophecy child would not be a threat to the wizarding world as he saw it.”

  (1.2) For some reason, the headmaster really didn't like him. When the chamber of secrets had been opened in his second year, and a girl killed, Dumbledore had convinced the world that he was the culprit. Everyone in the wizarding world, even his fellow Slytherins, blamed him, and they'd never liked him much to begin with. [..] He'd been shipped off to Azkaban screaming for someone, anyone, to believe him. No one did. The look of disgust and revulsion on his parents faces, fueled his dementor nightmares for years, until he stopped caring what the dicks thought of him, and Azkaban merely became an edited highlights reel of Durskaban.

  (2) He stopped again, and pointed his wand into a spot a few feet off the pathway, towards one of the muggle residences.

  “That's the Grangers house, Albus.”

  He stepped back. “It's warded.”

  McGonagall gasped. “What does this mean?”

  “It means, that there is more going on here then just a pureblood preying on muggle families. These wards are expensive. I recognize many of them.”

  [..]

  Mr. Granger knew something and the man's eyes were fixed on him. They were right there. He reached out his magic between them, there was a flash of white light, and he felt a sad little yank just behind his navel.

  Daniel Granger stared at the space where, just before, the most powerful wizard in the world had sat. He leaned back in his seat and sighed.

  “What happened?” McGonagall jerked up and whipped out her wand.

  He clutched the golden head-of-house Granger ring on his hand like a child might clutch a blanket. “The headmaster attempted to use some kind of offensive magic on me --- legilimency, I suspect. The wards shielded me, then ejected him. He'll be several miles away in a local park.”

**** The entire Granger Parents plot has left me with a bad taste in my mouth tbh. I'm all for Hermiones parents being involved in a fic but as soon as they start basically doing magic my head cannon looses it. I mean Spoilers for some of the later chapters: but a magical submarine designed by the Grangers in like 6 months? That should not be a thing and feels like the author couldn't think of a better way to write his hero out of a corner. (But what does my opinion matter, he's got a wildly successful fic and I've never and probably won't ever publish anything).

*** I've read both of them. Both are among the few that managed to combine every possible cliche and still make a great story out of them.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
