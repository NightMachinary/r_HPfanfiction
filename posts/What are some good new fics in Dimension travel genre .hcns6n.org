I was going through [[/r/hpfanifction][r/hpfanifction]] and going through dimension travel fics mentioned. Most of them were repetitions of some amazing work. Unfortunately I've read the good stuff many times over. Has there any been good additions to Dimension travel recently. I read linkffn(the granger principle). It was a nice fic but Ron centric. Ron lovers would love it a lot. Maybe in the past one year or so..anything new ?


** I understand that for some folks the pairing will drive some people away on sight, but for good/great dimension travel fics you probably haven't read I /definitely/ reccomend Whispers in Corners (a crossover with BBC's Sherlock). linkao3(1134255)

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. What he finds instead is an alternate universe. Harry is recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  Magic can solve all the Wizarding World's problems. What's that? A prophecy that insists on a person? Things not quite going your way? I know, lets use this here ritual to summon another! It'll be great! - An eighteen year old Harry is called upon to deal with another dimension's irksome Dark Lord issue. This displeases him. EWE - AU HBP

** Funnily enough, I just searched for dimension travel fics and found this thread lol (just finished Stunning Shifts and looking for more).

These two are new-ish and currently ongoing:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1722766][The Bonds series]] - MoD/Powerful Harry tropes, follows Sirius through the veil into the world of Anita Blake. Slash. I very vaguely remember reading the first AB book and not liking it very much, but haven't had any issues with this crossover. Will NOT be everyone's taste: there's some pretty obvious power wank going on, but if you're in the mood for that then hey. Here ya go. linkao3(23901199)

- That Universe Over There - Very cracky, but also very entertaining. Raises himself but the child Harry is a she: Ivy is a blast. Has some of the Lord X tropes in it but they're used for comic relief. linkao3(23702959)

I second this one. Not so much cracky, as wall-to-wall shenanigans.

  Given that Dumbledore's decisions and choices had led directly to Sirius's death Harry didn't really have it in him at the moment to care about his reputation or the Headmaster's or whether people believed him about Voldemort's return.He'd done his part.He'd been the sacrifice and witness, he'd tried to warn them, he'd fallen into the trap, he'd shown them all, if they still wanted to deny the truth and get themselves killed that wasn't his problem anymore.Especially since among all of the apologies and retractions and admittances of Voldemort's return that he'd seen plastered across the Prophet not one of them carried the truth of Sirius.His godfather had died just as reviled by the people he'd died in part to save as he'd lived and that...that made something hot and burning and dark catch fire in the core of him.Alternately titled "The Process of becoming a BAMF"

  Finding himself in another universe, Harry makes the perfectly logical choice and adopts his younger self, destroys this world's leftover Voldie pieces, and tries his best to avoid happy goblins.

*** The author of stunning shifts is back after a long hiatus but I dont think any new chapter will be coming out soon enough.

I haven't written anything in my life but I have a head-canon stuck in my brain. Maybe I'll write it out when I get time just to get it out there.

  Harry ends up a little more Slytherin that what anyone expected, especially considering his Gryffindor fathers. While fiercely intelligent, he also looks out for his own interests first. He has high aims, namely, to become an Unspeakable and study time and alternate dimensions. But he has to grow up first. AU, background wolfstar, no current pairing

** linkffn(Lessons from another) it is probably my favourite dimension travel fic despite being fairly short and incomplete but the way the author shows Harry and the brief glimpse we get of Ron and hermione is amazing and really gets the tired warrior feel across

  Harry finds himself thrown into a new dimension, surrounded by new and old faces alike. Will this be the chance he has always wanted? Will he be able to learn from his past and do it right? A new twist on the "the characters read the books" genre. EWE; Cannon through the end of 7th book; No reciting of the books yet covers the events
