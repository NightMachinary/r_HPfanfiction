I've started to work on my own story and it led me to a thought. How long should an average chapter be? Personally as a reader I love long chapters I can dig into, but how much is too much?

** I presume we're speaking of fanfiction? At least 5000 words. Shorter than that, it feels the chapter gets over before it really had a chance to get off the ground.

Also, every chapter should /do/ something. It shouldn't be a pointless, aimless thing that does nothing for either the plot or the characters. But if you keep the chapter length below 3000 words, you run the risk of doing just that.

** As someone who reads fics mostly on my phone, I prefer chapters that are less than about 5,000 words. Any longer and I'll frequently lose my place if the page reloads. Preferably, chapters should be at least 1,000 words.

*** Sort of random question to anyone- does ff.net have any rules against publishing the same work twice? Like if someone wrote 1k words a day and published it each night to Story A. BUT also combined them each week into a single chapter to Story B (whether identical or edited into a final draft)?

Ps. TY- good info to have about mobile, did not know.

** As a reader, I prefer... well, a few years ago I would have said longer chapters, but now I'm generally a stickler for pace. If a chapter is 10K but without too much thought I can pick certain sections and mentally cut like 25% of it, that's bad. If I'm into the story, obviously, longer is better.

As a writer, it's whatever the fuck you want. A "chapter" is a unit that you kind of have to define for yourself. It should have its own arc, its own cohesiveness that fits into the larger story. Generally the longer story you have planned, the longer you want your chapters to be. As long as you keep things paced within an inch of their life, and don't add filler, you'll be fine, 2K or 20K.

** Longer than 10,000 words per chapter in a really long fic is kind of a turn off. I like having a good stopping point and shorter chapters make me feel like I'm getting through more of the story. It's a bit ridiculous when you have 400k words for instance and there's like 15 chapters. I think the best length is like 6000-8000 words, which isn't too long or too short and I can get through it quickly but not in 5 minutes or less and I can still just say "one more" to myself and not end up taking over 15 minutes. Below that is too little and above 10000 can sometimes get draggy, but above 15000 it gets a bit ridiculous. To begin with I'd like the stories I read to be quite long anyway.

It's the ones that are a bit boring or I'm a bit more on the fence about, or drags out a ridiculously long fight scene that annoys me. That being said if it's a really good fanfic and I'm into it, I could care less and just want to devour it. Quality trumps everything.

** There's no max limit so long as it maintains quality and isn't long just to be long or artificially extended. People can just leave the tab open if they want to take a break. However, your chapters shouldn't be so long that it takes more than two weeks for you to write, edit, and upload one. Chapters should absolutely never be less than 4k words, except for epilogues, prologues, interludes, etc, but 5k+ is better.

** First and foremost I prefer chapters to be roughly the same length. +/-500 words is ideal.

For my taste, chapters can be as long as you want them to be. Although, at ~10.000 words they tend to become a bit hard to handle for scrolling,...

What I greatly dislike are chapters that don't go over the 3000 word mark. Its not a reason for me to stop reading something, but it annoys me and makes me judge what I read more strictly.

** Anywhere more than 3k words is fine, but the sweet spot is probably 5-10k. Less than 3k feels a bit rushed and pointless - normally there's either not enough happening to deserve a chapter, or the events of the chapter are too compressed.

More than 10k is quite annoying because it can be hard to keep your place, and it doesn't feel like you're progressing through the slightly more boring parts - at least that's my experience. Also, I prefer regular updates of 5k words to occasional updates of 15k.

** I shoot for about 30 pages, which is about 10k +/- 500, when I write. The biggest set back to my releasing stuff is being unsure if I want to, rather than writing it. I'll get many reviews/messages hopeful about a direction they hope my story will go, and then it's not that direction because I write well ahead of my releases.
