Im looking for fics where Harry and Hermione are vastly intelligent, learning magic, and challenging the rules of what is and isnt possible. Fics where they experiment, study and progress beyond what is taught about magic.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

**** Those are some good points, but I can think of at least 4 revolutionary things off the top of my head that he did that were beyond what was taught about magic.

  Harry and Hermione are 'child prodigies'. Destiny managed to throw them together and they form a bond far stronger than any seen in the wizarding world. They use their intelligence to bring innovations into the world that have not been thought before.

*** I've seen this fic pop up before... So /are/ they "child prodigies", or are those quoted for sarcasm? What actually happens in the fic?
