** Linkffn(Ruthless Revenge) more of a crack fic, but fun nonetheless. There was another one that I can't find where Harry and Draco keep making bets with Daphne acting like she's with Harry as the inside woman but I can't find it at the moment. Also pure crack with a little NSFW content. But Malfoy gets shafted in that too.

** Linkffn(5483280)

In this Draco (and the Malfoys in general) are part of a subplot that definitely humiliates them and then some. Crack but one of my favorite stories of all time.

  Harry allows Ron to compete for him in the tournament. How does he fare? This is a Harry/Hermione story with SERIOUSLY Idiot!Ron Bashing. If that isn't what you like, please read something else. Complete but I do expect to add an alternate ending or two.

** linkffn(Black Family Business by Nargled) is a nice one. linkffn(It Could Only Happen At Hogwarts by Inusitatus) doesn't have much direct humiliation of Draco, but there is some. And there's some in linkffn(The Easy Way by Kolarthecool).

In This Means War ([[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/This_Means_War/index/]]), it is publicly insinuated that Draco is gay, which you may or may not consider to be humiliating. When I was the age of the characters (about 50 years ago), that kind of public declaration would have been devastating to anyone.

I'm aware of two stories in which a 'finite' shot at Draco (by McGonagall in one story to "un-ferret" him, and by Harry in the other) undoes the effect of a potion Draco didn't know about that was administered by his father. The potion, in both cases, turned a female child male so that Lucius could have a male heir. That's at least embarrassing and awkward, and could easily lead to humiliation. The first one is The Wizard That Never Was, by deathdevil ([[http://s3.zetaboards.com/FanFictionFederation/topic/9004704/1/]]). Note: the link gets redirected, and a lot of the formatting/punctuation doesn't appear to be present. I don't have a link for the second one; I suspect it's actually one chapter out of someone's "odds and ends" file.

** Probably the most horrific and sociopathic Draco humiliation is in Jeconais's [[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Slytherins__Tales_From_The_First_Year/index/][Perfect Slytherin]] series, a crossover with /Addams Family/.

It's been awhile, but from what I recall, he fails miserably against the impossibly overpowered Harry and Wednesday. Then, Wednesday literally emasculates him. On Narscissa's decision, they turn him into a young woman and completely rewrite his personality then send him to another school. Basically, in a world where souls demonstrably exist, they literally unmake his very existence and turn him into someone entirely different.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
