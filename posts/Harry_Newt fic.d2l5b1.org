:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I've been trying to find this fic I read a while back. It's a time travel one where Harry is an auror and due to an odd mix of curses or something, he get tossed back in time. When he comes to in a hospital and realizes what the date is, he freaks. Hides out in the desert to avoid screwing with the timeline or whatever. He ends up helping out some desert tribe and helping out Newt when he gets injured trying to help some helpless (read dangerous) magical creature that's also in the desert.

They somehow end up getting bonded magically while drunk. I couldn't find it on my AO3 bookmarks or my FFN favorites..... Help? Anyone know what I'm talking about?? I've been searching for like two days.

If you check out her notes on her face book page she has her uncensored chapters there :) she keeps her sex scenes of ffn

She's also started posting on ao3 after refusing for years :)

You should check out her HP/FFXV one :)

  Harry Potter meets Cor Leonis. He is not impressed. Neither is the young Insomnian.  

  The Gryffindor paused, blinking at the stranger. He was about his age, wearing a military uniform of all things, and bristling like a Coeurl fixing to pick a fight, his boots were shiny and black, his uniform was clean and pressed, his hands and fingernails were also clean, and there wasn't a single button or seam out of place. Even his sword-sheath gleamed, shiny, clean, and flawless. Stood in blood and sweat stiffened leathers, with mud up to his thighs, dirt under his nails, across his cheeks, twigs in his hair, and his pistols dented and caked with blood after he used them to club the last of his prey to death, he felt incredibly dirty and small in front of the other teenager who was already close to hitting six foot while Harry had only just reached 5'3‚Äù.

  He hated him immediately.

  Newt/Harry, Timetravel Shenanigans, Canon Divergent. His plan was to avoid changing the timeline. He knew he wouldn't be able to resist if the opportunity presented itself. So he fled to Africa, where opportunity found him instead.

** Here you go! Sadly incomplete, though. It was the first result on ffn for newt/Harry in the Harry Potter category (not the fantastic beasts, category, or crossover of the two) [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12296472]]
