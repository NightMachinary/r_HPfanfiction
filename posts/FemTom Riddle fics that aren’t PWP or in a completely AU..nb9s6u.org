I'm looking for fics centred around a female Tom Riddle, preferably set in the canon timeline. Smut is okay, but I want there to be a proper plot, with her rising to power and everything. Slash is okay, but I want it to be sort of dark - and not a romance. I dont know if this is something that's been made into a proper fic so yeah
