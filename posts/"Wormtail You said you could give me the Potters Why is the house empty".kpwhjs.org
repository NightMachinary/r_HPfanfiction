Sure, switching secret keepers was a great prank, but Sirius and James couldn't resist topping it once they got it into their heads that it was a prank on Voldemort.


** ‘I- I'm sure they're just hiding under the Cloak, m'lord!' Peter said, frantically looking around as if they would pop out any moment, although he knew the cloak would be too small to cover all of them.

‘Hello Peter, Tom,' a voice said, amicably. ‘Tea?'

‘Dumbledore!' Tom hissed. ‘You double-crossing bastard! /Crucio/!'

The latter, of course, aimed at Peter.

‘I am afraid I can't let you do that,' Dumbledore said, firing of a fast protection spell. His smile got a bit tighter, but apart from that there was nothing to suggest this was anything but a reunion between old friends. Almost absentmindedly he turned the kettle on.

Peter smiled too, but his was both nervous and grim. ‘Perhaps,' he suggested before bolting to the kitchen, ‘you shouldn't have thought I'd betray my best friends, m'lord!' And he ducked behind Dumbledore.

** Chapter 2 of [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5805767/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Clockwork-Leap][Clockwork Leap]] has Harry pulling a Quantum Leap into Wormtail just before the spell is cast... he "confesses" (claims he got the DM while drunk) and tells them to pull a double blind fake-out on him, not letting him know what they're doing with Sirius leaking to Dung that Peter is secretly the real secret keeper so Tommy Boy will chase Peter... he then leads the idiot into a bomb-filled house.

** Furthermore, this house was trapped with large amount of magical and Muggle explosives. 10 seconds after Voldemort asked Wormtail that question, it blew up.

"I knew we shouldn't trust that rat, but the traitor had served his purpose well!" Said Lily triumphantly and handed over her omnicular to James, who appeared rather dejected and deflated.

"Yes, very disappointing to see this happening. But he paid for his betrayal and we even got the Dark Lord Tom. So, what next?"

Sirius spoke up next, "I think we all own Moony an apology, and we need to get the rest of the scum!"

**** I'm not sure why [[/u/fivegnomes][u/fivegnomes]] deleted their comment, but I like the idea all the same. I remember a similar idea being used on Ultron or some similar malevolent Marvel mechanical being, with a Harry Potter/X-Men crossover.

Though to be entirely honest I'm not sure you can do a fidelius like that.
