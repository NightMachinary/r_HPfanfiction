Hello! I'm looking for some opinions, and any constructive discussion would be appreciated.

Canon Harry seems to be well-off, if not vastly rich. We know little about his financial situation beyond the existence of a full (to an eleven year-old's eyes at least) vault 687. There's frankly no discussion of his money, which is JK's right, but it never comes up for good or ill.

Fanon Harry has all sorts of wealth. Whether the money comes from being Lord Potter-Peverell-Slytherin-Black-et al, having stakes in seemingly every Diagon business, to the ever present 'Family Vault', authors tend to want to live through Harry and have him become the richest wizard in Britain (and proceed to buy a mega trunk, a customized wand and then never touch it again).

I am curious on how you think Harry could become poor and have money be an actual and tangible thing to consider in the story. I have yet to really see it be done.

I can think of some ways, but I'm hoping that there are others (or if you have a fic to rec, that'd be tight too):

- The ubiquitous Dumbledore thievery, albeit in a permanent and 'legal' manner and not the typical 'Harry shouts at Dumbledore whose mystified by his emerald orbs and hands over his vault, the Potter grimoire and his lemon drop recipe in sheer fear'.
- Some sort of 'reparations' for the Potters' actions in the war. The circumstances would be difficult, especially if Harry is the BWL. I am somewhat toying with a Neville!BWL story where the Potters and the Longbottoms are at Godric's Hollow together and Voldemort and company attack. I could very loosely see the Longbottoms getting some money because the Potters picked Pettigrew, although that seems like it'd need to be pulled off by a mustache-twirling villain. The Odds were Never in my Favor has James pinned for being a DE and the Longbottom secret-keeper and them getting money that way too, although that's hard to replicate
- A simple "James and Lily spent all their money in the war" because they thought they would live and have a chance to earn it back to some degree.
- The cash-poor Potter family assets are sold off at bargain rates because of ~reasons~ and he gets a pittance back on investments made.

And that's all I've got! Fate, the Ron-centric story, does a good job on Ron and the Weasley's financial lives and how to crawl out of poverty. I think a poor Harry would make a different and unique character with different motivations and would love to hear what you think


** It depends on how AU you are?

It also depends on what kind of plot you have. Generally, yes, it is vastly more entertaining, satisfying and just makes for a story better all around to have an underdog (anti)hero who fights against the odds, starts with nothing and ends with everything.

Some random ideas:

- In a world where James and Lily aren't heros, but traitors, the Ministry seized their assets for compensation. Harry got moved to the Dursleys because literally no one wanted to take in their spawn, and he enters the world broke and disliked.

- In a world where everyone thinks Harry died, the Ministry seized the assets as part of a law declaring without heir, they are the default beneficiary. It was intended for Death Eaters, but the Potter fortune got caught up in it. Harry enters the world broke, and the Ministry desperately does their malicious best to cover it up and keep Harry marginalised, because they are (still) cash-strapped, after the war, and can neither return the money nor compensate him in other ways. It's a rather nice plotline with a ready antagonist. There's good a Slytherin!Harry with it.

- In a world where the Potters simply /weren't rich/ Harry enters the world howevermuch-broke-you-need: The Potters couldn't work, and going into hiding costs money. So there is nothing/little/modest amounts left.

The last is probably the easiest if you want to change nothing else from Canon; as you note, we are never told how much money he's got exactly, so you can always say that while it /looks/ like much compared to the Weasleys initially, as opposed to them, he's not adding to it earning money, and therefore has to run an equally tight budget if he wants to make it through Hogwarts.

.

Note I didn't add anything with Dumbledore. I just don't think you can make that plausibly work (as evidenced by the fact that a lot of those stories don't even try, Dumbledore steals money for no reason, just to show how evil he is.)

This is, in fact, the law in very nearly every jurisdiction on the planet. /Bona Vacantia/ is a fairly common name for it - 'goods with no owner'. Such goods revert to the crown/state/government/local lord/temple of whoever.

It's part of my problem with the 'vaults unclaimed since the founders' times' trope: uninherited property just /doesn't/ get left laying about like that.

**** Granted, it might be an issue of getting that law to work. In a world where "assets" are either in a Goblin vault, or in a manor that can be arbitrarily protected, a law that says "it's ours" is nice until you have to actually try and get the stuff. So in theory, I can see random old vaults just getting dusty with no one touching it, if the Goblins just shrug and point the Ministry workers to doors that suck them into the vault if they try to open them.

That said, the "Founders' Vaults" trope is still terrible.

I've seen this done before, though I can't remember the story in question. James spent all the fantastic fanon-level Potter wealth during the war, leaving Harry with enough to get through Hogwarts, but not much else. Whoever was taking care of Harry in that story (might have been Snape) was furious at him for not thinking of his son's future.

**** I can't remember the fanfic author at the moment but in his fic he discussed his rationale for the exchange rate he used. It started with knuts and the cost of a newspaper and then considered the wand and the cost of a small car. Eg one time purchase that lasts for the rest of your life. With the rationale that most witches and witches only ever have one wand.

I think he used 500-1 (which seems way too high when you consider the other items that are purchased). Well one thing this does do is prove that JKR did not lie that she is bad at math because the various prices folks pay for things in the books make no sense when you compare them side by side.

I would say that it probably be in the 50-100 to 1 range. But then the Weasley's joke wand at 5 galleons makes no sense.

From the only item we get a price for that has a nonmagical equivalent (the Daily Prophet in Book 1, which costs five knuts), I calculate that a knut is 10 pence (author switched to US values), a sickle about £3 and a galleon about £50.

Or, if you don't want to make it that, you could easily have what Harry has to be modest in the wizarding world. Even the Weasleys have more than him! He just doesn't know it.

(Since the wizarding economy is mostly undefined, you could do this a couple of ways: For example, magical real estate could be *#$*$ expensive to keep/maintain from our eyes, thus what looks like a fortune is really just a modest amount. Since Harry isn't paying for his own lodging, he doesn't have that on his finances).

** Basic evil bank shenanigans:

#+begin_quote
  Griphook grabs Harry's wrist and drags him up to the center of the doors, indicating Harry should place his palm on the oval stone at the center. Doing so, a brief flash is seen, and then the great doors swing open. Within, everything is dark.

  Harry: “Griphook, a little help with the lighting?”

  Griphook: “One galleon.”

  Harry tosses the coin towards the goblin who snatches it from the air with the skill of a professional Quidditch Seeker.

  Harry: “Are you overcharging me?”

  Griphook: “Yes. /Activate sconces/.”

  Torchlight flares to life surrounding the chamber from 16 separate wall sconces placed around the room. With the lights fully aflame, Harry and Moony take a look around at the contents of the Potter Vault.

  Harry: “I don't understand.”

  Moony: “It's all paper.”

  Moony reaches down to pick up a parchment laying on the floor.

  Moony: “This is a certificate for 40,000 shares in a magical flying carpet corporation, dated 23rd November, 1982.”

  Harry: “Aren't flying carpets banned in Britain?”

  Moony: “Yup.”

  Harry: “Griphook, is there a way to get an assessment of the current value of the contents of this vault?”

  Griphook: “Two galleons for the answer.”

  Harry: “Fine.”

  After Griphook pockets the two coins, he smiles.

  Griphook: “You may have the clerk of courts evaluate the paperwork for review of contracts to look for improprieties, but at this time, there is no value in this vault. Except perhaps as insulation or kindling.”

  Harry: “No value. Griphook how is the Trust vault sustained?”

  Griphook: “One galleon.”

  Harry: “I'd ask to run a tab but I doubt my funds will hold out.”

  Griphook: “You're not as dumb as most. Your Trust vault is renewed to a level of 50,000 galleons every 1st of August from the contents of this vault. As this vault is in arrears, you have been refilling the Trust vault from a modest loan for the last 8 years, interest set at a forgiving 3%, compounded monthly.”

  Harry: “If I were to put the money from the Trust vault back into this one...”

  Griphook: “We can process that request for a 1% handling fee, as you do not have financial control of this vault yet. As it stands, your Trust vault will be replenished with additional loans until you have the authority to change that arrangement and order it so.”

** - Have the Gringotts cart crash or something. Harry wakes up in a Gringotts infirmary. Horcrux and abuse discovered. Shitload of gold to remedy the situation. That could substantially hurt the contents of the "trust" vault.
- Blame Dumbledore for the rest. I can't remember the fic, but Dumbledore left the Potter estate with the Wizengamott Inheritance department or something. Which was run by a Death Eater. They did their standard thing, selling stuff for dirt cheap to themselves. Pocketing loads of others. Investing in sham businesses. Donating to sham charities. etc.
- Blame Umbridge. Have her find the Main Potter Vault key. When she comes up with the "great idea" to seize the potter cottage. That would put even more motive behind the dementor incident.
- Attach a withdrawal limit for his trust vault. Sure, he has money, but he can't use it. Say he can withdraw 20/50 galleons a year for personal/fun stuff. X for necessities. X for caregiver (food/shelter) X for education. And X for supplementary education (secondary books/materials for further education. A Hermione fund). Second year would be hilarious. "I couldn't buy all of the Lockhart books, as it went over my Education Allowance."

That last one can be used to get the Dursleys to stop treating him like crap.

**** State Schools get government subsidies (the Muggle UK government spends about £90 billion a year on education) or what a teacher friend informs me is called 'Philanthropic Giving' (like our version of the US Alumni Donations - reached about £1 billion a couple years back, apparently), and at the end of the day, they probably don't have a significant amount of expenses. They have greenhouses to grow ingredients, things at the quill and parchment level can be conjured, the furniture has probably all been there for longer than the entire teaching staff has been alive, etc.

They'd only really need money for the big magical stuff, and there's some idea that they either don't have enough money or can provide for themselves for some of that too. They waited for their mandrakes to mature instead of buying someone else's potions/mandrakes, didn't they?

** I mean... just have them be poor?

If you really wanted to get into it... bump James and Lily's ages by ten years (so they die at 31) and James beggars the family trying to hold on to the family home in the face of taxes and disrepair. Yes, I know, magic, but even so.

A more intriguing option would be to borrow the structure of something like Vanity Fair or the Grapes of Wrath. Vanity Fair has several basic options... there's the sympathetic but naive Harry, in which case you model him after Amelia, i.e. the family loses its money just after Harry finishes at Hogwarts (I guess we'd have Ginny as George, so the Weasleys get to be wealthy... and Hermione as Dobbin... or the reverse... or do it as slash, of course... Fred should be George, for the memes).

If you want Harry to be unsympathetic but understandable... he's Becky (with Ginny for Rawdon and Aunt Muriel as the wealthy Aunt... Hermione can be Jos, I guess). In this Becky!Harry case, Harry's a poor orphan who twists everyone around his finger, forces Rawdon!Ginny to gamble for a living, exploits the Weasley's good name to scam their landlord (seriously, the chapter's called something like "How to live well on nothing a year"), probably murders Hermione!Jos for the insurance, is a complete arsehole to their son (I think the line is something like "my son loves a stone")

If you want Harry (and James) to be unsympathetic and to die part way through... he can be George... with Neville as Dobbin and James gets to live on as Old Osborne.So, the basic thing here is that Harry kind of likes Amelia!Ginny and we'll go with Dobbin!Neville again (Hermione can be Becky and Ron Rawdon... although Rawdon and Amelia aren't related so Ron can be Jos and... screw it, Draco!Rawdon works). Anyway, James and Arthur arrange for a match between Ginny and Harry, which is a major reason why Ginny is completely into Harry. Anyway, Arthur goes out of business, James tries to break the match, Harry's already pushed things to the point of dishonour, Neville loves Ginny but advises Harry to make it right... so Harry marries Ginny, James cuts him off, Harry knocks Ginny up, goes off to Waterloo (er, the battle of Hogwarts) and dies (er, stays dead). Just extend the period of time where James cuts Harry off and Harry's busy flirting with Hermione.

If you want Harry to be sympathetic but also a jock... he can be Rawdon. You can do this one as a good WBWL concept because you just have Harry's older brother inherit everything while Harry's completely earnest affections for Becky!Ginny cause him to be disinherited by.... I guess, Uncle Vernon (who, previously, liked him)... or maybe it's a rare fic where Petunia and Lily's parents live or something.

Incidentally... if you're interested in the pureblood society stuff but aren't overly interested in the Potter seat on the Wizengamot, Vanity Fair is a good model. Of course, it also works if you are interested in the Potter seat on the Wizengamot trope.

The Grapes of Wrath option is interesting... you start the fic off with Harry's release from Azkaban into a wizarding depression (dust bowl). And then it basically never gets better.
