Hi,

I'm looking for stories where Harry truly dies and the reaction of his friends. That means no fake death, no resurrection, hiding or kidnapping.

This can happens during the war (before Voldemort dies or win) to see what happens and if it changes things in the way his friends live and fight or an aftermath by Harry dying with Voldemort and seeing the other trying to get better without him.

I'm particularly looking for two kinds of death. Death in combat (can be active combat or kidnapped/killed) and suicide (no aborted of failed one). What interests me the most is the interaction people will have in the aftermath of Harry's death.

Thanks


** Suicides are dark man, I hate reading stories with those. Maybe if it's like a suicide mission-type, where Harry learns he's a Horcrux and goes into a battle and bombardas himself and like 6 Death Eaters I could see that.

It sounds corny as hell, but I'd love a one-shot story of a spell recreation of that Wanted scene where Angelina Jolie bends the bullet to kill everyone that should've been killed. Harry creates some piercing spell or something that kills some of the top Death Eaters, Nagini, himself, and Voldemort. Maybe the immediate planning of it, the scene itself, then a somber Ron eulogy explaining the plan and its execution. Could be powerful if written well, with just the right amount of ridiculousness that the Wanted scene recreation would bring (one of my favorite cornball action movies).

*** Shit yes, can you imagine Harry casting the spell Pettigrew used with those muggles but with Death Eaters and eventually killing himself in an impossible battle and seeing his friends and other Death Eaters stops fighting to see Harry's body without life?
