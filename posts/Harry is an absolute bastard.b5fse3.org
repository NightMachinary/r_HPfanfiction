Fics where Harry is just a complete bastard to everyone, like in linkffn(Denarian Renegade) and the others.

  An ongoing series of one shot stories exploring how Slytherin!Harry would have handled key moments from the books. Events will appear out of order, so don't be surprised if it jumps around. Small but important edit made to Chapter Five

** It's been way too long since I read Shezza's stories to remember them (well), but my first thought upon seeing "complete bastard to everyone" is this:

#+begin_quote
  A different upbringing leaves Harry Potter with an early knowledge of magic and a view towards the Wizarding World not as an escape from the Dursleys, but as an opportunity to learn more about it. Unfortunately, he quickly finds that there are many elements in this new world that are unwilling to leave the Boy-Who-Lived alone.

  An aged Harry reveals the scandalous truth about his youthful exploits. Read how a lying, womanising coward became the hero of the magical world. Rated M for language and sexual content. Title changed to comply with website's guidelines.

**** I loved how in this book Hogwarts starts when they are 16:

#+begin_quote
  By the by, you may be wondering why I received this letter on my /sixteenth/ birthday and not my /eleventh/, as in my novels. The answer is quite simple: not even the wizarding community, a community so asinine that they elected Cornelius Fudge as Minister for Magic, would be so stupid as to give pubescent children magic wands. Combining teenage hormones with the power to unravel the very fabric of the cosmos scarcely bears thinking about. Besides that obvious drawback, wizarding children need a basic education just like Muggle children: it's no use having the power to brew a magic potion if you don't have the maths to follow the recipe. So students at Hogwarts College begin at sixteen. I reduced it to eleven because I was writing for the children's market (much more lucrative) and you have to give the little tykes a hero they can identify with; hence, my fictional self starting magic school at eleven.

Hilarious rec, only wish it went on longer.

  By the age of seven, Harry Potter hated his home, his relatives and his life. However, an ancient demonic artefact has granted him the powers of a Fallen and now he will let nothing stop him in his quest for power. AU: Slight Xover with Dresden Files

  With Harry being declared a squib at birth, Voldemort went instead for Neville's life as only he seemed to have a chance at becoming his equal. But Harry's parents were still killed by DE in the aftermath of the Dark Lord's defeat. Homeless, on the streets, he had to rely on his own power to survive. But the fates smiled upon him when an ancient pendant landed in his hands. VeelaOC
