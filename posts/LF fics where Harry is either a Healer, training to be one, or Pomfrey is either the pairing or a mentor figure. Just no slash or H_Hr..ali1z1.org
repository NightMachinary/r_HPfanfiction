Pairing would be nice, but I doubt it exists, at least not in a non Harem setting.

I've read Whispers in the Night and the one with the Zombie apocalypse, with Astoria pairing, Also read that one with femDraco (Nica)


** Surprised by the no comments.

But there's only one I've read, but highly recommend and that is Basilisk Born by Ebenbild (don't know how to link on phone sorry,).

It's still updating, each chapter is extremely lengthy and keeps things interesting. Though due to chapter length it doesn't update often. It delves into time travel that actually has consequences for those who mess with time. As of yet there isn't a pairing.
