I would like some of the not-so-popular ones, but if you must...

It's a female Harry with no pairings, but I really think you should give it a shot. It starts a bit slow and Tom Riddle is a politician and not a crazy terrorist monster, but please, please give it a shot. There is plenty of potions brewing, Draco and Pansy are actually likeable and the first three books are complete and the fourth one is ongoing. (There is also an entire subplot with OCs about Diagon Alley which is honestly more like a small city and not just a street.) And it's not a dark Harry (thankfully).

  Once upon a time, Harry Potter hid for two hours from Dudley in a chemistry classroom, while a nice graduate student explained about the scientific method and interesting facts about acids. A pebble thrown into the water causes ripples.Contains, in no particular order: magic candymaking, Harry falling in love with a house, evil kitten Draco Malfoy, and Hermione attempting to apply logic to the wizarding world.

  Now that Harry is back at Hogwarts with Hermione for eighth year, he realises that something's missing from his life, and it either has to do with Ron, his boggart, Snape, or Malfoy. Furthermore, what, exactly, does it mean when one's life is defined by the desire to simultaneously impress and annoy a portrait? Harry has no idea; he's too busy trying not to be in love with Malfoy to care.

**** zeitgeistic does Harry's characterisation so brilliantly that even the somewhat OP Harry seems entirely organic.

  After ten years of misery with the Dursleys, Harry Potter learns that he has magic. Except, in this story, it's not a surprise-the only surprise is that there are others like him. Including his twin brother, Julian Potter, the savior of the Wizarding world. This isn't the Harry you think you know.
