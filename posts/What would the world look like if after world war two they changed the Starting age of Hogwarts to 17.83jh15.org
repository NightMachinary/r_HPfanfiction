Like a Muggle prime minister has a muggleborn relative who complains about the trouble they are having in the wizarding world and how they wish they could have completed there muggle schooling.

so The Prime minister spins a tale to the then Minister of magic about how The muggle world is starting to notice kids Disappearing out of the muggle world as age 11.

so the Magic world changes the starting age of Hogwarts to age 17 after the muggleborns have finished there muggle schooling.( the purebloods are fine with this because they just start up a school for there kids that starts as age 11 that teach up to O.W.L level)

THE only thing that changes is that Student now get there Hogwarts letter at age 17( and therefore muggleborns are introduced to the magical world at age 17). The children in the magical world can still get wands at age 11, still take there O.W.Ls at age 15, still get there apparition license at age 17, ect.

Maybe have it that Lily Evans still starts her magic education at age 11 Because of her friendship with Snape takes her with him to the DIagon alley to get a wand leading her to be enrolled in one of the new Hogwarts Preschools for kids between ages 11-16)

How would the Wizarding world look different by the Time harry gets there (assume that he is born)

would Voldemort get as much traction if the Purebloods felt like they were winning of the Political front with with them Slowly trying to Up the age at which Kids start Hogwarts (and there for when the muggleborns enter there world)


** It wouldn't look all that different except that the fact the kids are older would likely lead to a lot more specialized classes and small group interactions. It would also create an environment with a lot more romance, sex, and magic use (both experimental and typical).

The real issue would be, if you go by canon there would be major issues with kids and accidental magic. Both younger kids not old enough for Hogwarts and older kids who have never trained in magic.

Realistically Hogwarts should be a school from kindergarden age through graduate school age. Training kids in magic from early on, when their minds are more open and flexible, and then continuing that training on into college age where a student can specialize in a few subjects and then make the choice to go out and find a job, become an apprentice, or continue to specialize in a graduate school type setting.

*** That would be interesting so you think they should turn Hogwarts into an Elevator School. I can't help but think that that would make the muggleborns even worse off because they would not even have the Mugge world to go back to.

what about on the Political front?

Like if they next made a push to raise the starting age to 21 and made another school for there kids to study up to N.E.W.T level from ages 17-21. And just kept trying to slowly up the starting age.

I think there would be a larger amount of muggleborns that would stay and marrie in the muggle world leading to a massive boom in the amount of half-blood children from the muggleborns married to muggles.

That's assuming that even in making it an elevator school, they don't teach basic subjects like math and english (just with a wizarding twist). There was always the assumption in canon that wizards get some sort of basic schooling in the usual suspects. I mean, you still need to be able to speak, write, read, and know your numbers. Its also assuming they don't add some basic understanding of things like science (which still plays a role in the magical world), and history (again, the wizarding world is still subject to some basic history).

I guess I am advocating for a better all-around quality school as well if we are "changing" the school system.

Also, we don't know enough about the political front side of canon during the prior eras to really judge how this would affect Voldemort and his sway. My guess is an elevator school would have lessened the likelihood of Riddle becoming Voldemort while having a school start at 17 would not have helped in any way. Probably a worse off, and more angry/jaded Riddle, but with more established blood-based factions less likely to be swayed by some upstart 17 year old.

I also want to point out that it would be entirely possible, with the various elements of travel the magical world opened up, to allow kids, muggleborn or otherwise, to be able to spend more time at home than Hogwarts allowed. The train was really just for show. Kids could go home every weekend or even more often, and the amount could even depend based upon the age.

In reality canon wizarding schooling was an absolute pile of shit. If we are changing things.... well there is a LOT that could be made better.

******** But the whole "elevator thing" was brought up by you in response. I didn't realize you were still discussing in the bounds of WW2 forward. I thought the discussion had moved on to simply "How Hogwarts could have been better".

If you still want to debate within the bounds of WW2, then I could argue that an elevator school would lessen the likelihood of Voldemort of the past, being able to develop into Voldemort of the future, possibly due to less ease at swaying over new recruits within school. Remember, he initially recruited WITHIN the Hogwarts student population, not outside it. He didn't start with the parents but with the children.

*********** To be fair, that's always been debated because his birth date has never been nailed down for sure. If he was born in 1926 like most sources settle on in compromise and based upon loose information, than he graduates Hogwarts in 1942, when the war is still in full swing.

But the 1926 date is literally a pure guess based upon tidbits of information. As far as I am aware there is no confirmation on it at all and no direct proof.

************* Did you read what I wrote? I said 1926 is the generally agreed upon date. But it's NOT canon because the date was never known from canon. Pottermore has simply "created" this date based upon various clues, and other sites have done the same or pulled their info from Pottermore. People make the mistake far too often that because its on Pottermore it must be true or canon. That's not correct. Pottermore is simply the primary information source for HP because they have been known to pull their info directly from JK and established info/clues because of the connection they have with Rowling.

I also clearly stated that if you go by the 1926 date, Voldemort graduates Hogwarts DURING WW2 (likely in 1942). So yes, Dumbledore would still be a professor since the war doesn't end until 1945. But your point means absolutely nothing. Dumbledore doesn't become headmaster until 1956, so there are a solid 9 years between his defeat of Grindelwald and his transition to Headmaster.

Also, while the war ended in 1945, and Grindelwald was defeated in 1945, we have no dates on his defeat as it compares to the date of the end of the war (as it pertains to Germany). We also know that Germany and its allies were already basically defeated by 1945. Italy pretty much fell prior to D-day and then D-Day was June 6th, 1944 (nearly a full year before Germany's surrender). By January 1945 (the earliest Grindelwald would have been fought), Germany was basically done for (their last major offensive was in December 1944... the Battle of the Bulge).

Again though, the war ending, and Dumbledore defeating Grindlewald are not mutually exclusive or inclusive things as it pertains to the muggle war. The magical war may be another story although we have precious little information on what was going on in the magical world in that era.

** The world would be full of Obscurials.

Even at eleven years old it is already pushing it too much. Like another user posted the younger they start the better it is in the end. By 17, muggleborns will not only be grown up and adults, they will have their opinions and ideas pretty much set. They wont stay in the Wizarding world and many would use their magic to get what they want in the muggle world.

There is also the fact that those born inside the wizarding world will really have an advantage and I sincerely doubt parents of pureblood families will not teach their children a thing about magic or buy them wands someplace else.

Stories with a higher starting age for Hogwarts are incredibly unrealistic even for a world of magic and are never good either.

I think that more muggleborns would get control of there magic the way Tom Riddle and Lily Evans did, so the muggleborns would be self taught and have an intimate understanding of there magic because of this (although some would be better than others)and the purebloods would have a more well rounded education with the level of magic training being more consistent than there muggleborn counterparts (but they would not get the chance to get to know there magic the way the muggleborns would.).
