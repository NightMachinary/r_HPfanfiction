So details, I'm pretty sure there was some sort of agreement that the wizards and Harry wouldn't bother each other after Voldemort was defeated. Wizards pass a law mandating the removal of muggleborn from their parents. They take Harry's child w/o realizing. Can't remember much else. I think the muggles end up taking over everything at the end.

*** That was an amusing power fantasy fic, if a bit dumb.

** Yes! I have read that. Though I can't remember the title either.

It was not epilogue-compliant, the child was not Lily. And it was a girl. And she kept telling people "you have no idea what you've done, you are gonna be in /so much/ trouble." And she had a really different kind of magic - because her mother was Native American or something, right? I think it was on Ao3.

** Rise of the Wizards sounds similar to it although not exactly the same. Harry defeats Voldemort. Harry helps create a law to remove muggleborns from their parents for the kids protection from muggles. Harry/Daphne pairing and at one point certain lords conspiring against him remove their 2 sons, and Hermione/Ron are involved in holding them hostage.
