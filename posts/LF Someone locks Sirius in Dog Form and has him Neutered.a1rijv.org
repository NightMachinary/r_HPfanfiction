I've seen it threatened before, by Tonks, Harry ,and several other people, but I've never seen anyone actually go through it. Giving Sirius the snip whilst in Dog form, are there any fics that do it?


** I'm pretty sure that will turn Sirius into a manic murderer, and I wouldn't blame him in the slightest for it.

*** Bonus points if it's Snape that does it, so Sirius has a real reason to want to kill Snape instead of the bullshit canon gave us of "Sirius wants to scare Snape away" that made Snape look like a moron "Oh, he's actively my enemy, he told me to meet him here at midnight. It's obviously not a trap or anything. I'll go along without backup and then act surprised that it was actively a trap"

**** If it's Snape, then it won't be simple murder. It will be nice and grisly, just what Snape deserves.

You're wrong when you say that Sirius wanted to kill Snape during their school days - Sirius never wanted Snape dead during those days, because Sirius doesn't need a werewolf to do his killings for him. He just wanted to scare Snape, and was a teenager, as was Snape. Teenagers aren't known for their perception or hatching detailed dastardly plans to kill their schoolyard rivals.

***** Snape thought Sirius wanted to kill him, but Sirius hjust wanted to scare him. That was my point. But Snape was a Moron, as I said. "Obvious enemy who I've been feuding with for years tells me to go somewhere. I'll go without backup. OMG WHY U TRY TO KILL ME" I hated several people in school, and if they told me to go somewhere, I had the sense to know "They're going to beat me up where there are no teachers around" so I'd specifically NOT go there. Even if there wasn't a Werewolf and it was just "Go here" and then they all ambush Snape and hit him with Pranks, it was REALLY stupid on Snape's part.

The image of Padfoot with a cone of shame and murder in his eyes is a lot to take though haha.

*** Don't actually know. There's a spell to force someone out of their Animagus Form, so it would make sense if there's a spell or potion to lock them into it, without changing the rules of the Magic. Or you could just stun him whilst he's Padfoot and take him to the Vet.

I'm more than a little concerned about what kind of vet you've had dealings with that you think they'd operate on an animal you brought in unconscious.

** Poor Padfoot. I wonder why someone would actually want to? One of my characters gave him worming tablets once but she didn't know he was Sirius. I suppose if she had known she might have done something worse. But not that.
