There's no sign of Draco being smart at all. He does well in potions because Snape gives him whatever grades will make him happy. His other grades are never addressed. The only indication of his classwork is failing to understand simple instructions and getting hurt by a Hippogriff. Meanwhile, Ron made prefect without a head of house who gives him special treatment, did reasonably well, and is derided in the fandom as a since.

The only other thing I can think of is "snark", but Ron is consistently wittier than Draco too.


** He singlehandedly fixed that Vanishing Cabinet, he is good enough at Occlumency to keep Snape out, and we don't know how good he actually is at Potions. Maybe he does deserve his grades. He presumably got O on his O.W.L., after all.

And Ron absolutely did not deserve to become a prefect (not that Malfoy did either).

**** I think his Potions grade is the only grade we can actually be sure of. Only Harry and Ron didn't have their Potions textbook at the beginning of their 6th year, so the rest of the class (including Malfoy) must have got O on their exam, because that was Snape's requirement for the N.E.W.T. class. And O.W.L.s are graded independently.

Lucius chides his son for not improving his grades and beating Hermione at the beginning of CoS. Obviously, he is not at the bottom with Crabbe and Goyle, or they wouldn't even be talking about beating Hermione to the top, but that conversation doesn't tell us much about Draco's actual standing, only that his father wants him to apply himself.

To add to that: I always took that bit as Lucius not wanting Draco to come in second to a "mudblood", no matter how good his grades were in general or how anomalous /her/ grades were. I assumed that meant that Draco had to have higher grades (overall, at least) than Harry or any of the /other/ muggleborns, else Lucius would have made mention of them as well.

(Edit: It's been years, so I went back and re-read that part. I misremembered it as Lucius specifically complaining about Hermione, but no, Draco's the one who mentioned her first. Eh, it could mean it the way I thought, or it could mean Draco's grades weren't good after all. It actually reads more like the latter, now that I see it as an adult. I still think Lucius would have berated him for coming in after Hermione no matter how good his grades were, though probably not in public, and I do think he would have mentioned Harry if Draco got lower grades than him. But Harry's pretty average as a student, so that doesn't really mean much.)

****** Hermione is book smart, of course, but she is by no means a professional. Draco is not a professional either. They are both children with no prior instructions on how to construct or repair a vanishing cabinet. Maybe Hermione would figure it out quicker than Draco, but she has a tendency to check books for all her answers and fall back on prior knowledge. She is also in the same grade as Draco, Harry, and Ron. She might read ahead or some such thing, but that doesn't mean she knows anything about enchantments. Draco may be a daddy's boy, and he may not be all that smart, but from what I've seen, he's alright at making decisions that benefit him, unless Harry is involved. The fact that he was able to improve the state of the vanishing cabinet at all is something of a wonder. Someone like, say a seventh year student who is looking into becoming an enchanter, however, would have more experience, and may be able to fix the vanishing cabinet in less time than either of them.

**** I think with the cabinet, we have to acknowledge that we know nothing. It could be a complicated enchantment that took him months to fully fix. It might be that he tried a ton of random solutions and one finally stuck. There's no way to use canon to tell if it was intellectually difficult or just time-consuming.

[[https://www.quora.com/Is-Draco-Malfoy-smart][This quora post covers the quotes we have on Draco's grades]]. For ease, I'll copy them here:

“I would have thought you'd be ashamed that a girl of no wizard family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy.

and then also

“I hope my son will amount to more than a thief or a plunderer, Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, “No offense, sir, no offense meant ---”

“Though if his grades don't pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for ---”

“It's not my fault,” retorted Draco. “The teachers all have favorites, that Hermione Granger ---”

All that concludes is that Hermione does better than him, and I'd argue the second bit shows his grades aren't all that. In fact, it seems likely that multiple students are doing better, if there are multiple favorites. It's seems unlike Lucius Malfoy to tell a stranger that his son has terrible grades if he's second in class or something.

ALSO: I just double-checked this, and we don't learn about the whole Outstanding/EE/A etc system until the fifth book (fifteenth chapter, if anyone's curious). Since the conversation is with the Weasley twins correcting Hermione on the order of the letter grades, and Ron + Harry don't have a clue either, that seems to be pretty concrete proof that letter grades are not used until fifth year, and are only brought in to show how you're faring compared to OWL standards. Since Hermione says she got 112% on the first year Charms final, I'm guessing it's percentages until then. Overall, that indicates to me that grades are done by percents on a more individual level, and then convert over in the upperclassman years for something that's standardized between classes.

Outside of getting an O in Potions +(which even if Snape did not grade OWLs, having a potions master as your godfather can't possibly hurt)+, there's nothing that indicates Draco's a genius. He's most likely average/above average in his subjects, but nothing special enough to distinguish him.

I'm laying that at the feet of JKR. Because I find that hard to believe that Hermione of all people didn't know that. Grades are her lifeblood. I wouldn't be surprised if that was one of the first books she bought in Diagon Alley, or looked up in the Hogwarts library. She is not the kind of person to walk around without knowing everything possible.

** 1. Draco is a NEWT-level student

2. We see no evidence during the books that Draco is failing or sub-par at any of his classes, I'm basing this on the assumption that if Draco received poor grades, either Harry or Ron would have brought it up as "ammunition" to use in their confrontations with Draco. This is all speculation, obviously.

3. Draco /did/ fix the vanishing cabinet. We have no indication of the difficulty of this task.

The others here commenting that "Hermione could have done it in 5 mins" are clutching at straws. Maybe they're right, or maybe Hermione couldn't have fixed it at all? We have no information to base those assumptions from, though we can make some "safe" guesses. whoever previously owned and used the cabinet either didn't want to fix it or /couldn't/ fix it themselves - assuming they couldn't fix it due to lack of ability, that lends to the idea that fixing the cabinet is not a trivial task. And we know it took a few months of work to get it working.

You have no /actual/ proof of this, you're making assumptions to suit the narrative you've already decided is "correct". We actually know very little about Draco Malfoy, and that is what makes him an interesting character to write about.

And I can't remember in which book it occurs, but I seem to remember Dumbledore /himself/ said that he gave Ron and Hermione the Prefect role in the hopes they would temper Harry's more impulsive side. So your "Ron made prefect without special treatment" argument falls flat in the face of that (assuming I can trust my brain in believing this is canon).

At the end of the day, we know very little about Malfoy. He is just a kid. I find that I can generally judge the quality of a fanfic by how it treats characters like Draco. Does the story treat them as evil incarnate when they're teens? If so, the story will usually be dogshit.

***** I went to boarding school in the NE in the states, and we did have something similar to prefects, but they were called "monitors," or "mons" for short. Essentially, there were a couple upperclassmen students per dorm who would rotate the days that they were on duty. Primary duties of the mons were to visit every kid in the dorm during study hours (when you must be doing work), discuss their day with them for a couple minutes, and make sure you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. Mons also had the ability (within dorms) to deduct points if you were not doing your work, or making a lot of noise after lights out, etc. Enough deducted points = detention on saturday night :(

But tbh, the way that my school did it made WAY more sense...kids had to apply for the position, have their entire academic and disciplinary history taken seriously into account , and also had limited powers (they couldn't just take away points for no reason whatsoever, the way that Draco did in the 5th book when he took away points from Hermione for being a mudblood and from Harry because he "[[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/604577-anyway-members-of-the-inquisitorial-squad-do-have-the-power][didn't like him]]"). Genuinely have no idea why Hogwarts prefects are able to take away house points from people outside of their house, because everything else about prefects/monitors totally makes sense.

On the contrary, they'd managed to get on his bad side, and as long as Voldemort was alive, they would be bound to him, through the Dark Mark, with no chance of escaping (as seen with Karkaroff). They would constantly be subjected to Voldemort's whims, including torture and, likely, murder, once the war was over and they'd become useless to him.

So maybe the Malfoys had already started to think that Harry winning would be more advantageous for them. At least the good guys didn't engage in torture, and there was also the possibility of using the family's fortune and influence to get off with no punishment.

Regarding Karkaroff, I always read it as the Dark Mark being used to track the Death Eaters. Since they can use it to Apparate wherever Voldemort is, it's likely that the connection can be exploited to find the Death Eaters. It definitely sounds like something Voldemort would do.

As someone who's rich, he probably had tutors as a kid but there's no evidence of him putting any more effort into his studies than Ron until his life depends on it in 6th year. When comparing intelligence, we definitely know Ron is good at being strategic and has the most common sense of at least of the trio. Possibly his entire year. He's just a normal kid in the sense that he doesn't really care for studying or keeping his grades up. Draco may have more book smarts, bc again, he's rich, but he lacks any common sense. Srrsly, he doesn't think about things like using slurs in school can get you in trouble or aggravates a dangerous animal is a stupid thing to do. He's spoiled and just thinks things will go his way and has 0 critical thinking skills until his life gets wrecked.

** Academically, you are right. There is no evidence that proves Draco is smarter than Ron. Some readers refer to the Draco/Lucius conversation as "proof" that he was second to only Hermione. But, that absolutely does not prove that. He was also in the Potions class before Harry and Ron got there, so he most likely got an O in potions. But, again, this does not prove much. Harry got an O in DADA while Ron got an E and he outright states in book 5 that he was not a better student than Ron was.

A big guess as to why people would assume is firstly economic status. Draco is rich and Ron is poor, so /obviously Draco is smarter./ Or it could be the way each person speaks. Ron does a ton of "reckon" and "bloody hell", while Draco does not. These are just guesses.

Ron has much better canon feats than Draco, he does all of this in *book seven alone.*

Of course, it's worth pointing out that the connection between your grades at school and your intelligence is weak, at best. Many very bright people have average or low grades at school, and many perfectly average people do very well by working hard.

I'll also point out that while Snape plainly favors Slytherins and treats Draco as his class pet, that doesn't mean that Draco doesn't deserve his Potions marks, any more than Hermione doesn't deserve /her/ grades in Transfiguration just because McGonagall clearly likes /her/.

Additionally, up until 6th year he has a specific extracurricular that Draco doesn't, namely, dealing with Harry's Boy-Who-Lived crises. Even when Ron and Harry aren't getting along, all that has to affect his time management. (I'd be stunned if Draco's marks in 6th year are anything to write home about.)

***** I also agree that it's alright not to be super smart. I think this sub in particular is hyper focused on a sort of intellectual elitism that makes me uncomfortable. It's often used to undermine Ron's worth.

All I'm saying is that Ron isn't a below average student. And as Hermione says, other things matter than good grades.

** I don't deride Ron because he's dumber than Draco. The reason I don't like Ron, and will only ever bash him in my fics, is because he's a fake jealous little shit who on more than one occasion has flat out abandoned his "best friend", and who believes loads of other people over his "best friend". At least with Draco, he's honest about his fakeness you know he's fake from the beginning. He hates Harry because Harry refused his friendship.

Back to the topic though, we see from the first flying lesson that Draco has obviously used a broom before. Snape isn't actually his godfather, I can't see Snape flat out giving his students better grades, more points yes (even though if you add up the point tallies from the books McGonagall took away more points overall) but not grades. Dumbledore throughout the book has played favorites, so of course, Ron would become the prefect over somebody like Dean. Ron is gullible enough to believe his brothers over a spell to change his rat yellow, Ron thinks using a broken wand will work, etc.

Draco, as people have said, knows Occulemency, he's taking the NEWT classes in potions, DADA, and transfiguration, he uses non-verbal magic, and not to forget that Serpensortia is a higher-level spell because the counter spell Vipera Evanesco isn't taught until the 5th year DADA. Why is Draco smarter? My guess would be because his ultra mega-rich parents hired him some tutors to make sure he's at the top.

**** I could absolutely forgive the time in 4th year, but he most certainly should have known better by the 7th, and the fact that he does it again, means he probably hasn't learned much since the first time it happened. As he himself admitted he was jealous. I personally consider it to be fake to do that to your friends.

I believe Dumbledore gave Ron the position of prefect, mostly because of Ron's character. When Ron looks in the mirror we see that what he really desires is fame, glory, being recognized for his own achievements, and I think Dumbledore gave him that position to give something that Ron could be proud of.

I will concede that Snape could have likely boosted Malfoy's grade some, but I honestly don't see it in his character. He doesn't have any connection to Draco, except that Draco is in his house he's not Draco's godfather or any other relation. Which could mean Snape slightly boosted all Slytherins grades or he didn't boost any grade. I'm inclined to believe the latter.

Yeah, I was basing it off the game, to me while not canon, it's like those star wars books that come out that don't have anything to do with George Lucas, they have the brand seal of approval, which makes them stronger than fanon but not quite as strong as canon.

Here's a snippet:

#+begin_quote
  But nobody wanted to hear that he wasn't hungry; nobody wanted to hear that he hadn't put his name in the goblet; not one single person seemed to have noticed that he wasn't at all in the mood to celebrate... Lee Jordan had unearthed a Gryffindor banner from somewhere, and he insisted on draping it around Harry like a cloak. Harry couldn't get away; whenever he tried to sidle over to the staircase up to the dormitories, the crowd around him closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer on him, stuffing crisps and peanuts into his hands... Everyone wanted to know how he had done it, how he had tricked Dumbledore's Age Line and managed to get his name into the goblet...

  "I didn't," he said, over and over again, "I don't know how it happened."

  But for all the notice anyone took, he might just as well not have answered at all.

  "I'm tired!" he bellowed finally, (*after nearly half an hour.* )"No, seriously, George - I'm going to bed -"
#+end_quote

There's no way that Ron didn't hear the "blast of noise" when Harry came in. But Harry remains downstairs with his admirers for nearly a half-hour before he comes upstairs to find Ron. Which gives Ron a half-hour to brood about why if Harry didn't put his name in the goblet, Ron's upstairs alone with zero information while Harry hangs out with his admirers downstairs.

And things don't go well when Harry finally does show up.

#+begin_quote
  He [Ron] looked up when Harry slammed the door behind him.

  "Where've you been?" Harry said.
#+end_quote

Not a great start from Harry. Harry means it as "why weren't you there for moral support?" But to Ron, this registers as "Why weren't you downstairs congratulating me at the party with the others?"

Since we see the books from Harry's POV, we know that Harry wasn't really a voluntary participant in his own party. But Ron doesn't know this. Harry shows up thirty minutes "late" with a Gryffindor banner tied around his neck and looking like he's enjoyed spending the last 30 minutes being praised by the entire house.

#+begin_quote
  "Oh hello," said Ron.

  He was grinning, but it was a very odd, strained sort of grin. Harry suddenly became aware that he was still wearing the scarlet Gryffindor banner that Lee had tied around him. He hastened to take it off, but it was knotted very tightly. Ron lay on the bed without moving, watching Harry struggle to remove it.

  "So," he said, when Harry had finally removed the banner and thrown it into a corner. "Congratulations."

  "What d'you mean, congratulations?" said Harry, staring at Ron. There was definitely something wrong with the way Ron was smiling: It was more like a grimace.

  "Well... no one else got across the Age Line," said Ron. "Not even Fred and George. What did you use - the Invisibility Cloak?"

  "The Invisibility Cloak wouldn't have got me over that line," said Harry slowly.

  "Oh right," said Ron. "I thought you might've told me if it was the cloak... because it would've covered both of us, wouldn't it? But you found another way, did you?"

  "Listen," said Harry, "I didn't put my name in that goblet. Someone else must've done it."

  Ron raised his eyebrows.

  "What would they do that for?"

  "I dunno," said Harry. (*He felt it would sound very melodramatic to say, "To kill me."*)

  Ron's eyebrows rose so high that they were in danger of disappearing into his hair.

  "It's okay, you know, you can tell /me/ the truth," he said. "If you don't want everyone else to know, fine, but I don't know why you're bothering to lie, you didn't get into trouble for it, did you? That friend of the Fat Lady's, that Violet, she's already told us all Dumbledore's letting you enter. A thousand Galleons prize money, eh? And you don't have to do end-of-year tests either..."

  "I didn't put my name in that goblet!" said Harry, starting to feel angry.

  "Yeah, okay," said Ron, in exactly the same sceptical tone as Cedric. "Only you said this morning you'd have done it last night, and no one would've seen you... I'm not stupid, you know."

  "You're doing a really good impression of it," Harry snapped.

  "Yeah?" said Ron, and there was no trace of a grin, forced or otherwise, on his face now. "You want to get to bed, Harry. I expect you'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something."
