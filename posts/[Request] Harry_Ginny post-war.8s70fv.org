Fluffy, angst, anything. My only stipulations are no Weasley, specifically Ron, bashing, and no CC-compliance.

PS: If it involves the Next-Gen, I'm not a fan of little0bird or Northumbrian (/don't hate me/) but if you want to recommend it anyway, go ahead. Someone else might like it.


** You might like some of my stuff. I only have a one shot that is next gen and it has very loose cc compliancy but barely touches on it at all. Other fics I have include Harry and Ginny attending Dudley's wedding, Harry being an Auror, DH from Ginny's POV. It's likely I will write a Harry/Ginny wedding one shot soon too.

**** Thanks! It will, but balancing caring for my mum and getting married in just under three weeks (!) means that it's a little delayed! I'm hoping to get back into it after my honeymoon, so towards the end of July.

** There is the ongoing Armistice Series by Annerb (direct sequels to The Changeling, also a great Ginny story). It's been a while since I last checked them out (the first fic in the series is complete, the second is ongoing) but I'm fairly certain they are Ginny pov (not sure if that's a problem).

** A couple of days ago I would have been right there with you about ignoring CC, but now I've been reading linkffn(12096051) and its sequel and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. It focuses on The Potter family, mainly on Albus, Ginny and Harry. The sequel switches perspectives between Harry and Albus for the most part.

/Technically/, people will say it's slash but I dsiagree. Albus and Scorpius' relationship is definitely central to the story but it is definitely not a pairing fic (ie, the entire point of the story is definitely not just about the relationship. It is much more about the Potter family) in the traditional sense.

At the same time, I haven't read CC and still understand what's going on, So it isn't entirely dependent on the story if you can accept that something happened with Albis and Scorpius in the year preceding the fic

  Ginny Potter estimates it will only take three days into the Weasley-Potter family holiday for Albus to act on his feelings for his best friend. Albus estimates it will only take three days for him to die of embarrassment. And Scorpius, well. Scorpius is just glad to be there with Albus in the first place.

*** Eh, I'm not a fan of Scorbus when it's based on CC. Reminds me too much of SnapexLily and that's a toxic relationship. Someone else might like it, though!
