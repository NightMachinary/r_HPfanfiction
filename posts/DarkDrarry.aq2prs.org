Alright so a common theme I see with drarry fics is that they almost always have a light!Draco or a redeemed Draco. What I want to see if a drarry fic, preferably fourth year or later, that has a Gryffindor Harry falling for Draco and then turning dark. Can have good dark side or bad dark side I just really want to see a drarry fic where both Draco and Harry are dark. Fic does not need to be focused on the drarry, just have the relationship.
