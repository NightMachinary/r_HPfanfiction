I want anything that focuses on McGonagall, at any time in her life. Any length, any genre, and any pairings, but smut acceptable only as part of a larger story.

Already read: [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3124159/1/][Just a Random Tuesday]].

** [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/687710]] is pretty good, if you don't mind the Dumbledore pairing

** My go to pairing is McGonagall/Hermione (I had a huge crush on most of my female teachers, so it suits me). There is a plethora of stories centering on them.
