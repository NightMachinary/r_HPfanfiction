:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I think they show up on the motorbike? Harry is raised pureblood but still hilarious and charming. He ends up casting a patronus like spell on the first year's toys to ward off the bad dreams? Help please! I've been searching for ages.


** The motorbike could be this one : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5856625/1/The-Return-of-the-Marauders][The Return of the Marauders]] linkffn(5856625)

Don't remember about the Patronus toys. Well it remind me something but in another one.

  James sacrificed himself to save his wife and son. Sirius took them into hiding and trained Harry the Marauders way. Neville became the BWL. That doesn't mean that he's the Chosen One. This is a AU story. Harry/Ginny MA Rating
