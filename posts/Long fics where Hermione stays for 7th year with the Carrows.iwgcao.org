Any rating/ pairing is fine.

I am looking for a well written fic that explores more of 7th year. I don't have any requirements other than it being readable, long enough to not feel rushed, and complete.

Suggestions?


** Wouldn't she get arrested? There is a reason all muggleborns went on the run in book 7. Unless you mean reincarnated or disguised as another person?

*** Well if I can't find it ill have to write it so... I kind of think of it like the Luna situation. Where it's more of a house arrest until they're useful. When they go to take her she goes into hiding with Neville and kind of turns the school into a proper guerilla war ground.

**** Check out linkffn(six pomegranate seeds by seselt) it has Hermione accodentally timetravelled into the body of a dead pureblood girl at the start of first year. Goes all the way to book 7 and might be a sequel too I think.

  At the end, something happened. Hermione clutches at one fraying thread, uncertain whether she is Arachne or Persephone. What she does know is that she will keep fighting to protect her friends even if she must walk a dark path. *time travel*
