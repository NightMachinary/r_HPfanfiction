I have an idea for a fic during 8th year (HP/HG, EWE), and I've gotten pretty far with the outline. However, every time I read through it I feel like it's missing something. I've spent days mulling it over and I can't think of what else it needs. The main story arc will be the romance between Harry and Hermione, and how they will recover from their traumatic experience the previous year and readjust to normal life. I have a several problems (and solutions at the end) planned out, but I feel like there needs to be more to it. I guess the stakes just don't feel big enough for the story to be interesting. Does anyone have any suggestions or tips on how to add more conflict/problems to their plot?

Examples of some of the arcs I have are: Hermione has mild PTSD and it is affecting her day-to-day life (Harry convinces her to get help for it); Harry feels lost and directionless now that Voldemort is dead (he will end up finding a passion).

tl;dr: Help make my fic's plot more interesting

** The one dynamic I could see happening in 8th year would be a lot of students in Gryffindor/Ravenclaw/Hufflepuff wanting revenge against Slytherin house for the shit they were put through the prior year. As symbols of the victors Hermione and Harry would naturally be thrust into the middle of mediating the conflict If they were Head Boy and Girl this would become an even bigger issue that they would have to deal with.

It could even be integrated into the things you mentioned Hermione and Harry would be dealing with as everyone in the castle will be damaged in some way.

** Unless they get together right away, a very easy source of conflict & drama could come from several girls having their sights set on HP, and HG trying to negotiate her own feelings with fears she is too late to actually get him. I mean, Harry at that point is probably more popular than Dumbledore was after he beat Grindelwald (voldemort was terrorizung them on their own soil, after all), so it would not be unrealistic for him to attract a lot of romantic attention.

Conversely, if you decide to veer away from the relationship drama, there could be a lot of fallout from the Muggleborn Registration stuff Umbridge supervised in Year 7. Muggleborns traumatized/"disappeared", orphaned teens out for revenge, purebloods resentful at giving reparations. HP and HG, given their personal backgrounds (muggle raised/born AND wizarding saviors) would be seen by both sides as their champion, which could make for a lot of uncomfortable decisions about who to support.
