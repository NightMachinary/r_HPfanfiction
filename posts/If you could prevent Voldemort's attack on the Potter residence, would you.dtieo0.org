Lets say you were a SI who arrived in the Potterverse sometime mid-October 1981. You could warn Dumbledore and/or the Potters of Voldemort's upcoming attack. But that would also mean that it's unlikely he would be defeated and would be free to continue to attack wizards and muggles.

Would you warn them or would you let him attack, knowing that whatever set of circumstances saved Harry Potter would temporarily destroy Voldemort and take him out of play for the next decade?

Personally, I don't think I would. While it's sad that Harry's parents would be killed, they are just two people out of the dozens (hundreds?) who had been killed by the Death Eaters and letting them die could save dozens of other families from torture and death.

I mean, I know a child is going to lose his parents but I keep quiet erm for the greater good. But I'm rather curious how it would work if an OC really wanted to do more than that, like if they were planning on saving the Longbottoms and giving other death eaters what they deserve. And also how Harry would react upon learning that there's a person who knew what was going to happen and let it happen. But that's for those who would let the events unfold the way they did.

** Yes, of course:

- I would ask them (or Sirius, or Dumbledore) to set a massive trap consisting of combined Muggle and Magical explosives, preferably adding some Basilisk venom in the mix.
- I might cause some collateral damages in the neighborhood, but I consider them acceptable in light of neutralizing a systemic threat like Voldemort for several years. Our own military was actually willing to risk far more civilians to take out far less important targets.
- Once the trap works and Voldemort's wraith is left howling for Albania, it's time to get that Wormtail hiding outside the Potter cottage, if he's not already killed by the trap itself.
- Next, prepare another ambush at Longbottoms. Present the heads of the Lestranges to the Wizengamot and Goblins should net their vault and the Cup. Present the head of Barty Jr will get Barty Sr removed from his post.
- After that, encourage the Order to launch full scale counterattack against Death Eaters. Divide Death Eaters among themselves, offer those opportunistic ones like the Malfoys to betray the hardliners. No locking up at Azkaban either, anyone with even one murder conviction gets pushed over the Veil.
- Pass legislations to seize Death Eater assets to compensate their victims. I mean this is some of the most basic form of justice, and it should absolutely be done!

I personally will never ever let Harry carry a part of Voldemort's soul!

I also know where each of Voldemort's Horcruxes is hidden. Once he is reduced to a wraith, he's already fucked up beyond any recognition. Once we got Barty Jr and the Lestranges, it would take less than 24 hours to send his soul to rot in hell forever!

--------------

There's absolutely no fucking need to repeat the canon timeline. Canon good guys only won through an atrocious amount of Deus Ex Machina, Author Fiats, Plot Armors, and multiple “Lucky Hero” tropes. Even then, the bad guys completely took over, carried out genocides against Muggleborns, murdered who knows how many Muggles, tortured hundreds of Hogwarts students with Cruciatus, and finally killed off another 50% of the good guys before losing to JKR's (Words of the God) many shenanigans.

Good guys had it best a Pyrrhic victory. It's just awful.

Any time traveler who wants a repeat of that total cluster fuck is one big fucking coldblooded negligent shit head:

- There is absolutely no need to let the Potters die.
- There is absolutely no need to let the Longbottoms suffer.
- There is absolutely no need to let Harry have a piece from that sadistic genocidal maniac. It will be far easier to send that piece of shit to hell without worrying about Harry's status.

  After the war, Hermione is haunted by the friends she lost, so she comes up with an audacious plan to fix it, starting way back with Harry's parents. Now, all she has to do is get herself taken seriously in 1981, and then find a way to get her old life back when she's done.

** Yes, because Voldemort should be pretty easy to defeat if you use the Battle of Hogwarts to judge his leadership abilities. A 12 year old Star Craft player has a better grasp of strategy than Voldemort, who ordered repeated frontal assaults on a fortified hilltop position across hundreds of yards of open ground. Same goes for Dumbledore if you look at his track record. The Order had capable fighters, just look at the end result of the DoM battle. One down and a few injured in return for almost a dozen Death Eaters. You'd only have to make sure that the Death Eaters can't return to Voldemort.

Hell, you could boobytrap the Potter house and blow Voldemort up with a few tons of plastic explosives as soon as he enters. Or maybe a little less if the Fidelius does not contain explosions. After that, destroy the Horcruxes and without anything left to anchor him to this world, he'd pass as soon as he has to leave whatever animal he was possessing in Albania.

And most of his horcruxes had been destroyed by that point which probably made him even more unhinged. I don't think you can use his performance (or lack thereof) at the Battle of Hogwarts as a judge of his abilities/intelligence before he got defeated by an infant.

***** AK was the "death" spell. One shot, one kill. No magical shields could protect against it; the only defense is to block it with something or get out of the way.

Voldemort getting surprised by a defense that had never occurred before is not a mark against him - Black Swan events are notoriously hard to prepare for.

And who knows - maybe all of those other ways to kill Baby Harry would have been turned back on him as well. Hard to say since that level of defense had never occurred and quite possibly will never occur again.

** I would not. While I'm not sure if it's canon or fanon, my headcanon has Voldemort winning at this point in time. Peter is still around as an active mole, and as long as Lily remains alive, Severus' loyalities are not firmly on the side of Light -- if Voldemort were to truly grant her sanctuary conditional on SS' loyalities, the Order would lose its spy, becoming a triple-agent (making its intelligence situation even worse).

If Voldemort decided to stop concerning himself with the Prophecy and on taking over the Ministry, I'd imagine that the Wizarding Britain would ultimately end up in Voldemort's hands, and Hogwarts becoming the last safe zone for the other side (because of Dumbledore), and you can't last forever that way -- especially not if Peter remains undiscovered.

This stance assumes lack of ability to change anything else -- no Horcrux knowledge, no changing the way the Order behaves, etc. Otherwise, the obvious change is to let the Godric's Hollow event become a trap.

** I'd probably make a really hard decision to let events unfold as normal until after voldemort was defeated, at which point I'd attempt to insert myself into Harry's life as some sort of parental/guardian figure and ensure that he would grow up a well-balanced individual, even if I couldn't prevent him from going to the Dursley's. I'd also attempt to intervene before Sirius got himself framed by Pettigrew, though whether he'd listen to some random muggle a couple years younger than him is another story, and I'd most definitely try to keep the Longbottoms safe and sane. All else failing, I'd get in touch with Dumbledore, reveal my knowledge of Voldemort's horcruxes (which, depending on what you believe, he doesn't even suspect exist). Best case he believes me and gets a head start on dismantling Voldemort's immortality, worst case the idea is planted in his brain and he doesn't take as long as in canon to twig on to the fact that I was right and Voldemort is in fact using horcruxes to stay alive. Those would be my main goals, but depending on my state of arrival (am I taking over the life of someone else and therefore have resources, or am I penniless? Do I even realize I'm in the Potterverse? Am I still a muggle or do I have magic? Et cetera) I'd obviously have different immediate goals, such as not freezing to death in early-winter Europe. It's horrible to sacrifice Lily and James, but after Voldemort "dies" it becomes much easier to plan and there's a much clearer path forward. I just don't know enough about what happened before his defeat to be able to effectively strategise, predict and derail other paths he might take. I'm a firm believer in the butterfly effect and I'm more comfortable operating within parameters that I'm familiar with.

** This is the classic “train with diverting tracks” argument about sacrificing the few to save the many. It's been implied and outright stated in the Harry Potter universe that a magical foil to Voldemort had to be created. He could've gone after Neville and his family, but was never going to (sans the fact that they were Order members with a baby born on July 31). He was always going to go after the blood foil to himself. That's the part of that night he should have seen the most: he himself created the only means to defeat his plans for a new Wizarding World.

I personally wouldn't stop it, because of this fact. But I still hold Sirius as responsible for what happened that night as Peter was, because what Sirius did was borderline cowardly.
