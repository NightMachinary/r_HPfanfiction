I don't remember anything else about it. Just that scene, Quirrel tried to offer Harry to the basilisk, Harry spoke, and said basilisk turned on Quirrel instantly.

If there are any stories where Diary Riddle doesn't get his way with the basilisk, please post them. Thank you.


** That sounds like what happens in the Child of Azkaban by LonelyHarvest when Voldemort tries to stick the basilisk on Harry and it backfires beautifully. linkao3(The Child of Azkaban by LonelyHarvest)

That also happens in this fem!Harry fic where Riddle fails to account for the fact that Harry too can speak parseltongue. linkao3(that tender light by mayfriend)

*** Ah yes. The Quiet ones Series. Still pissed that it stopped right as it was about to get REALLY interesting. Also, how unlucky can Remus get? Poor guy manages to send a message and it gets ignored because petrification is a thing...

Haven't read the other one yet.

  Being in the middle of a dangerous war meant having to plan ahead for the worst case scenario, as both James and Lily Potter very well knew. And as such, they placed powerful safeguards to ensure their son Harry would grow up with proper guardians should anything happen to them. ...in their defence, neither of them would have ever expected what would happen to one Sirius Black after their deaths.

  Harry's dreams that night were frenzied, disjointed, terrifying. There was blood on the walls, blood on her hands, an animal lying prone at her feet. She was laughing. She was laughing, high and cruel. A flash of green light. A scream. Blood on the floor, not water. Blood going up her arms, as if she's stuck her arms deep in a bath of it, and a voice - the voice in the walls - I smell blood, it chorused in a thousand languages, I smell BLOOD! She tried to run away, but only seemed to get closer to the crime scene with every turn. Moaning Myrtle was a girl, a real girl, but then she was on the floor, glassy eyed and empty, and always afraid, always hiding. I will return for you, Harriet Potter... promised the monster, and Harry believed him. Second year of my Soulmate AU, wherein Harriet Potter's hopes for a nice, quiet year are thwarted by a singularly determined house elf, two bickering best friends, and a strange boy in a fifty year old diary.
