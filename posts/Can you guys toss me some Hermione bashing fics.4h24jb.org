** Better yet, does anyone have a Hermione-bashing fic that doesn't involve Ron-bashing? I desperately need a change

** I upvoted you even though I disagree /completely/ with the premise of your question. This sub *needs* more controversial and pot-stirring content.

** Finding Hermione bashing fics are pretty hard. I remember reading one where Hermione applies for a job in the Ministry and gets shut down pretty hard.

*** Was it a one shot where they basically told her that she messed up with the time turner and other kids would use them to invent potions and things? That was a cute one

**** Right, that's the one! And the guy mentioned how Hermione kept badgering Harry and Ron to finish school...when they just used their fame to get top of the line training from veteran Aurors and are now really high up.

** *Aspirations*, linkffn(4545504), contains very serious Hermione bashing.

*Without a Trace*, linkffn(11718442): Hermione's actions in this story were pretty bad imho.

*Harry Potter & Death's Ultimatum*, linkffn(8286141): another fic that didn't portray her in a positive light.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.
