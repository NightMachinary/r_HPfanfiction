And so Dumbledore continues to prepare his hero over the years, trying to ready young Harry for a war that will never come. The major plot points of the books still happen, but are orchestrated by Dumbledore. He's convinced that Harry needs to learn how to be a hero, and that the best way for that to happen is to face and fight “evil” year after year as he grows up.

As time goes on and Voldemort doesn't reappear, Dumbledore grows more desperate and starts trying to lure him out of hiding. He decides that the surest way is to attack the man's pride, and so Albus Dumbledore pretends to be Lord Voldemort, returned from the dead, certain that news of an imposter will bring the real one out of hiding.

But then the Death Eaters start flocking to him, and Albus decides to keep up the act for a while longer; after all, he's learning valuable information about who really fought on the enemy's side during the last war, and now he'll know who not to trust when Voldemort rises again.

Things begin to avalanche, and Dumbledore finds himself leading the Dark Lord's army while simultaneously playing the part of a kindly headmaster and teaching Harry all he needs to know to defeat the Dark Lord.

On that fateful eve of the final battle, after a war that saw surprisingly few casualties (though there were some, of course, because it was necessary for the Greater Good) compared to the last one, Harry walks into the forest clearing ready to sacrifice himself only to find Dumbledore waiting for him instead of Voldemort.

** By the time the final battle comes around, Dumbledore has been playing the part so well and for ao long that he becomes the most feared dark lord ever. Even though the death tolls are pretty low, Dumbledore is a master manipulator and has used it to inflict mortal fear. Voldemort is no longer a feared name, but people flinch in fear even THINKING the name Dumbledore.

** It was October 31st, and the world believed that Voldemort was dead. The wizarding world, at the very least, did. Britain, where Voldemort was operating, celebrated, but the war wasn't finished. The sane death eaters went into hiding, claiming the imperius was cast upon them. Harry Potter, a toddler, was renounded a hero across Wizarding Britain. The toddler was sent to his Aunt's home, where the Boy-Who-Lived was neglected.

~

Albus Dumbledore was an extremely powerful wizard. He had fought in two wars, one where he was claimed a hero, against his ex-boyfriend. And one where he found a young hero in Harry Potter. Speaking of the boy, it was his fourth year, where the Tri-wizard Tournament would become the Quad-wizard Series. Of course, this was due to Albus himself, but who could blame him. On Halloween, Albus pulled names out of a goblet. Viktor Krum... Fleur Delacour... Cedric Diggory... And finally, as he spoke, congratulating the contenders, one final name flew out. "Harry Potter." Albus spoke. Gasps came from the great hall, where Harry Potter stood, terrified. He walked where the contestants were, too stunned to even speak. The great hall roared, all fighting about the credibility of Harry's enterence.

~

"He's back! Voldemort's back!" Harry shouted, holding Cedric Diggory's body close to him. The horrified teenager had tears streaming down his face, as he cried out repeating himself over and over again.

~

The war raged on, horcruxes were found and destroyed. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley found themselves back at Hogwarts, where they spent the previous 6 years, before the Horcrux hunt began. A voice rang out. "Harry Potter, if you would like your friends to live, then come to the Forbidden Forest, alone."

So Harry did. There were too many casualties, too many innocent have fallen. He walked to a clearing where he found an unexpected face...

"Professor Dumbledore?!" Harry's eyes grew.

"I admit... Things have gotten out of hand." Harry's old headmaster spoke.

~

In shock, Harry walked away. Not another word was spoken between the two, but as everybody saw not only Harry, but the supposedly dead Albus Dumbledore, everybody stopped fighting. Albus stood tall, hand perfectly fine. And the Headmaster coughed into his hand. The old man gave an impressive speech, if it weren't for the fact that he had been foraging Lord Voldemort's place during this entire war he might have actually lived through it. Accounts of the tale vary, but they all agree on one thing. In her rage Bellatrix Lestrange killed Dumbledore.

As this happened, the Headmaster's office opened, revealing his memories. He faked the Voldemort coming back. He manipulated events for Harry Potter to train, as the old man attempted to tell, once his portrait appeared among the other Headmasters.

Now, people hardly shudder at the name Voldemort, however at the name Dumbledore people cower in fear. There are tales recount a man with too much power, forcing a young boy to train for a war that would never come.

** I'm picturing Dumbledore showing up in increasingly unlikely times/places to try to convince Harry that Voldemort is still alive. He even makes another philosopher's stone or something just to stay alive long enough to guide Harry when Voldemort returns.

**** Dudley as raised by Lily and James. Given the fact that he came to regret his childhood behavior in canon, he clearly had the potential all along to be a fine human being and was only as much of a bully/criminal as he became because of his parent's influence. In other words, basically the same as canonical Draco in that respect.

** Dumbledore spread out his arms. 'The last enemy we must defeat is death.'

'You're insane,' Harry spit out. He looked at his old headmaster, almost unconsciously looking for the ugly features of Voldemort. But apart from red  firelight glinting of the glasses, he saw nothing.

Dumbledore shrugged.

'It had to be done, ' he said simply. 'Who could possibly suspect kindly old, eccentric old Dumbledore, Champion of the light to be Voldemort?\\
'Quirrel... that was /you/?' 'Yes. It was all me.' 'You /disgust/ me.' 'I know. I expect you have questions?' Dumbledore was surprisingly placid for someone that was about to either kill his favorite student, or be killed. 'What did you put in your lemondrops?' Harry asked, before firing of a spell.

He never thought he'd say it, but now he was ready to believe Rita Skeeter on /anything/ she wrote about the headmaster and his rather infamous lemon drops.
