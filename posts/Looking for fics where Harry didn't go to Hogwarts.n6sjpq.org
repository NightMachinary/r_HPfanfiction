Give me allll the Harry Potter fics that you know where Harry Potter didn't go to Hogwarts, (for whatever reasons) and meets wizards later on. I've read a few like this, but would love more.

P.S - please avoid the ones where Snape is Harry's mentor (and definitely avoid snarry) or the ones with too much bashing, thanks!

  'You're a wizard, Harry' is easier to hear from a half-giant when you're eleven, rather than from some kids on a tube platform when you're seventeen and late for work.

  In 1991, Harry Potter begins his time at Stonewall High, unaware that he is anything more than a boy prone to freakish accidents. When he turns fourteen, he will receive a letter that will change his life. He will learn he is Harry Potter, and be invited into a world where belonging is his birthright. Until then, he stumbles on, two steps forward and one step back, out of the cupboard and into the life he was never meant to have.

  After confronting Dumbledore about their failure-of-a-Savior Longbottom, Draco learns of another boy who would fit the bill. His name is Harry Potter, and he lives with his Muggle relatives in Little Whinging. Oh, and he knows nothing of the wizarding world or magic.Or, the story of Draco going to the Muggle Realm to fetch him, and how that affects them both.

  It was "Witch Weekly", of all people and organizations, the first to notice and comment on The Boy Who Lived's absence from the ranks of first years at Hogwarts. The magazine went on to elucubrate that the young hero was studying at a foreign school, possibly Beauxbatons or Holzschuhk√§se.
