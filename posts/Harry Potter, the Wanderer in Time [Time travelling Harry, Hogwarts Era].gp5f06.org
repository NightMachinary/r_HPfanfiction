Not an OP Harry story, at least in the beginning. Believable development. No bashing, and I /try/ to avoid cliches. But given that time travel itself is pretty cliche... Anyway it's my own twist to it.

There is a minor crossover in this fic, with Merlin (BBC) but the characters involved are canon in universe.

Features: I've kept it in spoiler, but they are not big spoilers.

Certain events trigger Harry to travel in time. I try to explore the mysterious nature of magic. You may see some canon historical characters. Overall a light-hearted fic. Focus on Adventure and Mystery.

I can answer any other question in the comments, though I haven't really planned the fic completely yet. Currently in chapter 15,


** The summary rings some alarm bells for me.

Does the story disregard canon completely, and focus exclusively on the time travel, with self-contained character growth and plotlines?

Does the story alter canon, having it serve as a base of operations for Harry, a time to regroup until he goes on the next time travel?

Does the story follow the stations of canon with absolutely no change to anything?

The whole "as he travels time and struggles with his second year" is mildly concerning me rn.

Hmm... Yes and no? This is a fanfiction, so canon itself would inevitably change. I am trying to address how the canon would change with this new ability of Harry's that I have introduced. It does not focus exclusively on time travel, but the past is an important component in it. He does not spend too much time there, however.

Big spoiler:>! He develops a related ability that allows him to view the past. Thus past is very relevant.!<

I am unsure what you mean by that. The story emphasizes on the events of Harry Potter book 2 and its plotlines. As of now, there are no plans for any major plotline in the past per se. However, the past and the present are very much intermeshed in this story, and I can't reveal more than that without spoiling everything.

It alters canon, of course, as most fanfics does. The canon plotline doesn't stay the same with all the changes I've made. Let me say now that Harry does not have control over his time travelling ability when he goes to the past. I do not plan to give him control any time soon. The present is where he belongs.

Nope. Many future events change according to actions done now, otherwise it wouldn't make sense.

Oh, you'd be surprised.

In any case, I've started reading it now, and it's everything I hoped it'd be. I especially appreciate that you're not bashing anyone.
