** Self-promotion is allowed here, and even sometimes encouraged, but you should at least copy+paste the summary. Also, (personal preference here) maybe wait until you have a higher word count before posting.

*** It's not a joke. And I was trying to separate the sentences so that people could read them better. People have told me in the past that I needed to separate paragraphs and such because they had trouble reading it. And why do you think its a joke?

**** Paragraphs don't mean just separating sentences at arbitrary points. I don't want to discourage you from writing, it's a good thing, but before you continue I recommend reading a book to have some idea how to write. It's quite difficult to reinvent the wheel.
