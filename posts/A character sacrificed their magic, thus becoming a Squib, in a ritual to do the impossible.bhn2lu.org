** So ive been off the sub for like a year now. I don't remember seeing so many prompt posts back then im assuming they are something new? or is my memory just shit?

Either way, i know this is not exactly what you are looking for as its not something im writing but i remember reading a fic from the old days with harry doing a spell to take the cancer away from the father of a muggle family that he was good friends with. In the story wizards cannot get cancer or cure it but they can transfer it once, so harry is not stuck with terminal cancer.

The story was not super amazing by todays standards but i remember having good feelings back then.

**** If you meant the prompt to be an actual prompt i have 2 ideas i could write out.

First is on the horcrux hunt after 6th year. When they use the sword to destroy the locket it destroys the sword too leaving them with no options (no fiendfyre or killing curse cheating) but to try to get more basilisk venom when they need to destroy the cup and diadem. However it has been 5 years since the basilisk was killed so there is no venom to be had there. Hermione finds a ritual that might work but will cost the magic of the participants. 1 person per horcrux.

Second idea is a little different. When harry goes into the chamber to rescue ginny the ceiling collapse is worse than in the books. Harry is separated from ron and lockhart completely allowing no communication or hope of escape on his own. He saves ginny on his own, no fawkes or near death experience, but she wont wake up and he feels that he needs to get her to a healer. After exploring the chamber he finds some old books that have a form of the bubble head charm. How much magic you put into the charm determines the size of the bubble and its something you have to continually channel in order to keep it active. There is a passageway from the chamber to the black lake allowing the basilisk to get water and food. Harry decides to take ginny through this to get help but the passage is longer than he thought. As the bubble slowly shrinks around harry and ginny and harry gets more exhausted he has to make a choice on what to do.

let me know if either of those sound interesting to you and i can write them out. Just to give a warning, im not an experienced writer i just mess around with stories for my own amusement so don't expect polished amazing content like some people on here can create.
