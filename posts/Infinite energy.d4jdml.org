Say you were a wizard, and you wanted to go and end scarcity forever, no matter what the Statute of Secrecy stipulates. Maybe, for the sake of argument, you live in the distant future where muggle-wizard integration has sorted itself out.

What do you do? Use various charms to create a stable nuclear fusion reactor, or try to derive energy from a sustained Lumos Maxima (or any other spell that just discharges energy constantly)?

On a side note, do we have data as to whether Lumos produces heat?


** The most obvious solution is Gubraithian Fire, which creates an everlasting flame, just using it on few coal power plants would solve it.

Another obvious solution would be casting refilling charms on oil wells.

And another obvious solution would be to simply enchant turbines inside power plants themselves to move indefinitely and to generate energy forever.

This one. Why bother creating fuels when you can just turn the things directly.

Though you could probably just do away with electricity entirely and just make everything run off magic instead, like Colin's camera.

I was under the impression that Colin's camera running on magic was a result of it being exposed to Hogwarts highly magical environment, I dont really think it would be possible to mass produce the effect for the majority of muggle items, at least not with how small the magical population is.

***** According to JKR, it was something Colin did himself prior to arrival at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Why did Colin Creevey's camera work etc?

  As a vast number of people have pointed out to me in the last twenty four hours (some of them related to me by ties of blood) Colin DID develop a photograph from his camera in 'Chamber of Secrets' (my previous answer stated that he never did so).

  Cameras, like radios (or, as the wizards call them 'wirelesses' -- they're always a bit behind the times when it comes to Muggle technology) do exist in the wizarding world (there's a radio in the Weasleys' kitchen and we know there are cameras because of the moving photographs you see everywhere). Wizards do not need electricity to make these things work; they function by magic, but in the case of such objects the wizards liked the Muggle invention enough to appropriate the idea without adding cumbersome plugs/batteries.

  I have an old notebook in which it says dev sol (potion) magic [indecipherable word] photos move. Adept as I am at interpreting my old scribbles, I can tell you that the original idea was that wizards would use a magical developing potion to make their photographs move.

  SO... as Colin's batteries can't work in Hogwarts, clearly his camera is running off the magical atmosphere and he is then developing his photographs in the magical potion that causes the figures therein to move. All of which goes to show that Colin has a lot more initiative than I ever realised.

Contrary to common fanon, getting "magitech" appears to be so simple than even a first year can do it (either that or it's a common thing you can have done in Diagon Alley). Which the existence of magical radios should have told us anyway.

So much for Mugglwank!Harry's magitech empire blowing wizards' minds.

(Sometimes people who think themselves very clever say "Aha! But Colin had a camera in the 90s, when cameras didn't have batteries!"

As someone who had a camera in the 90s, I can confirm they commonly had batteries, which powered the flash and the automatic winding of the film.)

I still dont think you could really use it on the majority of muggle item though, unless the majority of wizards start spending all their time making items for muggle use. There just arent enough wizards.

Yeah, I never really understood that, it seemed quite clear in canon that when wizard didn't use much technology because of a lack of need, not because its impossible, I mean we see that even when wizards want to have some muggle technology like cars, they just get them.

** Short term, quick and dirty method: Magic fires in existing power plants.

Long term, proper method: Research how magic and electricity interact and create an easily mass producable enchantment that makes a wire produce a constant voltage. Solution can be implemented to power virtually any device.

Secretive method if you don't want to reveal magic: Develop magic wire and create muggle startup funded by some millionaire guy that's researching nuclear fusion reactors. There's already one doing rocket science, so people will accept that explanation. Once the electricity enchantment works, implement it to make the reactor prototype super energy efficient and start building tons of reactors all over the place. Magic government will get the normal government to accept the new power plants without asking too many questions, the normal government will do most of the job of providing security and assisting with mass deployment of reactors, eventually globally. Within a decade or two you could have most of the world running on magic without knowing it. Then use the money from selling energy cheaper than anyone else to hire more wizards and scientists sworn to secrecy and develop other cool things like magic CO2 air filters, warp drives, mass producable magic cures for various diseases that seem to be normal medicine, maybe 'fusion' powered cars, and mass produce anything that you can pass off as sufficiently advanced technology.

*** If you read VimesEnthusiast's A Third Path to the Future, Harry does use magic to enhance or shrink arc reactor generators. It has been a while since I checked it out, but the concept was pretty cool. Do check it out Linkffn(A Third Path to the Future)

Or just transfigure uranium-235 and use it before the transfiguration wears off. If all goes well, there won't even be any radioactive waste afterward.

But make sure you test it far away from Earth, just in case the result of the transfiguration wearing off looks more like "total conversion of matter to energy".

** Conjuring (or duplicating) infinite fuel of any sort seems like the obvious trick. You could, of course, create Lumos-based solar panels, but why? At the end of the day, though, I'm not even sure trying to power Muggle energy methods through magic is the way to go. Just give the Muggles magical items.

(All that being said, your "infinite" energy may not be quite so infinite. There is no real reason magical energy couldn't be as subject to entropy as any other form of energy.)
