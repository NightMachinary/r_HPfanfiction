** "Sun Tsu says in 'The Art of War' that those with nothing to lose will triumph over those who are distracted by maintaining what they do have," Hermione declared, her voice high. Her wand was pointed unerringly at Malfoy.

"That's all very nice, Hermione," said Ron, gently laying a hand on her shoulder, "but I'm not sure Sont Sue - whoever she is - was talking about Gobstones."

** Let's start by looking at number comparisons versus each other. If this is, say, 1 privileged out of 5, it's likely that the privileged could simply extend some smaller benefits and recruit those less dedicated, people who just want to live better. Few people are willing to revolutionize, unless under extremely strenuous circumstances. If it's 5 privileged to 1 oppressed, then the oppressed stand not a damn chance, unless they get given plot relevant abilities.

And finally, the interesting one. An even match. This is where I talk about which side it would be worse to be against in terms of even numbers, and as if you were one side or the other.

Initially, I thought “Vietnam war” when it came to “nothing left to lose.” Of course, that's ridiculous. The reason the Vietnamese were so effective was not only were they supplied various recourses by world powers, but they had EVERYTHING to lose. Motivation is a huge part of fighting, as any RTS would point out. With nothing left to lose, the enemy would likely hate you, maybe even fight you, but would give up. After all, why keep fighting for nothing.

By simply having the status quo, the privileged would be more desperate to maintain their power. Because they are actually fighting for something, they will stand a far better chance. And then we get to recourses. You give a man a gun, and another a knife. We all know the result. Don't bring a knife to a gunfight, after all.

In summary, those with nothing to lose will have nothing to stand for, and nothing to assist them. The others will have their society to stand for, and the backing of all their, well, everything.

It's really a obvious argument, but with Indy!harry fanfics parading the “nothing left to lose,” and then immediately giving him people to stand for, money to back him, and other stuff that he has to lose, it's easy for this to be misconstrued.

Another thing, this may be better under “discussions,” rather than “prompt”

**** Those that 'have noting to lose' usually fight because they have a lot to gain, not the other way around.\\
If people fought because they have nothing to lose there never would've been any slavery anywhere.

** I would say that those with nothing to lose are the worst opponent because they have nothing holding them back.

Someone with privileges will always have to think about the consequences of his actions, by fear of losing them. Let's take the Death Eater in DH for example (or the Nazis during the occupation of France since it's pretty much the same thing). Once they were in power, they did attack a minority (Muggleborn or Jews), yet did not move against the rest of the population. Because both knew that if they pushed things too far, the population may revolt and they could not handle this. On the other side, most of the population was glad to look the other way as long as they were left alone.

If the Death Eater has crossed the line (let's say for example, by killing in the middle of the ministry for no other reason that he likes Muggles), the other wizards may have started to wonder about their fate "/If a Pureblood like Arthur could be killed without any reason, what about me?/" and the resistance may have growed a lot. So they left Arthur continue his life "peacefully", while keeping an eye on him in the hope to find a true reason to arrest him.

​

On the other side, the one with nothing to lose just don't care. They have one objective in mind and will do anything in their power to reach it, no matter the price. If they want to kill a wizard, they will try to kill him. The killing Curse didn't work and now he won't leave his house? Let's burn the neighbour with Fienfyre and hope he is among the victims. If not let's try again.

​

The ones with privileges follow the rules of the game, the ones with nothing to loose don't, that make them more dangerous.
