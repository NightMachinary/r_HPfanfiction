This is copied from [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/ksabqu/its_said_that_governments_should_be_afraid_of/][this thread]]. But I expanded on the point because there's a lot to say.

Fudge's entire administration is built around avoiding and covering up problems. Seriously, the ministry of magic is a dystopian government. They send individuals to Azkaban without a trial, when they have the ability to never arrest the wrong man, as Wizards are able to both /read your mind/ or give you /literal truth serum/. The no-trial Death Eater laws are completely ludicrous, eliminating something that the mundane British government has outlined as a human right since the English Bill of Rights of 1689*, on the basis of being suspected of terrorist acts. They didn't even roll up Sirius's sleeve.

Fudge was able to send Hagrid to Azkaban, just to "be seen doing something." It's implied that Hagrid did not get a trial for this, or at least a sham trial, and was sent directly to Azkaban. Fudge was able to bypass the trial system personally, and did it to protect his public image.

Also, Arthur Weasley was able to get a bill passed which allowed him to raid the home of Lucius Malfoy, a /personal enemy/. Arthur is the head of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Department, and Malfoy wouldn't touch a single muggle artifact with a 39 1/2 foot pole. And we know that Aurors are those responsible for catching Dark Wizards, which is ostensibly why Malfoy was being investigated. It could be normal, don't know, but I find it suspicious.

Azkaban is a complete travesty of human rights that the Ministry uses to threaten individuals into compliance. We see that all the wizards are absolutely terrified of Azkaban. When we actually get to see Azkaban, I'd make the argument that the only reason that any individual survives there is plot convenience or wizards can just take more punishment. They starve everyone there, make their best efforts to freeze the prisoners to death, and that's not even mentioning the dementors. If we're not allowed to use sleep deprivation on individuals, I wonder how induced PTSD would be looked on by the United Nations. They feed the prisoners three square meals a day of misery, with despair for dessert**.

They are able to completely deny the claims that a dark wizard has returned and use a private newspaper to attempt a smear campaign on a /teenager,/ who /one year ago/ was entered into a Ministry endorsed tournament against his will because they couldn't be bothered to secure a stupid wooden cup, to prevent the only people they didn't want entering, from being entered. This smear campaign goes against all journalistic integrity, but the sheer volume of control that they influence over the newspaper because it is implied that the Ministry directly encouraged the Skeeter campaign.

They are able to launch a full trial for a minor***, who they change the times on, in order to prevent him from receiving legal counsel, and attempt to prevent the defense from even giving their version of events. It's a complete sham trial.

In this same campaign of defamation, they take over a learning institution, to attempt forcing conformity on the students. The Death Eaters tortured students in their run of the school. Umbridge attempted to brainwash students into pure ministry compliance through fear. We're told that they are trying to prevent students from learning to defend themselves, so they /don't overthrow the ministry./

She tortured students. I hate the fanfiction trope of, "oh, that's a blood quill, it's illegal," as you don't need to make the quill illegal to make torturing children a reprehensible act. She directly caused students harm, with the intent of causing them to suffer. The entire fifth book is a masterclass in what a tyrannical government looks like. The worst part? Everyone we meet acts like it's unfortunate, but nothing out of the ordinary.

The Ministry passes laws to invade a /private/ educational institution. This is, in fact, specifically remarked on. The ministry overstepped it's bounds to try to expel a student from said institution, and then they did all of the above. And the only reason they didn't get away with expelling the student is that they're scared of Dumbledore. No one else in the entire Wizengamot even comments on that.

Additionally, Umbridge attempted to /assassinate/ a child. She did this with a dementor, she was able to just borrow, apparently, because she's the secretary to the minister. I wasn't aware secretaries were allowed to take the nukes for a spin, but I guess I'm out of touch.

Whenever someone remarks upon the election process for the Minister of Magic, it's always a /they/. /They/ elected Scrimgeour, /they/ ousted Fudge, /they/ installed Thicknesse. Who the hell is they? It doesn't seem to include Arthur Weasley among its members. If I'm wrong about this, please tell me, but this seems suspicious. We have no idea who the lawmakers are, just that someone like Arthur Weasley can propose a bill. I mentioned my thoughts on this bill above, but it's at least a good sign.

And before someone says the Wizengamot is their legislature, recall that the only time we see them is when they are acting as a judicial body for /all/ criminal cases. If they were additionally a legislative body, this would be an issue for a few reasons. They wouldn't have the time to cover all of those cases. If they're the ones who decide whether their laws are valid, that's a massive conflict of interest. Dumbledore was removed from the Wizengamot by Fudge, or at least it looks that way. Chief Warlock appears to be similar to a role like the Speaker of the House in the United States. He's in charge of presiding over the Wizengamot sessions. Fudge then acted as the Chief Warlock, which is so sketchy it's ridiculous. It might have been that the Minister always has a seat, but then there wasn't a Chief Warlock, so it's more plausible that Fudge was simply acting as the Chief Warlock. So everyone has a hand in the cookie jar.

So we have no idea what the elections look like, and who votes for who. As far as we know, the Wizengamot writes the laws, judges the laws, and elects the minister, and we have no clue how Wizengamot members are selected. The Wiki says the Wizengamot is a legislative and judicial body if that matters as evidence as well. The Wiki also says that there are implications that the Minister is party to selecting Wizengamot members as well. I don't know if this is true, and I wouldn't put too much stock in it, but it should be considered. The minister also seems to be selected by the Wizengamot, which I'll go further into below in the parliament theory.

So, we still have no idea how the Wizengamot is selected. It appears to be made up of ministry officials, such as Umbridge and Fudge. Madame Bones makes sense, DMLE head and all. However, someone like Tiberius Ogden or Elphias Doge has no connection to the Ministry outside of the Wizengamot. This means that they aren't simply members of the Ministry. Additionally it means that they aren't likely to be selected through lordship, as the closest thing we have to an indicator of Noble Houses, besides families calling themselves that, are the Sacred Twenty-Eight. But the above mentioned Ogden, is certainly not a member. So that doesn't make sense. That leaves us with some form of selection system like the House of Commons, but we still don't know about their political parties, nor are any mentioned. So we can't say for certain, but I find it the most plausible. Since we don't have any mention of political parties, that means the minister would most likely be directly elected by the Wizengamot. Leaving us with gross imbalances of power and government overreach, so it's not that much better.

But let's toy with the idea of Lords of the Wizengamot, since it's so popular. Since we already dismissed the Sacred Twenty-Eight, we have to assume that there is a different selection method for who is a Lord. Maybe the lordships are artifacts of the pre-Statute government. It's not that consequential to saying that aristocracies are garbage. It makes the Ministry even worse, as now there is /no/ accountability on the side of the Wizengamot and they still have all of the other problems above. Even with the possible accountability outlined in my theory as to how they are similar to Parliament they don't become good.

But seriously don't endorse aristocracy. It's not cool. That's all.

Now please, give me your thoughts.

***Incidentally, if you'd like to emancipate Harry in a story, this is the route you should take. The goblet wasn't made by the ministry, the 17 or older thing was added later. There is no ministry acknowledgment necessary to make the contract binding. The trial, however, implies that the ministry acknowledges Harry as an individual who is responsible for himself. Add in Harry's wealth, and you have an argument for government acknowledgment of responsibility as well as proof of his ability to financially support himself. As soon as he turns 16, he can apply for emancipation. You could cite the Tournament as why Fudge was able to convince the Wizengamot to try him as a full adult, but that's not really necessary.

** I'd like to preface this with the point, that I agree that the wizarding world has dystopian elements.

Ok, the salient point I want to address is:

Just because magic exists, does not inherently make it a utopia. This seems to be the expectation of many, that that should be the case. In fact the terms utopian and dystopian are entirely relative. As such, just because magic does exist, does not make the wizards any less human, it will in fact tend to magnify the flaws that are already there.

I may be wrong, but it reads like you are operating under the assumption that these things aren't ‘normal' in the real world. For instance the treatment of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, see MI5 involvement too. The Prevention of Terrorism Acts as a result of the troubles enabled the Police to do some truly horrendous things. In the appeals of the Guildford Four and Maguire Seven, the Court of Appeal deemed that the Police had fabricated some of the evidence against them.

When an arrest is made, you can be remanded in custody, until the date of your trial, which can be months down the line. So Hagrid could feasibly have been remanded to Azkaban on suspicion of multiple counts of Attempted Murder. Fudge's Justification for doing so is wrong, but Hagrid is a hypothetically dangerous suspect.

The Ministry is well within it's rights to ‘invade' Hogwarts, private institution (I'll dispute this until the end but thats beside the point) or no, is still bound by the laws of the land. The Government in the real world does this too. As I knew it in my school days, Her Majesty's inspectorate of Education (now defunct) was explicitly founded to inspect the state of the schools in Scotland. My old school has been inspected at least twice in the last 10 years. The first time I can't remember why, but the second time was because of the suicide of a student. On the grounds of the Death of Cedric Diggory, the Ministry would be doing their due diligence to inspect the school anyway, politics aside. Again though, the ministerial justification may be wrong, but the situation has somewhat real world parallels.

Minors can be charged as adults depending on the crime. Mostly heinous crimes though. See John Venables, a controversial as it was, it set a precedent. As the Ministry is blatantly incompetent, we don't see it, and we don't actually ‘see' the consequences of breaking the SoS, it may be a serious as Murder, Sedition and Treason it may not. They also could have easily charged Harry in connection with Cedric's Death if they wanted.

The fact is, some of the stuff is precedented in the real world, but ask the Public if its a dystopia, they'll likely say no.

There is a Dumbledore quote that could be extrapolated to apply to wizards and magic as a whole;

“I make mistakes like the next man. In fact, being--forgive me--rather cleverer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly huger.”

The Power of Magic invites the necessity for stricter or harsher punishment, as the individual is more powerful on the whole, they need a way of keeping prisoners imprisoned. Yes it is hell on earth but each individual wizard is much more capable when it comes to causing untold destruction.

*** Good response.

You're wrong. I find instances of corruption quite normal. Magic wouldn't make a utopia, it makes people have magic powers. Nothing else. It does not make them worse, it does not make them better. To assume otherwise is flawed reasoning. We have no evidence to support it in the books, as everything they've done, we've done, and none in the real world, as we don't actually have magic powers. Don't assume my position. Read it.

Let's accept your point on Hagrid being remanded into custody. It's correct. But that brings us smoothly into your point about Azkaban. First, as to security; a Witch or Wizard without a wand is useless. They cannot do magic without it, and as such can be held in with something as mundane as a brick wall. It does not matter whether they can do more damage than a muggle when they have magic. They can't use it.

As to a harsher punishment; why does their having magic necessitate a harsher punishment? Is it because they can do more damage? They're charged based on the crime. So that can't be it. They're wizards, they can still rob someone, they might just commit tax evasion. Those are crimes committed without magic, but they need a harsher punishment because the individual who did the deed has magical abilities? Doesn't work. Even if they do, there is no possible good justification for dementors. It is /torture./ For /every/ crime.

For Harry's trial, the issue is not the fact that he's being tried as an adult. The issue is the fact that the Minister attempts to deny his right to said trial. They change the meeting times and don't allow Harry any defensive counsel. I remind you, been in the English Bill of Rights since 1689. They did not charge Harry in connection with Cedric's death, so that's a moot point.

I would fully support the inspection of Hogwarts and even the inquisition. They weren't doing it to enforce reasonable education and safety standards on a school full of some of the most negligent individuals I've ever seen. They were attempting to disarm the populace so they can't oppose Ministry rule. They said that. The justification matters.

Thanks for your response :)

** I think you're kind of missing the point here.

The later books of Harry Potter are explicitly intended to show a dystopia. It is not in any way subtle. This is not in any way controversial. It's baby's first dystopia.

There is a clear good and clear evil. Wizard hitler vs wizard anti-hitler. Harry and Voldemort are both incredibly 2d characters engaged in an incredibly 2d battle. And what ends up making it interesting is the incredibly 3d world Rowling created around it. Umbridge and Fudge are far more interesting villains that the big bad voldie.

What do you want from fics? For the characters to simply point at umbridge using a blood quill and monologue qbout how its clearly torture and have everyone just be like "hey.. that is torture! Are we baddies? Let's all just live happily ever afteafter."

*** No. What I wanted was to examine the why and how of that on a deeper level than Fudge is incompetent. That could be incredibly useful for fics where they use Umbridge and Fudge as villains.

The blood quill comment is just a response to a common trope where blood quills are illegal. Like, is torturing students not enough to make people say she's bad? It's a weird trope.

If I'm saying the wizarding world is a dystopia, and it's intended to be one, how am I missing the point? I think I'm hitting it perfectly. Unless you think that I think I'm some controversial genius. So why is everyone on this thread so willing to assume my motivations? Because I don't think that at all. It's not controversial, it shouldn't be controversial, what I wanted to do was, again, to talk about the why and how of the government.

**** Because you are constrained by the standards you used. Your perspective is the one of an outsider looking in; or, in another sense, the one of a reader reading the book. The result is not particularly useful in terms of understanding motivation, source or results of actions, which would matter, were one trying to write something.

That was the point of my question. You start with position X is bad, identify X in the wizarding world, and end with X being bad. The result is the obvious one, there's nothing that follows from it (apart from bad Fix-Its).

Conversely, a more interesting approach would be to take the magical world as we see it, and evaluate /characters'/ reactions to it, thus assuming the perspective of an insider. What does Mr Weasley think about Fudge and the Ministry? Lucius Malfoy? A random shop assistent? You thus inevitably end up judging the world in a relative, culture-dependent context, whose scale is defined by the people that inhabit it, and that's the right approach, at least if you're interested in any deeper realisation than that it's different from (or, if you are confident in your moral position, /inferior to/) our world.

And so you spared this most important of all aspects a single line -- "Everyone we meet acts like it's unfortunate, but nothing out of the ordinary. " -- which, far from being the 'worst' part, is actually the most /interesting/ part, because inevitably the questions arises (or it should, for any thoughtful reader) of why this is so. This line of thought is the source of interesting FF. Not so much expressing one's personal dislike of a world which indicates nothing so much as a dis/tance/ to it, i.e. a feeling of estrangedness due to an evaluation with standards a million miles removed from the nature of said world.

***** As I replied to your other comment. Morality is irrelevant to a dystopia claim. It refers to a world in which there is injustice, which is to say, a lack of fairness, on a particular scale. This is an actual definition.

I'm sorry that I thought a tangent on the societal implications there wasn't relevant to my point on government structures besides establishing a pattern.

Of course, if you read the rest of my evidence, you'd understand that I'm not constrained by individual viewpoints and their reviews of the ministry. I use evidence to establish the government structure.

For the last fucking time. My moral position on this world is irrelevant to the point of it being a dystopia. There is a definition for the term. I use evidence to back up that point. Refute it if you care to.

Your idea about examining individual reactions to the world is interesting, however it wouldn't be useful to the point here. It would be more useful in a point about life in the wizarding world or a fic where those views come into conflict.

****** Uh. What is this "particular scale" to which morality is irrelevant? How does the very concept of "injustice" even make sense without making value judgements? I'd say that those are obviously linked, as evidenced by your very post, which is full of value judgements everywhere -- from literally invoking human rights to the plethora of attributes ("ludicrous", "sham" "reprehensible", "ridiculous") to the nature of the content. It reads as one long opinion piece.

Which is fine, but it's also the source of confusion here. On the most bare-bone facts no one disagrees; like the other person said, no one will dispute it's a dystopia (even if I personally would reserve that particular term for the DH variant).

And the point I was making, in your terms, was that "injustice", just like any other morality-dependent term, has a certain relative or cultural component; simply put, what is a "crime" is not a fixture in humanity. And if Joe Average in the wizarding world sees no problem with the way the Ministry works, then listing all its failings as judged by our standards doesn't lead anywhere, as far as I can see.

******* TO /REPEAT/, morality does not matter. It is fairness. A dystopia is characterized by a world in which people are not treated fairly. It would otherwise be a useless term as Aldous Huxley and George Orwell would likely disagree on the subject of morality. Yet both of their works are specified as dystopias. My moral values do not matter in judging it as a dystopia. Just as they would not matter in deciding what is a utopia. It is a term referring to the /structure/ of society.

I am arguing that the Wizarding World is a /dystopia/. I used terms of judgement because they make the writing less dry. You might note, that I describe the events, in detail, even though I hyperbolize. Because my opinions on the morality of the world don't matter.

Injustice, as a term, means a lack of justice. Which in turn, refers to either fairness or everyone getting what they deserve. There are two definitions. I was referring to fairness.

If I were arguing that it was immoral, I would've started the post with an explanation of my system of morality. I didn't because the post isn't arguing for that.

My standards don't matter. They simply don't. They have no place in this discussion. This discussion is on societal structures, and whether or not they /fair./

This was an /opinion/ piece, just like every other argument. I have provided evidence for those opinions. Please don't mischaracterize the term to become an insult. It's not.

** Sure it is!

Voldemort (and his ilk!) are just a symptom of a stagnating, backwards (about the only thing they are doing right is not having a gender-bias, probably because magic is a great equalizer and it doesn't matter who is physically stronger, because any half decent witch will not let you anywhere close so physical strength is a non-issue!) society!

Hell, look at (what little) information we have about the muggle-studies course! It is out of date (was out of date by the time Tom Riddle attended Hogwarts!) and nobody bothers with upgrading it...hell, they may be able to delete memories, but the more cameras there are (from CCTV to Smartphones!) the more exposure they'll get, so keeping the secret is probably next to impossible after say 2005!

What is the most annoying part is that our "conquering heroes" (they aren't...Harry is just a lucky dude who stuff happens to, he is so lazy and reactive that it isn't even funny anymore!) just accept this and about the only law changes are some things about houselfs because that is a pet-project of Hermione! Otherwise there doesn't seem to be a lot of changes and most Deatheater-Kids retain their parents' power, influence and money (not to mention exclusive access to certain spells as they are part of a family library!) which they continue to lord over muggleborns!

Hell, that they allow a sentient castle to harm its inhabitants (especially first years students, who don't know the building yet!) with moving staircases, fake doors, trick-steps (and sexist steps, like the ones that protect the girl's dorms, while the boys don't have any protection!), doors that lead to other parts of the castle on a certain day etc. etc. is telling!

If I were Harry after defeating Voldemort? You bet I would try to drag the wiz-world into the freaking modern age (kicking and screaming if need be!)...but Harry sadly has no such ambitions!

*** No he had the authorization, that's why it's suspicious. It was second year when the incident I'm thinking of occurred. It's the fact that he is a personal enemy to Arthur, but ostensibly an upstanding member of society, who is a personal friend to the minister. Arthur was able to personally raid Malfoy's home due to a bill that Arthur passed. It's not definitive, but I find it suspect. In 6th year when he was responsible for the new department, his duties changed to focus on dark artifact, but in second year, he focussed on the misuse of muggle artifacts. Another example of this sort of behaviour was covering up the trash can attack at Mad-Eye Moody's.

*** What other standards should I evaluate by? Morality is subjective. I have to evaluate by standards we can all understand, but those aren't necessary to a claim of dystopia. Dystopia refers to the world's actual structure and it's effect. The morality is a different debate. Brave New World is a pretty good example of that

*** Dystopia

>an imagined state or society in which there is great suffering or injustice, typically one that is totalitarian or post-apocalyptic.

​

Just

>based on or behaving according to what is morally right and fair.

Here are the definitions. Ok_Equivalent you were wrong about morality playing a completely negligible role. We do determine what is just by a moral standard. Sesquatch, please read a single dystopian novel. What you fail to understand is that a common piece of making a world a dystopia is to make citizens believe that the status quo is /morally right and fair./

This eliminates the possibility of trying to look through the world depending entirely on their cultural lenses, as the entire point is that they believe in the status quo regardless of the situation. According to your standards for judging the rules, if the average person in 1700s America said that slavery is fine, your argument would have to be that they shouldn't change. Or if we were to come to you in the 1950s, still for the U.S., and ask you about civil rights, you would have to respond that there are no problems with the legal system, as the average person believed it to be /right and fair/. To establish whether a country is Just, you often have to step back and look at it objectively. Yes, I do understand that objectively is a strong term for discussing the morality of the government, but it is what works.

As for looking at the Wizarding World through the lense of contemporary moral standards, it is a story that takes place in the 90s, written by a woman in the 90s. Note how the Wizarding World has a /Minister for Magic/. It is fine to judge a contemporary world, by our /contemporary/ societal standards. If it isn't than we should probably lay off China for their reprehensible, human rights violations. Same for North Korea, in fact. We use contemporary moral standards because surprise, it's a contemporary world.

Thank you for upholding the status quo, Big Brother would be proud. Your arguments were double-plus ungood, but have a good day.

**** I accept the rebuke. Morality shouldn't be the most important factor though. The evidence still matters

But contemporary means that things happen at the same time. We don't live in a contemporary world, we are contemporaries of Rowling.

#+end_quote

This is, of course, exactly what I'm saying. But note that the /should/ (or "ought") is not /my/ moral judgement, but an accurate representation of a stance of the people of that time. It's perfectly impossible to understand a different time and how its people lived if you apply standards that didn't exist back then. And the entire attempt of looking at things "objectively" runs into the problem of needing to define what "objective" /is/. Presumably, it's our current standards. But what will people in another 300 years think about our standards today?

Anyway, this is not to explicitly invalidate the idea of objective standards, and not even the process of applying current standards at different worlds. It /is/, however, to question the usefulness. Like I said in the other replies, looking from the outside in works if you want to slap labels on something for convenient shorthands in discussion. Yes, (at least DH) is a dystopia. As [[/u/Trythenewpage]] noted, this is obvious and was the entire point of the novel. But it starts and ends there, nothing follows from that. And that was what I pointed out.

.

As an aside:

#+begin_quote
  If it isn't than we should probably lay off China for their reprehensible, human rights violations. Same for North Korea, in fact.
#+end_quote

Yes, we should. Or rather, there is no imperative saying we absolutely must be judging China and North Korea. We (the "West") /can/, however, on account of having sufficient military and economic power, so that we can A) afford to do so, B) feel good about it while doing so, C) gain benefits by doing so (since after all, holding ourselves at a higher standard would put ourselves at a disadvantage).

On the other hand, note that no one seriously considers invading China to actively spread those standards (what about those purges in Hongkong just now?). The US probably could. It'd be something like WWIII, of course, but agreeing that that cost is too steep is nothing but saying those values are important, but not important enough. Which is perfectly fine;-- well, in my framework, anyway, in yours, everyone who doesn't is a nefarious agent of the status quo. I dunno that that is particularly helpful.

***** I hate to break it to you but Ok_Equivalent isn't a time traveler, and Wizarding England is part of the Western Civilization. So I'd say it's fine for him to judge the West using western morality. Nothing throughout the series indicates any moral differences whatsoever between muggles and Wizards. This isn't the West judging a vastly different culture. It's the West judging the West. Your entire argument is based around moral differences that don't exist in the context of the series. Nor do they exist in the context of the writing of the series. I appreciate you clarifying that your entire argument was based around moral ambiguity throughout different cultures. I'm also glad you missed the last paragraph which was about despite all of the previous things I mentioned, it didn't matter as the OP was using the correct moral standard to judge the Wizarding World.

#+end_quote

Yes, I'm glad that came across. Now what is your argument that those differences don't exist, beyond saying they don't? Given all the points OP listed so diligently, /and/ his correct, if somewhat short, note that " Everyone we meet acts like it's unfortunate, but nothing out of the ordinary.", it appears to me that the default stance needs to be quite a different perspective of wizards and witches on many issues, compared to what, say, /your/ perspective is.

Also, I didn't ignore your last paragraph, I agreed that there is no a priori reason to judge China and North Korea.

******* So your argument is: moral ambiguity exists and the Wizarding world has one difference to the muggle one, thus they must have vastly different moral systems? Now give me proof of a moral system as distant as Eastern morality. Otherwise, Occam's razor, they don't know what it's like to have a different to have a different government. The Wizarding world agrees that their government is shit. Note the “Everyone agrees it's unfortunate”. So they believe they have a problematic government. That doesn't indicate a vastly different mentality on the government to what we have.
