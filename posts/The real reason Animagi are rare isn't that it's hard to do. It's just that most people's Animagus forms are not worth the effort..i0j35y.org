Harry sat down in the chair, steadying himself for the apparently-awful taste of the potion he was about to drink. His godfather had helped him go through the steps of brewing, and gave him ample preparation for what was about to happen - he'd done it before, after all.

Steeling his nerves, he put the potion vial to his lips and downed its contents in one go. It was bitter, painfully spicy, and had an aftertaste that /might/ compare favourably to Aunt Marge's armpits in a heatwave - not that Harry was particularly eager to find out whether that was true.

Harry found himself getting extremely drowsy as the nauseating taste vanished, and his emotions were slowly filled with anticipation to see which animal he'd be able to turn into... Until the visions started, and all that anticipation turned into disappointment.

--------------

I'll leave it up to this subreddit to decide which animal to go with.

So if they get attacked they panic and an animagus elephant might accidentally harm his/her friends as well. And because it's an 'ordinary' animal, no magical resistance there. Dragons, basilisks and trolls are magical creatures, it's not only their hide that protects them.

As for weponizing it, he could throw himself at someone, say Lucius Malfoy, *then* transform on top of them. Just for a second. It would cost him brief discomfort and possibly a cracked or broken rib or two but he'll live (and whoever got too close, won't).

** Harry downed the potion. One nauseatingly dizzying moment later, where he couldn't place up nor down, and he was blinking his eyes open.

Harry gasped.

He was in space. Everywhere around him was the vast blackness of Nothing. Nebulae and distant stars shone brightly. Harry turned itself around, moving molasses slow, taking in a breathtaking view. He never in a thousand years expected such magnificence.

But the movement made one thing painfully clear: he was alone. Huh? Wasn't the whole point of the potion to discover your inner animal? At first Harry's thoughts raced to so mythical creature hidden between stars (conveniently ignoring the fact that animagus was always 'mundane' animal). He did not know what to do.

The longer he floated aimlessly the more dejected he became. The beauty of his surroundings stopped mattering in the face of his distress. He was alone. He did not know how to wake up.

Desperately, he wispered. 'Where are you?'

He felt something. Not really answering call, more like an inkling to look right.

To no ones suprise, right was empty. Harry growled in frustration. He strained his eyes, looking at nothing. He really hoped someone will wake him up already. He wondered if similar experience was part of the reason Sirius was widely called insane.

And he got a feeling that something settled in his palm. His heart beat rapidly, racing like a horse.

"Yeah, it was disappointing, I won't lie ..."

"You're my only godfather, Sirius."

****** I just imagine Harry as a shaggy black wolf as both reference to Moony and Padfoot and his Patronus is still Prongs. It's a better way than making Harry have three Patronuses or something. Though, I don't mind if Harry has two Animagus forms so long as he's not like a Phoenix and a Basalisk or whatever. I've never read anything that says you can't become two animals and I feel like Harry would be able to become a flying animal (a falcon for Harry's speed, determination, loyalty, strength, ambition) and a land animal (a wolf for Harry's love of family--he practically loved Sirius once he found out that he didn't kill his parents--strength, power, determination, quick thinking).

** His body started to shrink and he fell with a plop into the chair. Everything was warm, like his animal form was made for colder temperatures. Harry tried to take a breath -- and panicked. He couldn't breathe. Shit, he was asphyxiating! Harry wanted to look down at his new body, but could only follow its muscle instincts while it spasmed on the chair, his new arms too short to be of any help. As he was falling to the ground, Harry finally got a good look -- at his colorful tail and shiny scales. Bloody hell, he was a fish!

and then he died

** There's another common false trope in this; I'm pretty sure that you don't use a potion to go into a "trance" to visualise what sort of animal is your animagus form. I read somewhere that you won't know your animagus form until the transformation is complete.

*** Canonically (or at least according to Word of Rowling) drinking the potion during a thunderstorm is the last thing you do before your Animagus form "unlocks". It's never really said what happens during said unlocking to my knowledge, in interviews or otherwise, but it's assumed you somehow "learn" which animal you turn into before you actually do so.

The visions are common enough fanon that I figure it's fine for a prompt like this.
