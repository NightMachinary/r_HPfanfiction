So it seems like Ellory has vanished from Ao3. Their FFN account is still online but most of his HP pureblood culture fics seem to be missing.

Does anyone have copies of those?


** You sure? I just did a quick Google search and found them still on [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Ellory/pseuds/Ellory][Ao3]].

Edit: It looks like they've restricted their Ao3 account to only have their stories viewable by members of the site.

*** Hmm you're right, their profile is still there but all their works are gone..

**** Do you have an account with Ao3? They've restriced access to their stories there to members only.

***** Damn, now I feel stupid. As it happens I do have an account, I just never bother to use it on my phone.

Anyway, thank you!
