  Sometimes, all it takes to rise to greatness is a helping hand and the incentive to survive. Amid giants, there is no choice but become one yourself. If you want to keep on living, that is. [GoF, Mentor!Albus]

** The one story which popped into my head while reading the title of this post was linkffn(West of Here by MK-ONE). It is unfinished but receives an update every now and then, featuring a Harry Potter who is quite literally from another time and place. Harry is, for once, not politically correct, which is one big reason why any new chapter always teases an amused smile from my lips. Don't take it seriously, it's not meant to be read like that, and you can have your fun too.

  Harry Potter accidentally disappeared to another place and time the night his godfather fell through the veil. Voldemort has taken over and Harry is needed now more than ever to fight the growing evil. The only trouble is that Harry Potter is no longer a teenage wizard, but a full grown territorial marshal who uses weapons of a simpler, harsher time period, somewhere- west of here.
