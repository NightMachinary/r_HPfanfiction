I'm looking for fics where spells/rituals cast in other languages are used often. Bungle in the Jungle is a good example. The older the languages the better but even spells that only work in French or German or something would be interesting.


** Linkffn(the long game by inwardtransience) is written by someone very interested in linguistics and older languages. The (multilingual) wizarding community in the U.K. has retained a lot of languages (like brittonic language) that no one in the muggle world still uses. I don't think spellcrafting language is covered in depth as much as cultural and language differences, however.

  Britain has been at peace for nearly a century --- protected from the devastation of Grindelwald's war, free of conflict of their own. Charissa Potter, raised surrounded by family and friends more numerous than she can count, never really expected this to change. But hidden forces, it seems, have been playing a long game. (fem!gay!grey!Harry, so very very much AU)
