So I'm reading The Semblance of Peace by Maeglin_Yedi on AO3, and i was wondering if you guys knew any others like it.

Like where the Horcux in Harry (or another) connects and communicates with him. I like that it has some control over him. I like manipulative Tom and resistant but doomed to fail Harry. I enjoy Tom teaching Harry and showing him that he can be more that the golden boy.

The relationship doesn't have to be between Tom/Harry in can be others but I'm a bit of a suck for them together (when done right).

  In which Harry Potter learns that friends can be made in the unlikeliest places...even in your own head. Alone and unwanted, eight-year-old Harry finds solace and purpose in a conscious piece of Tom Riddle's soul, unaware of the price he would pay for befriending the dark lord. But perhaps in the end it would all be worth it...because he'd never be alone again.

** Controlling/manipulative relationships:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/19312162/][The Devil You Know]] - Similar premise to "Harry Potter and the Accidental Horcrux" but with a more humorous bent.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7456444][Pianissimo]] - Extremely disturbing single-point-of-departure oneshot set postwar: Harry picked up the deformed thing-under-the-bench in Kings Cross. (Word of caution on the tags: the author labeled it as dub-con, but it really should have been tagged as non-con.)

More lighthearted:

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/7912882/][Dance with the Devil]] - In year 6 Harry forms an alliance with the scarcrux in order to collect and reassemble Voldemort's soul pieces.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13212984/][A Memory of Shadow]] - Harry befriends the scarcrux during the summer after 1st year.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/15675621/][Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus]] - fem!Harry is the personification of death and grows up befriending the scarcrux.

- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14476725/][Bound by Souls]] - A fusion with the universe of the /His Dark Materials/ series: Harry grows up with the scarcrux as his dæmon.

  All Harry Potter ever wanted was to finally be accepted as someone other than an incurably criminal boy. A fresh start in Slytherin - which, admittedly, does seem to have a worrying proportion of goons - seems to be just what he needs to make some lifelong friendships. And if that life happens to be an immortal one, all the better. It's too bad that the high-pitched voice in his head has other ideas.

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

It is Fem!Riddle. If you can get past that, makes for a great read. Really explores what made Riddle go so bad.
