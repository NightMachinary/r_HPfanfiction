I recently read A Call To Arms, and now I'm wondering what are some fanfictions that have the battle of hogwarts done really well? Doesn't have to be purely canon, could be something like “harry time traveled and fought the battle on his terms” etc.


** I loved the preparation for the Battle of Hogwarts - especially McGonagall's call to arms of the suits of armor and such. That being said, the Battle itself was sidelined hard, and we only got flashes of it as Harry and Co dealt with the Horcruxes.

Also, I will forever love Neville breaking Voldemort's full body bind - for the callback to it being used against him liberally in his first year, to how it demonstrated what a BADASS he grew up to be.
