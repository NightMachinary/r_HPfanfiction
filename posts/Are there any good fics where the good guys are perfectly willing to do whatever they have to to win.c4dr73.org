**** Isn't, you know, the traditional villain someone who has a goal and is willing to do anything, no matter how illegal and amoral, to accomplish it?

If you have your heroes throw out any restraint and kill, cheat, and steal for their victory are they still the Good Guys? Or have they become the Baddies?

The Good Guys kind of have to remain Good, or they aren't. Just look at how people demonize the fanon Greater Good Dumbledore.

I'm not saying that couldn't be an interesting story, about how people compromise their principles for a victory. But if you protag breaks into someones home, kidnaps their child and sends them a finger at a time until they give in they're not a good person.

  Canon Divergence from HBP. When Harry fails to save Ron's life in Slughorn's office, he and Hermione are thrust into a search for answers. But the path is thornier than either of them could have possibly imagined.

** Linkffn(Divided and Entwined)

Fudge doesn't deny Voldemort's return, but instead tries appeasement to avoid a war.

After a year of constant discrimination from the ministry and Umbridge at Hogwarts, Hermione organizes the muggleborns to fight back. Brutally.

As it turns out, ancient wards are good against spells and intruders but not really designed to handle half a ton of semtex plastic explosive.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
