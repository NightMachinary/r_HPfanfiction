linkffn(12925628) Either Interview or narrative style is fine.


** linkffn(4798208) - An Interview with Justin FinchFletchley comes to mind.

​

linkffn(6783306) - Also Paging Dr Belll, although its abandond and if I remember correctly the story changes between an interview-like narrative style and flashbacks. There's also quiet unnecessary smut in this one, but I think it vaguely fits your request.

**** Well, fair point. ;)

​

It just makes me uncomfortable in this one, because they are just SO young and it is explained as a magical release needed in pubertry or something. I just try to forget about it and without these scenes I find the story to be a nice read because of the idea of Katie Bell as a psychologist.
