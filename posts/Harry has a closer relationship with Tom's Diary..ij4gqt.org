:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Looking for a fic where Harry & the Diary get way closer than in canon and Harry takes Tom's inevitable betrayal at the end of 2nd year really hard. In the specific fic none of this is actually depicted its just happened in the past and now Voldemort and Harry are trying out being allies and the whole diary thing makes it painfully for Harry to trust Voldemort and it annoys/intrigues Voldemort because Harry keeps the whole diary thing close to his chest. I believe this fic was eventual hp/lv
