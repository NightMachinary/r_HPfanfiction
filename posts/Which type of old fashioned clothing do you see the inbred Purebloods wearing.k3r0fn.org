** Well it's shown that wizards, in general, have their own fashions which are based on robes. Logically then, if we assume that ‘inbred pureblood' implies people such as the Black Family or the Malfoys, then it should be as /culturally/ conservative as possible. This means robes galore. Of which there are many cuts and styles. For the very rich, I would imagine that they would likely be made of the best quality materials available, so satins, silks, cashmere etc. IIRC I imagine a more ‘medieval'/ ‘Early Modern' style of displaying wealth in clothing, so not necessarily the style but the quality of materials. Formal Robes may have some form of intricate brocade or Cloth of Gold or Silver.

As a side note, I never understood why fanfic presumes muggle clothing is more comfortable than robes or muggle fashion is better. As someone who wears robes and kilts and such on a regular (almost daily) basis, and has custom made their own, I can tell you robes are objectively more comfortable IMO, especially when, like in the wizarding world, they are likely custom fitted. They don't get in the way as much as you think.

*** I would also suggest that they would probably have enchantments on them, both for comfort/convenience (e.g waterproofing) and cosmetic both because they can, and it would make then more expensive and so more exclusive. There would possibly also be parts of the outfit, at least formal ones, which need to be worn in a particular was because of certain symbolism and/or and awkward to wear if you are not used to them (like high heels) to show that you are 'one of us' and were brought up in the right way.

**** Oh yes of course. I completely overlooked the enchantment angle. Also never overlook a society's ability to hold on to random things just because. I can totally see a taboo on ‘Pure white robes' for example because its a holdover from The Druids. And all sorts of other things.

**** Well i don't go outside much, even before lockdown. I wear my kilt because i want to. It sort of started as a ‘living history' project for togas. It spiralled from there and i though making a set of robes was a fun idea.
