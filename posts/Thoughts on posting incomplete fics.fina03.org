I've had a bunch of partially completed fics sitting in my google drive and in light of having more time to write due to COVID-19 I'm debating posting chunks of these fics as I (might) have time time to work on them in addition to my main fic. Not sure if this would just be annoying to potential readers though. Thoughts?


** If you let readers know up front that they're unfinished and likely not be finished, then it's on them to decide whether to read or not. And who knows, the act of posting and feedback might reawaken your muse.

*** I agree; while posting may seem pointless if you never update it, you still may later find your muse to continue it or someone else may be inspired by it and write their own fic.

*** Agreed, and also: Something that worked for me (YMMV) was posting my in-progress fic and using the fact that people were following it to keep myself working on it.

** I have couple of fics in various level of completion [[https://matej.ceplovi.cz/clanky/drafts/][on my website]], but I am afraid there will be drastic changes until I finish the thing. I cannot understand how somebody can serially write in public, when you cannot rewrite what has been already published. My first drafts are usually almost unreadable and convoluted, the idea I would post them anywhere officially public makes me shiver.
