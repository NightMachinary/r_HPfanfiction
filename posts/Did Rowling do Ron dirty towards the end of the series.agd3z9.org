I was reading through the chapters of DH that build up to Ron's departure yesterday and there were certain moments and thoughts that created this question in my mind. Let me break this down.

A lot of people like to cite Ron's chess skills as a showcase of his brilliant strategic ability. I see this more as a waste of potential. The chess match was a great example of how he could bring a different level of intelligence to the trio, but we never really see him use that level of strategic intelligence again. It's noted in DH that Harry and Hermione do most of the planning and Ron doesn't contribute a lot. Harry and Hermione both have their incredible talents and this would have been an opportunity to showcase Ron's abilities as well. But it never really happens.

Another thing I want to mention is Ron's behaviour in the tent. Now obviously a lot of it is caused by the locket, but Rowling could have done a better job at explaining why it affects him so much. A lot of people point out that he's more prone to the negativity that the horcrux feeds and he does say that himself. But for me, it didn't feel like a strong enough justification. And even in that chapter, he's pretty unpleasant before he even begins wearing it. Infinitely more so than either Harry and Hermione were.

Once he returns, Rowlings writes various segments that attempt to prove Ron's brilliance, but it never goes quite far enough. You always feel like he's still a bit secondary to Harry and Hermione.

Half Blood Prince didn't help matters. The whole scenario of him being furious at Hermione for kissing Viktor makes sense from the perspective of how a teenager acts. But I think a lot of people didn't feel that he got enough of a comeuppance when it came to that drama. To my knowledge, he's never said to have apologised to Hermione about it. He might have done so off camera, but that's most likely not enough for the casual viewer.

There is the one scene where Ron comes up with the idea of using the basilisk fang to destroy the remaining horcruxes. But let's face it, it felt like that was only thrown in there to make him winning Hermione over in the next page more plausible.

Meanwhile, Hermione consistently shows off how great she is in the last book that it's not surprising that people question why she ended up with Ron. She brings an absurd amount of resources to allow them to survive through the heavy year and almost always has a spell in mind. Not to mention, she's normally what carries the plot from point A to point B.

Any thoughts on this? Should Rowling have given Ron more positive attention?


** I definitely think Rowling had plans for Ron's development at the start of the series and then wasn't really able to follow through with them. His ability to play chess isn't really mentioned ever again after PS, and in the earlier books he was the gateway of knowledge to the wizarding world. He got to do a bit of this in DH, but not enough.

The arc he has in PS is far more developed than in the rest of the series put together and it's such a shame because he has a lot of potential as a character. His maturity and growth was too rushed in DH, although I did like that there was a key turning point and that he and Harry were able to get everything out in the open.

I hate to say it because I love him, but Rowling should have followed through with her original plan and killed Arthur in OOTP. She chickened out because it would have changed Ron's character too much, but I think that would have been a great thing for his development. Take it from someone going through it right now, nothing matures you quicker than losing a parent.

*** There really should have been more payoff for, or growth beyond, Ron's vision in the Mirror of Erised. That was quite clearly initially put in there as a foreshadow of Ron's arc but it never really came explicitly to fruition imo. Ron should either have come to be the centre of attention and appreciated it - showing maturity and success past initial adversity, come to be it and disliked it when it happened - showing growth and character development, or explicitly have come to move on from that dream to another dream. Instead it just feels like a dropped plot thread that may technically have been fulfilled (Quidditch, epilogue!marriage + being a businessman) but doesn't feel like it quite landed emotionally.

While I think the world of HP treats casual assault a little flippantly, I think we do have to consider this in the context of the series. The confundus charm was used numerous times throughout the series, most often on other wizards. Hermione used the same charm on McLaggen during Ron's quidditch try out.

That's not to say that what Ron did was /right/, but I think it's a bit of a stretch to say he did it out of some deep-seeded feeling of superiority over muggles. A bit of casual assault is just sort of par for the course in the wizarding world, even between each other.

This is irrelevant. Everyone is helpless against something done while they aren't looking. It's not like confundus is something you use in a duel. You use it when someone is least expecting it to confuse them.

All the firearms knowledge in the world won't stop you from being shot in the back. We wouldn't (or shouldn't) consider shooting someone who owns a gun to be more okay than shooting someone who doesn't; so why would casting a spell on someone without a wand be worse than the alternative?

The crux of the issue is that, in any sensible world, confunding someone would /always/ be viewed as very dark. It's akin to slipping drugs in someone's drink. It's an egregious personal violation that should land someone in jail. /But/, that's clearly not how it's regarded in the Harry Potter universe. It's taught in school, and treated like a harmless trick. Therefore, /within the context of the series/, what Ron did is viewable as harmless chicanery rather than as a sinister, dehumanizing act.

Of course we can. They are both shitty cowardly actions, but shooting someone who's unarmed in the back is a million times more despicable and cowardly than shooting someone who's a master marksman and armed to the teeth.

I didn't challenge this point earlier because I felt it was too distracting, but if you can fight the imperius magically you can bet your arse that you can fight a "weaker" spell like a confundus.

This is fanon. Canonically, fighting off the imperius is only described as requiring exceptional willpower. It is never explicitly stated that resisting it involves any magic whatsoever, or that muggles are incapable of resisting it. So, unless you believe that muggles are inherently more weak-willed than wizards, this point is moot.

#+begin_quote

Because the original post I responded to described Ron's use of it in a comparative sense; more a /Malfoy/ action than a /Hermione/ action, let's say. If you don't care about how people in the book regard it, then we aren't even having the same conversation.

Stop twisting my words. They are both wrong, I made this very clear. One is just less wrong than the other. Like genociding 6 million Jews is a million times worse than shooting the unarmed guy in the back, you know? It's possible to have degrees of evil, they are all still evil.

So, it's also never explicitly stated that Muggles can't use legilimency. What kind of point are you trying to mind? It's very possible that you can't even begin to fight the imperius if you don't have magic, no matter whether you're the most highly leveled willpower person on the planet.

** Yes, Ron should have gotten more positive attention. Best bet would have been for him to handle all the cooking, and adding more moments where he showed humor and ridiculous confidence, so that his departure really screwed with Harry & Hermione's mental states.

I balk at making him a strategic genius or anything, but he should have been the most loyal, steadfast, and reasonable one of them to create a better balance of virtues and faults between them.

It doesn't help that Steve Kloves made him into a buffoon whenever possible. Ron's better moments were in the third movie, but he was still being framed as the clueless one and his better moments from the book were given to Hermione (like facing down a mad killer who they thought wanted to kill his best friend).

It could have been a bromance of the ages, if Ron had been the one to stand up and say 'I believe Harry' when his name came out of the Tri-wizard Cup, and I think it would have been a better turn if Hermione was the one to get mind-bent by the horcrux enough to get separated from the trio in the last book.

  Could you imagine that? Dumbledore believes in Ron enough to give him a book of fairy tales but hands the light-stealing/giving device to Hermione, knowing that she will become frustrated or might be lost along the way and need to find Harry again. When she leaves, EVERYONE would think Harry and Ron are essentially screwed. Ron would agree to visiting Godric's Hollow because he understands how important family can be to a person.

  In her absence, the two men would fight but afterwards they would also confess their feelings for the girls in their lives. Ron would resolve to tell Hermione how he feels with Harry's encouragement... if they ever find her again. In the meantime, they'd listen close to Potterwatch in fear of hearing that she'd been captured.

***** As a Hermione fan, I can definitely see this story. If you go back to Book 3 starting with the Firebolt incident and project forward, it would definitely fit.

Book 4: I'm not sure Hermione would outright disbelieve Harry, and I don't think she would be jealous, but she would definitely be suspicious, constantly probing for holes in Harry's story and becoming preoccupied with how he got entered in general over actually helping him. Ron openly admits he is jealous and has a few surly moments, but his loyalty is stronger, and he still defends and tries to help Harry.

Book 5: Hermione goes behind Harry's back to tell McGonagall about the Black Quill. It probably wouldn't change much for better or worse, but Harry resents her for it, and Ron takes his side.

Book 6: actually, Hermione's characterization here feels just about right. Ron, however, believes Harry about Draco and thinks Hermione is being closed-minded. Ron is also portrayed more positively for (sort of) taking the same romantic advice Hermione gave Ginny.

Book 7: Hermione gets fed up faster than Ron about making no progress on the Horcruxes. Twisted by the locket, she accuses Harry and Ron of not really trying and leaves to try to do it on her own, only to get in way over her head and need weeks to find her way back to them.

The rest is pretty much as you described, although the reconciliation scene when she returns needs to have more impact. I think one of the reasons people hate Ron so much is that his reconciliation feels incomplete (despite saving Harry) because Harry lets him off the hook so easily for the things that caused him to leave in the first place.

**** I think that the argument in GOF is pretty misunderstood, mainly because Hermione says Ron was jealous, and we all know the she couldn't possibly be wrong.

The way I read it, Ron had spent three years having Harry's back, and from his point of view, after going on every adventure and risking life and limb, Harry went and put his name in the goblet by himself.

Obviously Harry didn't do that, and it took less than two weeks for him to realise he was wrong, swallow his pride and apologise in public.

I think if Harry and Ron were both a bit less pissy the night the champions were announced, the argument wouldn't have happened at all. But they were fourteen-tear-old boys, so maturity isn't a default for them.

** I feel like the only character who didn't get done a little dirty in some way toward the end was Neville.

Harry went from being an academically okay but magically powerful wizard (being able to conjure a corporeal patronus strong enough to dispel a 100 dementors as a teenager c'mon) to being mediocre and reliant on luck and deus ex machina.

​

Hermione got nigh character assassinated in HBP and acted totally irrationally and behaved in almost total contrast to how she was in previous books.

​

Ron went from the funny bro to the guy who comes close to being a fair-weathered friend and frankly something of a misogynistic child in HBP (I don't throw the term around lightly)

​

Dumbledore goes from being the occasionally funny but ultimately wise and benevolent headmaster to the guy who manipulated most of Harry's life and, despite his intentions, negligent in the care of someone he considered vital to Voldemort's downfall (abandoning him to a home he knew to be abusive right after he had been tortured, watched a friend get murdered and forced to witness his greatest enemy become revived with his own blood at the end of GoF not to mention basically all of OotP)

​

Ginny went from being a background character with potential to be more once she got over her crush to Mary Sue and basically Harry's clone in the effort to make her the perfect soulmate for him according to Rowling

​

Snape in a way was actually done the opposite of dirty (Cleaned? Seems paradoxical for him.) when his past and his relationship with Lily was revealed but at the same time it soured things in a way since now everyone likes to preach about what a hero he was when he was an abuser of children who never got over his grudges as a schoolboy

There are others but you catch my drift.

Harry relied on Deus Ex Machina since day one tbh. Realistically he should have never survived even Quirrell. It's not something that only happened later in the series.

Hermione got character assassinated in HBP? I don't see it. Sure, she was a bit jealous of Harry's success, but she ended up being at least partially right about the HBP book, didn't she? She also physically attacked Ron with birds but the text made her out to be justified, so I don't see how it's character assassination.

Ron was not a misogynist, maybe he was a bit sexist with his sister, but no more than most teenagers in the 90s were.

Yeah but that's the point. The thing that is motivating him is his insecurity/fear about Harry & Hermione hooking up. As you said, the Horcrux is not a mindless boggart, it's picking the thing he's most insecure about. If he actually feared for his family or hermione dying more than anything else it would have shown him scenes of all of them dying in gruesome ways and then an evil voice yelling: "Kill Potter and your family and everyone you love will be spared!" or whatever.

What motivates Ron most to possibly betray his best friend is his irrational and insane jealousy over who gets to have the girl in the end, not his desire to protect or really anything wholesome. The Horcrux is either really stupid for picking something that is not the best suited to convert Ron or this is a condemnation of his character. I can see plenty of other potential "Horcrux visions" where - if Ron killed Harry - I'd say: "Well he's an evil git, but I get where he's coming from" (like trying to protect his family). But with the vision Ron saw, I don't see where he's coming from. He'd just be an evil git if he killed his friend for petty reasons like that. Nothing more nothing less.

  Another thing I want to mention is Ron's behaviour in the tent. Now obviously a lot of it is caused by the locket, but Rowling could have done a better job at explaining why it affects him so much. A lot of people point out that he's more prone to the negativity that the horcrux feeds and he does say that himself. But for me, it didn't feel like a strong enough justification. And even in that chapter, he's pretty unpleasant before he even begins wearing it. Infinitely more so than either Harry and Hermione were.
#+end_quote

Ron was more vulnerable to the locket than Harry and Hermione because he had been wounded. Hermione accidentally splinched him when escaping the Ministry, and Ron lost so much blood that he turned grey and lost consciousness. He was a 6 foot something teenager, who was already skinny, and now he was supposed to recover a huge blood loss while eating some soggy mushrooms? No wonder he was cranky, everyone would be in that situation. And on top of his injury, he was wearing the locket and worrying about his family. And I think it's important to remember that Ron never seemed to have thought about leaving before Harry yelled at him to leave /thrice./

​

#+begin_quote
  Half Blood Prince didn't help matters. The whole scenario of him being furious at Hermione for kissing Viktor makes sense from the perspective of how a teenager acts. But I think a lot of people didn't feel that he got enough of a comeuppance when it came to that drama. To my knowledge, he's never said to have apologised to Hermione about it. He might have done so off camera, but that's most likely not enough for the casual viewer.
#+end_quote

I think Hermione lost any right to an apology for him being cold to her when she physically assaulted him (she sent birds to claw and peck at every piece of his skin they could reach... no wonder the movies changed the scene, it would be hard to feel sympathetic to Hermione after watching that) and ignored him for several months, they were both extremely childish, but at least Ron never attacked Hermione.

** Ron was fine. I personally enjoyed his character in all of the books.

Yes, he was flawed, but you know what? Flawed characters are more interesting. If we didn't have flawed characters then we would likely not have a plot at all. Ron's mini arc in DHs is actually my favorite part of the book and I loved the moment where he destroyed the locket.

Having chess skills doesn't necessarily mean that you're a brilliant strategist despite the stereotype. Playing a game is simply different than being in a stressful situation in real life. That being said, I do think that Ron was pretty smart, he was just not an intellectual. For some people being intelligent is synonymous with being an intellectual, I actually find that this is not necessarily true. There are many people who are quite smart, without caring about intellectual pursuits.

I don't think Rowling did Ron dirty by not showing him as some brilliant strategist. I think Ron was quite smart as he was. The "Ron is dumb" meme mostly comes from fanfiction.

The real reason why Ron is hated is that people don't have patience for characters that show too much weakness, no matter how "realistic" it might be. Harry is also hated for showing weakness in OoTP even though he was just a teenager in an impossible situation. Fanfiction is full of Gary Stus or at least "borderline" Gary Stus who act nothing like the teenagers that these characters are supposed to be. There are fanfics out there where Harry acts more like a 40 years old aristocrat than a teenager. In this environment is it really a surprise that Ron gets bashed a lot? Ron is the archetype of the flawed and immature teenager, of course he has no place in fanfiction.

Then there are those who like hurt/comfort fics but only if a character reacts in a way they see as "appropriate". Reacting with anger is usually less tolerated , probably because it's considered a "masculine" emotion and most of the fans seems to be women.

** Yes, I definitely believe she should have. I think Ron has a lot of potential as a character, particularly as a flawed one. Rowling could have done really well if she expanded upon Ron's chess skills / tactical skills, giving him a unique skill set while continuing to play on Ron's insecurities involving his family (peep what he sees in the Mirror of Erised). Ron's character arc could have included him finally coming to terms with himself and gaining self-confidence to be his own person.

** I think there's plenty of justification for Ron's actions in the tent, even without invoking the influence of the Horcrux. He was risking his life, and his family's lives, by going with Harry, and Harry really didn't have much of a plan, and honestly Harry was pretty dismissive about Ginny's safety - "they've faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!" is not terribly comforting, given that Harry and Ron both almost died in it in CoS.

Furthermore, JKR repeatedly makes it clear just how important Ron is in the trio, often by highlighting the effects of his absence. In GoF we get the line, "Harry liked Hermione very much, but she just wasn't the same as Ron. There was much less laughter and a lot more hanging around in the library when Hermione was your best friend," and in DH, Harry says, "After you left, she [Hermione] cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never even spoke to each other."

Ron doesn't have the planning skills or extensive knowledge that Hermione does, but that's fine - Neither does Harry, after all. One of the things Ron does have is fierce loyalty to Harry and Hermione - he automatically agrees to be Harry's second in the duel and physically fights Malfoy during the Quidditch match, he curses Malfoy (or at least tries to) for calling Hermione a Mudblood, he talks back to Snape for calling Hermione a "know-it-all" (which earned him detention), he throws a crocodile heart at Malfoy for taunting Harry (costing Gryffindor 50 points), he put himself between Harry and Sirius even after he broke his leg saying “If you want to kill Harry, you'll have to kill us too," he draws his wand on Scrimgeour after he threatens Harry, he tries to volunteer to be tortured in place of Hermione at Malfoy Manor, he's the first person to break Voldemort's silencing charm, and honestly I could go on. For all the attention fandom pays to Ron leaving in GoF and DH, I think they forget that those moments are important precisely because they are so atypical for Ron.

TL;DR JKR gave Ron plenty of positive attention, it's just different than the positive attention she gave Harry and Hermione.

*** These are all 'if so' moments and moments where Ron already hates some people, though he defends a Hermione, it never seemed that he actually cared for her. It just shows that he took the advantage of that situation to remove his anger on the person(Snape and Malfoy). He is too childish a character for me to bear. About him supplying (?) happiness in Harry's and Hermione's life, it is never shown in the book though commented on. Boys want to have friends that are boys, and Ron was his only friend at that time, what would happen if Harry liked someone else too(ex.Cedric)? is the question. ......kill us.... This is said in the heat of the moment. In DH book he was more concerned about havig good food prepared by his mother than his life, though he was influenced by the horcrux still is this not childish .\\
He sees Harry in trouble everyyear and he still thinks Harry gets more out of it than he gets, he wants to be a hero so he has no problems in life but cannot understand that being a hero causes one of the worst headaches of life. And if he was so good at strategies why did he not think of making friends in Slytherin, because openly hating someone is not strategic even small children know that. Due to his hatred of Slytherin Harry couldn't make any friends in Slytherin bcz lets face it not all slytherins were bad....though Hagrid and Malfoy also contributed there too. In bk 2 he uses a broken wand ,though it was teachers work to handle it it was also his work to understand that broken wand means disaster (he lives in wiz world afterall) its like using a broken gun, everyone knows that its dangerous (remember the slug scene and Lockhart-oblivate scene) will any good parent allow his or her child to use such dangerous weapon, he didn't tell his mother due the fear of getting scolded.

Ron didn't openly hate Slytherins despite what fanfiction says. If anything Ron was /indifferent/ towards Slytherins except for Draco and his gang who went out of their way to bully him. Also, whitewashing Slytherins is a recent thing. It's obvious that originally Rowling just intended them to be the bad guys and nothing more.

  “We should get a move on, you know ... ask someone. He's right. We don't want to end up with a pair of trolls.”

  Hermione let out a sputter of indignation.

  "A pair of ... what, excuse me?”

  “Well --- you know,” said Ron, shrugging. “I'd rather go alone than with --- with Eloise Midgen, say.”

  “Her acne's loads better lately --- and she's really nice!”

  “Her nose is off-center,” said Ron.

  “Oh I see,” Hermione said, bristling. “So basically, you're going to take the best-looking girl who'll have you, even if she's completely horrible?” “Er --- yeah, that sounds about right,” said Ron.

  “I'm going to bed,” Hermione snapped, and she swept off toward the girls' staircase without another word.

The way Ron treats Hermione pretty clearly follows the pattern of a typical abusive relationship, like in this instance making her feel inferior for her imperfections.

#+begin_quote
  The danger grows, subtly, insidiously, through each successive image, but you'll also notice, if you look closely, moments of enormous tenderness and vulnerability between the man and woman. Those snapshots are poignant reminders of what abuse victims hold onto in staying with their abuser. They don't stay for the pain. Their desperate, often palpable hope, if you sit in the room with them, is that the abuse will go away. *And they tend to block out all evidence to the contrary. In point of fact, they stay for love. Many abuse survivors cling to the positive traits in their partners -- like being affectionate and reliable.*

Why is Ron wanting to have a casual fling such a crime? Does he live in Saudi Arabia? Did Ron ever promise Lavender anything? No. Are we supposed to persecute him for being promiscuous? Was he supposed to /marry/ her just because he dated her at 16?

Hermione intentionally hurting Ron's feelings and physically attacking him is arguably worse than Ron merely wanting to have a casual relationship with Lavender. Yea, maybe he did not handle it in the best way possible. But what Hermione did was way worse. She used McLaggen for purely manipulative purposes and she pretty much intentionally hurt Ron's feelings.

You're honestly making Ron sound as if he was some machiavellian womanizer or something when we both know that the guy could barely recognize basic social cues.

Nope. He easily could have. The fact that they didn't outright execute his whole family when they invaded at Bill's and Fleur's wedding despite them being known blood traitors and Harry's allies proves that they weren't willing to touch purebloods unless absolutely necessary. Another example is how they didn't go after Neville and his grandmother until /much/ later even though they were known as Harry's allies. They only really persecuted purebloods when they actively resisted them. Ron could have easily hidden behind his pureblood status if he really wanted to.

Honestly, he probably just got over his insecurities eventually. Besides, at least Ron decided to take a less demanding job for the good of the family. Harry and Hermione on the other hand were both careerists. Would they even have time for each other at all with her being the minister of Magic and him being the Head Auror?

Hey, I'm sorry, this discussion has been going on quite a while, you may be getting confused: We are actually discussing the validity/sense-making of canon in this debate! :) I'm actually aware, for example, that canonically Ron and Hermione ended up together and didn't actually have an abusive relationship.

************************ Do you think that the books themselves are not valid as canon? I disagree. Whether we like it or not, it's how the characters are written. I'm totally with you if you want to argue that the Cursed Child and a lot of Pottermore nosnense shouldn't count as canon though.

Anyway, when it comes to Hermione and Malfoy, she never said that he's a "good guy". She only said that it's unlikely that he's a Death Eater specifically because it would be atypical for Voldemort to recruit a 16 years old.

I think you probably put Hermione on a pedestal if you think it's so unlike her to go out with a jerk like McLaggen out of spite. Hermione is still just a teenage girl after all. From my understanding, you're male yourself and men tend to put certain females on a pedestal for various reasons, but it's the wrong approach.

This is difficult to put into the right terms, but an interesting question: I think there are severe inconsistencies in the books that put the whole thing into question. Let's imagine a little story (I'm making this up as I go along).

"There once was a little man. One morning the little man left his house and fell into a well while the moon was shining in the sky. The man died. Three years later he married his high-school sweetheart and got crowned king of the country. The end."

(of course this is highly exaggerated and the HP story is not as inconsistent as that)

If I asked you now: Do you think, that canonically the little man became king at the end of the story, what would you say? Yes of course, because that's what was written, but how can he be king when he died? Also the story says that he went outside in the morning, yet the moon was shining. Something is amiss.

The best way I can say it: In my "headcanon" I disregard plenty of things from the books, because they make either none or very little sense (the epilogue, large parts of HBP). So what I'm left with is that the epilogue (or other parts that I take objection with) is "wrong"/"false"/"error", whatever that means.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Sure. That wasn't such a bad idea to humanize Hermione in that regard. JKR went way overboard. Even if Hermione is going through a difficult hormonal phase she's still a rational person and would notice that she's acting nothing like herself for months on end. Like, even just one of those Hermione subplots would have been more than enough, not all of that shit. The only way I could accept those is actual potion dosing, Malfoy imperius/confundous or an actual psychotic break with personality disassociation.

Well, I see what you mean. I have my own headcanon too. However, I recognize that my own headcanon is not the actual canon.

Here's the thing, the HP books themselves are not terribly inconsistent. There are some small inconsistencies but not to the point where they are /unbelievable./ Most of the things that do happen are at least within the realm of possibility.

The reason why I don't accept Cursed Child as canon is specifically because a lot of the things that happen there are completely unbelievable based on what we know from the original books.

If anything, I would argue that it's the opposite. Hermione is almost /superhuman/ compared to how most actual teenage girls are. Most teenage girls are neither the "brightest of their age", nor do they continually figure out things before adults do. And of course realistically it's unbelievable that an average looking 14 years old girl managed to attract an 18 years old intentional sports star with dozens of fangirls. However, this is fiction and there's nothing wrong with Hermione being capable and smart. I am just saying.

*************************** Just as a side-note: I think I have a pretty decent idea how the whole Ron & Hermione thing might have been salvaged in DH (though a "real" fix probably requires a complete rewrite of HBP and DH):

In the tent it should have been Hermione who had the freak-out. She never showed weakness, but now she has all kinds of reasons to lose hope: She just gave up her parents, has all the pressure on her, does all the magical shit that they need to survive in the wild and they are making *zero* progress. Everyone is relying on her! Imagine the burden! Of course the Horcrux affects her the most!

So, Hermione has some kind of serious break down, is threatening to run away, kill herself, whatever. Ron is the rock. He calms her down... relates to her how he sometimes feels hopeless too, how difficult it can be to be Harry's friend and how it's okay to sometimes fail (because... he failed Harry himself before). They have a heart to heart and Hermione finds new strength in *not being perfect all the time, because Ron is not perfect all the time, but he's perfect for her in this moment*. Something like that. BAM! Ron looks great, Hermione looks human and less of a super-girl... everyone gets character development and it makes total sense for them to end up together.

Instead we get this shit with Ron abandoning his friends while they are all on their own. What a fucking shame.

Sure. I'm not delusional. I know that Ron is supposed to be a great friend and that he was happily married to Hermione. I didn't think that needed to be established. When I'm analyzing the literature like that I'm doing a kind of "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author][Death of the Author"]] type of analysis and ignore any authorial intent and take the scenes as they are written without preconceived notions about "this is supposed to be a good guy, so I'm going to ignore all the iffy stuff he does". Of course if you axiomatically assume that Ron is nice and good, because that's what Rowling intended we have nothing to argue about. I'm arguing that she failed to realize her authorial intent on paper successfully (but enough of it is there that we know what she was going for). Obviously she was also trying to write convincing romances between the main characters. She disastrously failed at that too.

#+begin_quote

Right, she is. But we have established this for *five* previous books. You can't just give her [[http://superman.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Kryptonite][Green Kryptonite]] and have her lose her superpowers for a book because you want there to be more drama and angst. That's bad writing (honestly, that's almost fanfiction levels of bad writing). Especially if you immediately return all her superpowers in the subsequent book. It also makes no sense and gives me an easy out to disregard parts of canon that I don't like.

Ron is the opposite: He's completely average, boring and uninteresting, but he gets some super-juice occasionally so that he has a reason to be in the story.

Ron /is/ a great friend , that is based on facts.

He has been following Harry on dangerous missions since he was only 11 years old, surely that has to count for something. They often risked their lives over merely having a /hunch/ without even having a real plan. What more do you want them to do to prove that they're loyal to each other?

Sorry, but I personally doubt that my friends would be ready to die for me and I hardly think that's a typical requirement that people have of their friends. So yea, Ron was a pretty good friend. A bad friend would have not followed Harry anywhere and nobody would have even blamed him for it.

We've been through this. There's plenty of reasons to risk your life for Harry without being a good and loyal friend, especially for Ron, who desires recognition.

Again, even Dumbledore who has no respect for Harry as a person and literally raised a child for slaughter would have died for Harry. It's really not a super-duper good argument for a great friendship in this scenario. Unless you want to claim that Harry and Dumbledore were great friends as well?

#+begin_quote

Reconicile how Ron secretly despising Harry for his "wealth" and "fame" makes him loyal. Also the abandonment. Oh, also the No. 1 concern of this loyal friend is that the friend doesn't hook up with the girl Ron is interested in, almost on the edge of killing said friend for a petty reason like that. Such loyal! I mean, I don't really understand this... Rowling went out of her way to write scenes where Ron is completely disloyal in two different stages of his life and people turn around and go "oh he's so loyal". I don't understand this definition of loyal. Apparently anyone is loyal as long as they don't outright kill you.

It was obviously a very desperate attempt by JKR to have him be useful. The idea that he could somehow learn Parseltongue by hearing Harry say 'open' once or twice years ago is on its face ridiculous and one aspect of canon I completely reject. Makes no sense. Everyone would try to learn Parseltongue and command snakes if it were that easy.

** I think that by the time the last three books were written, the films had changed Rons character irreparably, at least in the eyes of Movie fans, and probably to Rowling herself.

The locket affects the trio in different ways, specific to who they are and what they're faults are.

Ron, with his blood loss, and a lack of nutrition to make up for it (you would be complaint about food to if you had a life threating wound from splinching) wallowed in his self doubt and anger, until it exploded.

Hermione, still guilty for splinching Ron, was pushed into a cycle of incompetence, rereading the same books over and over again, and losing her ability to discern solutions from any of the text.

Harry, being the brooding, obsessive and paranoid guy he is, became obsessed with watching the map, and then paranoid about his friends talking amongst each other.

Eventually, Harry's Paranoia and Ron's self doubt comes to blows, Harry is the one who tells him to leave, the one who makes light of how hungry he is.

In the movie, Ron reminds Harry that his family is dead. In the books, he told Hermione that her parents were safe and away from all of this (which is an admitted shitty thing to say) before then Harry then brings up his family being dead.

The reason why Ron seems to be the only one who is acting poorly, is because the story is told from Harry's perspective, who is definitely being affected by the horcrux to make him see his friends that way.

Did anyone else notice how Harry and Hermione barely made a dent in the mission while the horcrux is with them, and when Ron comes back and destroys it, they actually make some progress?

There are only two things they manage to do in This period: a. They figure out that the sword can be used to destroy horcruxes (which isn't much considering the information was practically in their faces the entire time). b. They go to Godrics Hollow, which Hermione knew was a trap (but was too afraid of Harry, and forced into desperation by the horcrux to properly go against the plan), nearly getting killed by Nagini, and losing Harry's wand.

When Ron destroys the thing, all three are much more trusting of each other, and are a much more effective team because of it.

As for HBP, Ron may have acted like a little shit, but Hermione acted just as nastily. Unlike Ron however, she attacked him for being with another girl. Frankly, once one party engages in physical violence, any pretence of them being on the right is lost. Hermione almost blinded one of her best friends, and other than a few nasty jokes, he never retaliated or tried to harm her.

Meanwhile, Ron is villainised used for a few mean words and the giving her the cold shoulder, something Hermione did just as much as Ron throughout the book.

*** I felt like DH Ron was getting more affected because of how huge his family is. Say what you want, but Ron was constantly around people. At home, it's the siblings and parents. At school it's shared rooms in the dorms. He never spends one moment where he's truly by himself.

Hermione is an only child. Harry, when at the Dursley's, spends hours in his room by himself. Both characters are used to solitude. You get a gregarious, fairly well cared for (poor as they were, I seriously doubt that Molly stinted anyone on food, or warmth, or creature comforts) and shove him out into the woods in relative isolation.

Harry never had that, and Hermione is able to compartmentalise to a scary degree. Because Harry can handle solitude, and lived most of his life with no comforts, he can cope. Hermione would have had a relatively comfortable upbringing (both parents are dentists), but she can be raging inside and still shunt that part of her brain to its own space while handling her shit.

Frankly, I'm surprised he held out as long as he did.

At the same time though it's not like he doesnt get a happy ending. He ends up happily married with kids and a bright future ahead of him. But it feels off somehow. Feels like what should've happened is that instead of Ron and Hermione getting together being the happy end for both of them, why not have them both achieve their goals and mature be the happy end, itd be easy too. Instead of them getting together they become close friends and then eventually they help eachother out, hermione helps ron be a little more emotionally receptive and helps him overcome his inferiority issues, and in return when hermione ends up making a single relationship horribly complicated ron is there to aggressively simplify things (I'm thinking a cute scene where Ron just sets up a dinner date in like 3 seconds between hermione and the guy shes wanting to ask out and Hermione just sitting there dumbfounded cause that somehow never even occurred to her in the countless hours she spent trying to plan this) idk even if they do end up together have it be a little more natural, honestly the fact that Ron's only dating experience is lavender and hermione, couple with hermione only having experience with ron and maybe victor,(wish we knew a bit more about what happened with that lol) and it just feels like jumping the gun, and then getting shot with said gun.
