I'm brand new to the world of fanfic, so my apologies if this is a dumb question. But are there any fics that basically take up where the last book left off? I'm not a huge fan of cursed child, and wanted to know if there was an “alternative” to that basically that might continue down a different path.


** Hi, welcome.

Lets get you started with some canon compliant stuff, first check out [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2132422/Northumbrian][this user]] they've written a bunch of stories that all mesh together for one wider world. Their stories aren't written chronologically but on their page, the one I linked, they list them in that order, I think 'Grave Days' is the first that picks up where the books ended.

After that I'd get you to check out works by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6993240/FloreatCastellum][Floreat Castellum]] who occasionally can be found on this subreddit. Her stories are fantastically well written and canon compliant.

after that you'll have fics like linkffn(4367121) which aren't by any means my favourite but are quite popular.

** Since it seems you want canon-compliant at least up until Cursed Child, I think little0bird is the author to read first. She hits almost every part of post-battle canon (canon pairings except some minor characters I think), canon professions, etc. The thing to know about little0bird is that her fics are not your typical Harry Potter adventure/mystery fic. They are very much an imagining of how Harry's life would have likely developed post-war, which means some PTSD stuff and normal life. One could argue that there is a distinct lack of actual magic in her world. These are very slice of life, character-driven stories. But they are very well written and capture the characters incredibly well.

** There's probably a hundred thousand of them. Like, once the seventh book came out, the most common starting point with fanfiction was the "what happens after the final battle and before the epilogue." It's how I got into fanfiction.

Truthfully, they can be kinda of sorted into a two different flavors. First is, what kind of job do you want Harry to have afterwards. Usually it's like Quidditch Player, Professor, or Auror. And secondly, its what kind of pairing do you want? Do you think Ginny and Harry immediately got back together and wasted no time in starting a family? Or do you think he explored his options a bit before committing, or think that Harry/Hermione is the OTP?

There's a few authors people recommend to starters. I haven't read these kinds of fics in a really long time, but I know of Northumbrian, Floreatcastellum, and littl0bird.

*** I think they(Harry/Ginny)would've immediately started their relationship, and I like to imagine he does have a job as an auror. Thank you kindly for the recommendations for starters as well!

** Do you mean what happened directly after Voldemort is defeated or stuff that continues the epilogue, so stories containing Harrys children ?

*** I would actually enjoy reading both if they exist honestly. I'd love to know what happened after his defeat, and also more about his children/his life at that point. Maybe something that has Albus not going into Slytherin since he was so worried about it?

**** There's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3435601/NoahPhantom][The Albus Potter Series By NoahPhantom]], and while its introduction of new kind of magic that both explains some of the old and is innovative in turn is quite interesting, I have to warn you that there's a cliffhanger right at the end of the seventh book and that the authors involved haven't continued the few thousand words of the started sequel meant to deal with that cliffhanger for a couple of years now, though I have recently heard from someone that they are planning to do so still.

** swissdog's series Harry's Future, Professor Potter, Harry Potter and the Children of the Clan and Harry Potter and the Magic War (WIP, really slow updates) which have part of cannon post DH and other things not so much.

linkffn(4335716; 5454173; 8512776; 11328983)

With that I looked in the deep bottom of my favourites and found back some old fics post DH that I read so long ago when I began reading fanfics. Unfortunately all are not completed. As for the quality I don't remember everything so I can't say if it's going to be good or not but it should at least not be awful.

linkffn(3723406; 7188801; 10749133; 6350739; 11593633)

all recs above may not be the best fics but as I said it's amongst the first fics I read and it's been quite some time. Hopefully you'll find something you'll enjoy.

As other already said, look for Northumbrian and little0bird who also did good post DH fics.

Also Days to Come linkffn(10728064), post DH EWE
