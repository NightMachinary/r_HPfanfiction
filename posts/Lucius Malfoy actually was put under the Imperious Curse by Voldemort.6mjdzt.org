Doesn't have to be a major plot point.


** That would be a really interesting fic if it's executed well and has a decent plot. After Voldemort is defeated for the first time, Lucius is finally free from the curse. If he was under the curse, this means that he didn't fully agree with Voldemort and/or had some sort of resource (money, power, talents, artifacts) that Voldemort wanted to get ahold of. Lucius could keep his head down after being acquitted or he could somehow act as a spy, working with Snape.

** You know, in Goblet of Fire, it's shown that Voldemort can summon his Death Eaters just by activating one of their Dark Marks.

Think about that for a moment. That's information on an Apparition target, either a mental picture or set of coordinates, transmitted over who-knows-what-distance direct to someone's mind.

If a mental picture or instructions can be transmitted over that link, why not suggestions? The Dark Mark is somewhat evocative of a slave brand, what if Voldemort used it to brainwash his Death Eaters into being more obedient to him?

Considering that of all the Death Eaters we see, only Snape, Regulus, the Malfoys, and Karkaroff rebel against Voldemort...if the rest have been brainwashed, why would those 6 break loose?

**** A possibility. But what makes them strong?

If we do go with 'the Dark Mark has brainwashing properties', then I assume that given it worked so well for Harry, love is probably the reason why the rest of them can resist it.

Snape had his love for Lily, Regulus had his love for...either Kreacher or Sirius, I dunno which, the Malfoys had their love for each other, and Karkaroff...did he flee for himself, or to lead the Death Eaters away from his students at Durmstrang?

Yeah, not a perfect theory yet...but if Voldemort never understood things like love or kindness or compassion, it makes sense that the Dark Mark wouldn't use those in its whispered suggestions and temptations and threats and such.

****** Another possibility, yes. Snape and Draco explicitly know Occlumency, it's possible that the rest could know it too.

True, Voldemort doesn't have a tremendous number of marked Death Eaters; mostly just his inner circle.

Perhaps the reason he marked so few, if the Dark Mark brainwashes, is to reduce the risk of a research group mounting a study into the Dark Mark and discovering its properties; if it's revealed that Voldemort can manipulate minds through the mark, then that could cause whoever has the Mark to start doubting their own thoughts. That and it'd undermine his standing amongst the purebloods no end.

Hence, he only used it in high-value cases; the rich-and-influential Malfoys, Unspeakable Rookwood, unstable but powerful Bellatrix, Order of the Phoenix member and Secret Keeper Peter Pettigrew...

***** Maybe the brainwash can only go so far, and if you lose faith in the cause for whatever reason (for instance, if the Dark Lord kills the woman you're obsessed with) the suggestions stop working?

** In my story "Patron", the Dark Marks were Horcruxes, and influenced their wearers. With Voldemort reduced to a shade, the influence was gone, but as he started to recover, his influence grew again, and Lucius became more cruel and violent, even cursing Draco when his son didn't fulfill his expectations - something he'd never have done otherwise.

*** linkffn(If Looks Could Killby questionablequotation) has something similar. (The Dark mark is a Horcrux created by the bearer, but hijacked to serve as one for Voldemort.)

  ONE-SHOT: After Arthur Weasley nearly dies at the Ministry, Harry wonders why Voldemort's snake isn't something more exotic...really, no self-respecting Parseltongue should limit himself to something as mundane as a regular snake. In which Harry makes use of what he learned in Care of Magical Creatures, Kreacher is forced to cooperate, and the Chamber hides a new Secret..

**** In my version, Voldemort also makes the Death Eaters think - with a False-Memory Charm - that they killed the sacrifice for the Horcrux as their intitiation. So they aren't aware that anything but a murder happened when they were marked.

** There's a Lucius/Hermione fic that is unfortunately incomplete, where Hermione investigates Death Eaters crimes and discovers that some of them were actually mind-controlled by Voldemort (or something else out of their control, as I said the fic is unfinished and we still don't know what happened). It was really good, it's super frustrating that it's abandoned. I don't remember the name right now, but some Death Eaters had green-tinted dark marks, which seemed to be the detail that differentiated them from willing death eaters. I'll check if I can find it tomorrow, this made me want to read it again, and be disappointed again by the abandoned status haha.
