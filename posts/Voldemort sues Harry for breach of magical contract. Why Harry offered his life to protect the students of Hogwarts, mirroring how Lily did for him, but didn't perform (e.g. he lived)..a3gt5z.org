What a huge mess for the law courts. The shard of Voldemort's soul that took the hit in the first place that let Harry live, was it an object or a person? If it were an object, did Harry have the legal right to swap it in place of his own death?\\
What about the ethos of someone else taking your place as a sacrifice? If you offer your own life, but then actually sacrifice something else like an animal (or a different person), is that a breach of contract?\\
If intent didn't apply in the original contract (where Lily traded her life for Harry's, Voldemort just planned to kill both of them but was bound by it anyway), why should it apply to Harry's (where he didn't actually die, but he 'meant to, and that's what did it')?

What would the court's decision be? Would it annul the contract and order Voldemort's restoration, soul bit and all, or would it order that Harry perform his part of the contract properly, or would it rule that the contract had been fulfilled? What precedent would it set for future 'self-sacrifices that aren't'?


** The relevant passage:

#+begin_quote
  â€˜I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.'
#+end_quote

Voldemort asked that Harry turn himself over to be killed to protect the lives of those remaining defenders in Hogwarts. He turned himself over and even allowed Voldemort to attack him with no defence taken -- he didn't even duck. The fact that the Dark Lord was too WEAK to leverage that offer doesn't invalidate Harry's good-faith submission to the terms of the deal. In fact, Voldemort's Magic itself deemed the contract fulfilled, as it refused to perform when he reneged on his end of the bargain and resumed attempts to kill the defenders of the castle.

If the contract had been breached even by his own belief, the Dark Lord would have been able to attack and kill those defenders without difficulty. QED.

*** But as previously noted above, good faith and intent are implicitly irrelevant to magical contracts.\\
When Voldemort attempted to kill Harry Potter when he was a year old, Lily Evans gave her life to save Harry; Voldemort didn't intend to form a contract of 'take Lily's life and spare Harry', he intended 'kill Harry, and spare Lily only if she steps aside'.\\
Nevertheless, despite his absence of intent, he was bound by the contract to take Lily and spare Harry.

So, by that token, Harry's good-faith attempt at sacrificing himself is irrelevant; the fact is that he offered his life, but did not follow through (Voldemort's own soul shard paying the price in his place), but Voldemort was still bound by his side of the contract despite Harry not paying the price he promised. Hence, breach of contract.

**** You may be missing a relevant factor: Lily's life was already protected by a contract between Voldemort and Severus Snape. When Lily offered to trade her life for Harry's, she unknowingly invoked a good faith clause in the prior contract; when Voldemort killed Lily, he was no longer free to kill Harry, and thus was confounded (and nearly killed) by that breach of contract. This suggests that good faith and intent are relevant to such contracts, despite Voldemort's preference otherwise.

***** Hmm...that seems bizarre, though.\\
Contract between Snape and Voldemort: In return for whatever Snape offers (service as a Death Eater, or something else?), Voldemort agrees to spare Lily Evans' life.\\
Voldemort does not uphold this contract, so therefore...his killing curse works on Lily but bounces off Harry for some reason?

I could see that working if the penalty for killing Lily /was/ Voldemort's spontaneous death for violating the contract, and Harry's scar just comes from a shattered soul bit rather than reflecting a killing curse.\\
And maybe as a plot point, Voldemort's violating the contract might free Severus from any magically induced obligation to serve him faithfully as a Death Eater, hence his spying activities.

****** I can't be fucked arguing(to tired), but wordhammer is right, you're wrong. While a contract was made(in this mystical court), it was also invalidated by Voldemort as well. Intent is what a magical contract would look for most. You can't blame someone if you failed, and then invalidated a contract you made yourself. This is a magical court, which means it can measure if you did your best to uphold your end, Harry did, Voldemort didn't, therefore the contract is void.

Even in actual courts, if you showed that you tried as hard as you could to meet a contracts requirements, and failed, all that would happen is that either the contract would be renegotiated, or if the other side purposefully failed the contract(Voldemort) they'd be in the wrong, and have to do be punished however the contract stated, and agreed upon by all parties, or they'd just cancel the contract. In this scenario, Voldemort failed the contract, therefore the contract is voided unless Harry wants to hold up his end of the bargain. That's the answer, answered by someone who has some experience in contracts.

Thanks,\\
Warryn.

Except, apparently, with the Goblet of Fire. Also, re-reading the relevant chapter of Deathly Hallows, Voldemort did actually keep his word, and didn't resume the battle; though he attempted to silence the crowd and torture Neville Longbottom, it was technically the Hogwarts defenders and their reinforcements who re-initiated the fight.

...Although, /that/ specific agreement was only for Harry to come and give himself up to Voldemort, and in exchange, he and his Death Eaters wouldn't restart the battle. So, he technically upheld that one, if only because the other side attacked first.\\
So...I guess the one where Harry gives his life to give magical protection to the denizens of Hogwarts is a separate contract...but then aren't we back to the start? I highly doubt Voldemort intended to form such a magical contract, and Harry (accidentally) breached it by not giving his own life, so if neither contract were wilfully violated...I've confuzzled myself again.

Shortly after this promise of Snape, he went to Dumbledore to ask for additional help to grant Lily protection. This caused him to turn spy, meaning he in practice no longer worked as a Death Eater. Wouldn't this be a breach of contract on his end?

***** Mm, I suppose that's technically true. It occurred to me before that perhaps the contract in question could be 'Voldemort immediately gets to exercise his 'right' to kill Harry, in exchange for foregoing his 'right' to kill everyone else', in which case it'd be fulfilled, in that Voldemort would still be perfectly capable of killing Harry...just not everyone else.

But I suppose that's something for the lawyers.

** Voldemort would definitely have a strong case. After all, the life Harry threw in place of his own was one of /Voldemort'/s own lives. Hard to say Voldemort wasn't cheated.

On the other hand, it could be argued that by making him a Horcrux (albeit unintentionally), Voldemort had /given/ him this life of his --- and hence it belonged to Harry, it was one of Harry's /two/ lives that he could dispose of, and so it fulfills the terms of the contract for him to sacrifice it. He never said /which/ of the lives he owned he was going to sacrifice.

On the other other hand, Scardemort was only one-seventh of a person (though, of course, so was Lord Voldemort himself). So Harry may owe Voldemort six-seventh of a life still. So the court's decision would be that Harry must make six Horcruxes posthaste and then sacrifice all of them to Voldemort, at which point the contract will be fulfilled.

In all cases, though, the contract traded Harry's life (whichever) for the lives of the Hogwarts denizens, not Voldemort's own. Assuming Harry's sacrifice was found to be legally void, the court would order that the Hogwarts denizens be killed, but Voldemort's life or death doesn't enter into it, really.

*** I'm not sure that you understand the horcrux mechanics in play here. Voldemort's killing curse did not kill the scarcrux. Voldemort's killing curse killed Harry, which resulted in the scarcrux dying because a horcrux is destroyed when its physical container is put beyond repair, which in the case of a biological container means the death of the biological entity.

Harry came back to life because Voldemort had anchored Harry to life by putting Harry's blood in him, which kept Lily's blood protection alive and tied Harry to life via Voldemort. He didn't come back to life because the horcrux in some sense "took the hit" for him.

**** Well, it's kind of left ambiguous exactly /what/ saved Harry at King's Cross between mastery of the Elder Wand, the blood protection, or, if you want to go wild, being the Master of Death. The idea of Scardemort "balancing death's books" is yet another theory, and I don't honestly think it's any more or less likely than anything else. But I do see your point.

My reasoning was more that, no matter the /magical/ mechanics involved, in this hypothetical court where Harry had to justify his not giving his life even though he was supposed to sacrifice it to Voldemort, his best defence might be to say that he /did/ sacrifice a life, it just wasn't his but Scardemort's.

*** But making a horcrux requires a cold-blooded murder (or presumably, a similar-in-magnitude act of malice/cruelty). Even if contracts involving murder are magically enforceable, I don't know if the court could order a grossly illegal act as restitution.

Although, I suppose that that could be fulfilled by appointing Harry the Lord High Executioner, and have him make his horcruxes by executing various Death Eaters convicted of crimes against humanity.\\
Of course, seeing as it's sweet innocent Harry, he'll need to take lessons; starting with a guinea pig, and working his way up to a Second Trombone.

(I know, it couldn't /actually/ work, but it's funny to think about as crack fic potential.)

** Since a method of capital punishment in magical England is the dementors kiss, then that means that a life is the same as ones soul.

Therefore Harry did in fact give up his life to fulfill the contract. He just had more than one on hand.

Voldemort also can't claim ownership of the soul in Harry's possession since he never filed a claim prior to the 6 year statute of limitation.

I would move to have the case dismissed and countersue since Voldemort knowlingly endangered the lives in breach of the contract that was struck

*** BUT. If a soul and life are considered equivalent, and soul-shards/horcruxes are demonstrably intelligent as shown by the diary (and to a lesser extent, the locket), wouldn't that mean that Harry's possession of one could be considered comparable to an ongoing kidnapping/false imprisonment or similar?\\
While he might not be held particularly responsible for said illegal custody of the soul bit, since he wasn't doing it on purpose and besides, it's a horrible horrible horcrux that's making Voldemort immortal, I'm fairly sure that Voldemort /can/ continue to claim 'ownership' of the soul bit that Harry has, regardless of how many years it's been.
