:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Good day, all of you. This is my first post on the subreddit, so forgive any rule-breaking, etc. if you would.

I'm here to ask you guys if any of you are familiar with a story I read before on mobile before my phone had whatever might be synonymous to a heart attack for a phone. I was too late to save my Chrome tabs via Recent Tabs by the time I got a new phone. It happened some months ago, and I've tried my best looking for it myself, but I can't seem to get a break.

So now here I am, hoping the good peeps of this subreddit might help a bloke out.

Here's what I know:

1.) I'm about 80-90% sure it was posted on [[https://Fanfiction.net][Fanfiction.net]] . I can't be 100% sure because I also often browse other fan-fiction site, including Webnovel. I'm almost sure it wasn't from Webnovel, though, from the simple fact that the story isn't in my library.

2.) The MC might be Harry. About 95% sure with this one. It might also be a Harmony (HarryxHermione) fic. Or maybe a HarryxHarem fic, but I'm sure Hermione is there.

3.) The number one reason I'm looking for this fic is because of one scene/chapter that really stuck to me: MC/Harry is doing a practical auror/unspeakable exam - pretty sure it was an auror exam, or maybe it was just training. People not of Britain are in charge, if I remember right. Harry and a few other candidates are dropped off the shore of an island. Their goal is to survive and to make it to a command center. The catch is that there are trained aurors scattered around the island, and the examinees have to go through them or around them.\\
At the end of it, Harry gets to the command center and uses coconuts(?) to knock out the ones guarding the perimeter. Then he charges through the door and looking to take down the ones inside, but he realizes that the people inside are the ones in charge of the exam.

I'm really sorry if this isn't much information, but it's all I got. It's got me really pulling my hair, too. Any help would be appreciated.
