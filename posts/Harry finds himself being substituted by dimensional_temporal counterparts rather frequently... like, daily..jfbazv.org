Every student is confused/worried/afraid of Harry's frequent changes of behavior, Umbridge/the Daily Prophet are gleefully pointing it as him being mentally unstable, the rest of the faculty and wiser adults call it a rather acute case of puberty and go on with their lives.

Would like that some of Harry's quirks were: trying to get into someone's pants one day, only for the next not even remember their name and in the third swear a bloody revenge over some imagined slightly/being beyond Hermione in studies one day, become dumb as a rock the next, refusing to learn anything discovered/created after Hogwarts' founding the one after, disregarding all theory the one after only to then invent tons of new magics while fusing it with muggle science and after taking turns in over glorifying and completely disregarding muggles altogether/ Deciding that Dumbledore is the best thing invented since sliced bread, then acuse him of numerous supposed crimes based on flimsy evidence, a total lack of logic and some truly impressive mental gymnastic, to claiming to not have ever talked with Dumbledore, to considering him a reluctant ally, to then trying to either go over his head or circumvent him instead of working together, to siding with Voldemort, then a bemused Grindelwald that he broke out of prison (against Grindelwald's will), to creating his own dark supporting side and then his own light supporting side...

** I had an idea a bit similar to this some time ago. Harry is hit by an unknown curse at some point. As a result, he randomly swaps "soul" with a parallell Harry from a different HP fanfic universe. The canon universe gets the kind of hijinks you mentioned, while canon Harry gets thrown into various confusing realities, some which are sort of plausible in different circumstances (Slytherin!Harry) while some aren't at all and something truly wacky must have made it so (Evil!Dumbles).

**** I mean like would it be like possession, would he be aware of it but unable to communicate with other Harry and not in control or would he switch places so he would ended up in the world of other Harry and be like 'wtf is going on' and have absolutely no idea what are others up to in his original world

Just to be clear, it isn't said by the author but I thought it was along the lines that he lives normally and then suddenly he starts to switch

***** Eh, could be any of the options really, if he was sent to the other Harry's dimensions it may be funny having a small part of each chapter showing the reaction of the Harry presented in the last chapter to being sent to the new Harry's dimension.

*** He discovered a spell that has effects similar to Quantum Leap/Sliders and has to solve some problem the other persona could not solve/rescue the universe before hopping off to the next universe in a desperate hope that the next leap will bring him home.

** Not exactly what you're looking for but there's a crack fic where Hermione finds a spell that lets you relive your past lives and she uses it constantly on Harry.

** What if it were like a rotation of infinite Harrys in infinite worlds? I mean like canon goes to Au who goes to Fanon who goes to dark harry and so on every day. And the canon Harry meets all the alternate dimension.
