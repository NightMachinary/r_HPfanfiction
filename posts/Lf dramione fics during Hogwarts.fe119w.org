** An old (/OLD/) favourite of mine not long after I started reading fanfiction was [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/140349/1/Blood-Tears-and-Drowning-Fears][Blood, Tears and Drowning Fears]] by Rhysenn. I haven't read a lot of Dramione, but this one was a pretty decent seller, though it is short and incomplete.
