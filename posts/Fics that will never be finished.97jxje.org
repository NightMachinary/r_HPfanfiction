Are there any fics that are good enough to read even though the author has decided not to complete them? Mine is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4345778/1/The-Book-of-the-Dead][The Book of the Dead,]] by Satismagic. It's the sequel to [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/The-Apprentice-and-the-Necromancer][The Apprentice and the Necromancer]], which I loved. The author told me she isn't going to continue the story, but I'd read Book of the Dead regardless. And you should absolutely read "Apprentice", too. It's Hermione/Snape, but I didn't find it too hideous.


** Oh boy, lemme first brace myself for possible tears.

linkffn(4080247) - A part of me dies every time I remember Lost Time is abandoned.

linkffn(Contemplating Clouds) - Hands down my favorite Harry/Luna in the fandom. Also dead.

linkffn(The Skitterleap) - There goes my fav sweeping AU. At least it does have a complete arc, with buildup and climax, I guess. /Sniff/.

linkffn(Für Das Größere Wohl) - Started reading this one, thinking that it was crack. Well, it was awesome while it lasted.

linkffn(Harry Potter and the Lords of Magic I) - At least maybe Taure will rewrite this as his [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/7cq26e/whats_the_fic_youd_like_to_write_but_lack_the/dprvn0b][Air Ship Alchemist fic]], yeah? Yeah, probably not, but a man can hope.

linkffn(Error of Soul) - The only H/Hr fic that gave me hope for my ex-OTP. Needless to say, that ship sank for me.

linkffn(The One He Feared) - Probably would sacrifice my left nut to see this one continued. Maybe the other nut as well to see it complete.

Now I'm sad.

*Not adding Forging the Sword, On the Way to Greatness or A Long Journey Home here, cuz fuck you, I'm not accepting the possibility that they're dead too.

** I really like [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1260679/1/Realizations][Realizations]], which has the premise of the Dursleys just up and leaving shortly before OotP, without telling Harry. It then follows him spending his summer in Diagon Alley, trying to convince everyone (including himself) that he's fine, really. I really think it's worth a read if you like character-focused stuff, even though it hasn't been updated in almost eight years.

** My favorites:\\
Linkffn(The One He Feared): the best Harry gets someone elses memories stories, also the best Dumbledore in the fandom.

Linkffn(The Lesser Sadness): one of the most original variation of the time-travel trope I have encountered.

Linkffn(Ectomancer): dang if I didn't get a kick out of all the spirit world stuff.

Linkffn(On the Way to Greatness): the most canon-like Harry in Slytherin out there, and while the author says he will return, its been four years.

Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Unlocked Knowledge): the relationship between Harry and Tom is the most amiable yet enjoyable I have come across.

Linkffn(Forging the Sword): I have yet to find a fic that so captures the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione as this fic does.

Linkffn(A Game of Style and Brutality): one of the better quidditch stories and one of the better H/D fics out there. Ditto for Duality.

The Alexandra Quick Series cut out after 4 books. Left a fair amount unsaid too.

Linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent): one of the oldest fics in my favorites, the fic just concluded two of its three major acts, but the world-building was such a resounding jolt to the system in comparison to all the other post-2007 fics. Highly recommend for the characters in particular.

**** It's because the characters feel real. James isn't a creepy stalker with no interests outside thinking about Lily and talking constantly about how utterly amazing she is because she cast 'Wingardium Leviosa'. Lily was not a perfect Mary Sue 'prettiest, most talented, most intelligent, most gifted, most amazing person at Hogwarts in two hundred years to come' which you regularly get in fanfiction, her friends were actually nice to read about too. Lily is also not Hermione with red hair and green eyes. Snape is the crappy person he should actually be.

Sometimes, I forget that Donna Shacklebolt is nothing more than an OC and that no Adam McKinnon was mentioned in canon. Peter is actually a Marauder and Sirius isn't defined by being stupid and flirty, literally the only given attributes to him in a regular Jily fanfiction (one of which goes directly against what was stated in canon). I mean, it's the only fic I tolerate which has Marlene Mckinnon and Alice Longbottom being Lily's friends.

I have my issues with it because not even Lily fit in with her canon persona (for example, reforming her friendship with Snape, something I personally don't see her doing at all). But it's really well done, with a unique writing style and correct grammar as well as great OCs. It's a shame that it's abandoned but the author does have a completed fic and a funny parody of your regular Jily fanfiction.

linkffn(The Evil Overlord List by boomvroomshroom)

linkffn(Death Before Dishonour) has the best characterization of Daphne as well as Harry and his friends acting like kids; terrified of the looming war.

linkffn(To Be Queen) is just flat out strange but is a different take on Harems. Weird, but unique and isn't for everyone but it is something.

Linkffn(An Unfound Door by joe6991)

linkffn(Ouroboros by Voice of the Nephilim) is a torture fic but it is psychologically thrilling. Author of The Unforgiving Minute.

** Linkffn(Give Me Wings by Enjaye) is REALLY good, but unfortunately it only has the one chapter and it was posted back in 2002, the same year when the author seemingly quit. I'd pay for someone to rewrite it, though.

Linkffn(A Song of the Old World) is similar to the above in the sense that it only has the one chapter, but it's even BETTER imo with lots of worldbuilding already. Sadly, the author disappeared from the internet, which is why it's never going to be updated again. It's on my to-do list to adapt/continue it, though.

Linkffn(4190925) hasn't been updated in several years, so I doubt it's ever going to be finished.

Linkffn(9524552) is a hilarious story that only has the one chapter. The author is kinda known for writing and dropping fics, so it's never going to be finished most likely.

And linkffn(Blood and Chocolate by Lady Lemon Drop) will probably never be finished, which is really a shame. It's quite good, but they haven't updated any of their stories in years, including this one.

** This thread is pure torture.

My contributions are [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5137164/1/Double-Time-Trouble][Double Time Trouble]] and [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7450800/1/Preventing-the-Future][Preventing the Future]]

Both are OP Hermione time travel stories. Both are angsty, feature Hermione, and may I remind you: Over Powered. So, so, deliciously easy OP. If you like your hero's to have every advantage, read these. Yeah, sometimes they get hurt, but the baddies are never really a challenge.

Double time trouble: Crackfic, Dark? Hermione (its been a while since I read it) times 3. That's right, 3 of her. All slightly different. The opening chapter should explain most everything.

TL;DR There's 3 Hermiones

Preventing the future is my favorite because, while filled with descriptions of OP magic, surroundings, and items, the descriptions and pranks pulled are unique (not your typical “they turned him pink!” hurr hurr hurr). It's set in the marauders era and Hermione heavily fraternizes with all four + Lily. She's even nice to Pettigrew.

TL;DR She's the chosen one.

** Not technically dead, but on hiatus since 2015 due to severe health problems: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past) is worth reading even though incomplete.

The author maintains a very good balance of foreknowledge vs the butterfly effect. Harry's greater experience and power comes at the cost of PTSD from watching everyone and everything he loved destroyed over a 13 year war, usually brutally and often right in front of him. His need for secrecy, meanwhile, puts distance between him and the Headmaster. And something seems to be working against his ability to make changes, restoring something like the original timeline but often darker and more violent.

** I'm going to start with linkffn(Tenebrae Vincunt) and linkffn(The Dark in Peace) both by [[/u/TE7]] partly because I know it'll annoy him but mainly because I really do want to find out what happens - especially in the latter.

linkffn(Harry Potter and Hogwarts U) has a nice idea where Hogwarts is a university rather than a school, which may just be an easy way of having lots of sex right from the get-go but could also be a really original story.

Lastly I'll include linkffn(We Found Wonderland by scarecrowing). It's not very far along but I love the idea and it was the first story I beta'd (from ch. 6) so it's always going to have a spot in my heart.

This thread has made me realise just how much utter crap there is in my alerts list. I'm definitely going to have to go through and clear it out at some point...
