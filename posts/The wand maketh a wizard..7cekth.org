In the old days of yonder, there was a time when witches and wizards had no wand.

It all changed when +the fire nation attacked.+ the first tree fell onto a unicorn, trapping its majestic tail hair at the core of the tree. And a wizard found the tree, for no reason but the plot, and cut it to pieces. But the first wand was to be found, for +Tachanka+ lord is good and fair, his radioactive 'helmet of awesome' rays giving our universe shape (and magic). The wizard was startled, as the twiggy core spat out globs of white silver and in-between, scarring the night with the first wand magic, announcing his position to the predators of the +taxes+ night +also known as+ and the king who was conveniently out hunting. So they met and so they talked, and King Arthur came to know Merlin, the first wand waver.

Time passed slow and fast and saw the rise of evils, which plagued the world but +Tachanka+ lord was good and fair for he made the +jedi+ light to oppress the dark and bring peace.

But then came the lord that fled from death. He was great and terrible for +Ollivander said so+he spilled much blood with his wand stick, which was as long as the thirteen and a half inches of its lice-ridden horrible glory, that could +please+ slaughter any witch or wizard, given power with its yew colored outer shell bulging the veins that were a dragon's heart.

Not even the mighty Albus Dumbledore, the brother of Alberforth the +pleaser+ raiser of goats, with his fifteen inches of dangling, elder, experienced wand, shrouded in dark Thestral hair, a stark contrast to his silvery mop of beard, could not defeat him.

But +Tachanka+ lord is good and fair for there arrived Harry Potter, the one of prophecy, the destined one. He stepped to the Ollivanders' and like no other, no wand fit him. But +Tachanka+ lord is good and fair for Olivander only had to make him a new wand after the careful inspection of his girth and length, in various places of anatomy.

And so the wood for the wand was chosen by touching many other poles owned by various witches and wizards, and choosing a core was done after careful fondling of various majestic glass containers which were in the form of globes dangling from the Olivander's ceiling in pairs, thus balancing each other, connected to a single wood. And after, when Olivander handed the wand of the chosen one the +fandom+ world wept in relief for sparks of white and silver jumped from the massive wand tip of seventeen inches, which would no doubt penetrate many keyholes to cast the magical essence.(Of Alohomora)

All hail Harry Potter the handler of the mighty wand.

All hail the wand crafting arc.

All hail the Alohomora.

And all hail the +Tachanka+ lord for he is good and fair. (And has the biggest gun.)

**** Was this perhaps written in a drug and/or alcohol induced stupor? Or are you just plain... odd

It is with great sorrow that I inform you that I am neither alcoholic nor do drugs. Unless you count fanfiction, which is a very mentally and physically harmful drug by itself.

****** â€˜Tis truly a sad day to discover a fellow Redditor suffers from the most vicious of afflictions; oddititus. A minutes silence must therefore be held to commiserate with their friends and family and give them strength through all the strange events that shall surely become a regular event in the future. To find out at the very same time they are addicted to fanfiction is surely an even greater wound. It is a terrible drug that few ever recover from and nigh impossible to be weaned off of. You have my condolences, dear friend

** Let us not forget that the wand crafting arc is but one piece of a whole.

Glory to the shopping arc, for it is long and tedious and needlessly detailed.

Praise be to the Goblins and their bloodline tests.

All hail Acromantula silk and the robes made from it.

Give thanks to the magically expanded trunk, we would be lesser by its absence.

Forget not Flourish and Blotts, for there begins the path to +OP bullshit+ power.
