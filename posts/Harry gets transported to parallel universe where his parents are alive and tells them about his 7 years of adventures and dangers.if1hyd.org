So I have this guilty pleasure of reading fics where harry describe his hogwarts years to other people. I have enjoyed those fics where characters from harry potter read harry potter books and enjoy them a lot, especially the fact that harry kills a basillisk. I've been wondering if there are fics where harry gets transported to a parallel universe where both james and lily are alive, and when harry tells them about his years at hogwarts, they are very shocked by the kind dangerous situations that harry goes through.

I hope there will be no bashing of anyone because it is very easy to find james and lily alive fics where they are complete idiots and don't care about harry.

I hope i am not asking for too much.

  Trying to bring the ghosts of James and Lily so they could protect Harry from Snape's taunting, Sirius makes a mistake and actually brings them back to life.

  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

Too far from home and elsewhere not elsewhen are also pretty interesting but contain a duplicate harry in parallel world. I would rather have him dead otherwise it won't make the reunion with his parents as much emotional. Well I have to say the the riddled universe caught me completely off gaurd.
