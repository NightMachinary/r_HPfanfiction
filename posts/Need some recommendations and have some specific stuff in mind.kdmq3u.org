Hey everyone hope you all are doing well. I was in the mood for some fanfics and this time I have some things I'm looking for: 1. No bashing 2. Competent/powerful trio 3. Immersive, well written and hopefully complete. 4. I want to see some cool artefects and crazy magic. 5. No slash (Nothing against it just not my cup of tea) 6. It would be a bonus if it included The Flamels. 7. Good action and possibly some political contrive.

Thanks :)

  The writing on the wall said she'd been taken, that her skeleton would lie in the Chamber, that no one could find, forever. Everyone believed it because they still had no idea where it was. Ginny/Harry. Slow Burn.

** Well, the Trio isn't a thing in this fic, but it hits everything on your list except that and the Flamels. And it's complete (sequel just came out today).\\

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.
