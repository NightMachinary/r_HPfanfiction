What I can remember

Hermione gets her wand snapped due to performing magic before Hogwarts starts. I'm fairly sure it's a oneshot.


** Was it [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/9/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][this]] one that came up in this sub recently?

*** Thanks for this, I really liked it. I generally avoid reading collections of oneshots, so I miss gems like this.
