I've noticed something kind of odd with my fic recently. I've been posting it to both ff.net and ao3 since 2015, and before it was always that I got lots of reviews on ffn and the odd few (though they tended to be longer, more thought out reviews) on ao3.

Recently, I've been getting far fewer reviews on ffn, but lots more on ao3. Has anyone else had the same thing?


** I posted a story recently to AO3 and FFN. Kudos but no reviews on AO3, but I've had about half a dozen reviews on FFN. So people are gonna people and ain't nothing you can do about it.

** I've all but stopped posting on ffnet due to this. It feels like writing into the void over there. There's really only one reviewer nice enough to do it every time, a couple of sentences and I appreciate it, but I haven't had a new reviewer there in months. However, I get a kudos email daily on ao3, a lot of the reviews are engaged, detailed and often have questions or comments which are insightful (which thanks to ao3 is set up, we can have comment discussion easily). Also get new readers pretty frequently. It's just a lot of faff getting it formatted for ffnet for very little reaction but I also know a lot of people prefer it, even if I don't.

** I seem to be the opposite of the other posters. For every one comment I get on FFN, I get about seven on ao3, and the ao3 ones tend to be of much higher quality. (Gen writer, no real pairings)

** I closed my Ao3 account because I got so few hits, it wasn't worth keeping it. I don't get much on ffn either but it was easily ten times better than Ao3.

** I get very little feedback on Ao3 compared to FFN. And while I got no "but according to my headcanon, Harry should do X" reviews on Archive, there was very little deeper feedback. I had significantly more helpful conversations on FFN, even though recently there were little of these either.

The feature to directly reply to comments would be a lot more useful on FFN for me. I have exactly one author with whom I write on Ao3, and in that case I am the one who leaves feedback.

But your mileage may vary. Some of it comes from the fact that what I write is not very popular on Archive. No slash, no Death Eaters as protagonists or love interests, no explicit content. On FFN, I have the #12 spot when it comes to "most popular stories" with Andromeda Tonks in them. On Archive, I have less than 1% Kudos compared to the Top Story. Family and Friendship are simply not themes which will get you a lot of attention over there.

** I don't get feedback on either site but I post regularly. People aren't that interested in minor characters paired with OCs.

*** That's sad to hear because I personally love those kind of story's. I've been into fanfic for some time now (around 2 years) and I'm just sick of the usual parings and tropes for my fandom so every new idea gets me really exited. What fandom are you writing for?

** The exact oposite for me.

But i should add that there are much more HP stories on ffn and that I write mostly ASOIAF.
