** Snape is Draco's Godfather. Always read it in fics and just thought I had missed a portion of the book. I still am partial to it, but now I know it's not canon.

Also there are so many different spells and charms that have just been ingrained into my mind that I have to look up to see what's canon and what's not.

**** It's something that makes a /lot/ of sense, but isn't actually in canon. To me, this makes it fairly harmless fanon - it doesn't go against the spirit of the books, adds a bit of flavor and world building, and has enough building blocks in the books that it isn't out of left field.

**** Narcissa says Snape is Draco's favourite professor and that Snape is Lucius's old friend, but that's all. I think from the fact Snape was actually called a /friend/ of Lucius that people theorised he was Draco's Godfather. Since Snape didn't really have any friends other than Lily and Lucius didn't seem like the type to have "friends" as much as acquaintances, it felt kind of significant that Narcissa called them friends.

The idea probably became popular since people like to create dark-and-light-but-still-similar comparisons between Draco and Harry. Sirius who was friends with James was Harry's Godfather. So it was interesting to make Snape who was friends with Lucius as Draco's. Especially since Sirius and Snape hate each other so much and Draco and Harry hated each other.

It's just never actually state, and Narcissa probably would have mentioned it if it were true, but unlike a lot of fanon this one makes total sense without making any leaps beyond what we do, in fact, know to be true.

  On [[http://www.jkrowling.com][www.jkrowling.com]], J.K. said, "Just like Dean Thomas, Flitwick has a background that I now realise will never see its way into the books because it is not relevant to the plot. He is human but with a dash of goblin ancestry -- something like a great, great, great grandfather. This is only interesting in as much as it gives him a perhaps unexpected empathy for people like Hagrid who are, in Death Eater parlance, half-breeds. However, Flitwick and Hagrid have never had a scene together, so Flitwick's genetic composition has been relegated to the very back of my mind over the six novels in which he features, although I think it has informed his character. Slightly dotty though he may be, he is welcoming of all students, whatever their background (he did say in 'Philosopher's Stone' that he was very fond of Lily, thus establishing that he was not prejudiced against Muggle-borns)."

  On her site, J.K. also added, "I must admit, I was taken aback when I saw the film Flitwick, who looks very much like a goblin/elf (I've never actually asked the filmmakers precisely what he is), because the Flitwick in my imagination simply looks like a very small old man."

*** The problem is that many spells use a modifier when cast, such as accio pillow, or /accio broomstick/ (note Harry didn't say MY broomstick, magic interpreted his command as that). As a result, while the /Point me/ spell might only oint North, with a modifier added, it could quite easily become a locator spell.

Saying that it can't do that because we never see it done would drastically limit the number of spells in existence. After all, there WAS a book in the bookstore that said 1,001 Hexs, yet all the spells listed in the books total well below that number.

So, just because it wasn't SPECIFICALLY mentioned is no reason to declare it impossible. Otherwise you have to admit that centuries of wizards and witches were too dumb to invent obvious and simple spells.

Fleamont is implied to have been an only child. And Charlus would be likely too young to be Fleamont's first cousin, his wife Dorea was born in 1920, if we assume that they would be of similar age it doesn't really work out, since we know that in 1926 Fleamont was already a very successful potioneer with his potions even being popular in America. It could still technically work, but I would rather assume that he's at least a second cousin or a first cousin once removed.

One of the most prominent characters, McGonagall, is thrown in to a movie just cause she is a favorite?

The story switching themes between movies, changing the focus completely with out adding anything of a purpose?

The main focus of the story not being revealed as what it is, the blood vial, but given very minor indications? Every movie and book before this gave a clear purpose to each important item and story to back it but not anymore.

The way that magic works, while it looks cool, is mind-boggling in comparison to what we saw before. I understand that we saw everything from a schoolboys perception, but the way Dumbledor fought Voldemort is not even close to what we saw happen in the last two movies.

Not even going in to it about nagini, or the fact a prominent pureblood, LeStrange, sent his daughter and only son, off with an half elf on muggle transport to America, both completely off base from what we know of the wizarding world.

But you are right JKR did write it so by definition it is canon, but the good thing about fiction is that people can pick and choose what they want to see as canon. I have no hat to those how like cursed child or even see it a canon, but for me it can't be, nor can FB.

This Cambridge definition would also include anything JKR has written which isn't a part of the Harry Potter universe at all - say, that crime novel she wrote under a pseudonym.

I think fandom use of the word is a bit closer to the second definition listed by Google: "a collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine" or "the works of a particular author or artist that are recognized as genuine."

Obviously we know that everything JKR wrote is genuinely by her, but some people may not accept it as "genuinely" part of the universe they conceive. Canon's kinda subjective. Like, if you look at the subreddit survey results, people's uses very wildly.

********** A dictionary definition isn't the same thing as a generally accepted one; if it were that simple, the Death of the Author debate wouldn't exist, and the definition you cited doesn't actually clarify this point: by this definition, the books and prequel films are both part JKR's canon (although even that's murky at best due to the collaborative nature of filmmaking), but they aren't /necessarily/ both part of the Harry Potter canon, as there's room to interpret them as two separate stories.

It also doesn't work for series with multiple authors: the Star Wars sequel trilogy is, at least for now, still part of the canon (no matter how little anybody wants for it to be), despite Lucas having had nothing to do with it. Disney could announce that they're removing it from the canon, but does it really mean anything if they do? Similarly, Community's creator and showrunner was fired along with most of its writing staff between its third and fourth seasons, but that doesn't change the fact that the so called "gas leak year" is 100% canon to the show's continuity.

As for your other point, you're right: Dumbledore doesn't explicitly state that there /isn't/ an outside force preventing him from fighting Grindelwald. His exact words are:

#+begin_quote
  "'They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I feared him.

  'Oh, not death,' said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry's questioning look. 'Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly: you would be right. Harry, I dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually stuck the blow that snuffed out her life.

  'I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could.'"
#+end_quote

So, yeah, it's /technically/ possible that he literally couldn't figure Grindelwald and just chose not to mention it, instead explaining in detail why he didn't want to and never making the barest reference to any external obstacle. I still very much consider it a contradiction, but I'll concede that I was wrong in that it isn't an explicit one.

*********** In this case it's more they've chosen a definition of "canon" that's related but distinct. Effectively, it's the same as quoting the definition of "fly" as being "a vital piece of men's apparel" instead of "an insect". They've chosen the wrong sense.

I think canon in the fanfiction sense is more closely related to Biblical Canon:

#+begin_quote
  A collection or list of sacred books accepted as genuine.
#+end_quote

When it comes to Harry Potter I use a hierarchy of canon:

1. The Books
2. Cursed Child
3. The Fantastic Beasts Films
4. Pottermore
5. Interviews/Twitter/etc.

In principle, canon is what's declared to be canon by the owner of the IP. I definitely think there's room to say things like "canon is only that which is created in the same medium as the original work with the explicit direction of the original creator".

When I write canon compliant attempts at fics, I use Pottermore details quite a bit... in part because it's what myself everyone else (with next gen and canon compliant tastes) expects as canon but also because it means I don't need to come up with partners and children for the other Weasley siblings. And similarly with Euphemia and Fleamont (although, in this case, I think Dorea and Charlus do not sit comfortably with book only canon /at all/... why would Sirius not mention being related to Harry/James when he points out a very distant relationship with Molly?).

With the question at hand... I think this is like Victor being Chase's name in Runaways. If you're unfamiliar with the property, we spent the better part of 20 years with the knowledge that Chase Stein had an abusive father called Victor that wanted his "jock" son to be smarter (like himself and his wife... who are, to be clear, supervillain mad scientists). Then in the most recent Runaways volume the current writer (something like the fifth creative in control of the canon) revealed that Chase was Chase's middle name the entire time... that his first name is Victor. It's a retcon but it's completely perfect and adds so much to the character without actually contradicting anything.

When we look at Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, we're meant to believe that the main reason why Dumbledore did nothing to fight Grindelwald for all those years was emotional. And, sure, I can see the argument that this is more powerful/poetic than the idea that there was some external force acting on him. However, this doesn't really sit with what we know about Dumbledore. After all, Dumbledore was in a position to help Tom Riddle and, sure, the experience of Tom may have affected how he handled Harry, but we know that Dumbledore /didn't/ help Tom, at all. There should be similar feelings of guilt and shame wrapped up in fighting Voldemort, especially as Dumbledore is clearly complicit in allowing Tom to be known as Voldemort. Similarly, we also see... and maybe this is because of the experience with Gindelwald... that Dumbledore drinks the potion even though its likely effects are obviously bad.

So if we look at this:

#+begin_quote
  I delayed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, and I had to do what I could
#+end_quote

Perhaps the critically important part is "I had to do what I could". It looks like it's just referring to the earlier "evenly matched" type thing but that should be balanced against "oh, not death".

Now, there's every chance they fail to stick the landing, but I think it's going to prove quite important that Crimes of Grindelwald didn't set up an Unbreakable Vow as the basis of the problem. But right now it seems to me that this is taking that "what I could" line and fitting in something that will relate to the shame and emotional baggage.

***** Well, Sirus talks to Harry about how all wizarding families are related but describes Harry as quite distantly related. It seemed to me that if Harry's grandmother (who Sirius had stayed with after he ran away) was actually Sirus' great-aunt then the topic would have come up.

The family tree JKR drew up with '1 son' written on makes sense for it not to be mentioned because the son died and is a faceless dead relative. We can also see that muggle sympathisers were burnt off the tree, Alphard was burned off for giving money to Sirius after he ran away so it seems unlikely Dorea and Charlus' names would still be on there given that they took in Sirius and had different views to the Blacks.

Therefore, it seemed unlikely to me that Dorea and Charlus would be Harry's grandmother.

I have an Elder Wand replica, and pretty long arms, I couldn't do that, I then realized people's forearms are not nearly big enough to carry around average wands comfortably 11-12` much less the longer ones 13-14`.

So I just assume expansion charms, which, are not that much of a big deal actually, Hermione has one in school, Newt had a pocket building in a suitcase( and wasn't rich), we have the tents, so it's safe to assume it's not that hard.

And people like the idea of flicking your wrist and having your wand in hand, like a trick knife.

In the GoF movie, I /think/ Harry had a leg holster for his wand during the second task.

Since I realized that Rowling didn't bother to give them given names (being 'only Muggles' after all) I started using different names in every story... And I've got a plan for a crack story where they get different names in every mention, even within the same conversation.

*** I think I've mentioned this on a different post on this subreddit before, but I have a headcanon (and will die on this hill) that Hermione's mother's name is Helen (because Helen of Troy had a daughter named Hermione, and I just feel like that's something that would be so befitting of Hermione's family if they're anything like her). I've always had this headcanon, but I've only seen it in one fanfic before, so it's not super popular.

******** I suppose it's one of those things that is canon, but unknown to the other characters. Ron calls them the Marauders because of the map, but the map (as far as we know) was broadly a secret. So, it's not canon that there was a group in the '70s called the Marauders.

It would be like writing a WW1 or post-WW1/pre-WW2 story and having the characters talk about WW1. They didn't - they called it The Great War.

** That Cormac McLaggen was actively after Hermione and wanted to (at least) date her. No, that's actually:

- Film canon, especially made to fuel the Romione ship. 🙄

- Mostly fanon on top of film canon, which occasionally gets used to also fuel the Romione ship in even more drama-fuelled ways than the film tried with Romione.

Book!McLaggen (primary canon) hardly even cared that much for Hermione at all. He wasn't passing remarks about pursuing her at the Quidditch tryouts, and her presence at the Slug Club went nearly unnoticed by him. At most, he came asking Harry if the latter had seen Hermione at the Christmas party, when she was actually hiding from him.

Book!canon McLaggen's primary concern was himself and his own massive ego. When 'dating' Hermione at the Christmas party, he was mentioned to have poor manners and spent a lot of time talking about all the great saves (a hundred) that he'd done in Quidditch.

He was like a younger version of Lockhart but with a bit of varying talent and no Memory Charms.

The Viktor Krum drama already felt forced enough in book four and, especially, in the fourth film. But then they just had to go and do that whole McLaggen nonsense on-screen, by turning him from idiotic Quidditch player into I-wanna-get-in-your-pants for Hermione in film six.

Whatever wizards thought about Muggles, there's still the fact that they're objectively superior to them due to having magic abilities. Attempting to organize a society on a foundation that ignores reality is never going to work.

This always looked like pro-Muggle propaganda to me. What if the magic user didn't have their wand or couldn't cast the flame-freezing charm? It's likely that many witches and wizard were victim of witch hunts, but Dumbledore prefers this not to be widely known, lest it increases anti-Muggle feelings.

***** Hm, you bring up valid points, except for the last one iirc "the witches were able to escape the witch trials" actually comes from Harry's books, not Dumbledore, plus older wizards would still pass down what happened if it was as horrific as the trials, since it's good ammo for anti-muggles things, and no one in Dumbledore's generation even mentions the witch trials so it doesn't make much sense for it to a big thing, even so many centuries ago, it would be a big thing to remember if Muggles of all things were putting them in danger, they wouldn't take it lightly (aka the whole fiasco with Grindelwald). Also feel the need to clarify, while Wizards objectively can do much more, it's not just muggles they descriminate towards, giants despite the fact they can have similar or the same powers, are regularly looked done about, I don't think goblins or half goblins are treated much better, and especially not house elves. Humanity's been pretty awful but at least the general population isn't a fan of literal slaves I'd say.

“I have nothing more to say to you, Potter,” he said quietly. “You have irked me too often, for too long. AVADA KEDAVRA!”

Harry had not even opened his mouth to resist; his mind was blank, his wand pointing uselessly at the floor. But the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive, leaping from its plinth to land with a crash on the floor between Harry and Voldemort. The spell merely glanced off its chest as the statue flung out its arms to protect Harry

Many people just assumed those were James' parents, because it fit AND many people(including myself) liked that Harry could be related to Sirius and the rest of the fan-favorite Blacks.

He would also be related to Draco. It would explain his black hair while James had brown hair and Lily red.

BUT then JKR released the Potter Family Tree that listed James' parents as Fleamont and Euphemia, many authors just kept using Charlus and Dorea due to the above mentioned reasons.

One of them is BlackResurgence the author of stories like Stepping Back, Honor Thy Blood, and others that heavily involve the Black family. He kind of combined the canon Family tree and moved the ages up and down a bit and it ended up pretty well IMHO.

I one of my stories I am using a similar family tree with similar ages(canon ages are different, like Bellatrix being the oldest and almost a decade older than Sirius), the difference is Harry(back reincarnated) is Charlus and Dorea's kid while James is Fleamont and Euphemia's making them cousins.
