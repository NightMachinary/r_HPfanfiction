Maybe it was a combination of Ron's envy regarding Harry's wealth and fame, mixed with Harry's envy of Ron's big loving family, mixed with a millenium of ambient magic flowing through Hogwarts, mixed with a certain indecisive mollusc, mixed with who knows what else that caused the swap in the first place; but now they're stuck as each other, with no obvious way to swap back.


** “Bloody hell Ron-how do you even stand up straight with this thing trailing down your leg?”

“Ummm”

“...”

“...I'm gonna get laid!”

“Harry NO-FINE! I'm gonna hook up with Fleur!”

“That snooty french cow!?-know what? You're going to make out with Malfoy!”

“Ron thats nasty! Hope you like crab-cause he's going to be inside you!”

“Well I hope you know how to put your organs back when Flint rearranges them!

“Have fun being Davies latest conquest!”

“The star seeker sleeping with the Beaters isnt going to look good!”

“Ron! They're /your BROTHERS!/”

“Oh right-got caught up in the moment...”

“...We should probably just go to Madam Pomfrey..”

“Yeahhh...”

“Never speak of this conversation again?”

“Agreed.”

*** Something like that, only without the rather extreme Ron bashing. I'd rather he learn the true price of fame, that it's not all it's cracked up to be, and come out the other end a wiser, more mature, more level-headed individual.
