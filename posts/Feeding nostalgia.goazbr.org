Things I know are true:

It was a HP/Avengers crossover Harry gets adopted by Tony Stark Harry creates a ward on all of stark tower at one point that befriends Jarvis

** I've seen several fanfics with Tony adopting Harry, but I can't recall any where he wards the tower.

** Oh, I think I know which one you're talking about! I think Harry was actually Tony's biological child, though, that he didn't know about until he tried to get emancipated or something? It's been awhile, but I remember it being pretty good.

I'll go ahead and look and see if I can find it for you.

#+begin_quote
  Tony Stark. Genius. Billionaire. Philanthropist. Ironman. (Reckless. Lonely. Father.)Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. Wizard. (The Master of Death. Survivor. Breaking.)Tony Stark never thought he would be a father. But when a lawyer comes knocking and truths become evident, he realizes that he can't let his son walk out of his life. For Harry, acknowledging his relationship with Tony is a last-ditch effort to gain freedom and control over his life. Although the journey might not be easy, Tony and Harry learn to heal and become a family, facing trials and tribulations on the way such as a scheming Death, a Mad Titian, Dark Wizards, dangerous Doctors, and living Wards. Minor Peter Parker/Harry Potter. No pairings for Tony. Strong T rating for talk of sensitive subject matter. No explicit sexual content, but an author who uses too much bad language.(Look forward to Runic magic, Quantum Theory, Peter Parker, lots of Marvel villains, and a author who tries too hard.)
