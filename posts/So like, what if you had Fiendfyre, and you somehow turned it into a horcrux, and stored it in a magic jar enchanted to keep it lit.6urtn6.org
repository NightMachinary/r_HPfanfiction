And whenever you wanted to cause some destruction, you'd just open the jar and let the Fiendfyre out to burn things, but because it has a bit of your soul and all the protection spells that come with it, it'd be like an intelligent fire elemental that could zoom around and 'fight' on its own, tactically burning things and attacking goody-wizards with its flamethrowers while you focus on using different spells, and then when all the good-guys are incinerated and the house is burnt down with a dark mark hanging over it, you could call the Fiendfyre back into your magic jar until the next time you wanted to burn things?


** Don't think you could make Fiendfyre into a horcrux. Fiendfyre isn't an object.

*** It's an amorphous fiery stuff made from dark magic? I dunno.

High fantasy settings tend to have fire elementals, even though fire is moreso a chemical reaction than a substance, so couldn't we have a Fiendfyre-elemental living horcrux?

*** Does it? Or is it just extraordinarily effective at destroying magical enchantments?

Hermione said in the books that to destroy a Horcrux means damaging it beyond even magical repair, and basilisk venom counts for this, so maybe Fiendfyre's horcrux-destroying ability merely comes from its 'utterly incinerate stuff' power.

**** This is true... I'm sure if you wanted the Fiendfyre to be used in this way there would be some way to handwave it. Maybe an object which is able to produce Fiendfyre has the soul inside?

** Interesting idea, but I have an inkling the part of soul in the Fiendfyre may not let itself be bottled up at the main Voldemort's whim, and could try to go /King and the Mockingbird/ on him.

Personally, I thought the promise of being stored and getting to incinerate stuff later, instead of extinguishing after burning everything flammable in the area, would've been enough of an incentive for Fiendfyre to behave...

**** Well, it wouldn't be Fiendfyre with heightened I.Q., it would be a mind-clone of Voldemort placed in a body of Fiendfyre.

(Yes, in retrospect that reference was +a bit+ obscure. /The King and the Mockingbird/ is a 1980 animated film. Long story short, it's established early on that works of arts talk among themselves when no one's looking ala /Toy Story/, except a recent painting of the titular King decides to climb out of its painting, murder the real King, and take his place. No one's the wiser, and, because the King had insisted his portrait be an idealised version of himself that didn't share his flaws, the Portrait!King is much more cunning and therefore dangerous than his predecessor.)

...Okay, has anyone ever done /that/ in a Harry Potter fanfic? A painted doppelganger, or a mirror's-image doppelganger, or something like that?

The closest I can think of is that one fic with the Weeping Angel getting itself into Hogwarts via a boggart turning into it, and one (The Mysterious Case of Sally-Anne Perks, I think it's called) where Ariana Dumbledore comes out of the Mirror of Erised.

** Fiendfyre isn't a solid, material object, and is already known to be able to destroy horcruxes. If Fiendfyre can effortlessly destroy horcruxes, then a normal jar spelled with an unbreakable charm wouldn't stand a chance.

** the fire needs to be controlled constantly and i'm not sure how you'd make a jar immune to the stuff. what would happen if it tried to burn something with basilisk venom.?
