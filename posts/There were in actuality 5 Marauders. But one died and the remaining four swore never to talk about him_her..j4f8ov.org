** What is this? Crappy/lazy prompts week?

Ok, who was this fifth Marauder? How did he/she die? Why would the other Marauders swear to never talk about him/her?

The OP is just adding a new character just because. Hence, those questions are important.

****** "What if Harry also had a third best friend after Ron and Hermione?"

"What if instead of a Triwizard Tournament, it was Quadwizard Tournament?"

You see a problem here? Just adding something without any reasoning why is not a prompt. It's a pointless detail.
