  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** My first exposure to this type was Harry Potter and the Cursed Summer and I loved it because it is a more reasonable start to an independent!Harry universe. Then there is also Dragon Chronicles 2: Harry Potter, Dragon Whisperer (you'll need to read the setup known as DC1 to understand the backstory as to how he got there). Both of these are my favorites, with DC2 being in progress with fairly regular updates.

  Being a parselmouth, Harry is hired by all of the Dragon Sanctuaries. His new job: to travel the world, check on all the dragons, talk to them and learn about them. The dragons have also heard of Harry's talent - as an artist and they can be pushy about having their portrait painted. With dragons, magizoologists and shades of Dark Lords after him, Harry's life is anything but dull.
