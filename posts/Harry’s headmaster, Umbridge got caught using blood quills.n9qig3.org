:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The blood/black quills (I don't know which it is I've seen both) I swear they like, affected peoples magic when they were used, So like, a whole bunch or students had to be in Madame pomfreys care for a little while (I think one student died? Maybe it was a different fic idk). Uhh Umbridge gets like put in a cell thingy on Hogwarts grounds I think

And hardy become headmaster?

I've been looking for the fic for ages but I can't find it, I don't even know if it exists anymore or if it ever did and I'm just making stuff up üòÖ

  One strange spell. That's all it took to alter the course of Harry's life - and everyone else's life around him. Bound to stay within ten feet of each other, Harry Potter and Severus Snape have to learn to get along or die trying. But in the hardest of times, one can learn things never imagined possible. After all, the past doesn't define the future. Mentor/Guardian Snape

**** There's another fic out there with this plot? Strange. It's so specific... Unless one fic was inspired by the other.
