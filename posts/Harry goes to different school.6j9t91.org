Looking for a Harry Potter that goes to a different school than Hogwarts. I remember reading a fanfic where he was raised by Sirius and Remus and went to a school called Merlin Academy or something.

It'd be nice if he learnt magic BEFORE going to the school.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

**** I sincerely hope that was sarcasm. I read it a while ago, and it's quite possibly the worst fanfic I've had the misjudgment of finishing. (Granted, it has more plot and conflict than most HHr fluff, but that's a very, very low bar.)

***** Yeah. The amount of reviews a fanfic gets in no way correlates to how good it is. Case in point: Rorshach's Blot and his hundreds of thousands of plotless, conflictless words on the first page of the 'most favourites' tab for HP fanfiction on FFN. I guess some people still like that kind of stuff, which is fine, but it doesn't mean it's a well-nailed-together fic.

****** Yeah exactly. I'm not going to judge someone for liking trash (God knows, I'm enjoying a crappy fic right now), but writing is certainly not 'in the eye of the beholder'. You can objectively discern great from good from bad storytelling -- and most of the FFN's 'most favourited' fall squarely into the last.

** I can't believe no one has mentioned Miranda Flairgold. While it isn't perfect, nor professional quality, the sheer scope and vision of it make it well worth the read. 3 parts, 3rd unfinished and abandoned at this point, however it still stands as one of the first and better significant AU's.

  After his second year, Harry begins to realize Hogwarts isn't everything it could be. Are there other options available? While the Hogwarts characters belong to JK Rowling, the story is obviously outside of canon.

  What if in Book 2 Dobby worked smarter and not harder? Inspired by a reddit prompt. Many thanks to my beta ekb1circloud, who has also contributed a few passages of content as well, I believe that makes him a co-author. I read an entertaining guest review, that made me realize that I have to specify this is an AU.
