*** Agreed! I was really disappointed to see that [[/u/FloreatCastellum]] didn't start off the discussion. I always find it fascinating to see which of an author's 'children' they like the best.

Mine is probably Under the Southern Cross as I really don't care for H/G.

** I'm tempted to say it's my amazingly terribly awesome blogfic I wrote 8 years ago, which had vampires, swordsmanship and griffons, but since this is now archived as a hard copy in a secret vault below the Kremlin only for my bestest friends to ever read, I'll go with my current WIP, Lesser Evils.

It started out as a terrible challenge fic and went through two more meh iterations before becoming what it is now. I'm really quite proud of myself for coming up with some of the stuff in it and if you tell me any other fanfic did a better job of fleshing out a minor canon character, I'll stick fingers in my ears and sing Hakuna Matata at the top of my lungs.

** I have a story called "Ruby Rose and the Delicate Art of Tribadism" which is the best story ever and the epitome of RWBY fanfiction.

** It's hard to decide, really. I've got so many tie ins, but it's hard to separate them all into individual stories. The most viewed one of my fics isn't even really in the same universe as the others, but A Glance Askance is the series I'm working on, and my favorite out of that would be [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/5094914][Odorless.]] /since it's the only one complete.../

But when I get it shoved out; my personal favorite is titled Wizarding Vacation: Ibiza. But again, with all the tie ins, it's hard to keep plots moving!

** I only have 2 one shot fanfics, one is a fluffy one shot of Ron and Draco as drunken friends post war. The other is a total 180 on the feel good of the first story. They're not connected, but in my other one Harry was taken prisoner for a time during the war and given the Dark Mark, and now post war he is haunted by it. They are both very short i.e. less than 1000 words.

I'm a fan of darker, more psychological stories so I probably prefer the second one. But if anyone wants to read either.

Drinking with Death, the light hearted fic: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10910721/1/Drinking-With-Death]]

Painful Reminder, the darker one: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11697368/1/Painful-Reminder]]

** Well... I'm most proud of my novel that I'm currently writing.

But as this is hpff, I guess it would be linkffn(The Bloodmoon Rises)

I do like it a lot and I like whats coming. Its unpolished, not triple-edited like my novel, the plotline is literally written on an scrap of paper and well... its fanfiction. But I do think it is at least fairly entertaining and by far not the worst FFN has to offer.

  Voldemort had not only sent his Death Eaters to the Ministry, but vampires as well. Hermione and Harry fall to them and find themselves in new, undead lives. While Harry struggles to remain human, Hermione becomes what was believed dead long ago. She becomes a Countess, an heir to Dracula. Unfortunatly, there are no books on that. Vampire!Hermione/Harry, Dark!Hermione Dark!Harry

** I haven't written much HP fic (or any fic really), but I did a Remus/Sirius one shot called "You Don't Have to Ask That" that turned out pretty much like I wanted it. Just a quiet night at Grimmauld Place in which Remus and Sirius have a cup of tea and a small talk.

** Some time ago, my keyboard puked all over the screen due to over-exertion (I was updating Untitled Tome twice a month at the time - it didn't last), and Harry Potter and the Fruits of Ennui was the result. It was scarcely proofread or polished and received marginal attention, but the few reviews I did get called it funny. Like "ha-ha" funny.

It had a profound effect on my self-esteem for a week or so, before I wanted to set fire to the keyboard for not typing the right words again.
