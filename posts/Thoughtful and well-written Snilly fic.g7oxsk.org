I was so very surprised to find a Snape Lilly fic that caught my attention! Severus Snape And The Art Of War. It's a complete work, Marauders era, and definitely qualifies as a slow burn - the author gave the characters time to grow up. I won't spoil the ending for you, but it's definitely worth your time!

  After his death, Severus makes the decision to return to the world of the living, starting in the summer of 1975. With his adult knowledge on the upcoming war hidden inside his 15 year old body, he finds his way back to Lily, and his new position in the wizarding world.[Story related warnings can be seen on the first page. NO character bashing!]

  Three years after Voldemort visited Godric's Hollow, Lily now lives under the protection of loyal Death Eater Severus Snape in a world ruled by the Dark Lord's conquest. But the Order of the Phoenix is not completely eradicated, and two names are beginning to return to her: Harry and James.
