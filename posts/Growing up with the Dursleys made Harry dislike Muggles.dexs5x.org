The Durselys abused him, no one in the community helped him even though they saw how he was dressed compared to Dudley, and how Petunia and Vernon talked about him.

So he agrees with the idea that Muggles are dangerous for magical people and that they should be separated.

Maybe he goes to Hogwarts and sees how Dumbledore panders to muggle traditions at the cost of Wizzarding traditions.

Everything else can be changed. Harry can be the boy who lived or not. He can end up in Gryffindor or any of the other houses. He can end up light, grey, or dark.


** I've long been interested in reading a fic with the idea of a dark or grey Harry who's views are more in line with Grindlewald or Magneto from X- Men. A Harry who is a magical supremacist, but not a blood purist. As with his background with the Dursleys, this could have easily been a path he could have gone down.

If he was a blood purist he would never have befriended her before Hogwarts, and wouldn't have remained her friend for several years at Hogwarts. He was angry and embarrassed, and when people are highly emotional they do and say awful things that they don't really mean. That he didn't mean it is clear because he repeatedly apologized, and it was one of his worst memories.

******* I see the Death Eaters as being a bit like the SS. Plenty of foolish and impressionable young men were sucked in to that not because they were True Believers to the heart of their being, but because they were fooled by grand oratory and a good looking uniform. They often had a superficial belief, but that didn't last. Plenty of them realised how horrible it was but by that time it was too late. They *had to* obey orders and do hideous things, because the alternative was execution. I see Snape as being like that - suckered in under false pretences, and by the time he realised what he had signed up for it was too late. He then went with the flow until that one intolerable thing happened and he turned spy.

It is common for naive youngsters to get sucked in to extremist groups without having a complete grasp of their ideology and aims.

As for Sectumsempra - it was created "for enemies" IIRC while he was at school. Who were his enemies then? Those bullying shits the Marauders. Yes, he later used it while in the Death Eaters, but that just brings us back to him acting under duress like those suckered into joining the SS.

******* Yeah, Harry went to primary school for what? 5 or 6 years? He was out in the public enough, and he's not so damaged that he doesn't know how to socialize, he just really couldn't make lasting friends due to all the bullying. He's good at being a fly-on-the-wall type person, because he had to be growing up, and he'd be able to observe and reflect. Harry strikes me as pretty emotionally intelligent: he recognizes Draco as a bully straight away, even without knowing all the pronouns in play.

That's not to say Harry couldn't or wouldn't be biased in some way, but he's got enough intelligence to recognize that the Dursleys are not your average muggle family.

Not all psychopaths are killers, in fact very few are. It's the ones who have been traumatized that become predators due to the fact that they are physically incapable of processing the emotions required to deal with that. It's when a shitty set of circumstances are added together that create some terrible results. That being said, it is only a incredibly simple overview of the neurological issues in a psychopaths brain. What i'm trying to say is that there are cases where it creates a hatred towards certain people, characteristics ect ect. It's just important to understand that not all killers are psychopaths and not all psychopaths are killers.

******** Yes and no, you have to have the genetical faults inside the brain to be classed as a psychopath. Certain areas of your brain which mainly deal with emotions is what is generally effected. Now in saying that, there is the debate of your Nature vs Nurture which is effectively your biological make up vs the environment that you have grown up in. In the case of a psychopath, it is most definitely both. There is the neurological make up which leads to the lack of empathy, but then the environment which that child grows up in has the effect of choosing whether that psychopathic child is a killer or a law abiding citizen. This is a very general rule, you don't have to be a psychopath to be a monster, and you don't have to be a monster to be a psychopath. In my opinion, tom is a psychopath who's living environment changed him into a monster. It really all comes down to the debate if whether our genetics dictate how we act as humans or whether it is our environment. My personal option is that it is a mixture of both your environment and genetic make up which dictate that way we behave in society.

The strongest factors included having a convicted parent, being physically neglected, low involvement of the father with the boy, low family income, and coming from a disrupted family. Other significant factors included poor supervision, harsh discipline, large family size, delinquent sibling, young mother, depressed mother, low social class, and poor housing.

***** At the core of Harry's personality is his dislike of bullies, and Harry recognizes Draco as a bully almost right away. If Ron had been spouting off about "those kinds of people" instead of wide-eyed enthusiasm and voracious Quidditch fanboyism, Harry likely wouldn't have liked Ron, either.

  Dumbledore was sure he had made the right choice. Ten years later Harry shows him just how wrong he was. With little regard for most, Harry makes a name for himself at Hogwarts, and shows everyone that he is far more than just the BWL. In doing that he attracts the attention of the Dark Lord, making Voldemort believe that the Boy-Who-Lived could be far more than an enemy.

** There are lots like this, and they don't make sense. The defining characteristic of Harry Potter is his inherent morality. A person with functioning morality would not perpetuate a prejudice. It's not a matter of being brainwashed into loving muggles by Dumbledore and the Weasleys.

His boundless compassion is not a product of manipulation. It's innate. It's the thing that makes him different from Tom Riddle and Snape. The only prejudice he seems to have absorbed is against Slytherin, and even that falls through when push comes to shove. He hates Snape, but sympathetises with him against his dead father who he reveres when he finds out that Snape was bullied. He suspects Draco of being a murdering death eater, but his first impulse upon finding him crying in a bathroom is to reach out, until Draco raised his wand to cast an unforgivable.

Harry Potter does not have the kind of sustained hate or even apathy in him that any kind of bigotry or prejudice would require, especially when he has targets other than the group of people his parents died fighting for to blame for his fate.
