** Hearing the horrible pun from Ron Harry tilted his head in thought after a second.

"Wait, you mean Malfoy buys articles from the prophet!? That's why they are always so slanted against me and muggleborns?"

"Well yeah mate, of course they are, they're a business so of course you buy things from them, like articles in the paper."

Harry narrowed his eyes in thought, he had some owls to send off.

OOOOOOOOOOOOO

The Potters were not rich as god or anything though they were rather wealthy. So when Harry had gotten an accounting of his full wealth he had smiled when he thought of the amount he had. Comparing it to the prices he had gotten from the owners of the various wizarding publications he smiled even more.

**** Thanks, glad you enjoyed it. That's the format I use when second stage outlining a story. I write out key points to get a feel for how the story will go. More lite hearted, darker, violent, funny, etc... Through writing out condensed forms of major scenes it helps me see how it would go.

From there its connecting all the points with story between and filling out those condensed scenes.
