So, Hagrid went to school with Tom Riddle, which if I remember correctly was before James and Lily. So Hagrid is older than James and Lily, but how old is he exactly?


** Hagrid is Eternal.

...

When Harry gets his letter on his 11th birthday, Hagrid was 62 (since his birthday that year had yet to occur).

** Hagrid was expelled during his third year at Hogwarts, while Tom Riddle was a prefect at the time, if I remember that correctly, so he'd have been at least a fifth year. Since Tom Riddle was born in 1926, that would make Hagrid's birth year around 1928. In comparison, James and Lily Potter were both born in 1960, so they were around 32 years younger.

** This always confused me. Why she set the events of Hagrid's expulsion 50 YEARS in the past from the events of COS. I mean, Hagrid's part giant, so it's totally possible that he looks great for being 62! And Voldemort is barely a person at this time so he gets that as an excuse. But Slughorn teaches Tom Riddle as a child? How old is he during HBP? 80???

*** Remember that in HP canon, it's not unusual for wizards to live long lives.

And factor in the effect potions might have as well.

Slughorn is a potions master, and from Snape's speech, you can stopper death. It's possible that Slughorn has altered his physical appearance or age.

******** Not really. Griselda could be as "young" as, say, 125 years. The only frame of reference we have of her is a quote that says she was the examiner for Dumbledore's Transfiguration and Charm N.E.W.T.s back in the day. There's nothing that says she had to be old to get that position, it's not impossible that she was a new hire in the ministry education department.

There is definitely some conflicting information about Dumbledore's age, because Rowling once said (in a 2000 interview) that he was about 150 years old. Several years later, in the last book of the series, references place his year of birth in or around 1881. This sounds a lot more reliable to me than her random ramblings and makes Dumbledore around 115 years old at the time of his death.

I have two things to say about the age wizards can live to. The long life expectancy is probably not the rule, but witches and wizards certainly have the potential to live long lives and be active even as a centenarian. On the other hand, there are plenty of Black family members that only lived some 50 to 80 years. The movies showed a newspaper that mentioned the so-called /Ministry of Divine Health/, which named the wizarding life-expectancy at 137.25 years. I would certainly not call that canon, but they went to some thought and effort into making this ([[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/File:DailyProphetMakingOfHP1.jpg][source]]). Edit: I don't think this was ever seen in any movie, but the screenshot was taken from a making-of bonus feature.

********** Hmm, I have to correct myself, it appears. When I went and re-read chapter 18 of /Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows/ to look for the reference I thought was there, only relative and not absolute numbers were to be found.

I did some more research on the 'net and couldn't find any other information about the 1881 birth-date than [[http://web.archive.org/web/20070911000516/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/wotm.cfm][this reference]] on Rowling's webpage from September 2007. It's as much or as little canon as the '150 years' quote from seven years earlier :(

Unless there is some information I'm not aware of (like the mention of an age, ie of Grindelwald at a known point in time like at his defeat in 1945, the age of Dumbledore's school chum Elphias Doge, etc), then you can really pick and choose between either age.

Edit: it appears pretty clear, that all of those year numbers in both official and unofficial sources like the wikia wiki are based on the assumption that Dumbledore was born in 1881. If you want him to be 150 years old, you also change many other dates, like when his mother died, when his father went to prison, when Ariana died, when Grindelwald was born, etc.

******** If not close. You figured Dumbledore is about 150 when he dies. So if we take it back to when he's 17. If we said she was a minimum of even 30 or 40 when she administered his test that would make her at a minimum 170 something 180 something. I say that is a minimum because I can't remember how that the scene is described in the book but I thought they were some younger people who gave the test as well as obviously the older people. If you take into account though that they are all older than you probably at least 200

************** Let me state it this way. Unless JK publishes a book stating the age of Dumbledore then i can pick whatever number i want. Because until its in written published form, BY DEFINITION OF THE TERM CANON its not canon. Its taken as canon. Pottermore is as close to a new work as we get so we label as canon. But if i was using the term for a paper that i was going to publish, the term canon will only refer to that which is written published and sold. There are way too many inconsistencies any other way.

That being said, the interview coming directly from JK is more canon than even Pottermore. We dont know who publishes on Pottermore, and we dont know if JK has to approve it. However as stated above we dont seem to give a fuck about if someone posts there that isnt JK. We just take it as word of god which it clearly isnt.

*************** JK Rowling is the founder and owner of Pottermore. Regardless of whether or not she actually writes the words, the contents of Pottermore exist through her approval and are canon and trumped only by the books themselves. Robert Jordan did not write the last three books of the Wheel of Time, but that doesn't mean they aren't canon to that series. I don't care what definition of canon you like to use, canon just means that it's officially part of the story's universe. Beyond that, Pottermore is published. Just because they're not charging or collecting it into novel form doesn't mean it's not written and published online. Until Rowling either writes another book in which it states that Dumbledore was born on a year other than 1881 or she changes the information on Pottermore, Dumbledore's canon birthday was in 1881.
