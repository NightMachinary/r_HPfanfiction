** /Some necessary information, and then, comments on the story itself/:

- Pairings: None so far, and that's not the focus.
- Rating: Hard T.
- Genre: Adventure/angst.
- Summary: A reckless escapade changes Draco's life forever and not for the better. Who else can he trust with his secret if he cannot even trust himself? Set during OoTP and featuring werewolf!Draco.
- Updates: This was started in 2008 and presumably has been revived this year. Updates are slow and sporadic, but the writing more than makes up for it in my book.
- Chapters/words: 7 / 26k

/Why should you read this?/

First all of all - I've never read anything quite like this. Most creature!fic featuring Draco is either HD slash focusing on romance and its subsequent soap opera. The relationships mimic canon beautifully. Second of all, the writing is fantastic. It gets even better as the story goes on. There's no dry, clunky prose and not once have I encountered a dull paragraph. The author clearly knows what they're doing.

Another point is how in-character Draco is, and how big of a horror turning into a so-called half-breed is for someone from a pureblood family like him. The story's interpretation of wizarding culture and its reaction to werewolves is all at once hilarious and pathetic.

This story is very much a dark comedy, or at least has its share of moments. There is a murder most foul in one chapter, a suicide attempt in another, and a lovely/sad dissection of werewolves in the HP universe.

I encourage you to give this story a try, and this is my attempt at giving the author some attention that he/she direly deserves for the efforts. So thanks, and happy reading.
