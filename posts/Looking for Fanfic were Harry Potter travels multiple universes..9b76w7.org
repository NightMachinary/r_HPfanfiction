  In deference to The Professional and his wonderful stories. Harry has lost everything; a failed attempt to fix his mistakes leaves him as the Lone Traveller, a part of Wizarding legend. This is "Complete" because the length is getting unwieldy. I stopped at a good point. The sequel is up.

  All his life, Harry Potter had heard voices inside his head. He never expected to learn that the voices were his own. Five different Harry Potters, from five different worlds, must work together to survive life, school, and the second war.
