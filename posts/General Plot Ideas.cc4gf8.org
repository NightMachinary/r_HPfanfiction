Below, some of my thoughts on a half formed story (built along with previous lectures and homework assignments I have posted). Any thoughts, suggestions, requests, or ideas welcome! I would sort of like to write this story or collaborate with someone else to write it, but i am not sure what all it will cover or how long it will be yet.

_________^

In an AU where Tom Marvolo Riddle was adopted by a loving muggle couple when he was still an infant, he grows up slightly changed. Still brilliant and powerful, but now with just enough of a moral compass to steer him away from tearing apart his soul. Many years later, Harry Potter, the gifted but otherwise ordinary son of an Auror and a Muggle Studies professor comes to Hogwarts.

Three story lines weave together, one following Harry and his friends through their daily life at Hogwarts, lectures, homework, relationships, and detentions. One following Holly Jasmine Potter (Harry's younger sister) and her friends. The third following Tom Riddle as he balance work, research, and helping out a global secret organization dedicated to protecting the world from its greatest threat. Herpo the Foul.

Nicolas and Perenell Flamel are the latest in a long line of Alchemists to head a secret organization, recruiting the greatest minds across the world to combat Herpo's ambitions for immortality and destruction in a shadow war that has lasted 5000 years. They recruit a very reluctant Tom Riddle, who is already busy as a teacher of two subjects, head of Slytherin house, and now mentor to his first ever apprentice, Harry Potter. Tom Riddle, unknown to the Flamel's, has far more of an edge against Herpo than anyone else, as he found the man's Grimoir in the Chamber of Secrets when he was a teenager, the magic book granting him all of the dark wizards knowledge up to the point it was made 1000 years ago.

Harry grew up as close friends with Neville and Daphne, and friendly acquaintances with the Weasley family and the Lovegood family. On the train, they also meet Hermione Granger.

Holly (Hufflepuff), Astori (Slytherin), Ginny (Gryffindor), and Luna (Ravenclaw) follow a year behind, representing the four houses and getting in to far more trouble than their older siblings and friends.

Pairings

Harry - Daphne Hermione - Theodore Neville - Tracey Ron - Lavender

Ginny - Draco Holly - Astoria

Riddle - OC

Teachers Defence - Tom Riddle Muggle - Lily Potter Care - Remus Lupin

Notes: Tom Riddle teaches an elective course called Magical Theory only for 6th and 7th year Defence students. Tom mastered a form of magical self-preservation which allows him to keep his body much younger than normal, looking only in his late 20's even as a teacher in his 70's. Once he joins the Flamel's, they allow him access to the Elixer of Life which restores his youth fully, making him much stronger and more energetic.

OC - Allison Roxanne Donovan, muggle born, member of Flamel's organization, believed to be a squib. Tom later finds that she has a magical parasite that prevents her from doing more than seeing the magical world. Once he removes the parasite, he begins training her in magic. Romance later on.

Herpo's goal is to become immortal and rule over the entire world until he is ready to pass on. He created the Basilisk as one method of destroying Horcruxes, but also continued working on better ways to safeguard his immortality and raise an unstoppable army. One of Herpo's goals is to acquire the Philosopher's Stone, and another is to take Hogwarts Castle for his own, using it's natural magic as a foundation for new dark creatures like the Dementors.

A major battle will occur between Flamel's group and Herpo at Hogwarts, in which Tom and his apprentice Harry, along side the Flamels and Dumbledore, defend the castle against Herpo and an army of Infiri and Dementors.

Grindlewald to make an appearance as a reformed wizard, against Dumbledore's wishes.

Nicolas Flamel and Albus Dumbledore have several disagreements, mostly from an idealogical difference. Nicolas believes that defeating Herpo is too critical and too necessary to handicap themselves with morals if it raises their risk of loss by even a fraction. Dumbledore believes that the means a person uses are every bit as important as the ends achieved. Dumbledore does not agree with Tom Riddle being involved, much less Grindlewald.

Drama between Harry, Holly, Daphne, and Astoria due to a love letter between Holly and Astoria signed with her initials which she shares with her brother. Daphne finds the letter.

Bellatrix had a major crush on Tom when she was in school, and comes back as a ln assistant to his class a few times while he is away with the Flamel's. Nymphadora Tonks was his best student in her year an also helps out when she can.

At some point about 400 years ago, Herpo put himself into stasis in Peru to wait on a specific set of conditions. Myrtle Warren, 70 odd years old, fancies herself the magical Lara Croft, goes an an unauthorized trip into Incan ruins and breaks the seal, setting Herpo free early.
