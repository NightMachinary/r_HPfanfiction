:END:
Here's what I remember:

-James was abusive -Lily read bedtime stories in parseltongue -Harry's first words were in parseltongue -Tom Riddle was Harry's legal guardian -Lily committed “suicide by Voldemort” -Wormtail had memories to share with Harry -Sirius made an unbreakable vow not to mention that Harry's parents were considering a divorce -Lily's mother's maiden name was Gaunt


** All of that is from [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8163784/1/The-Well-Groomed-Mind][The Well Groomed Mind]] except that Harry doesn't really 'join' the dark; he commits to not taking part in the conflict.
