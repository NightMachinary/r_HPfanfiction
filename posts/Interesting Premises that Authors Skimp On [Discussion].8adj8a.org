I got a review on my HP fic the other day after I released its 3rd chapter about how I've focused on the premise of the story too much. They took slight issue with me not skipping over the details through the use of time skips and flashbacks to provide the information.

This made think of how prevalent their suggestion has been in the HP fanfics I've read. The story has an interesting, unique or seldom used premise that piques my interest, but I don't really get the satisfaction of seeing the character go through the events in a way that doesn't make the conclusion feel too foregone.

Time skips and flashbacks have their place of course, but (not going to name any stories) do you feel there's a tendency to hook the reader and then use these as a way of skipping out on having to let events play out and get to the bits the author cares about? What stories cover these changes well? Any examples that particularly annoyed you?


** I think it's not so much "what the author cares about" as it is how much people (here and on fanfiction.net) seem to hate "canon rehashes". Type for "Stations of Canon" or "rehash" in the search bar of this sub, and you'll find a hundred people protesting that they do not want to "hear about The Troll Incident for the 3748th time", and that if you find it inevitable to feature The Troll Incident in your AU, you should just skip it and tell us, post-time-skip, what few details differed from the canon version.

That is not a sentiment I at all agree with; I loathe stories that begin in third year, add a flashback to first-year two chapters in, jump forward to sixth year at chapter ten, then have the characters time-travel back to fourth year... It's done to seem clever and innovative but just gives your reader a headache and prevent immersion into this new timeline. There's a reason the canon books didn't start with /Deathly Hallows/, then flashback to /Order of the Phoenix/ and convey the events of /Philosopher's Stone/ through a series of out-of-order Pensieve dips.

*** Yes, but there needs to be a balance. I'm fine with the troll incident. Or with Harry duelling Draco in CoS. Or with Harry going shopping in Diagon Alley after receiving his letter. Or with the challenges of PS, and even with Ron getting KO'd there.

I'm not fine with *all* of these happening. Rehashing some events from canon, but if your story only ever differs from canon in some minor additional details then I start to feel cheated, and the author should consider doing it "Iris Potter", "A long journey home" or "The life he leads" style. All of the stories have a lot of "canon, but"-stuff happening /before/ the story starts.

For example accidental Animagus does this badly. I'm just skimming through it, but here are some examples:

- Ron enters the compartment because "All the others are full"
- Harry shoots down Malfoys "some families..." offer
- Same sperch by Dumbldore pre-sorting
- Snape is the exact same dick
- Harry gets on the Quidditch team via the remeberall, and draco snatches it from Neville, who hurt himself. Same thing as canon, only on the ground.
- Draco tries the duel
- Hagrid gives away Flamel via "thing between NF and Dumbledore"
- Harry's broom gets jinxed during his fist match, Hermione thinks it's Snape (but does nothing), and Haary catches the snitch.
- ...
- It goes like this all the way until it's revealed that Harry is a parselmouth in a duel against Malfoy initiated by Snape and Lockard when Malfoy summoned a snake. (I stopped reading threre)

This makes this story feel so /incredibly/ low-stakes and boring, because nothing the characters do /matters/. Sure, Sirius is free, but it changes nothing but some fluff anyways. I'm not saying flashbacks would have helped here, but the alternative isn't good either.

**** Yep, that the sort of thing annoys me as well. I suppose that's why my AU fic changed so much from canon. Once I could really see how much would have to change once things like Harry running away, him living on the streets and Lucius having really been Imperiused into being a Death Eater (etc.) happened, it felt pretty freeing. Canon events are okay and all I guess, but it's just more interesting to write things in a way where everything isn't slavishly ticking off a checklist of events.

***** I just felt like like nothing matters, and that is something I dislike in fics.

And I was in 200'000 words or so, because people kept recommending it. That is PS, CoS and a good chunk of PoA of a story that I didn't really enjoy.

If you can't capture me in approx. 2.5 books, I don't feel like it's my fault because I invested to little. It might be that my taste is bad, but I gave you like 17hrs of an average reader's reading time (maybe 7-9 hours of my time), that is quite a lot.

*** I don't really mean skipping canon stuff that's often rehashed (I agree it's such a boring thing to do). I mean something like this (random example):

Story premise: "Time-travelling Merlin raises Harry". Ch. 1 consists of Merlin taking Harry... and then in the next chapter the story jumps ahead like ten years to Hogwarts. Or "Harry is raised by goblins" but then we skip from them taking him in to him getting on the train.

If the premise hooked me I'd be pissed since Hogwarts is nearly always a forgone conclusion, the interesting bit for me is how things are different leading up to it. Having all those details told after the fact often kills my interest immediately since the difference-maker has already come and gone.

See, for the author in both of these examples, the true premise of the fic is likely "powerful Harry at Hogwarts". Merlin and goblins are merely plot devices - a means to an end.

**** Honestly, stories which put a lot of emphasis on pre Hogwarts stuff are generally bad, either because they are mind-bogglingly boring or totally unrealistic, even in a world with magic. A 7 year old will not be doing much interesting stuff, especially if he is raised by responsible adults. Maybe the adults do interesting stuff, but certainly not the kids, unless you want them ridiculously overpowered.

**** But oftentimes it's better to see effect of that, I've read too many fanfics of the "somehting was different about how Harry was raised" genre that were stuck for many, many words in pre-Hogwarts where nothing significant happens.

An important element of my forever-stuck-in-planning-phase fic is how the changes I made influenced the situation Harry was raised and how that affected Harry going forward. But I will only have one chapter showing Harry's home life and his environment before he goes to Hogwarts. Because showing it would ruin pacing, and took away the impact of some scenes.

***** Most such stories I see just change who raised him and spend basically no time exploring what exactly was different and why that changed things. Most often I see a direct progression to Hogwarts. It's not that I want stories to belabor unimportant pre-Hogwarts stuff, but to give it at least some focus beyond vaguely mentioning it was different.

Like my situation is a bit different since the intervening years directly influence Harry's perception of the world, his attitude towards magic and what he wants to do in life, so it made sense in my head to spend a few chapters on the plot development in this section so I can try to make sense of why things aren't the same as in canon. This obviously isn't necessary for every story.

As I said in the OP, time skips and flashbacks shouldn't be dismissed, they have their use. I just wonder if the way a lot of people use them in this case amounts to little more than merging all these stories into an amorphous blob where the true premise is actually different than what you would assume going in (an excuse for Powerful!Harry)

****** As much as Harry Crow is a bad fic, it actually explored how the goblin culture shaped Harry. The goblin culture might've been badly thought out, but its influence was visible there.

It didn't go for showing us upfront Harry's living in goblin society and that was a good choice. By getting to "fun stuff" quicker it was actually bearable in contrast to another crappy and cliche fic about Harry being adopted by goblins - Vault of Stones which wasted a lot of time on presenting us the background of goblin (and dwarven) society before the plot even really started.

I'm currently reading too much stuff anyway, so I haven't checked your fic, thus I will get back to my eternally-planned-fic as an example.

The main divergence is that Susan Bones' was born at the end of July so Voldemort targets her (I thought of the idea when I was annoyed at yet another fic writer thinking that Bones in the Order were Susan's parents). This (along with some smaller changes to the story and bigger changes to the setting) results in a completely different situation for Harry.

His parents are pretty well known with James taking Quidditch carrier and Lily becoming researcher, he is friends with the Surviving Susan, father of his other close friend - Neville is the Minister for Magic. Dumbledore visits their house from time to time.

This situation creates a pressure for Harry, he feels that he have to match those around him. He feels that he has to achieve something - the quicker, the better. He is annoyed when he is mentioned just as Susan's friend or son of his parents. He wants to be noticed for who he is. Both this and being raised in normal family shape him significantly. He is not the same person as the canon Harry, because his circumstances were completely different.

But I won't have a million of scenes of Harry growing up. The action proper will start at the beginning of the August 1991 and then almost immediately jump to the beginning of the school year. To focus on those would kill pacing (which will be already strained because muh infodumps on magic).

It's because the fic is about Harry who isn't the famous hero but wants to be one (in contrast to canon) trying to rise to that position (ok, the fic is actually about my worldbuilding ideas). Not about how he got to the stage where he wants to attempt that. Not about how Susan a Girl-Who-Lived changed Britain. That can be gleaned from the introductory scene and later information. It's the secondary element, a background. Harry isn't even the character whose circumstances changed the most, but there won't be a 100k words about how butterflies from my changes caused characters lives to derail heavily as a result of Susan being the chosen hero.

Let me give a comparison that is in part unfair, but in another part it's the best comparison I can think of. In HP cano, we get to /see/ some of Harry's childhood. JKR didn't go into excessive detail, some of it was just told via narration. But we nonetheless get to see just /how/ the Dursleys treated Harry. The (or /a/) problem with Harry Crow, for me, was that we don't see a thing, we only see the end of result of how their relationship ends up. Well, confession time, I dropped the story within a few chapters. But that aside, Harry Crow jumps from "goblins get Harry" to "Harry's going to Hogwarts". It failed to do any exploration of the dramatics of Harry's childhood that established how he interacted with the goblins, it served it all up in brief mentions afterwards.

As I said, I'm against belaboring unnecessary detail. Over exploration, wasting time, shouldn't be done. The WIP story you mentioned doesn't seem very ripe for pre-Hogwarts stuff; from the way you described it it seems like his development would almost /have/ to occur near school time. So I don't think it's an example of skipping over an interesting premise in the way that I was thinking of. The premise sounds interesting and wouldn't make sense if you ended up skipping over how Harry goes about making a name for himself. Then it would be an example of what I'm thinking about.

It heavily expanded on those mentions later on, which is probably why our perception of the matter was different.

And after the second part of your post I'm sort of at loss when it comes to what can be really seen as the example of skipping on the premise. I will probably have to take the look at that fic of yours.

** I'm so glad I found this sub, and honestly this is a thing I've noticed in a lot of fics. I feel like there are two kinds of AU fics: the kind that just wants to see how things would have been materially different, and the kind that's willing to really investigate the change and what that would do. I tend to prefer the latter, because /everything/ has consequences, and "different from canon" does not need to (and frankly should not, IMO) mean "kinder than canon."

With the former, to use your "harry raised by goblins" example, I can kind of see why you wouldn't want to "waste" 15k words out of, say, a 40k word fic on just how different Harry's upbringing was. The point of the fic may not be the cultural differences between Muggle Britain, Wizarding Britain, and the Goblin clans. The point is more, "How would Harry have approached the second Voldemort War if he'd been raised in a culture that encouraged ruthlessness, cunning, adhering to the letter of one's bargains, and had a lot of cultural baggage over a lost war?" And showing more than scattered scenes from his childhood and first through third years would likely take too much time away from that driving question.

** It's something I see in a lot (a lot!) of fanfiction that would be ruthlessly edited in original fiction, and that is great tracts of (usually very dull) unecessary backstory. Backstory that is similar enough to canon that the readers already know it.

Neil Gaiman famously said (and I'm paraphrasing) that if someone tells you that something's wrong with your story they're almost certainly right. When they tell you how to fix it they're almost certainly wrong.

In the case of the OP I suspect that something in the writing (I would guess the level of background detail) is slowing the pacing and getting in the way of the story. Remember /The Story/. 'Letting events play out' is not always a good idea when it comes to storytelling. If nothing happens for a day or a week or a month, sum it up in a sentence and move on.

Like the idea that Harry is raised you goblins, and yet the next chapter after that the story immediately jumps to him entering Hogwarts. The purported premise, the thing that drew me in (hypothetically), has been skipped and I find its a shame. I'm not interested in having canon events rehashed to death, I'm just annoyed with stories skipping the interesting non-canon premise they present.

I think [[/u/Taure]] put it best in a comment elsewhere in this thread. A lot of the time the problem is the real premise of these stories is Powerful!Harry and the premise was a weak excuse to justify it. :/

** Sometimes when I'm writing, I'll feel like the story is getting bogged down when I try to go through all of the details on an event. When I first started writing, I struggled with getting away from chronicling every waking moment. Harry woke up, had some toast, got dressed, got on the bus ... and on and on. So sometimes when I'm writing about an event and I feel like it's dragging the story down, I'll do it in a bit of a flashback or more likely as a conversation between two characters.

I don't think of it as skipping to the good stuff, but rather keeping the story moving forward.

  why should anyone re-write what's already been written? if they want to tell a story about what harry (or whoever) would do after something's happened, why should they start the story before? they're interested in the consequences, not the minutiae
#+end_quote

That's not what I said, it's the opposite in fact. That they skip most or all of the preamble and leap to the consequences ends up with them rewriting canon with minor differences. The only consequences amount to things being easy because Harry/whoever was made OP.

#+begin_quote
  you clearly dislike these stories and it seems that you're just trying to validate your opinion. you don't appear to want examples of good stories that employ this AU technique (for e.g, linkffn(an unfound door)). you literally used harry crow as an example. that's just a terrible story that's also not aged well.
#+end_quote

Well aside from your mind reading, I'll further disagree by pointing out that I never said I don't want to read stories that use time skips and flashbacks to get to the consequences. The point here is that if my intention in this thread were to look for both kinds of stories, the OP would basically be "Hey send me some good stories", which is so vague a request as to make it worthless unless one has never read an HP fanfic. I.mean, here's a relevant bit if my OP:

#+begin_quote
  Time skips and flashbacks have their place of course,
#+end_quote

Many stories retread canon (and if we cull the one-shots and two-shots, possibly most of them do so you some degree. I didn't ask for plot retreads (though I thank you for linking several stories), I was complaining about how a number of stories seem to state a premise that they mostly skip over. Worse, the consequences they prioritized over the minutiae end up being either canon retreads or canon but where Harry and co. make solving their problems look trivially easy. Harry Crow is hardly the only offender here, it was just a random fic that came to mind since it's a textbook example of this.
