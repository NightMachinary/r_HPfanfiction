Initial idea came to me regarding 1984, but you could choose any dystopian novel as long as it makes sense.

Basically, what would happen to the wizarding world as the muggles fell into a dystopia? Using the world of 1984 as an example, would Hogwarts remain independent? Would it fall under the sway of Oceania? Or would it simple no longer exist, any magicals killed and any new muggleborns traced and promptly removed from society?

To take another example, take the world of the Hunger Games. Did the wizarding world have anything to do with the cataclysmic event that led to the formation of Panem? Are the wizards still underground, or do they live among the districts?

[Generalise for dystopia of your choice.]

** Oceania is scientifically and technologically stagnant in most respects, and great at rationalizing away inconvenient truths. I doubt it uncovers magic, and if it did, it'll just choose to forget it.

Probably the Wizards become more insular and xenophobic. They may not want to take Muggle-born children, as those children will already have been heavily-indoctrinated. Any children with magical ability will probably either be ignored and left to become possible Obscurials, kidnapped and likely mindwiped, or left with their families and mind-wiped.
