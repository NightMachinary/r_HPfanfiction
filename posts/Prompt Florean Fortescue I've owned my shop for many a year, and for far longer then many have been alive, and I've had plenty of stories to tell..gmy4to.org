Like the one time young Angelina Johnson slapped Lee Jordan, or the time James Potter and Sirius Black placed Dungbombs inside The Three Brooomsticks.(Just as examples, don't need to be used).

I like the idea of Florean seeing many things throughout his years of owning the ice cream shop, being able to reminiscent, maybe he'd rather people watch, instead of talking to people himself, or the like.

I'd imagine it being oneshot stories where he telling what he's seen throughout the years, or something similar, but doesn't need to be.
