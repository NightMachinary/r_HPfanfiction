** Thanks for posting this. I've seen very few fanfics with a better Dursley and this is definitely one of the best of those. I also agree it's a great way to honor the man for one of his better-known characters (at least to the HP Generation).

** I rarely complain about this but amount of misspellings is really high in this story.
