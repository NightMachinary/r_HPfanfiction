As above. I've been trying to figure it out but I can't see how it works without either assassinating characters or doing some mental gymnastics to justify it beyond it being a literary trope.


** well why not? I mean at least from harry's point of view hes definetly closer to her than any other girl. similar age, similar background, theres plenty in common between the two. theres at the very least trust and love between them of a platonic kind, it doesnt take much to lead to more. I think ships that work in the tent after ron leaves work well, both are angry and vulnerable and desperate and there is literally only one other person around. people often turn to friends for romance, its not an uncommon thing

****** Ron has even fewer in common with her than Harry. And Ron abandoned them twice, and although his second leave was unintentional, it was Harry and Hermione against the rest of the world for months. They had no help, no one to fall back onto, while Ron had the choice between Bill, Charlie, the Burrow and probably also somewhere with the twins. And that is discounting extended family like Muriel. But Harry or Hermione? It was "fight together" or "run away together". Maybe they would be able to track down Hermione's parents, maybe not. That is a whole different level of threat than what Ron faced.

** For me i just found their to be moments of such sweet tenderness between the two which were not always expclitly romantic but could serve as a bases for that kind of relationship to grow and seemed to show Harry and Hemrione having more chemsitry together than other canon couples that didn't feel forced but very real and natural(imo).

For example, Think the first time i was reading GoF i kept seeing Rowling was going out of her way seemingly, to put Harry and Hermione on their own together and having these little moments together that seemed out of step with the series till then.

Like when Hermione showed up the morning after Harrys name gets picked out of the goblet with some toast for him and they go eat by the lake and she listens to him and is vey suppotive and comforting its very sweet and tender. The kind of moment that shouldve belonged to Ginny in order to make that future relahstionship feel less forced and out of nowhere but instead it is given to Hermione. I love that little moment and when i was ten i was like OMG toast by the great lake??? this is the height of romance!! lol).

Anyway a scene like that, It tells us how much Hermione understands Harry like not many other seem to. She knows he doesn't want to eat in front everyone else and also doesn't even ask if he put his name in the goblet becuase she already knows the answer and Harry is greatly cheered by this and its just a really heartfelt wonderful display of their bond. While everyone else just assumes Harry to be a cheat and mostly runs off and abondons him(A recurring theme throughout the series everyone else leaving him and its back to being Just Harry and Hermione for ages).

There was also all the studying amd training together to learn Accio and Rita skeeter writing articles about the two being an item(even though they clearly deny it)

There's also the strange final moment of the last chapter of the book where its all "Hermione did something she'd never done before and kissed Harry on the cheek" Like why do we need to know she never done that before? why is that written like its significant? Perhaps suggetsing their relathionship had deepened or changed somewhat or is going to go somewhere in the next book? I think that at this point in the story JK was maybe unsure what pairings to go with and was trying stuff out (no matter how much she says the pairings where all planned from day one)

Anyway at the cost of going on and boring people any longer those kind of moments i can see defintely shaping people to see Harry/hermione being viable.

Ps. I'm not die hard on harmony or anything so please don't shout at me ahha all my ships get me enough trouble already Like Hermione/Luna Hermione/Pansy and other stuff people give me funny looks for lol

** First. Obvious bait is obvious.

Second. Why not? It's fanfiction, and Harry/Hermione is far and away the most believable of the non-canon pairings; if you put some work into developing the characters (particularly if your fic is post-canon) then there's no reason why an H/Hr ship can't be better than the canon ships, let alone plausible. If you're asking why people think the ship works in canon, then I'd agree with you that it mostly doesn't. However, I think it's a more than fair argument to suggest Jo poisoned the well because she so desperately wanted the canon ships to happen: that bit at the end of HBP where Rowling basically assumes omniscience to contrast Ginny and Hermione by saying Ginny would accept his decisions and not tell him to be careful is pretty much proof positive of that. A few changes here and there to canon and there'd be a great big lot sitting here and on [[/r/harrypotter]] dumbfounded as to how anyone could think H/Hr wasn't the perfect pairing.

** Shared Muggle childhood experiences, the 'child prodigy' treatment from adults around them (which in particular is something Ron doesn't share with them), Harry relying on Hermione's intelligence and vice versa to a small extent (it's more an outlook, a point of view, that I feel Harry has that's valuable), and just sheer time spent together, especially during traumatic events. There are people who become couples after living through something terrible that seem to not have any other things in common, and it still works. The military studies that phenomenon, I think.

​

I wasn't a fan of the idea until I watched a music video back in 2005 or 2006 that really caught an angle I liked, which was the 'feelings for each other we keep hidden so we don't hurt Ron' angle. I think they'd be an all right couple in public as well, though. Besides the whole 'Rowling deliberately wrote feelings between Ron and Hermione' thing, I think there's a solid friendship turns to more basis in the Harry and Hermione relationship. I mean, how many movies are there where two people were best friends and one of them realizes they have feelings, and has to either reconcile that with the lack of them from the other person, or convince them to realize they also feel the same way? It's not a stretch. I find it way more plausible when *just* looking at canon events than Hermione and Draco, for example.

​

I think a good writer can make nearly anything work. Whether you end up liking it has to do with how well they wrote it and how willing you are to see it the way they wrote it, if that makes sense? If you don't like it, that's totally fair.

** 1. They have a great friendship.

2. They are actually complementary, making up for each other's weaknesses instead of just opposites.

3. They are both stoic and can endure hardship. They'd both work on a relationship instead of thROwiNg in the towel at the first sign of resistance

4. They are proven to be able to work as a team and achieve their goals.

5. They take care of each other and support each other even when they disagree.

6. Hermione is the only female character (besides maybe Tonks) who sees Harry for Harry and not as "prophecy boy". He needs to be in a relationship with someone like her, not Ginny (and this is not a dig at Ginny, she's great).

7. Hermione would never allow Harry to name one of their kids Albus-Severus.

The biggest objection: /They just aren't into each other/ can be solved by a single line written by the author, so it doesn't really interest me that much. Of course they aren't interested in each other if the author goes for different final pairings...

** I think there are enough hooks in canon to hang a relationship on. They share a relationship of deep trust, friendship and loyalty more than any other character. There is evidence of a physical attraction on both ends in canon as well. They are both from the Muggle world.

Hermione/Harry also works better than Hermione/Ron in the sense that they are not complete opposites. Rowling even said herself that the relationship between them was a mistake.

Biggest thing of all though is that there are so many moments in canon where you can realistically start of the ship. End of third year with the rescue of Sirius, when Hermione is the only one to stand by Harry after he gets picked by the GoF, after the first task, Yule Ball, after the second task (honestly anywhere in fourth year would be appropriate), anytime during fifth year with the Umbridge detentions and Occlumency, after Sirius dies, when Harry goes looking for her when Ron snogs Lavender, Slughorn party, when Ron leaves during DH and post war are all perfect opportunities from the top of my head.

*** Yes, so many natural points for it to happen unlike nearly all the other canon ships (imo) finding her crying in the classroom in HBP was another scene for me where i was like "wow Rowling is actually going to go with this after all???" then... no lol and by the time DH and the tent stuff rolled around the idea was pretty dead in my head but when Ron leaves i defintely felt that Harry and Hermione shouldve hooked up in that tent even for only one night. ( clearly imply it and be subtle as its still a childrens book even though by DH its pretty adult now so you coudl write it tastefully) I mean, they are lost alone and theres no one else to turn too they are also horny teens who could die any day now ahha it was so obvious and also would have added such depth to the scene where the locket shows Ron what he fears may have went on while he was gone...well what if it actually did happen in a time of weakness but Harry and Hermione regret it or hide it? will Ron be consumed by rage or will he be a true Gryffindor and destroy the locket as its the right thing to do maybe he leaves again after or choses to stay but the rest of the story has this dark cloud hanging over the three?

** My view is that Harmony could work well if you made some slight changes to one or both of them, and those changes would probably be improvements. For example, having Hermione appreciate Harry's sense of humour a bit more, or take more time to listen to him without judging. Having Harry be a bit more considerate of Hermione's challenges, a bit more committed to his studies. Those changes would help them to simply enjoy each other's company, not because they rely on each other to save the world, but just because being together is fun.

Since those are positive changes, and hopefully some form of them would happen as the two grow up, I think it's reasonable for fanfic writers to see potential in the relationship.

Since Harry is Hermione's only real friend she's ever had in 17 years of life it's practically expected for her to have very strong feelings for him, especially since he almost dies every single year.

As for Harry well most of the time he is just like wow, I've been neglected my whole life and don't know what love is. Then Hermione proves she loves him by never abandoning him. Eventually they kiss and then are inseperable.

She spent a decent amount of time growing up with Harry and the fact that she had a crush on him before she attended and in her first year--during which he ends up saving her life, let's totally blame her for crushing on the hero--is not something I think that should be held against her.

Popular opinion around here is that her relationship with Dean was doomed even without Harry triggering their break-up with the luck potion. I got downvoted into oblivion because I tried to argue that Harry, at the very least, sped their separation up. People seem to believe that it was done for early in HBP.

Ginny in OotP was an amazing character (much like Hermione and Tonks). HBP and DH shat all over that. She goes from "strong, important character" to "nothing but the love interest" as soon as the sixth book starts.

Harry laments that Lupin didn't write after Sirius death, Lupin, unlike Sirius, did nothing during the TWT and didn't bother to visit Harry even once for 14 years and then only does so to get him from one prison to a slightly more gilded cage.

Honestly, Rowling should have used the runner to break them up and make a point about loving divorced parents. But due to her pining after the ex-husband who dumped her, we get the Tonks character assassination which is their romance (she admitted that it influenced all her romances in the last book).

***** I didn't see it as much spiteful as looking for evidence for your position on her, no worries. I don't really like her character as much as others, but found as I read the books that personally my view of who she was as a character felt like how Rowling *meant* to write her, but when I actually go back over the parts in the books that are about her specifically, they lack the nuances I thought I'd seen. I think my brain fills them in, if that makes sense.

​

Harry and Ron hadn't been very kind to Hermione (not specifically unkind, except for maybe one comment), and she hadn't grown up knowing vaguely of him, so it makes sense her reaction was different to being saved. Plus, Hermione's view of him definitely changed with his actions. They became far more favorable, just not hero worship :)

I think what isn't said about Ginny in the books is actually a net positive for her. She isn't an extension of the trio, she has her own stuff she's into, she isn't always around, because she's doing her own thing. This ends up meaning that we don't know as much about her, because the books are in Harry's PoV, but I do think it shows something healthy about her that she has her own group of friends and such.
