I'm talking things like Dumbledore phoenix travelling through the Malfoy wards, Legilimensing the names and locations of the Inner Circle out of him, then going and dispatching everyone in said inner circle.

** I don't think he could solve the Horcruxes in a day. Even a Dumbledore who know longer cared about playing by the Ministry's rules would probably fall for the ring horcrux's trap, and he'd need time to find out what they all were.

Pretty much everything else he could at least make a very good start on, if he wasn't afraid of overthrowing the Ministry (which is a regime which is complicit in outright slavery and genocide, has been for centuries, and is therefore entirely deserving of overthrow).

*** Canon Dumbledore started looking for the Horcruxes after CoS (when Harry showed him the diary). After being "exiled" from the school in OotP, it became his main activity (since he was free from his other obligations). And in HBP, every one of his "trips" outside of the school was spent looking for them.

Even with all of this, he only managed to find . . . 2. Even by going all out and ignoring any secrecy, I doubt Dumbledore would be able to be any faster in his search, especially since Voldemort was the only one to truly know the locations of the Horcruxes.

Also, I just can't see Dumbledore overthrow the Ministry, no matter how badly they fuck up. The whole philosophy of the character is based on refusing to use his power, or take any position of authority for fear of repeating the error of his past. In my opinion, Dumbledore overthrowing the Ministry would be just like Batman taking a gun and killing people, it would go against everything the character is supposed to stand for.

***** Can any ones other than the Diary do that, though? The Diary was the only one that was shown to possess people, and that was because it had someone writing into it for a year.

Also, Dumbledore could just Legilimens it out of Voldemort. A few weeks of torture and Voldemort would be spilling his secrets.

****** There's one fic - not going to identify it because it's a bit of a spoiler - where Harry finally catches up with Voldemort after taking a few levels in Hard As Nails, and is amused to discover that for all he liked dishing out the pain, Voldemort had no tolerance for it himself and cracked after three minutes of the Cruciatus.
