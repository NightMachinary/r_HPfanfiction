I've read literally two fics where Harry has a talent other then Quidditch and DADA. There are a few variety show ones, but Harry never struck me as a singer. Anyways, this one I read, called:

linkffn(Oh, you didn't know? Yeah, he's awesome)

Very funny. It's abandoned though, but here, apparently Harry was amazing at dancing and tailoring clothes. Is there anything like that out there? Thanks!

  Remember Goblet of Fire? What would happen if Harry took the filter off his mouth and actually said what he's thinking? Bad things, probably. But it'll be fun as hell. My go at the Intelligent!Harry, Smart alec!Harry situation.
