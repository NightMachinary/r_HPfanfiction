I'm apparently just tired of reading about teenagers right now. I just finished rereading the present-day half of Of a Linear Circle, and Severus/Nizar is great. I like (fanon) Snape, and I want to read more fic where he's happy and has friends and/or partners who appreciate him.

I have no particular preferences who the adult is, though bonus points for a) not a Marauder and b) not his student. Or c) is Regulus, actually, I like Regulus. Time travel is fine, wildly AU is fine, OCs are fine. I just want to read about adults.

(Yes, I am aware the more sensible option here would be reading something other than fic about a series of books about teenagers.)


** Coriaria: The love of damaged men series [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1188778]]

Moody/Snape

War's over and the wounded are recovering at the ward. Moody cannot sleep in a tiny single person room and Snape has to share the room because there's no space elsewhere.

** I'll throw my own into the ring. "Black Eyes" linkffn(12921782). It's an AU where he has a much younger sister. The focus is mostly on him and grappling with the little sister after some unforeseen events and being who he is during the first war. Then, have you read anything by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/7351150/FelixFelicisWriter][FelixFelicisWriter]]? I've only read one story, an older story, that's a Snape has a little sister AU. However, she has a couple where Severus has relationships with OC, adult woman. Perhaps one of them will catch your eye.

  When his mother insisted he come home for Christmas hols during his fifth year to share some important news, Severus came up with dozens of possible, not-so-possible, and impossible theories about what she could have to announce. This, though, he never dreamed it would be this. First War W/Voldemort. AU. Part I of Family Branches series. Complete.

#+begin_quote
  Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagall have a long standing tradition that cannot be stopped. Though other professors come and go the two Heads of House routinely meet by the staff room fireside on Friday nights to cope with the struggles of teaching at a magical school filled with teenagers. A few chapters of one-shots on the friendship of McGonagall and Snape.

  AU. Yes, the old Snape retrieves Harry from the Dursleys formula. I just had to write one. Everything changes, because the best revenge is living well. T for Mentor Snape's occasional naughty language. Supportive Minerva. Over three million hits!

** Try mine? It's as canon compatible as I could make it given that I did give him a friend (not a romantic partner and also, none of the options you mentioned.) Hope you enjoy!

** I know many would be down in the dumps just because the story is long as hell, but you can give linkffn(Prince of the Dark Kingdom). Best world building I've ever seen, and featuring a dnapr that is exactly as he was in canon. I won't give too much of the plot away by mentioning any more.
