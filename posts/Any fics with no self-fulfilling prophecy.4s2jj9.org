By that I mean, trelawney may have spoken it, and it may have been recorded in the hall of prophecies, but it wasn't during a job interview with dumbledore, and nor was it partially overheard by Snape. It'd be interesting to read a fic where it plays out with total ignorance on all parts.


** Prophecy is an overused plot device. LOTR has it, Star Wars has it, The Matrix has it, and the Percy Jackson series has it. IMO, it's getting really really boring and repetitive.

HP series wouldn't lose anything without that stupid prophecy. There are just way too many better plot devices.

For example, Voldemort needed magical children born at the end of July for some kind of ritual. Snape could have given him the idea in the first place, only later to realize what he had done.

Or the Potters could have gotten some important stuff that could pose serious threat to Voldemort (such as render its owner certain immunity against Voldemort). Voldemort attacked, the Potters were cornered, James gave it to Lily, but Lily injected the item into Harry's blood stream. Later, Voldemort bypassed part of that protection by using Harry's blood in his resurrection. But taking Harry's blood also turned Voldemort's horcrux in Harry vulnerable.

*[[http://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]]* is set in a sci-fi, non-magical world, and its author found an excellent and far more realistic substitute for Voldemort's obsession with Harry.

*** But there's very little reason for a bunch of kids/teens to target the Dark Lord and thus drive conflict in these teen fiction plots. It's suicidal for even the average person let alone someone underage. So extreme circumstances aren't explicitly /necessary/ but they're the easy way out. Prophecy, noble birth, magical power, mental unbalances, etc. Most stories give their main character a physical/magical/social/prophetic advantage to create the conflict.

Without the prophecy, Harry would be just another person targeted by the most evil and powerful wizard alive besides Dumbledore. Once Dumbledore dies, only luck could keep Harry alive, and without prophecy/fate, luck eventually disappears.

In order to have a main character who lacks a physical/magical/social/prophetic advantage, he/she would need an /ungodly/ amount of drive, agency, and determination. This person would be the embodiment of determination in a teenager's form. Dumbledore would never assign the Horcrux Hunt to Harry Potter, a school boy; Dumbledore would give it to someone better prepared to fight. But determined!Harry would /demand/ it. He would coerce and push and ensure that /he/ is the one to face down evil. And this character might be hard to relate with.

**** What if the fact that Harry and Boldemort share blood somehow gave him some affinity for Voldemort (like that blood connection gives him visions and all the benefits his scar does. Maybe it "activated" the horcrux inside of him).

That way Voldemort basically created his own worst enemy when he tried to bypass Harry's protection.

**** The Dark Lord was coming after them, and Harry wanted revenge for his parents.

Aren't these enough reasons?

***** Almost everyone else in the wizarding world wants revenge after the Dark Lord's reign of terror. Yet they're understandably frightened to even speak his name. What makes Harry different?

****** Others did not have a vengeful and obsessed Dark Lord coming after them either.

That revenge went both ways.

***** Pretty sure that the first book states that Voldemort was specifically targeting Harry, not his parents, though.

** Sounds kind of... boring? What's interesting about the prophecy is how it makes characters react to it. If nobody knows about it, it might as well just be the summary off the back of a book.

*** The prophecy is a key motivation for dumbledore and voldemort, everyone else is just fighting a war according to their beliefs in a well-developed fantasy world. The stakes are still there, just not necessarily any deus ex machina to deal with it - so maybe the war never stopped, or maybe some auror got in a lucky shot and bought some time until his resurrection.
