Any fics where Harry saves his parents that Halloween night? Whatever else happens besides that I don't care but I thought it would be interesting


** There is the punisher crossover where Harry gets trained by military muggleborns, half-blood and squibs in non-magical combat and takes Voldemort using a high-powered rifle and then goes about killing death eaters in the Malfoy manor.

Edit: This is a time travel fic where Harry goes to save his parents as hydrus black [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11593337/1/This-Time-The-Potters]]
