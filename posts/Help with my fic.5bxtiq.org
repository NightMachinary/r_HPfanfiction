I found a fun little challenge on ffn.net about Harry with the infinity gems. Figured i'd try and take it over and attempt to write a fanfiction!

I'd like to know what to fix or add, so any help would be appreciated.

** Your vocabulary is fine as is your grammar however, the story is too fast paced. It feels rushed. I don't know how old you are but you write like someone with very little experience - I hope you're not too offended. It doesn't flow, if you get my drift. You should expand you paragraphs, make your writing more descriptive.

I hope the above made sense.

*** I'm only twelve, so I don't exactly have a lot of experience. This is only my first attempt at writing.

I do thank you, however, for the reply.
