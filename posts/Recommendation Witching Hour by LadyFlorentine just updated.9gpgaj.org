Anyone else read this fic? It's by no means long or popular, but it has an interesting and funny premise. And humour aside, it's an opportunity to explore the mentor relationship between Harry and Albus in a new way. linkffn(12506007)


** That first chapter is great. Harry fucking around as Dumbledore is hilarious.

  Encouraged, he took a deep breath. In the spirit of staying in character, Harry put on his best long-suffering look and sighed in a very dramatic fashion. "Now, Remus," he began, "Alastor's paranoia is not entirely unwarranted." He gave what he hoped was an indulgent smile. "I'm afraid that in my old age I've gotten quite forgetful. That, in combination with my tendency to keep important information to myself, is why I did not notify you as to Harry's arrival."

** Two chapters? I'm reluctant to get invested in a story that just updated with it's second chapter after over a year.

** Fuck you, man. I didn't check out how far along the story was and now, I'm devastated that it's only two chapters, and it is all your fault.
