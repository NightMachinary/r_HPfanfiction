*** Fighting Voldemort, Harry yells, 'Expelliarmus'

In one clean movement, Voldemort arms are ripped off and land at Harry's feet with his enemy standing there too stunned to be in pain.

Harry looks at the twitching arms at his feet and slowly... Very slowly... Very very slowly has a good idea... Or just a regular idea.

He points his wand again and yells, 'Expelli-leg-us'

Normally this wouldn't work for any other wizard, but Harry's pure intent, no matter how inane, combined with raw power achieved the desired results and a pair of matching legs joined the matching arms on the ground in front of him.

Then Volde-torso began to scream in pain.

** Minerva was trying another transformation that would -hopefully- transform her colleague's hair into something presentable. Neither potions not charms had worked when Severus Snape's hair had been burnt almost to the scalp, and it was his theory that the only reason why he still had his head was because Potter didn't want him dead.

"Are we sure he didn't try to kill you, Severus?" Filius pipped from his chair, fiddling nervously with his teacup.

"The boy is well-meaning. A well-meaning idiot, but well-meaning nonetheless." He batted Minerva's wand away. They would try with runes later. "As much as it pains me to say it, Potter doesn't have a single malicious thought in that endless void he calls brain."

Albus, Minerva could tell, was battling with himself to not laugh at the mohawk the Potion Master now sported. Severus angry glare to the man told her he wasn't as successful, or that he wasn't trying to hide it in the first place.

That the glare only got him to break into giggles like a third year girl with her first crush meant that she was right. He wasn't even trying.

She cleared her throat: "Well, we can't let this continue. Potter needs to learn more finesse..."

This time it was Severus who snorted into his tea.

"What Potter needs is to use that monstruous strength of his any other way. And away from the dungeons, if possible."

In another universe, she was sure, Minerva would have protested at that, insisting that Potter needed to study Potions so he could become an Auror, just as he wished.

That had been before the Expelliarmus the child used against the Dark Lord had been too literal in expelling his foe's limbs. Voldemort and his lackeys had been found by the Aurors when a report of limbs (and blood, oh Merlin, so much blood) raining on the small town of Little Hangleton had been issued, not an hour after Harry Potter had disappeared from Hogwarts during the last task of the Triwizard Tournament.

What a way to end a war.

She cleared her throat again.

"Well, yes. But every day that passes he's closer to leaving Hogwarts, and he won't be able to take a normal job with his ah... Above average strength. And, as Severus said, he's a well-meaning... I mean, a good boy, and I'm sure he will like to take a job that lets him help others."

There was silence in the Headmaster's office, only interrupted by the clinking and humming of Albus' trinkets.

"Ehem," all eyes turned to Pomona, who had been sipping her tea with a pensive expression in her kind face. "Maybe we can have him work in the greenhouses more often?"

"And take him close to the venomous tentacula? To the explodera granatum?" Severus had a very mocking expression of worried surprise when he turned to Minerva. "Are we sure Potter is not contagious?"

Pomona puffed and fidgeted in her seat. Her face turned a very impressive red hue but her voice was firm when she started to talk again.

"My plants are too afraid of him to do him any harm, and he's too careful with them." She breathed deeply. "I didn't expect it, seeing as how his parents where more of the 'touch and die' type of gardeners, but Potter has a very gifted green thumb."

Minerva and Severus looked at each other, both blinking in tandem and, Minerva was sure, with the same expression of stupefied astonishment. Sometimes both Gryffindors and Slytherins could agree on getting confused by the Hufflepuffs.

"It could work." Said Albus with a smile, reaching for one of the shortbreads that had poofed into existence on the table.

"It could work." Agreed, after a few moments of silent communication, the head of houses.

Harry Potter, hours later, and still confused on how his restorative potion almost blew up his professor (not even Hermione was sure on how he had managed to do so, to be honest), got informed by professor McGonagall that he was expected to take double Herbology starting immediately.

He scratched his head, even more confused.

That was not bad at all.

********** I'm currently in my second year of studying physics at university. But the orbit stuff is mostly from Kerbal Space Program.

Anyway, anti-gravity spells are always a bit weird because if a spell actually negated gravity, it wouldn't look like you'd expect it to due to the fact that the earth is spinning and accelerating. In order to hover something in place, it'd have to either be very specific about just earth's gravity and centrifugal force or it'd have to actively keep the hovering object in place. I'd expect spells to be quite clever about how they do what wizards expect them to do, which means that what it actually does isn't quite consistent with the simple name.

************* I bet there are many spells that are all the levitation charm, but have different names because they do different jobs. Like accio, that literally is levitating an object towards you. It has the intent to get the object to you with levitation, so it's basically a levitation charm with a bit of intent tacked on.

The problem is, we don't KNOW that much about magic. Since it's not real, we can't test it and see what happens, only conjecture about what could happen, about the rules there COULD be. And J.K. Rowling is more concerned about releasing extra info about ships and diversity rather than on magic using the scientific method. Even if she did, it wouldn't be reliable as the extra info she gives is notorious for making little to no sense.
