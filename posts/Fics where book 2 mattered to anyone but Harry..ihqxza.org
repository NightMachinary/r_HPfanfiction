Book 2 in my opinion was the biggest wasted potential in the series, especially for ginny. Her possesion by tom was a unique connection to voldemort she and harry both share and cannon does absolutely nothing with it. Like no "holy shit tom was voldemort" moment.

So come at me reddit, and bring your best book 2 mattering fics.

- ginny possesion repricussions and bonding with harry over it in book 5
- ginny can speak paraeltongue after speaking it so much while posesses becuase hocus pocus reasons.
- ginny having unique insights into voldemort's personality.
- hagrid learning that ass who got him expelled was voldemort. "TOM YOU LITTLE SHIT, ARAGOG DID NOTHING WRONG"
- etc.


** I wish we saw more of

Penelope Clearwater or Colin Creevey having traumas after being petrified.

Ginny's journey to trust herself, her struggles of finding someone who can relate to her (big missed opportunity by JKR)

Muggleborns still being scared the next year. Dumbledore didn't explain much what had caused muggleborns to be attacked after all, and things like that aren't forgotten over summer.

Muggleborns whose parents remove them from Hogwarts

Neville develops a phobia for cornish pixies

Ron gets claustrophobia after the cave-in

We don't really see more safety measures due to the chamber incident, which there should have been

*** Ron starts finding more and more elaborate ways to not let his wand be used against him.

Puts the handle on the wrong end, puts a deafening charm on it that gets turned off if your thumb is in the right place...

It's incredible how close they came to a fate worse than death and then forgot about it

** The second one was something I was planning (to a degree) to incorporate in one of my fics. She can't speak it but understands Parseltongue the same way that Harry does (perceiving it as English).

Also, her magic is "tainted" due to how long hers and the Horcrux's souls were intermingled. Leaving her with an impression of his power and skills.

  Harry has been entered into the Triwizard Tournament against his will, and his friends don't believe him when he insists he didn't enter his name. Will Ginny Weasley sit by and watch him suffer alone, or will she risk exposing the dark secret she has been hiding. GoF re-write from Ginny's POV. Smart & slightly manipulative Ginny! Extreme Ron-bashing!
