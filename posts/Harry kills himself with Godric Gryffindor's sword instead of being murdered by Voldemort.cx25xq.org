So i had this particular (even if a little morbid) way of imagining the Final Battle between Harry and Voldemort. After Nagini has been killed , i envisioned a Dark Lord far too weak to cast Aveda Kedavra and fulfill the prophecy, but still strong enough to not be killed until all of his soul pieces have been destroyed.

So Harry, knowing that he is the only one who can finally defeat him and save the world, makes the sacrifice and stabs himself with the weapon capable of annihilating a Horcrux.

(The why he has the sword with him can be left aside or explained briefly).

The reason i wanted this scenario to play off is because of its sheer dramatic value and subversivity. It was told and retold that The Dark Lord has to murder Harry, so why not take a different route and make his sacrifice to his own terms? And apart of that, i am very interested in Voldemort's reaction to this scene, as i want him to watch (ok, maybe more than a little morbid.)

Any interpretations for the given indications will be immensely appreciated .

*** They could have someone besides Neville kill Nagini, Harry makes the sacrifice, then Neville, the other boy who could've been chosen by Voldemort, steps forward and delivers the kill shot to Riddle immediately after Harry's sacrifice.

Other possibilities: a dying Snape in one last moment of revenge for Lily and now her son, Hermione with her being a Muggleborn, Arthur Weasley the meek Muggle protector.

*** No, but someone else could. In this case, since Voldemort wasn't the one to kill Harry, it can be someone else to finish the Dark Lord off. The idea is while every capable wizard can cast a killing curse on a mortal Voldemort, just Harry has the power to decisively incline the balance by killing the Horcrux.

** Y'know, I'm reminded of that scene in Kingdom Hearts I, with Sora impaling himself on the keyblade of heart in order to release Kairi's heart trapped within himself.

...Okay, my mind is going strange places. Seven princesses of heart, seven horcruxes, one of which is concealed inside the protagonist and requires him to (not quite) die to release it...but then, in KH1, releasing Kairi's heart has the effect of uniting the hearts of the seven Princesses of Heart and unlocking the Final Keyhole which released a huge swarm of Heartless.

I wonder if there's any fics where destroying Voldemort's horcruxes unleashes something really really bad. Like, the ruined soul chunks combine to make some horrifying abomination, or they break the barrier between the mortal and spirit worlds to release lots of horrifying abominations, or...?

**** Unwilling to sacrifice Harry just to guarantee Voldemort's death, nor destroy such priceless artifacts as the relics of the founders, Dumbledore instead investigates ways to separate souls from their vessels without destroying the latter.\\
In his research, he finds records, of an ancient dark wizard who created a 'Key To The Heart', which he used to steal souls of unusual purity for his unspeakable rituals; seeing this as an opportunity, Dumbledore sets out to retrieve the surviving Key To The Heart, planning to use the ancient dark device for good by extracting Voldemort's horcruxes from the artifacts (and Harry) that they reside in.

But though Dumbledore's plan is well-intentioned, the malevolent shards of Voldemort's soul aren't inclined to go quietly into the beyond.\\
And the Keyblade of Heart hasn't forgotten its original, terrible purpose...

*** You make a really good point. With Nagini, the Horcrux was part of her, so cutting off her head killed the Horcrux. With Harry though, it is just in his scar, and we know that it can be stored in inanimate objects, so just killing Harry would not be enough, they would have to specifically aim to kill the Horcrux in the scar. If they just killed Harry, the Horcrux could just attach itself to his scull and continue to exist.

** I don't have one on hand where Harry offs himself with the sword. I /do/ however have one where he pulls a Dumbles and has Snape off him instead (Snape-icide?). It's quite the old fic, but linkffn(Harry Potter and the Curse of V'Ardian) is both complete and reasonably well written.

I will note that this fic has a number of what are now considered bad tropes that, at the time, were considered quite original. On the bright side, they're written well.

Spoilers below explaining how this story fits the prompt. Harry never manages to actually destroy a Horcrux himself. However, as a Horcrux he is able to call the soulpieces in others to himself, merging them and cleansing the items. This means, of course, that by the final battle's end he has more or less Riddle's entire soul fighting his own for dominance in his body. He anticipates this and asks Snape to hang around the battlefield and green-light him after he kills Riddle. Snape does.

*** God, i had the idea of Harry killing himself for some time now, but my second plot direction was having Snape doing it, putting a lot of stress on their already existing relationship as being either extremely controversial (like in canon but even more so) or bordering on Mentor!Snape .I almost started writing a fic about it, i really was seeing it. So thank you very much!
