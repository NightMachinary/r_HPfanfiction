I'm working on an AU OC Draco Malfoy romance. It'll be long, probably posted in chapter installments. Any recommendations on where to post? I'm aware of [[https://FF.net][FF.net]] and AO3, but have never posted anywhere before, so I'm not sure if one is better than the other, or if there are additional options.


** Just post to both.

** Where do you, personally, read fanfiction? I would post there.

** In my experience and thus my opinion, AO3 is filled to the brim with smut of all flavors, and if your story trends along those lines, might find a heavier readership there.
