I've been searching for one specific fanfic where Harry has a slight sadistic streak and is hunting down death eaters and death eater students at Hogwarts. I believe he has help torturing them for information from Hermione, Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, and a few others.

Harry is the descendant of a Witchfinder General takes up the cause for Death Eaters. He tortures and kills several purebloods and is supported in his efforts by a gaggle of girls who have also been wronged. It seems to descend into literal insanity and that takes a lot away from the story, in my opinion. Incomplete.

  When a man is pushed to the end of his tether, be prepared for violent retribution. The magical world had better prepare itself for the turning of the tide. If the magical government cannot be trusted to protect its people, then Harry Potter will just have to do it himself. Trigger Warning: Graphic depictions of violence.

** That'd be more interesting as Harry and Ron. And not as an Albus Bashing fic.
