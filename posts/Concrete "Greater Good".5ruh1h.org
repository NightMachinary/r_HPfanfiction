Dumbledore worrying about "the Greater Good" is a common plot in stories, especially those who feature him as an antagonist to Harry. And yet it seems that often, the "Greater Good" remains vague, undefined, which makes his motivation and goals look flat. I think those stories could be improved if he had concrete goals. Discrediting blood prejudice, improving the fate of werewolves, mending fences with other magical creatures, raising the standard of living in Wizarding Britain, etc. etc.

It's one thing to hear him tell Harry to risk/sacrifice his life "for the greater good", it's another to hear him tell Harry to do it to protect all of the muggleborns, the other magical species, and the muggles from Voldemort and his Death Eaters.

(Whether or not Dumbledore would actually want Harry to sacrifice himself is another question; this is just a proposal to make "Greater Good!Dumbledore" a bit more nuanced.)


** I think that, for bashing purposes, the concept of greater good has been both wrongly attached to Dumbledore and been corrupted in a mere excuse for evil. First, Dumbledore does not actively use the words "greater good" in the books; Second, the Headmaster, while appearing controlling, is only doing what he thinks should be done to save as many lives as possible!

I can see why it would seem cynic and unappealing to most, but put yourselves in his situation: You are a 116 years old extremely gifted wizard who has been for decades the one everyone went to, to have something done; one of the very few with the political clout to protect, the only one strong enough to stand up to Voldemort!

I rather think he did his best, and while he failed in many ways, he's only human and many readers fall in the same trap as many wizards and witches, to think him as a mastermind on "God-Cocaine" cit. Conneron

** A possibility is that he doesn't want things to change, given how disastrous his early plans towards the wizarding world were. Thus he prefers a contemptible status-quo to a potential fuck-up of Grindelwald proportions.

Another hypothesis is that he is very concerned about keeping as many ancient bloodlines alive as possible, which would explain the despicable passivity shown towards the death eaters [but then why not dose them with draught of living death and dump them in a dungeon untill the war is over?].

*** The first is a believable and somewhat canon supported idea.

But the second is just as far out there as a 'actually good guy Voldemort'. It has never been shown that Dumbledore tries to keep ancient bloodlines alive.

We've also barely seen Dumbledore as part of the war effort. 5th year is more espionage and 6th year he's already crippled and dying. And at the end of OotP he didn't have any political power so how would he have been able to make decisions on the fate of the prisoners...

As you might have noticed, I dislike the 'secretly pureblood supporter' Dumbledore immensely.

That's just not true. I refuse to believe that the entirety or even a majority of wizarding Britain simply believed what the Minister and the Prophet were telling them.

No matter how much people here and some authors especially like to think of the general public is 'idiotic sheeple' the real world just doesn't work that way.

Dumbledore is like a living legend, the man was held in the highest regard for almost 50 years, he was a hero for defeating Grindelwald, the only wizard that Voldemort was genuinely afraid of and he held 3 of the most important political offices in the world. You don't discredit a man like that with a simple smear campaign in a few months.

The only reasonable explanation for his behavior in OotP is that he was simply too busy hunting Horcruxes to bother with Fudge. He knew that Voldemort would show himself in a reasonable time frame and any preparations Dumbledore and the Ministry could have made in that time simply weren't worth more than finding the Horcruxes.

***** Oh don't get me wrong. Dumbledore still had a great social standing and was still highly regarded by many. But he had not a single official function right after he duelled Voldemort. He got removed as chief warlock and Supreme Mugwump after all.

Also, besides the points you mentioned for his inactivity in OoTP there is also the point that leading a coup against Fudge while Voldemort is lurking around is so fucking stupid that I can't even put it into words.

**** Wanting to save the lives of your enemies is generally considered compassionate - not "fucked up". In fact, most civilised countries have done away with the death penalty for even the worst crimes.

All the reasons people in reality believe the death penalty is wrong apply here too. And in the Wizarding world there are even more reasons to be wary of killing your enemies. With things like the Imperius Curse how can you even be sure your enemy is there of their own free will?

Fanfics tend to shit on that last point, since Malfoy and Co. used it to avoid Azkaban, but I believe it is canon that there really were innocent people forced to commit crimes under the Imperius.

This attitude has some merits, but it backfired badly in the fight against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Those murdering psychopaths already had compiled a decade long record of murders and tortures. As the story showed clearly, it was terribly wrong NOT to put Bellatrix and Co. permanently out of business when they had the opportunity. How many died or suffered after they were broken out of Azkaban?

Applying blanket 'mercy' to your enemies is dangerous, naive, wrong, and a GIGANTIC INJUSTICE to their victims.

****** One of the great things about the story is that its never morally black and white. You point to Bellatrix Lestrange as a great example of why they should use the death penalty. But I could just as easily point to Sirius as a great example of why they shouldn't.

What if the aurors who found Sirius - laughing in front of dozens of witnesses who had watched him murder 13 people - just killed him then and there and condemned an innocent man to die?

As Gandalf himself put it:

“Many that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgement.”

******* There is a big difference between kill on sight and execution after investigation and trial.

The Sirius case exposed how fucked up both Dumbledore and Ministry were: You finally caught a core Voldemort henchman and a deep spy, and you didn't bother to ask him some questions? Hello Dumbledore? He was once your hardcore follower, why did he suddenly turn? Even understanding that question might save you from future similar tragedies. As for you Ministry, a core Voldemort follower would be a goldmine for intelligence, but you just locked him in a prison and forgot about him. How incompetent could you possibly get?

******* Except that is not the whole picture. I think that most people in the fandom agree that there is not nearly enough concrete information on the first blood war, so let's come up with a plausible scenario for the sake of argument.

As of the first war, Voldemort utilizes terrorist tactics. He keeps under the radar by using quiet disappearances, assassinating those with the power, magical or otherwise, to stand up to him. By the time he has gotten momentum, he is carrying out full scale massacres against Wizards and Muggles. The Ministry has no idea what to do, Dumbledore cannot fix this by waving his wand, and so the terror continues. Voldemort allows for his name to be leaked to the upper levels of government, and by extension, Dumbledore. He places a Taboo on the name, and is able to successfully use the tactic to sweep in with multiple coordinated raids to kill public officials, severely weakening the Ministry. The Imperious curse is used liberally, and that is Voldemort's greatest tactic. He only needs to imperious a single Auror, and by doing so, infect the ministry with a wave of spies, who actively pass information, and sabatoge operations. The Department of Mysteries is immune at first, but falls with the recruitment of Augustus Rookwood. There are three circles to the Death Eaters. The Inner Circle are the leiutenants, strategists, and the Death Eater High Command. The second circle consists of marked death eaters, who aren't crucial to the operations. The third circle is the cannon fodder, werewolves, inferior and imperioused wizards. Except in certain situations, the Inner Circle never see combat. Instead, kill squads are sent out, groups of third circle operatives directed by second circle operatives, all of which are compartmentalized.

Now, let's look at the effects this would have. Literally anyone could be a traitor. And all those traitors and spies could also be innocent. Frankly, Voldemort could run his operation with perhaps only 10 people, and simply have a network of imperioused fighters. After all, the imperious cannot be detected. There were two times that execution was a serious possibility canonically. Just after the war ended, and right after Voldemort's resurrection. After the war ended, they had swept in, and dismantled a lot of Voldemort's power structure. You then have loads of people, of whom maybe 10% are actually guilty. You cannot execute them all, and there is no way to prove guilt in that situation. So you jail the obvious ones, and just leave it at that. They could have killed them all, but given public perception, not only would it do no good, but it would set a very bad precedent and create a potential scandal, if it ever came out that they had executed an imperious victim.

After Voldemort was resurrected, Dumbledore really couldn't do anything without having a bad time. Even without him trying to execute prisoners, canonically he was ousted from literally all of his positions. He could well have been thrown in jail himself, and almost was.

TLDR:Canon does not explain enough about the situation to judge it, and from the facts presented, one could easily come up with a canon compliant scenario which explains the reasoning. Yes, you can paint Dumbledore are evil or obsessed with second chances, but there is not nearly enough evidence for that to stand up on its own.

****** It's not true though. In the Wizarding World, they have proof of the existence of souls and an afterlife. See: dementors and the resurrection stone. In such a case, where you know that the person in question has not just ceased to exist, then the death penalty is far less of an issue. In fact, dealing out death in war is far less of an issue. I would even say that the death penalty is better than life imprisonment in that case.

But what I'd really like to know is if insane people like Frank and Alice Longbottom are still insane in their afterlife.
