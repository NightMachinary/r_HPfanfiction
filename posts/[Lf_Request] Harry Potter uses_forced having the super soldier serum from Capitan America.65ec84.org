Harry gets the S3 and The infinity formula, his magic acts as Vita-rays, he eventually gets the title of Union Jack (The Spy-Buster/Super Soldiers from the UK)

I would love to see more especially if Harry actual does some solo adventures rather than playing sidekick to all the adventures of the Avengers
