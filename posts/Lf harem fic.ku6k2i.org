Anyone got any harry/harem fics where he ends up with the daughters of "dark" families that need his protection after he kills voldemort?


** There is linkao3(Witches of Westfield by EJDaniels) where Harry takes in a number of witches after the war, the first being Daphne Greengrass.

  The war is over, Voldemort was defeated and the summer draws to a close as the new school term begins. Harry must decide what to do with his life. Will he return to school for his 7th year, be an Auror...or something else? Read along as Harry finally has control of his own life...or does he?
