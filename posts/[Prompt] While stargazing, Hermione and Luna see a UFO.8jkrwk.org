A scene of any length is fine, so long as the encounter is shown and the discussion thereafter. It also doesn't matter when this is set, so long as it's after OotP, so the girls are friends

Requirements:

- Luna's knack for uncomfortable truths

- At least one mention of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack

Bonus:

- Hermione is convinced it's aliens but Luna is skeptical

- The girls are actually abducted by the aliens

- The aliens ask Luna for directions because Hermione's too stunned to speak coherently

- Accurate astronomical notes--constellations and all that


** could be a nice fusion with Strangetown in Sims 2

** Bonus points if it starts off with Hermione thinking aliens and Luna says something like "That's crazy, it's obviously just a muggle military experimental craft."

Hell, make it a Stargate crossover and that one of our spaceships or something and they can both be part right.

*** Harry Potter and Stargate...hmmm...

I know that Avatar: The Last Airbender makes for a excellent crossover with Stargate, but for Harry Potter....hmmm....

Okay, what if the girls are abducted by aliens and rescued by Stargate?

** I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person here who still wants to see this. I feel like there should be some sort of mention of Heliopaths in this story, since that's what Luna would associate floating lights in the sky with.

*** I always figured fiendfyre was the source of Heliopath sightings.

Luna described Heliopaths as "great tall spirits of fire that gallop and burn everything in their path."

That's sounds pretty fiendfyre-y to me, and I'm curious if Hermione ever offered it as a completely reasonable explanation for the existence of Heliopaths.

** Ah heck, I'll write it myself...

"Luna, remind me again why you wanted to watch the stars tonight?" Hermione stiffened a yawn. It wasn't unpleasant weather, but being up on one of the rooftops near Gryffindor Tower was not how she expected to spend her evening.

"Because stargazing is the favorite hobby of the Pastel Kakapo. If we're lucky, we'll get to see them."

"Yes...I suppose I hadn't thought of that." Hermione felt a twinge of annoyance followed by guilt and then more annoyance. She'd grown to appreciate Luna's courage and compassion. But the girl still went on about her father's insane theories printed in /The Quibbler./ Yes, it had printed Harry's interview when nobody else dared to but all that other nonsense! The Crumple-Horned Snorkack and the Blithering Humdinger and whatever nargles were! And what Xenophilius else had done...trying to sell Harry to the Death Eaters.

Hermione didn't hate Mr. Lovegood. That wouldn't be fair at all. He'd been scared and desperate to get Luna back. Hermione wondered what she would have done, had she been in Mr. Lovegood's shoes. Or Luna's shoes, for that matter. Hermione doubted Luna would have accepted her father trading Harry to the Death Eaters in exchange for her freedom.

On the subject of shoes, Luna had apparently decided that she had no need for them. The Ravenclaw--who spent most of her time with Gryffindors, now that Hermione thought on it--lay on her back, her bare feet dangling.

An hour passed. And then another. Luna paid little attention to any of the constellations, except for several she had apparently made up herself. The nerve! All the work she'd done for Professor Sinistra, and here Luna was, pattering on with such nonsense! And she was exhausted! Why should she have had to come here? Why not Ginny? Or Demelza? Hermione longed for her cozy bed in Gryffindor Tower.

Hermione felt her patience ebb away to nothing. There had been no sign of anything all evening. No hippogriffs or thestrals. Not even any owls. And certainly no Pastel Kakatows or whatever they were.

"Did you say something Hermione?" Luna's voice was still sing-song and cheerful.

"Yes!" Hermione snapped. "There are many things I would like to say!"

"Oh?" Luna asked quietly. "What are they?"

"This is ridiculous!" Hermione shouted. She was angry, and she didn't care. "You're ridiculous! Spending your nights looking for things that don't exist!"

Luna's brow furrowed. "I've told you before, there have been a lot of people who saw these things! Loads of people have seen Crumple-Horned Snorkacks and heliopaths and--"

"Shut it!" Hermione cut Luna off. "You're a disgrace to Ravenclaw, going on about all that nonsense! How can anyone be so stupid?! Did your mother drop you on the head when you were a baby?"

Luna averted her gaze. "Please don't talk about my mother like that Hermione."

"What about your mother anyhow? Does she know you behave like this? Is she disappointed?"

"No..." Luna sounded close to tears.

"And another thing!" Hermione hesitated a moment. She and Harry and Ron had agreed to never tell Luna about what really happened that day at the Lovegood's house.

Before she could finish, there was a sudden glow. Bluish-green and very bright. A shiny disc flew across the sky and hovered in place.

"Oooh," Luna murmured. "What pretty colors."

The disc hovered, then darted this way and that, and then loop-de-looped and then did a figure-eight and then darted away, fast. Far, far too fast.

"So pretty," Luna said. "Hermione," her tone once again dreamy. "What do you suppose that was?"

"I...." Hermione blanked. There was nothing like that in nature. It was too big and too fast and the colors...and it couldn't be a Muggle plane. The magic at Hogwarts wouldn't allow it.

"Luna, I think...that may have been a UFO. An alien spacecraft."

"Hmmm...no, I don't think so. That doesn't make much sense."

"Luna! You are the last person on earth who can say something doesn't make sense!"

Before Hermione could say anymore, there was another sound. And a flash of light -- more blue light.

And it was getting closer and closer!

It was a...tiny plastic spaceship? It looked smaller than a Quaffle. And it was blue and white and hovering in midair.

And then a tiny voice spoke out, as if on a megaphone,

"Hermione Granger! Luna Lovegood! We need your help!"

A giant green grabbing hook shot out from out of the little spaceship and Hermione felt herself being grabbed around the middle. She heard Luna give a small squeak and then Luna grabbed her hand.

They were being pulled and pulled and then they were inside the ship. All the walls were greenish. A hand touched her shoulder, but it felt bigger than Luna's.

"Are you alright, Miss?"

Hermione's jaw dropped as she set eyes on a giant penguin. In an orange space suit.

Hermione fainted.

"Oh dear," Luna murmured. "Poor Hermione. Her head is full of Wrackspurts."

**** Thank you! I was channeling [[/u/Full-Paragon][u/Full-Paragon]] a bit by the end, I admit.

The idea is that Hermione isn't normally that mean in canon, but because it's 2 o'clock in the morning, she's exhausted and far more irritable than she would normally be.

If I do a Part 2, that's actually going to be brought up.

*** *Part 2*

Hermione awoke with a start. Luna was the first thing she saw. Her large silver eyes were somewhat shiny, but she was smiling her dreamy smile.

"Oh, Luna." Hermione groaned, "What a dream. We were stargazing...and there was this alien spacecraft. And then there were these...huge penguins."

"That wasn't a dream, my dear." A tall, skinny penguin with large glasses peered at the girls. "You fainted just a moment a go. I think Captain Zidgel gave you a bit of a scare."

"Well, sir. It could be a dream. And you saying that could also be part of the dream. Or it may not be Hermione dreaming. I could be dreaming. Or you, Mister..."

"Fidgel, Miss Granger."

"You know my name?" Hermione asked. She vaguely recalled her name being spoken over the little megaphone. But how did they know that?

"Why, of course. You're in our book!"

"Book?"

Luna smiled, "They have a book with names of people that can help them help others. The Penguins go around the galaxy helping people. Justin Finch-Fletchy told me about them once."

"I think he was describing a cartoon."

"Hmm....well, maybe we're in a cartoon."

"And I, Zidgel, Captain of the Rockhopper, welcome you! Welcome, Hermione and Luna!"

The penguin who Hermione had seen first was back. He smiled smugly, but didn't seem unfriendly.

"Now, we need your help! There's trouble in the Spiral of Solidarity!"

"What? I've never heard of any Spiral of Solidarity! That wasn't in our Astronomy Class."

*Meanwhile, back at Hogwarts*

"I'm telling you, I saw a spaceship!"

The first year, Billy Joe McGruffey, tripped over his feet trying to catch up to Headmistress McGonagall and Professor Sinistra.

"I'm not kidding!"

"Mister McGruffey, you are unwell. We must bring you to Madam Pomfrey."

"Professors! Please! It was blue and white and it looked kind of like a football."

"And it plucked up Miss Granger and Miss Lovegood?"

"Yes!"

"What's going on here, Professors?"

"Ah, Mister Finch-Fletchy. Kindly escort Mister McGruffey to the hospital wing."

"Yes, ma'am."

"Justin! Luna and Hermione got taken by a spaceship!"

"What?!"

"There was a big green hook! And the ship was blue and white!"

"Uhhh...." Justin hesitated. "Did you see the aliens?"

"Not really. I mean, I think I saw some orange suits, but I didn't see who was wearing them."

"It's real." Justin whispered. "Oh dear God, it's actually all real. Of course it's real. Why am I surprised? We have dozens of ghosts, and hippogriffs fly in the garden and house elves do my laundry. Next thing you know, my vegetables are going to start talking."

"Uh, Justin, are you okay--ow!" Billy Joe tripped over his own feet and knocked out his two front teeth.

"You are one clumsy kid."
