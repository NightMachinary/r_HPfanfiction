I'd prefer to have minimal romance in them if possible, and still readable even if I don't know the other fandom. That's all, thank you.

  Hermione realized it began with a sense of Impending Doom and finished with a battle outside her tent. Now, she has to decide between staying and helping Robb Stark and the Northern army or returning to her universe. And that line is getting harder to see the longer she's in Westeros.Part One: Chapters 1-19Part Two: Chapters 20-31Part Three: Chapter 32 - ongoing
