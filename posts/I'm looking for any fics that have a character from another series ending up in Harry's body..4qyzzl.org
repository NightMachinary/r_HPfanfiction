I've seen a couple of fun crossovers with Naruto where Sakura or Madara end up as Harry and I'm looking for others.

  When Loki fell from the Bifrost he was expecting the cool embrace of oblivion, not to become a spirit and then be ripped apart and forced into the mind of a six-year-old named Harry Potter. With no physical form, he must keep the boy alive if he seeks to keep existing, and everyone knows that the best way to ensure continued survival is to simply become greater than everyone else.

  Sakura awakens in the early morning hours of October 31, 1981 with a blinding headache and a mental passenger. She has no idea how she's become this boy-child Harry Potter, but on a scale of weird things that have happened to her, it ranks only slightly above "ancient demon goddess defeated by the power of friendship". She'll persevere in a way the Wizarding World is not expecting.

  Gabriel might have made a mistake when he borrowed pagan weapons to make a fake angel blade, but he'd thought it would be enough to trick Lucifer. Well, it was, but now the archangel find himself set adrift on another Earth. With his Grace almost gone and unwillingly possessing Harry Potter, what can Gabriel do? Maybe Hogwarts will be enough to distract him...
