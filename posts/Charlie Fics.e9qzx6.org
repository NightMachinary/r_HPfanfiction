Can you guys rec me your favorite Charlie Fics? He's not a character you see very often and I want to read more fics about him.


** Can't remember the name of it, but there's a great one that's Charlie/Oc (slash) in Romania. Iirc the author had created a bunch of OCs in a stand-alone universe involving the twins and their childhood best friend being a muggle. I read it twice in the last year so when I get home I can look it up if you're interested.

** I ~ kind of ~ like this one [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/21690799]] certainly not the best but it's okay. You might have to read other stories set in this series as it gives you a better idea of how the whole pureblood society works in this fic. It's completely stand alone though and doesn't connect to other stories

** The Sparrow Suite by Red Garden Gnome\\
linkffn(12858961)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
It's unfinished, but the writing is excellent. Also, it's one of the few stories in which Charlie and Hermione don't like each other right off the bat.

Nocturnal by Red Garden Gnome\\
linkffn(12243730)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
It's completed, and about Charlie and Hermione beginning a relationship with each other after the war.

Games are Afoot by Grumpy Grizzly\\
linkffn(3993848)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
A classic Charlie/Hermione staple in its respective community, it's a very well-done story though unfortunately, the latter half of the story (namely the last three chapters or so), feels as if the author simply didn't care to put in as much time or attention as she (?) did to the earlier chapters.

A Pleasurable Kind of Torture by Allotropism\\
linkffn(8417149)\\
[Charlie, Hermione]\\
This is a very good one-shot of Charlie and Hermione that's fun to read every now and then.

Also, sorry that all of my recommendations are just of Charlie and Hermione. But, I do like them as a couple.

  Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger can't stand each other, not one bit. This feeling may have been compounded by the fact that she broke his nose. However, when the duo accepts dual teaching positions at Hogwarts, a relationship forms then deepens. Meanwhile, a Forbidden Forest mystery unfolds. Non-epilogue compliant.

  It began when Arthur and Molly are out of the Burrow on Order business and Charlie and Bill are home to babysit. Fred challenges Hermione to think of something fun for them to do and she teaches them a muggle game. But, it continued and the games are afoo

  Oneshot. When Charlie suggested to Hermione to try being a little naughtier, he wasn't exactly expecting her to interpret it quite like that.
