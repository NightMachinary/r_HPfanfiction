** The best currently updating SI by an insane margin is linkffn(What's her name in Hufflepuff).

I can also recommend linkffn(A curse of Truth)

*** A Curse of Truth is the prime example of wish fulfillment-y Gary Stu SI fanfic.

BUT it's well executed and is really fun to read. Its definitely one of my top guilty pleasure re-reads.

  There's still a lot to explore and experience in a world full of magic even if you never become a main character. In Hufflepuff house, you'll make friendships that will last a lifetime. Also, we have a table of infinite snacks. Self-Insert Gen/Friendship

  An avid fanfiction reader falls into the Harry Potter Universe just before the Triwizard Tournament, and has to come to terms with what he's lost, take advantage of what he's gained, and figure out how to deal with the truths he's hiding. Complete! Detailed rune magic, witty banter...not your usual SI, so give it a shot! See my author page for more info.

  Most self-inserts are exercises in vanity, and nothing says 'vanity' quite like Gilderoy Lockhart. But with a new personality and knowledge of the future, who knows? Maybe Lockhart will turn out to be a useful DADA teacher after all.

** How dead set are you on it being a reincarnation fic specifically? As opposed to say a HP character going through time and dimensional travel, which conceptually hits essentially all the same notes as a reincarnation fic outside of the "being a baby/toddler/young child" portion.

If you are ok with the latter I highly recommend Face Death In The Hope by LullabyKnell (and the alternate PoV companion fic) which is not only one of the best fics of its genere, but IMO one of better/best HP fics I've read in general

  Harry looks vaguely nervous, scratching the back of his neck. “It's a really long story,” he says finally, almost apologetically, “and it's really hard to believe.”“Try me,” Regulus says, more than a little daringly.

The premise is simple, the author is inserted in Hogwarts, sorted in Ravenclaw and has some sort of curse that makes him incapable to tell anyone the books' plot which makes one of his first dilemmas deciding to fuck cannon or be a bystander and go to a desert island with a harem of Veelas.

Well, this is probably one of the best SI. Learning magic is actually interesting and ends up having a great payoff, there is absolutely no romance, great conversations with Dumbledore, the OC support cast is not boring and some trolled Golden Trio.
