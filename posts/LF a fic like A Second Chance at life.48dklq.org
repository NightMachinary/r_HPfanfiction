So I finished both of the first 2 parts, and when I got to the 3rd I saw that it had been abandoned and I was really disappointed. I really liked the idea of blood magic and all of the other strange magics that exist in this universe. Edit: No slash please!


** I've never read it myself, but I've read other commenters in this sub talk about how the Saving Connor series has a lot of unique takes on magic. The series eventually features HPDM slash, if that is (or isn't) your thing.

*** Thanks for the suggestion, but slash isn't my thing. I probably should specify that not that I think about it

** My suggestion for this would be googling something along the lines of "fics like a second chance at life" i know theres a community like this that you may run across (which i never remember its name). You may also run into other posts like yours, ive seen quite a few in the past.
