:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It's a Harry x hermione fanfiction and I think it was over 30 chapters long. Harry stays round hermiones for Christmas. They end up going shopping with her mum and dad. And one thing I can remember was Harry wanted to give gifts to an orphanage sonhermiones dad went with them. And her dad got somewhat jealous that hermione went to Harry for help with one of the children instead of him. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks

  Set during OOTP. The story of how Hermione's innocent suggestion of running a Secret Santa with the DA leads to the ultimate search for the perfect presents, an unexpected change in holiday plans, late-night mistletoe-kisses and revelations of profound feelings hidden deep down. Total HHr.

  If you are forced to participate in a competition that's reserved for adults only, doesn't that mean you should be considered an adult? Harry gets some much needed help and advice before having some fun by allowing his marauder heritage out to play. H/Hr

  Despite how impossible it seemed, Harry was sure his dad had saved the three of them from the dementors. After Hermione's time turner took them both back three hours, he was desperate to discover if who he'd seen casting that patronus was truly his dad. Harry certainly wasn't disappointed when his mum turned up instead, and changed the entire course of his life. Harry/Hermione
