I love Severus Snape in all his bullying snarky demeanour. I'm trying to imagine Ghetto Harry in an argument against Professor Snape. Against Draco. Etc.

Sassy Harry: (this is just an example I made up, so you get what I mean by sassy)

Professor Snape: Potter where would u look if I told you to find me a bezoar?

Harry: Depends who was poisoned. If it was Malfoy, I wouldn't look anywhere. I'd tell you to go get it yourself.

Witty Harry:

Professor Snape: Potter where would u look if I told you to find me a bezoar?

Harry: In a potions apothecare Sir. I would need money to buy the bezoar, as well as payment for running the erand.

I would love for Harry to have some sass/wit/ghetto sass/ghetto wit.


** Canon Harry already is like that, but it's easy to forget, because a lot of fanfic authors do.

** linkffn(In Which Sirius Can't Tell a Story to Save His Life by SilverWolf7007) is a good one-shot with sassy Harry.

  Remus orders Sirius to tell Harry a bedtime story. Harry, however, is fifteen and would really rather just go to sleep. Oh, and Sirius's story sucks.
