Hi! I'm looking for fic where /either the good or the bad guys/ get rid of every non-magical.

I'm talking /Rise of the Wizards/ destruction level. No muggles left behind. Ideally a complete fic.

*** Ok I finished it. It was pretty good, but the whole Godlike!Harry&Ginny and not-quite-Trump felt a little too heavy. (anvilicious?)

I'd loved an epilogue.
