While researching occlumency for a fic, I have repeatedly asked myself this question.

Harry does seemingly learn some form of occlumency, given he can kick Voldemort out of his mind in OotP in the end, but I'm reasonably certain that had more to do with him channeling love and grief born of love, both of which Voldemort can't stand. And when he is grieving Dobby, he doesn't get any visions from Voldemort. So would that same technique to protect his mind work on somebody who doesn't fear love? And if it would, would Snape be capable/willing of teaching that method to Harry?


** The short answer is: We know too little. Maybe the way Snape taught it was bullshit, maybe it was perfect. Maybe it does require some "Je ne sais qui" that Harry simply doesn't possess, and he is only ever effective against Voldy.

Point is: We don't really know.

You were probably aiming for /Je ne sais quoi/.

** Harry was not in a good head space during OotP for a number of reasons - Dumbledore was ignoring him, Cedric had just died in front of him, Umbridge was at Hogwarts and literally torturing him every night, the Wizarding World thought he was an attention seeking liar and he was worried about Sirius all alone at Grimmauld Place. Oh Yeah and EXAMS No wonder he couldn't clear his mind - he might have been able to do better had he not had so many external stressors (IIRC Snape wasn't too horrible to Harry during their lessons - snarky yes - he even gave Harry a back handed compliment when he managed to break into Snapes mind).

** Canon Snape couldn't teach a frog to jump. He'd insult it for having warts and tell it the instructions are on the blackboard. Why would you expect him to be able to teach a probably-complex topic like Occlumency to someone he hates?

** There was a thread on Occlumency recently with a lot of good headcanons proposed ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/89zk7h/thoughts_on_occlumency/]]). I have a somewhat dark take on the Occlumency, in that if the training doesn't hurt, you're doing it wrong. This is because what the attacker can send at you is only limited by their own imagination and squeamishness, and if you aren't ready to shrug off the worst of it, they'll get through.

** My personal headcanon is that it would never have been possible. That is, Harry could have mastered clearing his mind and whatnot, but given that the connection was a soul piece stuck in Harry's head, the attacks came from within - it was not an external influence, but an internal one. Had Harry not casted /Sirius' Greater Grief Shield/, I think Voldemort would have slowly gained more and more access to Harry's mind, eventually using the connection to either drive Harry insane or to subvert his actions.

I just think of Snape and Dumbledore in a floccinaucinihilipilificationa comic, with Dumbledore going "Just teach him occlumency or whatever"

*** I don't think that's right. JKR's explanation for why Harry couldn't manage Occlumency was that it clashed with his personality too much. Not to mention, Snape is the absolute worst person to teach him the art, his skill at the art isn't even a factor since it's supposed to be about Harry.

** I'm not even sure Harry actually wanted to learn it. I mean yes, they told him he should, but for him he just saved Arthur's life, Voldemort's visions were something he could use to protect his loved ones and to find and destroy Voldemort. + yeah Snape approach not being exactly what it takes to make a student really wanting to learn...

** According to JKR, the issue was Occlumency clashed too much with Harry's character, unlike with Malfoy's ability to pick it up easier.

#+begin_quote
  "...I think Draco would be very gifted in Occlumency, unlike Harry. Harry's problem with it was always that his emotions were too near the surface and that he is in some ways too damaged. But he's also very in touch with his feelings about what's happened to him. He's not repressed, he's quite honest about facing them, and he couldn't suppress them, he couldn't suppress these memories.
#+end_quote

I'd also say that having Snape be his teacher made it definitely impossible. Even if Harry would otherwise want to learn it, he and Snape's mutual hatred of each other just resulted in inevitable failure. From the beginning, Snape's explanation to others was Harry was in remedial potions, and he clearly took more pleasure in breaking into Harry's mind (and Harry's dislike of learning from Snape) would obviously not work, just look at their relationship in Potions class.

** Harry was letting Snape into his mind, a very vulnerable place that was already somewhat damaged from Voldemort's visions. Snape does not like Harry, and even if he wanted to help, which I doubt he did all that much, that instinctive dislike would have tainted his efforts. Trust and neutrality would be needed for best effect. Snape teaching Harry would be like using a rusty nail and barbed wire to sew a wound closed. Yeah, you might get there in the end, but it's prone to infection and probably hurt more than the wound itself did.

** I think it depends on if we decide if Snape was trying to teach him or not. If not: then he was probaly harming him, or atleast opening his mind more.

If he was; we can guess that repeated attacks might teach the mind to defend against intrusions like a knee-jerk reaction, as a quick automatic way to escape visions. -this is most likely very basic defense as volde using legilimens on snape with automatic defence of kicking volde out would probaly get snape killed.\\
Therefore snape have to have a defence that is not reactionary. Harry is not taught this, so harry will not be able to defend from others.

Or: repeated attacks will make the brain create shields and/or train the brain to better push out attacks, but nothing else.

Depends, what is occlumency? Shields? Misdirection? Mindscape?
