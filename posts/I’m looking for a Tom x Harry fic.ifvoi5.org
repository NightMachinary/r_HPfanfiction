:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only thing I remember is that Tom took Harry on a date to propose to him. And the date took place in a restaurant that was created from a tree and nymphs were the waiters. I can't stop thinking about this and haven't been able to find it myself. So help is wanted.
