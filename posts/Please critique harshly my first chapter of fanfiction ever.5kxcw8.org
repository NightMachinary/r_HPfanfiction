** I won't be overly harsh, but you've got a lot of things you need to improve.

Mostly it's basic grammar stuff and separating ideas into more cohesive paragraphs to make your work more readable. For the grammar basics, read [[https://faculty.washington.edu/heagerty/Courses/b572/public/StrunkWhite.pdf][this]] (/Strunk and White/, The Elements of Style).

I'll comment on your document line by line to highlight other things, my display name is Mr Palatino or something like that.

** Before I judgte this overly much, where exactly do you want to go with this story?

Why did you have this kidnapping scene? Only to make Harry a hero? To make Harry, /a wizard/ with access to brooms, floo and well... simple trains, find transportation on a god-awfully slow tanker to Albania? Is that woman gonna play a role afterwards or is she a mere damsel in distress for our hero?

**** And taking a cruise on a ship isn't boring? Just write that he's flying straight line to Albania. MAke it one or two paragraphs, and its done.

You really don't need to make it boring.

****** That's all great. However, it still kills my suspension of disbelief that Harry would choose a tanker. As in, I would have just closed the tab if I'd read it as I would any normal fic. It just doesn't make sense. At all. Its a really slow, tedious way of transportation. You not only just told us that Harry is capable of using a car, but there is also the railroad or the plane, if you have to have a muggle transportation in there.

Plus, and this just came to me: Why should we give a damn about that girl? I, as the reader, have no relation to this girl. Zero. By all probability, I also won't care about her when Harry sets out to rescue her from the Snatcher's clutches. She is the blandest a damsel in distress can possibly be.

**** u/InquisitorCOC:
#+begin_quote
  I figured that all forms of magical transport were under control and Harry can't apparate or make a portkey let alone international floo. Flying all the way to Albania on a broom is a bit boring.
#+end_quote

Why couldn't Harry apparate? He and Hermione disapparated in Godric's Hollow right in front of Voldemort's eyes without being tracked. Are you modifying canon elements just to make life difficult for your protagonists? If so, you need to write detailed and reasonable explanation why that's the case, or else readers/reviewers are going to tear into your story.

Next, you think cruising on a tanker is less boring than flying a few hours on a broom. That doesn't make any sense to me. A better explanation would be that Harry wanted to avoid all forms of magical travels because the Ministry/Voldemort implemented tight monitoring.

Anyway, it still came back to how they did that.

****** Harry can apparate just fine as of book 6 (enough that Dumbledore trusted Harry to side-along himself after the attempt to collect the locket.) Harry also apparates in book 7, he just doesn't have the license to do so legally.

The distance thing is mostly fanon. I don't believe the books once put any sort of limit on how far someone could apparate themselves. And again, Harry managed to transport both himself and Dumbledore to Scotland from wherever that cave was. I'm assuming England, not ridiculously far from London as it was where the orphanage took Tom Riddle and the other children for holidays. A popular limitation authors like to give is "Apparating across the English Channel is too far!" but that distance is /far/ smaller than the distance between say, London and Scotland.

** It's a bit rough, but you've got some good pointers already. My main concern is where all of this is going? Perhaps some exposition between Harry abruptly leaving Ron and Hermione behind and stumbling across an attempted kidnapping immediately after? Let him wander around a bit, thinking about his situation? It seems odd and contrived that there's a critical plot point literally right outside his front door at the exact moment he leaves home.

I know that you want to get to the meat and potatoes of the story, but try not to skip straight to it.

**** I admire your desire to put your work out there. Over the years I've had tons of fic ideas but have always been too lazy or chicken to flesh them out into real stories. Just the fact that you're open to criticism is awesome. :)

** Something that hasn't been mentioned, but all of your characterizations of speech are volume related... have it be a low pleading voice or a high-pitched screech, a gravelly voice, a soft voice or even a thunderous voice. Not just a loud voice or a quiet voice.

Unless you are setting Harry up as someone who is a little "harder" than cannon, he likely wouldn't spit on someone. Even then, it's a weird way to behave, have him kick one in the stomach or break a nose or something. Spitting is kind of a weeny "hard" reaction.

** The best advice I can offer for fanfiction writing: strive to write just like someone you admire. A lot of fanfic writers strive to write like JKR, or some of the well-known authors on this sub. Read your chapter with an objective viewpoint. Does it sound like something you'd read by Inverarity or nonjon? If not, what can you do to change that?

To reiterate some other points: work on grammar and punctuation. There are online guides that you can check out to fix those small mistakes, but if you have too many of them it will put readers off.
