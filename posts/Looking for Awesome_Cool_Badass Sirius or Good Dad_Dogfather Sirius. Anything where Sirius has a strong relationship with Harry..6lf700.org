I want any stories that prominently feature Sirius in a good light. Anything from serious stories to crack fics are welcome.


** linkffn(A Marauder's Plan by CatsAreCool) is the most in depth Harry and Sirius father/son relationship I have ever read. The story is brutally long and drags horribly at points though. It is complete and the plot is good though.

** A series by [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/4684913/MarauderLover7][MarauderLover7]] has a good Harry/Sirius relationship. Long books (first book was 450k, second and third like 170k each) currently on book 4, but it starts with ffn(Innocent by MarauderLover7).

Basically a story about Sirius escaping from Azkaban when Harry was 8 years old to take him from the Dursleys and prove his innocence. I think the first story goes all the way through first year. Has some interesting developments and adds an OC character or two- I have been criticized in the past for recommending the story cuz others found it dull and criticize the author but I remember being very caught up in it when I discovered it. The fourth book is a WIP and is slowly updated, usually a couple times a month.

** Sirius features prominently in my story "Patron", an AU where he is exonerated in Harry's third year, and goes on to raise Harry (while dealing with his own troubles caused by his time in Azkaban) and do his part in the war against Voldemort. He's also a POV character in another AU of mine, "Divided and Entwined", where he leads the progressive faction in the Wizengamot and fights Death Eaters while raising Harry.

*** "Hermione wondered if her and Wells being 'true muggleborn' would make those muggleborns born to magical parents 'fake muggleborns'."

Since you're the author I figured I would just tab back and ask - do you mean squibs here?

**** No. In this story, "muggleborn" and "half-blood", and "pureblood" are purely legal definitions. Magic doesn't give a damn about anyone's parent, and there is no magical way to determine someone's blood status.

"True muggleborns" are wizards and witches born to muggles. In this AU, those are very rare - about one is born every two years in Britain. "Fake muggleborns" are wizards and witches who inherited their status from their parents - either with two muggleborn parents, or born out of wedlock with one muggleborn parent. Since purebloods aren't allowed to marry muggleborns (unlike half-bloods, which purebloods can marry as well), Lily and James lived in concubinage, and Harry was legally a muggleborn, but after Halloween 1981, Dumbledore had the Wizengamot pass a posthumous adoption that made him a pureblood. Other ways of becoming a pureblood exist as well.

(And yes, that system is as unjust as it sounds (even if the vast majority of muggleborns lives just like the vast majority of purebloods since custom changed over the centuries), and the characters don't accept it. It's just that Voldemort is a kind of more urgent problem.)

#+begin_quote
  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
