  The Gaunt Family Ring kills Dumbledore? Tragic. Sirius Black acquires the Elder Wand, Resurrection Stone and Invisibility Cloak at the same time? Unexpected. His animagus form gaining tremendous power as a result of becoming Master of Death? Also unexpected. Sirius using his Grim form to terrorise Death Eaters? Hilarious.

*** Maybe not. What about Death?

Death would have to be portrayed as an entity, and Sirius of course didn't escape Death, but became an Omen.
