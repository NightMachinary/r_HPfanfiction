Genre, pairings, number of words? These thing matter not.

Not so long as the story itself is a [[https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructionFic][deconstruction]].

Deconstruction of what? That does not matter either! Be it cliches or legitimate tropes, I want to see some broken, shattered, their flaws exposed. Be it a serious work or a cracky mockfic, provide me with recommendations, oh Redditors!

​

As I said before, any kind of deconstruction works for me, but I'm feeling particularly visceral about soul bonds, "mates" and friendly goblins, so I'd be particlularly grateful for parodies of those.

​

In case of longer works where the deconstruction is only a part of a fic, I'd appreciate the number of the chapter it's in, if that's not too much trouble.
