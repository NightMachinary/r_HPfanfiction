Do you know in a fic where they set up a relationship in the train ride in first year, usually between Harry and hermione e.g Harry crow or Harry and daphne e.g I am not a hero, I would love a fic where it is set up like that but you Harry ends up with someone else.


** Yes, civilized break-up is something which almost never happens in fanfiction stories, and it is pity. Boy and girl can never decide that they just don't work well together and they could stay on at least polite (if not even friendly) terms. The only exception I can think of is Harry/Cho split in “The Accidental Animagus by White_Squirrel” linkao3(14078862) and my own exercise on this theme in “Late Morning Talks” linkao3(20141410).

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family---and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4.

  Exercise on reasonable breakup of Hermione and Ron (and Ginny and Harry in the background). Written as criticism on too often used stereotypes in Harmony stories. Without any longer plot.
