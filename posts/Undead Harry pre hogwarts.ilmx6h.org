Pretty sure it was on either [[https://ff.net][ff.net]] or ao3 but it starts when harry is 7, and he is dead.

hes half ghost and half zombie ghoul, (harrison and harold recpectively)

harrison posses the body most of the time, and he lives in a cemetary, I think in magic tree house.

also harrison is super smart and harold can barely speak, so yeah.

anyone know what it is send help plz.

Thanks
