Oh dear lord was that fic good, but it sort of massively destroyed my heart. I'd really like some fic recs, preferably Remus-centric, where there's a proper happy ending, but not necessarily a happy middle (love me some good angst), and a strong focus on the friendship and slice of life elements.


** I've not read that fic, but a slightly Remus-centric fic is the Dangerverse, starting with linkffn(Living with Danger) I love it, and the 5 book series has many twists within. The family that develops is central to everything.

  Non-magical modern AU - Marauders/WolfstarSirius attends a charity rock gig organised by his best friend's girlfriend, and the tall, quiet bassist catches his eye...Basically just a thing I wrote after listening to Belle & Sebastian's 'Dress up in you' a million times.Quite sexy.

  Sirius Black and James Potter are successful and famous tattoo artists. Their manager Lily insists they hire a piercer to cover their busy schedules, and Sirius does not approve of that idea even slightly.This fic is now completed, but there's still sequel action going on at Marauder Ink 2: Black and Grey(if you think there's a tag missing/something I've overlooked, please get in touch - either comments or on tumblr (jennandblitz) and I can update things!)
