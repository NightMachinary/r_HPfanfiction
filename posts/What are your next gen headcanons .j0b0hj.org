** Harry and Ginny had planned on four kids, but Ginny refused to get pregnant when she heard Harry's name ideas: Tom Vernon for a boy, Petunia Bellatrix for a girl. Inspired by /It Takes Two Parents to Name a Child/ linkao3(21603985)

In all seriousness, though, I headcanon different names for Harry's children. I headcanon him as a good father who doesn't project the past onto the next generation ("just like your father, but with your mother's eyes").

  Harry tries to name his children. Oddly enough, Ginny gets her own say....

** The Cursed Child does not exist.

--------------

- Teddy Lupin: Hufflepuff, Prefect.

Teddy Lupin, son of Remus and Nymphadora, was raised by his grandmother Andromeda. He has a close connection with his godfather Harry. He is very cordial, especially with students who lost family members to the War. Has an /extremely/ strong sense of justice that drove him to be an iron fist of defense against bullies. He joins the Aurors, but this is due to a desire to be a part of the /cause,/ rather than actively seeking battle.

While in school, Teddy amuses himself with his Metamorphagi abilities by taking on the form of any one of his boys in his dormitory, so that they could play the role of twins in a vein not unlike Fred and George Weasley.

- James Sirius Potter, Gryffindor

Delighted to be the son of heroes, James Potter is more than a little obsessed with glory. He is talented, but not particularly hard-working. He has a wide social network, making allies and connections and collecting favors across the school. He's popular with classmates, but distant from many of his cousins and has few people he can call /friend./

While never straying anywhere near blood purism, James believes that skill is inherently tied to moral worth. He's good at things so that makes him better than others--but this comes to a head when Harry sends him to spend a summer with his Muggle cousins.

This becomes transformative when he watches Dudley's eldest son break up a fight despite being out-numbered four-to-one.

He realizes that his philosophy is wrong and develops a new one--Might for Right and Right for Right.

- Albus Severus Potter. Hufflepuff

Unlike his brother who delights in their family name, Albus is terrified of not measuring up to the past. Not just the name "Potter," but also the names "Albus" and "Severus."

In this, he's quite similar to his Uncle Ron, only on a more pronounced scale. He was sorted into Hufflepuff partially due to this and because of his admiration for Teddy Lupin.

Unlike Ron, who didn't try many new things, Albus tries many new and different hobbies to find something he's good at. It takes him a long time to find his niche. Amusingly, he is dreadful at Potions, but he becomes very skilled at Ancient Runes.

He's very close with his little sister Lily and Rose is his favorite cousin.

- Rose Weasley, Hufflepuff.

Rose joined Huffepuff /by choice,/ out of fidelity to her favorite cousin. Rose is markedly different from her parents.

She's distant from her mother, who is very involved in the Ministry. Rose, by contrast, despises government and bureaucracy in general and finds inspiration in Muggle philosophers like John Locke.

An excellent student, her very favorite subject is Herbology and she has a special bond with Neville because of it.

She loves reading for its own sake--often falling asleep in the library, though her favorite place to read is outside the Herbology greenhouses. She is never without either a textbook or a storybook.

She is small for her age, so she often ends up the butt end of jokes from Albus and Hugo, who are much taller than she is.

Careful to avoid breaking any other rules, Rose despises wearing shoes and goes barefoot at every opportunity. Part of this is due to rebelling in the silliest way possible, but mostly, she likes the way the grass tickles her feet when she gardens.

- Hugo Weasley, Gryffindor

Hugo is fascinated by story and myth and the name Hugo. He has a passion for revolutionaries and carries around a copy of /Les Miserables./ Due to the size of the book, nobody notices that it isn't a textbook.

Like his mother, he is meticulous and organized. While he's a very good student, his speciality being able to push Rose's buttons, for his own amusement.

He knows exactly how to make her scream, how to make her squeal, how to make her laugh.

Inheriting Ron's height, Hugo was able to out-wrestle and out-rough-house her by the time he was six, and he never misses a chance to tease her.

Any argument Hugo has with Rose usually ends up with Rose pinned by Hugo as he pokes her in the ribs while she shrieks with laughter.

Their dynamic is not antagonistic though--Hugo's teasing is always in good fun and unlike Fred and George, or before them James and Sirius, Hugo is adamant that he never make someone cry, not even his shrimpy big sister.

Frequently, Rose can be seen helping Hugo with his homework, but it's more common just to see them sitting next to each other and reading.

- Fred Weasley II, Gryffindor

Despite being fascinated by pranks, he spends too much time on the technical breakdowns for the "perfect prank" that he never actually has time to pull them.

As a result, all the professors think Fred's the most well-behaved Weasley of the lot. He finally manages to pull the absolute perfect prank--jinxing every single student and staff member at Hogwarts simultaneously the day he graduates from Hogwarts and thus immune from detention.

#+begin_quote
  Beginning immediately after the Epilogue, this story follows Scorpius, Rose and Albus through their Hogwarts years and beyond. Childish fears and desires soon turn to more serious dilemmas as some members of the Ravenclaw trio are forced to grow up too soon. Albus wants to be remembered for being something other than Harry Potter's son. Scorpius knows his father expects him to follow in his footsteps, but how long can he keep his friends, his music and his OWL in Muggle Studies a secret? And Rose has yet to decide what she wants...
