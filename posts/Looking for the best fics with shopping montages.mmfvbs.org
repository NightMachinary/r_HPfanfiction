*** Now that you've put this in my head, I'd like to see a one-shot of Dobby shopping for himself now that he's got a paying job. What would he buy (besides socks)?

**** I can see him buying literally anything that is either a) brightly colored or b) has a fun pattern. And they just keep getting more ridiculous the longer he shops.

*** Harry screws up the adoption ritual. Instead of becoming Harry's elf, Harry becomes Dobby's human. Dobby accidentally becomes Lord Doby Potter-Black-Gaunt-Greengrass-Slytherin. His first purchase? Why plenty of clothes for his new servant obviously.

** I don't have any suggestions but I'm following this now. Definitely will read any suggestions people have! I love reading about the magical world when there isn't a war happening. It's just so interesting to see how authors imagine it as well as the amazing canon ideas that JKR wrote!
