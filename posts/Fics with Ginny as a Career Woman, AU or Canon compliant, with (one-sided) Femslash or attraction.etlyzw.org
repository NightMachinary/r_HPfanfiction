Im interested in Fics that have Ginny proceeding for a great Career. It can be Canon, so she becomes a great Quidditch player and might at some point change the direction or it will be (partial) AU with her choose a different Work. Whould be good if she gets an assistant or something like that and said Person develops feelings for Ginny (or vice-versa). Maybe it would be a Mutual attraction. It wouldnt be Limited to Femslash, so Ginny can enjoy other Men aswell.
