** I apologize in advance that you're the catalyst for this rant.

The idea that people would never try exploring or exploiting something because 'everyone is afraid of what might happen' is utterly contrary to human nature. We will stumble into anything that seems interesting, with doubled enthusiasm if someone else has warned us not to, tripled if the reason for the warning is 'we don't know what'll happen'. Lab safety is an invention of the late 20th century; even though the scientists in the Manhattan Project were the most advanced physicists of the time, they really weren't sure how far you had to be from a radioactive reaction to only absorb non-lethal levels. A few were even concerned that setting off the device would ignite the entire atmosphere. 'Well, that'll be interesting, Enrico. Are you staying for the test?' 'Of course.'

Whenever someone suggests that prior generations were more gun-shy about risk, I recall the tales of [[http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/10/time-me-gentlemen-the-fastest-surgeon-of-the-19th-century/264065/][Dr. Liston, fastest surgeon of the 19th century]].

From the linked article:

#+begin_quote
  His style may have seemed careless, but in the age before anesthesia, speed was essential to minimizing the patient's pain and improving their odds of surviving surgery. Slower surgeons sometimes had pain-wracked and panicked patients wrestle free from their assistants and flee from the operating room. Only about one of every 10 of Liston's patients died on his operating table at London's University College Hospital. The surgeons at nearby St. Bartholomew's, meanwhile, lost about one in every four.
#+end_quote

By modern standards, great inventors and pioneers of their field were almost universally insane. Or fearless. Same thing, really.

*** Surprised you linked Dr Liston without mentioning

#+begin_quote
  Liston's most famous case Amputated the leg in under 2 1‚ÅÑ2 minutes (the patient died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene; they usually did in those pre-Listerian days). He amputated in addition the fingers of his young assistant (who died afterwards in the ward from hospital gangrene). He also slashed through the coat tails of a distinguished surgical spectator, who was so terrified that the knife had pierced his vitals he dropped dead from fright.

  That was the only operation in history with a 300 percent mortality.

** Some stories have the theory that the moment you travel to the past, it creates an alternative world which deviates from the moment you arrived. There's quite a number of them. One which I read recently is Draco Malfoy and the Philosopher's Stone. It was recommended in this subreddit itself.

  A few years after the Battle of Hogwarts and everyone is struggling to adjust to all that's happened with the war. The one having the most trouble is Draco Malfoy, who faces scorn from everyone, as well as every other Slytherin. He tries to think of a way to fix things, to make things better, to maybe...maybe make up for all his mistakes.He devises a plan to go back in time to the very beginning. To where he first met Harry Potter. If he can befriend him- Really befriend him, then maybe things could change. Slytherin could be seen in a more positive light, he and Harry could be friends, and he could stop Voldemort sooner. He didn't know everything - not all of it, but he knew enough to make a difference.To save lives.If he was able to do that one thing...sacrifice all his years to save so many people- To do something with this life, well... Wasn't it worth it?

** If you want paradox free time travels, try fics with the following forms of time travels:

- Travelers sent their memories back and wiped out their own time line.
- Travelers ended up in a parallel universe X years to their past. That universe might be different.

But as far as time-turner travels are concerned, I've found only one in which the travelers significantly changed past without causing a paradox:

** Your question is phrased kinda curiously. A "paradox" isn't a physical "thing" that will stop you from changing the past. At least that's not the right way to think about it. A paradox as a concept is used to explain why certain types of time travel can not be possible. It isn't a matter of just trying it out and seeing what would happen... the whole idea is inherently nonsensical.

There are only 3 ways I can think of that avoid time travel paradoxes:

1. Traveling to the past is impossbile

2. Time is internally consistent and unalterable... there's only one chain of events through time. If someone can travel to the past they will already have done so and the timeline includes the consequences of their actions (I think this is what JKR had in mind)

3. Alternate universes - but it is fair to argue that this is not actually traveling through time.

** I'm looking for a type of time travel where time is linear but where the future doesn't exist yet, and therefore is ever-changing. Where if you travel to the past then it becomes your present and your future isn't written. Almost similar to the way it works in the TV series 'continuum'. Just because the future you came from existed when you were there, doesn't necessarily mean it will exist when time passes again. Just because your in the past as an adult doesn't necessarily mean the past you will live to be a teenager, and if they die before coming back, you won't be affected. It's not alternate reality, it's a byproduct of the fact that the timeline is linear though in ends in the present, and the moment one person travels back the future doesn't exist anymore so no one else can. I want that in Harry Potter.

Say, there's an 8 hour buffer or whatever, in which the future is still present, because magic is predicting it, natural divination, I'll call it. And if you go farther back then that, then the future beyond your present buffer no longer exists, and you can change it as you will.

But you don't, because your afraid of a paradox. Weather or not one will actually happen is irrelevant to the magical world. I want a fanfic where some Muggleborn, say, hermione, desides to try it and see what happens.

It doesn't necessarily have to be a good fic, anything will do.
