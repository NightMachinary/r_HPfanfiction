[[https://m.fanfiction.net/u/3489773/][These fics]] are pretty good. 8/10 for fanfiction. Summary: Voldemort, instead of making horcruxes, chooses the political route for power. Now, due to Tom Riddle being a political powerhouse, only purebloods go to Hogwarts. FemHarry is the same age as Sirius's son, Archie. They look somewhat similar, so they switch spots. Archie goes to school in America where FemHarry was going to go, and Harry goes to Hogwarts, and they pretend to be one another. Seems like a poorly thought out plan, right? Well, they are 11. As time goes on, their lies compound and they go to increasingly extreme lengths to hide their ruse.

This story has a fairly /huge/ wizarding world. TONS of lore for those who are into that. Now, there is one huge problem with this story, so just hear me out: it's got the 'magical cores' trope. Before you close the tab, I just want to point out that this story was first started in 2011, at the height of 'magical cores' popularity. It was last updated 23 days ago, so it's been consistently updated for 7 years. It's pretty fleshed out, and even if you don't like that trope, it's an excellent execution of that sort of thing.

I just wanted to recommend this because I've never seen it recommended here before. It's definitely worth sinking your teeth into, in my opinion.

** It does get rec'd here occasionally, but not often. I try to recommend it for a different fem!Harry perspective or when people want more in-depth potions.

Other turnoffs for people might be the overly nice Slytherins, Pureblood manners, or nice Snape, in case anyone gets triggered by those.

And while I'm quite pleased it updated recently, that update came after 1+ (2+? Can't remember) years of radio silence, so I wouldn't assume it's going to continue regular updates :/

*** There is a Discord now for fans of the series and there has been an inkling in it of there being only two scenes left for Violet to write for this upcoming chapter. I have high hopes.

** It's definitely a good story. I've rec'd it on here myself before but it definitely seems a bit underrated.

My main problem is that the two main characters start out as "very* advanced 11-year-olds but I'm prepared to overlook that.

The OCs are excellent, and I think Snape is done particularly well - the grudging respect he comes to hold for "Archie" is developed realistically.

Oh, one other minor thing: I wish the chapters were shorter. It's definitely not a "just one more before sleep" thing or you'll still be awake in the middle of the night.
