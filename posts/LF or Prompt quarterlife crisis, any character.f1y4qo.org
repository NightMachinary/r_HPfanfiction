I want to enjoy some fics about characters going through a "quarterlife crisis" - like a midlife crisis but in your twenties. I had one last year (well, it might not exactly be over lol).

I've been thinking about how in the Wizarding world, you enter adulthood at 17/18 once you've graduated Hogwarts and how some of the characters got married and had kids shortly thereafter. But surely some characters are struggling with the transition to adulthood, especially in hilarious and endearing ways? I'm looking for something that feels as comfortable as turning on the TV for an episode of Friends or Seinfeld, but also something that has you pulling for that character while they're going through it.

I would prefer someone from Harry's generation, but really I'll take anything. Any House will do. Bonus points if you work in inter-House friendships and characters who aren't as high profile, just because I think those concepts are fun.


** The only one I can think of right now is linkao3(Holly Potter and the Midlife Crisis), where fem!Harry becomes the cleaning lady for Avengers Tower.

  “The first group I sent over made the Avengers uncomfortable by thanking them constantly and asking for autographs. The next group stole things to sell on ebay. The group after that didn't even get through the front door because Stark's security system found something in their background that we missed. The fourth group left traumatized after cleaning out Thor's room, apparently the god had some beheaded poultry dripping blood into a bowl in there. Then after that every group I've left hasn't lasted more than three days because of some problem or another. I'm pretty sure one of those assholes has made it a game to scare my workers away.”“I don't think you're supposed to call the heroes of New York assholes.”Or, cleaning up after the Avengers involves more than just getting blood stains out of the carpet and most of them can't take the heat. Thankfully the Savior of the Wizarding has spent the last decade cleaning up after Death Eaters, so she's up to the task. Nothing, not pranks, bird corpses, or unidentified slime will keep her from cleaning up.

*** hmm that's an interesting premise...not sure it's up my street by I appreciate you taking the time to give a recommendation :)

I'm actually a few chapters into my own piece which deals with life in one's mid-twenties (but it's Pansy-centric and I know she's not exactly everyone's favorite lmao), and I wanted to read from the perspective of maybe a Ron or a Neville because other people are way better at writing them than I am.
