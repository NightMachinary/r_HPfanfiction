Considers the Two example we have from the canon story Tom Riddle and Teddy lupin both Inherited their parents abilty (and if they wen't just flukes than Abilities like Metamorphmagus, Parselmouth, ect should have been a hell of a lot more common in canon).

Edit: Any stories were the Genes for Metamorphmagus, Parselmouth, ect are dominate genes instead of recessive genes (note I am on the side that thinks that these abilty have nothing to do with genetics)


** Well Tom Riddle isn't quite the same, because his maternal line were all Parselmouths. It wasn't buried by inbreeding. And Teddy had two half-blood parents, and Dora's pureblood parent did not have any abilities.

I'd say the ability probably came through Ted's line, since Muggleborns are descended from Squibs.

*** Parselmouth in Canon seems to have been for want of a better term a recessive gene, even then considering Salazar Slyhterin lived 1000 years ago there should have been a hell of a lot more that just Harry and Tom Riddle(Really just Riddle since in Canon harry got the abilty from the bit of Tom's Soul).

I am personal not a Fan of Muggleborns being descended from Squibs, I feel like It takes something away from the MuggleBorns instead of being something new they instead something old and dead that was revived.

I feel like the Muggleborns are descended from Squibs is the Argument a pureblood would make.
