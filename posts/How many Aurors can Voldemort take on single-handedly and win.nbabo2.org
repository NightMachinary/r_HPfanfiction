Assume that Voldemort does not have the support of any death eaters near him and Dumbledore is also not in the fight. I assume that a total number of Aurors should be around less than 100 for the British Ministry of Magic. The Battlefield is an open ground with no noticeable hiding places. Voldemort is at his canon power level. Assume that both Aurors and Voldemort want to exterminate each other at all cost and are not going to flee from the Battlefield. Aurors and Voldemort don't really have the time to set up an anti-apparition ward so everyone can apparate around Battlefield. Everyone only has their wands with them.

In my opinion, assuming every Auror of the Ministry participates which amounts to around or less than 100 people, I think Voldemort can kill them without exerting much effort. He can cast massive Area of Effect spells like Fiendfyre. He likely knows a lot of dark and destructive area of effect spells like Fiendfyre and can use it to kill lots of people in a quick time. He likely wouldn't duel one on one. He would most likely apparate around and fire destructive spells in groups of people and kill lots of people with a single spell. He can also fly without any support with Magic alone. That's probably his biggest trump card. He can just bombard them with destructive spells from very high in the air and the Aurors wouldn't be able to do anything. The Aurors would most likely scatter in the Battle and then Voldemort can apparate to a single WIzard and can go one on one duels which none of the Aurors are likely to win against.

First of all, I believe you are really overestimating the total number of Auros in Magical Britain. We can't know for sure since Rowling, just like with the total wizards population, didn't give us a clear number (is 3000, 5000, or even 20 000 . . . ?), but I still think the Aurors should be a really limited force.

In fanfics, some people like to compare Auror to "Magical Cop", but their job is in fact a little more complicated than that. In Canon, an Auror job is both to arrest Dark Wizards, and to protect VIP. A good example of that is Dudley who was first charged to arrest Sirius Black, and later asked to protect the Muggle PM during the war. Other, more "mundane" tasks are taken over by over Offices of the Ministry of Magic (Magical Patrol, Misuse of Mugle Artifact Office . . .). Hell, even the arrestation of Dark Wizard may not be the job of the Auror (who would just have to find them) depending of your opinion about Hit Wizards (separate Office, or 1st version of Aurors before Rowling coined the term?).

Anyways, my point is that Auror are an elitve force, who probably have very limited number. I personally believe that they are around 15 to 20 during the war.

​

Now, concerning your question, if we assume that the Death Eater are, in term of power, comparable to the Aurors (by taking the Battle of the DoM as an example since Aurors/ Ex Aurors made up around half of the Order's during the Battle), and that Voldemort is also around the same power than Dumbledore (as seen by their duel), then we can say that the Aurors would cope against Voldemort just as well as the Death Eater against Dumbledore.

During the Battle of the DoM, the Death Eaters didn't even try to fight. The second Dumbledore arrived, they knew they were fucked and tried (unsuccessfully) to escape. I believe the same situation would apply in a Auror Vs Voldemort fight, with a maybe even worse defeat because, unlike Dumbledore, Voldemort would not even take the time to arrest them and would just use murder.

Now of course, the number of Aurors (and their willingness to fight) may change things a bit (10 motivated Aurors would last longer than 3 terrified ones). But even if they put up a good fight, I don't think the totality of the Auror Office would be enough to take down Voldemort. Their only hope would be to last long enough for some help to arrive.

​

One problem to my theory would be Kingsley who, with the help of McGonagall and Slughorn, managed to hold Voldemort back during the Battle of Hogwarts. But not only did they lose in the end, I also assume that he only manage to last as long because of Harry's protection after his Sacrifice.

​

Tldr : I don't think there are enough Auror in Magical Britain to win against Voldemort.

** Flying doesn't stop people from casting spells at him., unless he's so high up that no spells can reach him, in which case he shouldn't be able to damage the aurors either.

Setting that aside, the 100 aurors would win-- at least one of the is bound to hit him with an AK. He'd likely kill a bunch of them too. But the overwhelming force should just pound him with spells until one hits.

** iirc Voldemort took on Slughorn, Shackelbot and McGonnogal(sp?), 3 top tier wizards/witch, with Harry's sacrificial protection helping them and still came out on top.

Voldemort is a beast.

** All of them. There likely aren't enough to win against him. If I know diplomacy, the moment they thought he was going to come back the death eaters probably started pushing for budget cuts.

** 1. We don't know, because we have no good data on the effectiveness of different battle charms, so we can just guestimate. One fact we have is that aside from Dumbledore (which is not a good measure), we know that joined force of Kingsley/Slughorn/McGonagall got him to stall in the last battle as well as joined force of Luna/Hermione/Ginny was not quickly overpowered by Bellatrix. Of course, we don't know how these duels would end, because both of them were interrupted before their conclusion.

2. I don't think those overpowered charms like Fiendfyre are of much use inside of the building and amongst the people. They are as useful having A-Bomb in the building.

** It depends on the skill of said aurors. I would imagine he would have trouble with 4 or 5 Kingsley's, though he might take down 10 Dawlishes with little sweat.

The thing is, when fighting large numbers, long sustained fights against big numbers are difficult. Those 10 Dawlishes might find an opening at some point, the key is in how quickly can Voldemort incapacitate opponents. Opponents who are good at dodging and staying in the field are more of a threat than those with low defense.

** The thing with Voldemort is that, while he is undeniably a great duelist (he takes on the three most powerful good guys alive at the of DH and wins and he is on par with Dumbledore with Elder Wand and draws), but it's just not Voldemort's style. A lot of the fanon doesn't seem to realize that Voldemort is extremely secretive and he was like that even as a kid. He relies on stealth tactics and inspiring fear. Despite being quick to kill, I think his worst fate would be ruling over a throne of corpses because then there would be no one to fear or admire him.

However, I think that if he'd go against the whole Auror department, he would probably take them one by one or force them in a situation where they'd die. I don't think he'd cast a mass destruction spell because that would draw too much attention to him. Might even elicit a response from ICW. Besides the only mass destruction spell we see in canon is Fiendfyre but that's very volatile and hard to control and I think that that's why most mentally functional people avoid it.

** A good way to answer this question is to reframe it.

"How many soldiers can a normal wizard take on single-handedly and win?"

The reason why this is useful is simple. The Statute exists. That Statute must exist for a reason. We already know that non-magicals have a significantly greater population than magicals, even at the time the Statute was enacted; the flintlock ignition system was a thing in guns by then, making them more reliable. So the only conclusion at the time the Statute was enacted was that magicals were /not/ confident that they'd win in an all out conflict with non-magicals. (I'm not really going to comment on who would win between the two, but I will say, no matter who does win, both sides would likely take heavy, and perhaps devastating, losses for that win).

With over three hundred years of firearms developments, not to mention tactics, it'd be safe to say that against a similar number of non-magicals as you expect Voldemort to be against Aurors, that normal wizard would be toast. Those non-magical soldiers might take heavy losses to achieve that, but all the same, that wizard would not survive an encounter with up to 100 trained soldiers.

Back to the question at hand then.

Voldemort against 100 aurors, Voldemort loses.\\
He has knowledge of advanced dark magics, and he has power to back that up. But he is also against Aurors who are, ostensibly, 'Dark Wizard Catchers', which is literally one the first descriptions applied to 'Auror' in canon. 'Dark Wizard Catchers' therefore implies that they are trained to deal with dark wizards, and have ways to either mitigate dark magic being used on them, or knowledge of dark magics enough to directly combat dark magics being applied against them.

Those Aurors also have numerical superiority, which is a quality on its own. For Voldemort to win, he has to kill or incapacitate /all/ of his opponents. But only one of those Aurors has to get a lucky hit in. Given that Voldemort has been shown to hold his own against only three combatants (Kingsley, McGonagall and Slughorn), we can assume that his ability to combat multiple opponents is finite, even if he's willing to use area effect spells. This means that there are way more Auror's in this fight than Voldemort can reasonably deal with.

In short, a combination of dark wizard combat specialisation, and numerical superiority would result in Voldemort's defeat. Though I would grant that those Auror's would likely suffer heavy losses for their win.
