The year is 2138 (AU in which the cannon timeline is pushed up almost a century) and the Statute of Secrecy is greatly endangered, with new technologies developed by muggles magicals ended up actually having to learn and understand how they worked to keep their existence a secret, which was bad because it cut a lot the time and resources they had to develop their own magic.

The situation is rapidly becoming unbearable and different groups are giving possible solutions, ranging from removing the Statute and trying to live alongside the muggles (proposal regarded as a pipe-dream), Going to war and mass killing muggles (while there are some discussion about the applicability almost everyone is squeamish about killing up to 10 billion human beings for basically only existing) or to leave earth behind and try to colonize other world.

The third option is the most palatable for everyone, problem is that actually moving the many species and objects needed to continue their society in a spaceship great enough to keep everyone alive while terraforming a planet is a nightmare in organization and resource management, so the technomages and Unspeakables worldwide come up with a potential solution, instead they would just create their own pocket dimension already ready for moving in. And so started the process of creating Yggdrasil, a supposed ‘DMMO-RPG' of great complexity that made greater success in the muggle world. The actual goal of the game however was to program a virtual reality and slowly use the magic of all magical beings connected into it during decades to make the codes able to stand by themselves stably until they could cut the servers and still keep an independent, fully formed and self-sufficient dimension separated from their usual world

To develop the new world they combined things from their own world and magical system, muggle pop culture, history, legends and pieces and bits of other games of the same style that had success previously among pure wish-fulfillment (creating rules to allow things that were completely impossible in their own world, such as real resurrection and immortality) and a healthy dose of pure unadulterated sadism to make things interesting, plus a long period of time diligently taking suggestions of those ‘playing' the ‘game' (both muggles and magicals) into account, resulting in the most successful game of their age. Since they had the chance of making their character as they wished many used this time to experiment a little and choose the sex, species and classes that better suited them.

Then finally came the big day and they programmed the servers to turn off automatically before entering the world and started their lives into the new world... the societies already living there were a bit of a nasty shock though, as was the entirety of Nazarick, suddenly Momonga actually has a reason to worry about other players in the same level and higher than his, especially since many of this ‘players' had a hand into making Yggdrasil.
