Summary: Luna picks up Ginny's diary and starts writing to Tom. He can't seem to persuade her to give him back to Ginny, but how is he supposed to become stronger on a diet of references to Golden Flue Sprouts and ruggy tree gnomes?!

It's obviously a humor story, but as the author's notes state, not a crackfic; there is (eventually) a plot. The author has finished it at last :)

  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasley loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Not crack. I repeat, not crack ! Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

** Kind of goes in a weird direction when the plot kicks in. I think it was better when it was just Tom and Luna writing to each other
