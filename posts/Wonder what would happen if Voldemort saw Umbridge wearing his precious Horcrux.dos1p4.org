Exactly what it says on the tin, any thoughts?


** Recipe for Umbridge a la carte:

One Imperius, hold the prison sentence. Move the toad to a dark location. Liberal application of Cruciatus, mind the screams. At peak croaking, legilimize till a drooling mess. Quick application of an Avada Kedavra once thoroughly annoyed, toss the toad in boiling, bubbling potion - its not eye of frog, but should work well enough.

Fly over to the Dark Lord Supply Store - Aisle 8: lake water, necromancy, and snake paraphernalia. If all out of snake charms, thoroughly lose your mind until in a frothing rage (warning: side effects include wanton destruction and mass murder, keep away from children under 17). Panic like a school girl and race to other aisles to check if your other supplies are still available. Grab every available object in aisles like a madman, brutally slaughtering within a 50 meter radius (for more details, see every store 1 day before a natural disaster hits the area...or Black Friday).

Once satisfied, decide whose head to serve on a silver platter for the next coarse. Weasels and ferrets are highly recommended as follow up dishes.

** Avada Kedavra for Umbridge, then he goes to the sea cave to find out what happened. He checks the other horcruxes and discovers the ring is missing as well. Realizing that someone (Dumbledore probably) discovered his secret, he hides the horcruxes in an even more secure location. Perhaps a moleskin pouch that he would carry on himself at all times.

*** Probably true. And while reading about Voldemort killing Umbridge with extreme prejudice would be fun, I think it'd probably scupper any hope for the good guys of taking him down.

**** Yep. Totally would be cool for those 5 seconds before things go to hell in a hand basket. If Harry et al can actually steal it before he escapes, then they /might/ have a chance, but only if they get to the other horocruxes first.

***** Perhaps a story where Voldemort asks about the locket stolen from Umbridge when she's making a fuss about it? That way they've basically got all except the diadem and nagini? Just speculating here.

******** Or they get away with the cup fairly quietly, so it's the locket mission that goes poorly later.

Edit: Which is pretty much what you describe. Voldemort sees the locket, but Harry grabs it first, and escapes because they don't have the diadem or the snake. Voldemort then kills Umbridge. The plot then can still proceed without ending with "and everyone died".

********** It would be even more funny if Voldie used Avada Kedavra on Umbridge and hits the locket, ideally without knowing or realising. The horcrux would be gone. At the same time Umbridge does not die and styles herself "the woman who lived". :D

** I'm not really answering the question but your question brought something to mind. I think it's hilarious how Umbridge wore the horcrux continuously for a long period of time and still came out as evil as we saw her in OotP. Wearing it in breaks made the trio miserable and snappish at each other but she came out just as awful as we last saw her. In my headcanon the damn thing had little to no influence in her because she was so evil already.

*** I thought about this on my last read through of HP7. She is even able to summon her patronus without issue when she wears it, but Harry was unable to do the same while wearing the locket on his attempted food run a few chapters later. Definitely a subtle detail, but really interesting.

*** My headcanon is that the Horcruxes don't innately induce misery and stuff - rather, those things arise from either or of:

- The Horcrux trying to defend itself by sabotaging those it senses are threats to it or its progenitor's goals
- Conflict between the souls of the bearers and the Horcrux (in terms of worldview, mindset, magical Light/Dark, etc.)

Neither applies here - Umbridge is not a threat to it, and the form of the world she revels in is the one Voldemort induces...

**** It's a podcast! They read through the books chapter by chapter with commentary for each episode. Their most recent episode that I listened to this morning literally had like 20 minutes discussing what would have happened to her had Voldemort realized she had the locket. Funny coincidence with this post haha.

If you're into podcasts I highly recommend it, as well as Binge Mode. The Quibbler has a more negative, cynical outlook on some things compared to Binge Mode, but they're both well done and entertaining!
