I read a HPFF a few years ago with the most fascinating (IMO) horcrux lore but can't find it again. Couple clues: - The story was complete - Probably rated T or M - Remus travelled to Egypt to research Horcruxes - Turns out they were never meant to be bonded to inanimate objects but other living people - If the main soul died then the horcrux would take over the other persons body - The soul fragment in the diary ended up in Ginny when the diary was destroyed (not Harry b/c he was already a Horcrux) - Harry and Ginny killed the snake together in a vacant field so the soul piece in the snake couldn't attach itself to anyone else - Pretty sure Ginny and Harry both AKd themselves at the end when Voldemort died to get rid of his souls for good


** I've read this! I'll take a look for it soon and hope it's still in my bookmarks.
