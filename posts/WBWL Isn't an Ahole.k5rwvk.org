Does a story where the WBWL (or Girl-who-lived) isn't a prick, and actually becomes a good, friendly sibling to Harry, exist?

For extra points, I'm looking for long stories, starting pre-Hogwarts.

I like stories where Harry is relatively powerful compared to his peers, but this isn't a huge deal in this case as I'm mostly looking for the nice WBWL thing.

Relationships don't matter a whole lot, but when I say nice WBWL, I definitely do not mean incest (I'm sure this is a thing, somewhere.)


** Three Black Birds linkffn(13247979)

Harry's a few years older and the WBWL comes across mainly as an annoying little brother. James and Lily not so much, but they get better.

Unfinished, but the author wrote an outline for what he'd planned.

  When Voldemort attacked the Potters on Halloween, the wizarding world hailed Harry's younger brother Thomas as The Boy Who Lived. But were they right? As Tom starts Hogwarts, wheels are set in motion, assumptions are questioned, and lives are changed forever. Harry's two years older than canon. Story is complete through the 2nd task, the rest posted as outlines. Adopted by Ashabel.

** Linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived)

This link will take you to the reposted fic on fanficiton.net. It's not the real author and only 12 out of the 17 chapters made are posted here. If you want, you can find the original author and their 17 chapters pretty easily, though.

Anyways, not WBWL because his twin really is the one who took the curse. But it's generally got all the things you'd want. Harry is loved by his family but is hoplessly stuck in his brother's shadow. He goes to Durmstrang to get away from that reputation and gets stupid powerful. He goes into the dark arts but still loves his family very much. Which is what makes it so great. His path diverges from his family's with his /own/ choices and the consequences and benefits of those choices are properly recognized and dealt with within the fic.

Some of the best character and relationship writing I've ever seen in fanfic too.

Overall a great fic. It'll have you on the edge of your seat and it's difficult to put down. It is unfinished, though, and a lot of people aren't content with where it left off, me included (the ending of the 17th chapter, not the 12th).

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

***** There's a bit of Harry/Fleur during 4th year (and a summer or two) but not much outside of that. It's certainly not a main focus of the story. I wouldn't call it a canon rehash either, and I can get pretty fussy about those. Most of the main plot points from canon are still there, like the CoS petrifications and the Triwiz, but there are big differences as well, like having an intelligent, competent BWL rather than a muppet with felix felicis for blood like canon!Harry.

The WBWL does become an asshole eventually, but it doesn't happen until pretty late in the fic, like 4th year or thereabouts. It's still a thoroughly excellent read, though, as evidenced by the fact that I binged the whole thing in a day and a half. :D

***** Ur gonna be waiting a minimum of 7 years then, it's five and a half years old and is starting the fourth year. Just read it now, join the discord to get early chunk access, and read along. There's generally a chunk of a chapter each week or so. It's huge bc it's multiple Sanderson-length books, since 3 years have been finished. The worldbuilding is incredible and reading it as it gets published lends more weight to some twists bc of the almost episodic nature of fanfics. Imagine reading canon, having the insane twist that sirius is alive, and then u have to wait a week for the next chapter. The effect is lessened when u get to find out what happens next immediately, and speculating and theorizing is really fun on the sever. Give it a shot, I'll say that the beginning of the first book is very much the authors weakest writing, and u could really just skip to the start of hogwarts and then go back and skim over the pre-hogwarts chapters for added contexts. The story quality takes a massive upturn in the second year, the first one is very much a set up/introductory year, laying the chessboard so to speak. Second year is incredible honestly, and really cements the fic overall. Third is a bit bloated, since there was a lot of legwork that needed to be done, but the reveals at the end of the year were incredible.

I agree the author is fairly incredible... but the problem is, that the updates are not always within a week or so of each other... I d forgotten soooo many plot point by the time the author picked up the pace, that i had to read almost the whole fic again.. and its a lonnnnnnggggg fic...

that is why i decided, i am not giving up on this fic, but i am going to let it complete... because 1. if it doesn't complete the frustration will be much more severe than it is for smaller incomplete fics.. 2. I have the guarantee that I will have really good reading material to occupy me for a little while, and then I can put it out of my mind...

**** To be fair, the most impressive aspect of the fic is that there's a legitimate (in world) reason for Jim and James being total assholes, and the reveal is done in a way that really makes the progression of their relationship interesting and unique. It's the best fic when it comes to nuance, aside from Voldemort (so far) every character has fleshed out, sound reasoning for their behavior. From James' behavior, to dumbledore's politics, to the gauntlet of traps, the aurors never coming to investigate the basilisk, and even Peter Pettigrew and how sirius is still imprisoned in Azkaban. Everything makes sense.

** I feel like I'm always recommending this, but linkffn(Saving Connor) fits perfectly here.

Now, bear in mind this is a very long fic. And there is a good portion of the fic where Connor is a massive asshole - understandably, because he's 13 and his world is crumbling around him. But by the end I would consider him one of my favourite characters, and I don't think I'm alone in that.

As for your other criteria:

1) starts first year, but pre-hogwarts events are plot relevant and come up a lot

2) There are 7 books, and the series is very long

3) you will get a very powerful Harry, don't worry about that

** (New post with correct fiction) One of my personal favorite fan fictions is this one: linkffn(5957714) where Harry was kidnapped by wormtail and brought to Voldemort rather than him coming to kill him. James and lily live and the other son is called the boy who lived. Harry is raised by Voldemort and Bellatrix. The story is very good and has a couple sequels, one much better than the other.

  James and Lily have been put into a coma, Adrian Potter is the boy-who-lived, Dumbledore raises him and drops his twin at his aunts. Harry the twin brother of the boy-who-lived comes to Hogwarts and gets sorted into Slytherin. Harry is different from what anyone expecting and he holds a few secrets. Dumbledore bashing, select Weasley bashing, Hermione bashing. (HarryxDaphne)

  When Voldemort was vanquished, Harry inherited the Dark Lord's prodigious mental abilities but hides them for fear of attracting unwanted attention. His twin brother Jim inherited Voldemort's magical power and was hailed as the Boy Who Lived. Sound familiar? Check the title. Starts in Year 4. AU.

  Sakura was Konoha's golden girl, perfectly polished with a shiny smile to match. But as she looked up at him, playing at innocent with big eyes, plush lower lip caught between her teeth, Shisui thinks maybe he doesn't know a goddamn thing about Sakura Haruno. And that's almost as sexy as that super strength of hers. It's not love, but it sure is fun.

  HPLV. Harry Potter has been reborn again and again into new bodies as the Master of Death---but he has always helped to defeat Voldemort in each new world. Now his slightly older brother is the target of the prophecy, and Harry assumes his role is to support Jonathan. At least, that's what he thinks until Voldemort kidnaps him that Halloween night.
