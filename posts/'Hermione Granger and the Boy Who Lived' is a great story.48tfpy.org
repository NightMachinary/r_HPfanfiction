There is no magic in the story, but high tech, and Riddle is a mad scientist.

I would say it's even better than canon. Anyone else who read it share the same opinion?

***** It's interesting, as I think about it now, there are many fandoms which happily and (objectively) successfully remove the fundamental elements of the universe (non-vampire Twilight, non-19th-century-France Les Miserables) but I have never come across that in the HP fandom (or at least, its not nearly as prevalent). Anything can be changed, but you can't take away the magic.

****** Technically, this is a prequel to a story where the canon universe of Harry Potter has to deal with an interdimensional threat and contacts several parallel universes, such as this one.

Though I have to say that I did think the same - HP with magic is not HP. The story pulls it off though.

**** In the context of the fic I can understand why as a character she'd use it but as a reader I just got burnt out on hearing about Hermione course schedule, her course work, the way she triangulated the gps on the phone jammer through the means of interfacing with the transmitter blah blah blah, it was just too much and so boring to read at parts. Which is a shame because I liked the interpretation of some of the canon elements on a world without magic. Maybe I'll give it another shot.

** It's great. The subtle and not so subtle changes to canon are very well crafted. There are also tons of details about everything spy-related.

Among other things, it made me see the potential Ron had for greatness - and completely erased all the "Ron's a traitor, Ron's dumb, Ron's a coward, Ron's a bad friend, Ron doesn't deserve Hermione" influence from various fics. Plus, their romance was very well put together, with Hermione crushing early on, Lavender meddling, and parents trying to prevent their relationship.

Yeah...no.

No fanfic can ever be 'better' than canon. In fanfiction, you're using either the reader's connection to the world or the characters (or both, as it is in most cases). Creating this initial connection is one of the biggest challenges any author of original fiction has to face. But in fanfiction, this connection and familiarity is already there, created by the original author. As long as you're using this aspect, you're leeching off the original author, and as long as you're doing that, your story can't ever be /better/ than the original story.

I haven't read this story, but even if it is technically better written than canon (which I doubt), it can't be better than canon as long as it is using the characters Harry Potter and Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.

This is an utter non-sequitur. Loaded and prejudicial language ("leeching"? Really?) aside, why does an author borrowing concepts from another story inherently limit the "goodness" of the product to that of the things being borrowed from?

For that matter, how would that even work for crossovers? Is the fanfic "limited" by the better of the crossed-over settings, the worse one, or an average of some sort? It's silly.

*** Of course a fanfiction story can be better than canon. Improving upon an existing work is how many works of fiction we revere were created. Shakespeare, Goethe, many of the greatest authors used existing stories and tales as a base - they wrote fanfiction, you might say.

What you are saying is that an original idea can never be improved upon, which is plainly wrong. We see that each time in fanfiction even, when we encounter a good, original idea that was not perfectly executed.

Just because JKR wrote it doesn't mean it is perfect.

I love how you reduce picking off an entire cast of characters and/or an entire world to an 'original idea'. That's not an idea, that's years of somebody else's work. As with everything in this world, scale matters. Using a trope or an idea inspired by another work and using the characters of another work are hardly equivalent.

And this still applies:

Indeed. I certainly can't understand how you can take the setting, the characters and a major portion of what makes the story what it is from another one and claim to be better than it.

e: Also, since I suspect this is the part you're hung up about, Harry Potter can indeed be improved upon, as can any work. But you /still/ can't claim to be 'better' than it since a very significant part of it isn't your work at all. As long as that remains, you aren't the better writer and you work isn't better. The only one who can 'improve' upon it in that sense is the original author. And the difference between borrowing ideas and what happens in fanfiction is outlined above, so the comparison is not valid.

But it does mean that there is a distinct difference between borrowing ideas that happens all the time and what happens in fanfiction. Which was an argument you tried to make the first time.

See edit of previous comment. In any case, if the story uses my characters and my world, if it is relevant only because of my work and if it exists only because I allow it exist, then it loses any right to call itself better.

I was actually talking specifically. I was certainly not talking about any old piece of fiction.

And I did not say that no one can write better than JKR /generally/, of course there are a few more talented writers. But would fanfiction be better than what JKR wrote? No, precisely because they have not had the same input into the series that JKR has.

***** This is incorrect. The "quality" of a story depends upon the author's skull. Characters, plot, imagery, tone, whatever.

The inspiration for a story has no effect on its quality.

Example: Let's take a terrible book. How about, Twilight. If a good author took the basic concept and characters of Twilight, and wrote a great story, then that would be an example of the fanfic being better than the source.

The simple fact that the fanfic author didn't invent the idea of Harry Potter/Twilight doesn't mean that the fanfic will always be worse.
