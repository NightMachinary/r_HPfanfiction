Anything where Hermione is powerful, similar to the following:

-linkffn(The Arithmancer) defeating Voldemort by inventing tons of creative spells

-linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) becoming the most powerful Dark Lady in the world

-linkffn(Divided and Entwined) blowing up Death Eaters

-linkffn(Rise of the Dark Lady Hermione (adopted)) ruling magical Britain through the power of dentistry


** [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm#pt][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] is highly recommended if you like “Divided and Entwined” and “The Arithmancer”. That Hermione is a combination of the lethal warrior and genius inventor from these two stories.

*** I too highly recommend it, just with a couple of caveats. Due to it being a prequel of another series (and throwaway lines made in said series) names of a decent number of characters are different, but similar enough to be a bit frustrating until you get used to it (ie. Severn Snape vs Severus Snape)

Also, for a nonmagical AU, the plot sticks surprisingly close to the stations of canon, particularly in the earlier years. It's still interesting in how such things transfer over, but I think it's fair warning that it's not the 100% original plot one might expect

**** The weighting of the years is very different too:

Last two years take up 48% of all chapters, and year 7 alone occupies one third of the story length. For comparison, first three years together are only 58 chapters long, or 29% of the story.

***** Which is fair I think, given tbe last years have the most AU material (no magic kind of disallows things like being the Master of Death, or the horocruxes as they are in canon)

** - /Resistance/ by lorien829. Hermione is the main character, and pretty bad-ass IMHO. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2746577/1/Resistance]])

- /Harry Potter and the Witch Queen/ by TimeLoopedPowerGamer. Sadly abandoned. What there is, though, is worth reading. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8823447/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Witch-Queen]])

  After a long war, Voldemort still remains undefeated and Hermione Granger has fallen to Darkness. But despite having gained great power in exchange for a bargain with the hidden Fae, she is still unable to kill the immortal Dark Lord. As a last resort, she sends Harry back in time twenty years to when he was eleven, using a dark ritual with a terrible sacrifice. Canon compliant AU.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.

  This is a mix of genres, first and foremost it is a 'Fix It' story. There are also hints of 'Muggles do it better', and more than a little crack, with the BDA being one of the most feared organizations on the planet, along with a bit of fun with Tom Riddle's 'You Know Who' pseudonym. Clell62619 started it. I'm adding to it. I've taken it as far as I can. Feel free to write a sequel

  In an Alternate Universe where muggleborns are a tiny minority and stuck as third-class citizens, formally aligning herself with her best friend, the famous boy-who-lived, seemed a good idea. It did a lot to help Hermione's status in the exotic society of a fantastic world so very different from her own. And it allowed both of them to fight for a better life and better Britain.
