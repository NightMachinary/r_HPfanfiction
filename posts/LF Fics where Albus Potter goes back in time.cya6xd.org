  This is the companion novel to Backward With Purpose. I'd read that one first. This story is complete; the sequel has begun.

** His year one or Harry's? Because I'd actually be interested in angry brat!Albus seeing his dad being treated like shit and figuring out his issues.

Or maybe one of those Marauder era time travel fic archetypes where he goes back time and lives out all seven years in Harry's time, and has to experience through Voldemort's rise.
