:END:
In this fic Harry used the old wand of his mother. Snape noticed it and took it away from Harry at lesson. When Harry came with McGonagall to protest, Snape justified himself saying he thought it could be cursed or something because the last wizard to have it was Voldemort, and he gave it back after to run some check spells.

*** The first chapter has me interested because it seems like the author has really done their research. But the length is so daunting- over 200k!
