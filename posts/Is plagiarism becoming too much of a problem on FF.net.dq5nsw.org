** I'm pretty sure FFN has a very passive moderation team - I've heard that they only really do anything if someone reports something, and then they just take things down without thoroughly checking or following up with the author who posted the work. I've mostly heard this about things getting reported for mature content rather than plagiarism, but I would assume it's the same.

Report it when you see it, I guess, or move over to AO3. They seem much more proactive and transparent.

** I'm pretty sure it's just one person or group. Their usernames are always some variation of namesurnamenumber or mythrocker. Could be 2 people, but they update and post within a few of hours and in batches. So most likely just a single person.
