Doesn't have to be the main part of the story but I just want to read more about Neville. I don't read bashing (no matter the character) though so these are really hard to find. Any suggestions?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2736892/1/Becoming-Neville][Becoming Neville]] has a pretty strong Neville and Harry friendship (and if you're interested in a romance between the two, [[http://www.fictionalley.org/authors/jedi_rita/BN.html][this]] version of the story has that).

** in the perfectly normal series harry and neville become best friends and it doesn't really bash but it portrays some characters unfavorably. [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/346100]]

** Linkffn(Ressurexit) might be up your alley. It features Neville and Harry trying to hunt down Luna's murderer (in this fic Ginny died early and Harry married Luna)

  Ten years later. All was well ... until Harry's wife dies under suspicious circumstances. Harry will not rest until he has vengeance. Neville is tasked by the Ministry with uncovering the truth before the Chosen One does something he will regret ...
