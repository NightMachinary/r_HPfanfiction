Hi! What are some really well-written Snape fanfics? I would prefer him to be slightly mean/ruthless. Any kind is fine! THXXXXXXXXX!!!


** You might like some of [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile][my fics]]. They are almost all smutty one-shots, but if that's ok... The SS/HG fic /My Whole Existence is Flawed/ is good for the angsty dive into his mercy killings, and the SS/SB fic /Mapping the Dungeons/ is good for an ice-cold ruthless angle--he's willing to do just about anything for his innovative mastery of potions.

As for /mean/, I can give a strong recommendation for the SS/HG fic [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/641517/chapters/1163321][/The Marriage Benefit/ by miamadwyn]], in which the two of them are quite chummy, but he's got a really amazing rant for Hermione's rival and cuts her down brilliantly. This fic has some of the best /banter/ that SS/HG can offer.

**** Here's my works list at AO3 [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/works]] and my profile page where I recommend some specific works [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/jalapeno_eye_popper/profile]] The ones I rec'd above are maybe just a bit iffy on Rule 8 so I will respectfully ask you to look for them in those lists instead of link directly :)

**** Lots of Snaters in this sub who like to downvote-brigade anyone who likes Snape. I've seen the "Snape is a piece of shit" rants go by on the regular. Come over to [[/r/SeverusSnape]], [[/r/snape]], and [[/r/SSHG]] which are all nicer <3 but not as active.

****** Whoops maybe I'll add more whitespace and warnings about the explicit art at the end of /Mapping the Dungeons/. The same artist is working on something for my SSHG fic /Letters by Candlelight/ which is a little more tame, and I'll drop that into a separate chapter. But other than that there's no more surprise art hiding at the bottom of my fics so far. Most of my fics are either pure smut or post-war fluff, but /My Whole Existence Is Flawed/ stands out as having my darkest Snape. Thanks for following up :) :) :)

** I really like Of a Linear Circle, which is not Snape POV but does have quite a lot of focus on him.

  In September of 1971, Severus Snape finds a forgotten portrait of the Slytherin family in a dark corner of the Slytherin Common Room. At the time, he has no idea that talking portrait will affect the rest of his life.
