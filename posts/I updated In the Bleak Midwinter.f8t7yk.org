Fanfic authors rescue their favorite characters all the time, but poor Marius has been left as a burnt spot on the Black family tapestry for too long. And a few characters get all the ships. Doesn't Ron's great aunt Tessie deserve love too?

#+begin_quote
  After escaping from Merope in London and fleeing back to Little Hangleton, Tom Riddle had thought he was free of witches. He wasn't expecting yet another witch to turn up on his doorstep. This one seems different, but she too smells of Amortentia. Can he trust her when she tells him that she has brought him his baby from a London orphanage?
