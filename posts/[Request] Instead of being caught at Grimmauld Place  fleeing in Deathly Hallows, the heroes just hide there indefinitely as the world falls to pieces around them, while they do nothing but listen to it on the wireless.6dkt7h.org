I don't actually remember if they had a radio since it's been the better part of a decade since I read Deathly Hallows, but hey, it's whatever really.


** As in by choice? Willingly hiding out while their family and friends are slaughtered around them? Doesn't seem too realistic.

But if they're trapped in the house through some weird quirk of magic: forced to live out their days cut off from the world and people they love while hearing all about it, that could be cool. Depressing, but cool.

*** Man that would be so depressing !

The fidelius charm malfunctions so the only location they know of is Grimmauld place. They don't know the secret to the location of "outside". They're forced to live in the house for the rest of there lives with Kreature bringing them food, only knowing about whats going on through the wizarding wireless.

**** It seems pretty cool, but if Kreacher is leaving the house to get food, can't they side-by-side apparate with him? If my memory doesn't fail me, that's what they did with Dobby to get out of the Malfoys' house.

***** But Malfoys house wasn't under fidelius, what I was saying is that the fidelius would malfunction so that the only location they know the secret to is Grimmauld place, meaning that everywhere else is a secret they don't know.

*** Yeah, stories where characters just randomly start acting OoC always get clicked away from by me.

** The Legacy by storytellerSpW is one where they do just that, not necessarily by choice. It's an incredibly well written Harry/Daphne (those exist??) But unfortunately is abandoned. Still the character development and progression is excellent and I'd highly recommend it.

**** I know. It was one of my favorites, the slow progression of their relationship was a nice contrast to what is usually portrayed.

**** It's nearing to the end. At most 6-7 chapters or so are needed. And last time it was updated around March 2016.
