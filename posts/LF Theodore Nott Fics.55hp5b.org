** I would check out the author colubrina on ffn. Some of hers are Dramione, but she has several that aren't, and her writing is wonderful.

  Theodore Nott had every intention of ignoring the Marriage Law - the very idea the government could force him to get married was absurd - until Luna Lovegood smiled at him in the dingy office, tomatoes in her hair. ONE-SHOT.

  When Luna Lovegood and Theodore Nott use the same tree to read under during her fifth year they become friends but can romance survive when you're on different sides of a looming war? ONE SHOT.

  In a post-war world where Hermione is friends with Draco Malfoy and most of her friends have developed relationships with former Slytherin classmates, Hermione is single. However, when former Death Eater --- Theo Nott --- is dying, Hermione is guilted into marrying him to save his life. Rated M for language, violence, and sexual scenes.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
