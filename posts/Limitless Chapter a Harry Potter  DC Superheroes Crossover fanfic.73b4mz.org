** Tell us, why do you recommend this? What kind of crossover it is, an universe jumping or a setting merge? It's a crappy recommendation if you just leave a link.

*** I went and read the first chapter it's a Blended Universe, probable WBWL sub plot, Harry finds a piece of Kryptonite it changes him, breaks down the Horcrux, gives him TK but no magic. Squib, IDK if it's cause the Kryptonite or not but the author implies it's cause the Kryptonite.

Harry essentially acts like a Asshole to all the Male Heroes, especially Robin who seems to be the authors punching bag shouting about killing and making fun of the "Spandex while keeping mute about Raven's Leotard. Harry can essentially complete the entire plot solo so the other three male characters play caricatures of the characters we like, while the girls play sexy eye candy and probably Harem fodder.

*** That still doesn't Satanniel's question's. If you recommend a story you should explain why said story is worth our time to read, and why you felt it was good enough for a recommendation.

As Satanniel said it's a crappy reccomendation if you just leave a link, because all your doing than is, if anything, turning us away from the story, because who would want to read a story recommended by such a rude individual that he doesn't even have the grace to answer a question properly.

  All it took was one choice, a single decision to change the life and destiny of Harry Potter. It is because of this choice that a stronger and more powerful Harry is born, whether this will be good or bad is unknown, but one thing is for sure, it will certainly not be boring.
