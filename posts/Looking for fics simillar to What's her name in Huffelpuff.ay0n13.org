Recently read What's her name in Huffelpuff [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/whats-her-name-in-hufflepuff-harry-potter-self-insert.662488/]]

And now I wanna read something similar.

What I liked about the fics:

Protagonist isn't OP.

Characters had somewhat a realistic feeling.

It kind of slice of life but stuff is still happening.

It feels really close to the original books.

Its fun.

Hogwarts setting

Preferably with female Protag.


** From SB, there's this fic with a Ravenclaw MC. Mostly slice of life and fluff and a disappointing ending but still fun to read.

*The Doll Gamer* maybe, but it's a gamer fic so the MC will probably end up OP.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12980210/1/I-Am-Lord-Voldemort][I Am Lord Voldemort?]] is pretty good, my favorite so far.

** I was inspired by the Perks of Survival: [[https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-perks-of-survival-hp-si.311621/]]

It gets kind of cracky towards the end and its abandoned, but I thought it was pretty fun overall.
