In my opinion,it should be Seventh Hocrux, Black Comedy and Gryffindors Never Die. Do u think im right?


** Might be minority opinion, but the best stories IMHO are those that end well. The Black Comedy ended right where it needed to, and any continuation would just cheapen it.

*** Agreed, there are incomplete stories I would like to see finished, and sequel set ups I would like to see done, but I've not really seen any fully completed fics that I felt needed more.

** I don't know if it has ended yet because I read it a few years ago and was waiting for the next book, but Holly at Hogwarts is the love of my life! It is so well written and amazing to read! I stayed up so many nights so that I could read all that were released at that point

** Not exactly what you are looking for, but I quite like On Crimson Wings (I know it isn't generally thought to be the best), and I'm still disappointed that the sequel never finished.

The Historical Importance of Runic War Warding in England is one that I absolutely love and think was off to a great start, but seems to be abandoned at this point.

Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool had an epilogue but the author did set up for a sequel, was a great OP story and I'd have loved to see it continued.

I'm sure I have others, but those are the ones that come to mind

** C'est la vie. I still reread it every so often and it breaks my heart that there's no continuation
