  Daphne woke up to the smell of coffee, which was unusual, all things considered. Mostly because she didn't drink coffee.

*** Rogues Bet and Contractual Invalidation are head and shoulders over the others here. I've heard others sing the praises of The Legacy but i found it way too slow paced.

**** Thats the biggest criticism of legacy. But its a also one of the most interesting takes on common things like marriage contracts, how they deal with harry scar horcrux, the war or even just how Harry and Daphnes relationship evolves in a realistic way. It takes hundreds of thousands of words for them to even become friends and even longer to become more than that. At some points I even wondered how its a Harry/Daphne fic beyond them getting married, but later both of their behavior way that makes sense with both their personalities.

** linkffn(6311215) Also, James Spookie has a few other pieces with Daph Pairing that doesn't have much bashing, it isn't his style.

linkffn(Fraterculus) Quite AU, and there isn't much mention of Weasley's at all. But its different type of Daphne, not exactly the common fanon persona of "Ice Queen" but still an Ice Queen.
