I remember reading a old WBWL'd story where the Potters were straight up villains that left Harry behind with a bunch of Imperio'd Death Eater Sympathizers who were Polyjuiced into being James and Lily. The Imperio worked enough to make the Faux-Lily believe Harry was her baby and thus the Mothers Sacrifice worked.

This idea is slightly based around that, what if the Potter's... Just left but wanting to keep Voldemort looking for them they made Golems and left them in their place. Voldemort attacks the Golems but something goes wrong and when he attacks Golem-Harry, Canon Events take place and turn It into a seemingly living being, the very same Harry we love and some of us hate. Years later, The True Potter's Return and now the question becomes what to do with "Harry"

** Cool, that works. His avada kedavra rebounded because there was a boobytrap built into the golem for this situation. Voldie split his soul anyway because he intended to kill a real human being, even though there wasn't one around. The fragment of Voldemort's soul was just what the golem needed to become real-ish

*** That was my thought too, like at first he was a autonomous Horcrux but over the years of it living its own experiences and being a real boy it stops being a Horcrux and becomes a real boy. Only he isn't Harry Potter, he isn't anyone... Or is he?

**** The story could go on as in canon, except for the final battle, when Voldemort kills him, he's totally dead. The fragment of Voldie's soul was all he had.

***** My thought was more things go way off the rails. Fights, arguments, suicide missions.

They defeat Voldemort and then Harry has to question if his continued existence is actually doing harm in possibly keeping Voldemort alive.

Perhaps he is forced to take Riddle's name as all identifying magic, note him as Tom Riddle's Son.

** Oh god, I read this and thought it was one I've been looking for all the time, but no dice. The one I read years and years ago had it where to make everything more realistic, Lily, without telling anyone, used actual people as the basis for the golems, so when they come back, everyone expects the golem Harry to fade away and die, but instead they turn back into their previous self, and end up being super pissed and trying to fuck over the recently revealed Potters.

I enjoyed that one a ton, especially cause it technically is a fem!Harry fic, because the family Lily uses as a sacrifice, is Regulus Black, and his wife/lover and their daughter, so when everything is revealed (to the reader atleast), the daughter of the secondary, or I think she ended up being primary heir, to house Black is now back in action, and shows up out of nowhere, and while everybody is trying to get on her good side, she already has opinions of all these people because she spent the past few years with them.

**** I wish I could find it. I've posted the most I can remember in a few different looking for fic chats and not luck. I want to say after she finds out she's a black she joins with the two free black sisters and they introduce her to the order in grimmauld place when she goes there to claim the house. I want to say that the arrogant not actually world savior Harry tries to flirt with her and stuff and she puts him down hard, but after that idk, this was like 6+ years ago.

Speaking of, if anyone has any idea which fic I'm talking about, you would be a godsend. I've been trying to find it for 6+ years. I went back to my old post, and found the description I gave back when the story was more fresh in my mind.

The story started after Voldemort had been defeated, and Harry was going back to the Dursleys. Dumbledore was still alive so I'd assume it was pre HBP.

When arriving at the Dursleys, he finds Dumbledore there with his parents, and with 'Harry Potter'.

Apparently, they all went into hiding, and Lily set about creating fake versions of themselves to take their places. I forget what they were called specifically in the story,

Informing the main character, who Is apparently not Harry as we were lead to believe, is told that they will probably degrade back into magic or something as the enchantment is wearing off.

However, after leaving the house to await their fate, the fake Harry reverts to the body of a teenage girl. It is revealed that to make this ruse more believable, Lily kidnapped Regulus Black, his wife, and their daughter, and preformed a different spell to mask them as the Potters, and it was they who died that night.

I don't remember too much after that point, but I do know that the 'real' Harry was a spoilt brat, and loved basking in the unearned fame. I also remember him hitting on the girl main character (Sorry, her name eludes me), as she has kept it a secret that she 'was' Harry and survived after she was supposed to die. I also know she returns to society as the Black heiress.

** 'Bloody hell Harry, thats quite a surprize' ron said as he walked up to Harry "I am not harry potter' he figure replied 'Look mate we have been mates for well over a decade now, you have been harry potter that entire time and now some other harry potter appears with a bunch of other ponces and proclaims your not even a potter, who bloody cares and look if your that beat up about it just take my bloody last name your married to my sister already' ron exclaimed.

"and besides' hermioned added having just appeared '' more then one person can have the same name, there is no law in the wizarding world saying there can only be one harry potter, in the muggle world there are many people called smiths' Harry replied with a small smile
