:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
It was about Dudley and Harry.Dudley phoned him after years to meet him somewhere,then they talk about what happened to eachother,Dudley tries to say he is sorry,and also that his daugther is a magical and he needs help what to do now.

I found a few fanfics about the "dudleys daughter is a witch" part but none of them was exactly what i was looking for.Maybe you guys here remember it.

Im not sure but maybe it was in a [[/r/WritingPrompts][r/WritingPrompts]] thread?


** Maybe this one?

I would usually post a Trigger Warning here, but it's much better if you don't know in advance, and it's not that bad anyways, to most people. So, Deal With It.

  It's twenty one years later and for the sake of his daughter, Dudley is going to have to learn about the Wizarding World after all.
