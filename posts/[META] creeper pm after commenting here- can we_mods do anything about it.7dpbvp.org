*** I love the "you're racist, #ImWithHer" - that's so stupid it's almost good again.

No to delve too deeply into US-politics, but to do something so Trump (degrading to women) and then claiming to be with Hillary and pulling the 'racist'-card is just so fucking funny.

Does it actually work?

  ”not to delve too deeply into US-politics” immediately uses Trump as a word degrading to women

*** Let me tell you this-- [[/r/Drama]] is one of the most welcoming, lovely, caring online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that you would attack such a wholesome, sweet hub of comprehension and understanding. You think [[/r/rarepuppers]] was awesome? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Cats), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most heartwarming dog lovers, allies, milfs, and bff. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as welcoming as possible. That's intentional. They encourage hugs in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Love (it's from this underrated book "How to be a good person", give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of passionate love so they continue to adore every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these good feelings. They share love from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of voluntary workers spanning hundreds of communities, sharing lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown love movement. They've loved hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that [[/r/drama]] may be producing an entire army of Bob Ross and Tom Hankses, and I highly suggest that everybody dares visit that awesome subreddit, for potentially falling victim to its loving spell.

***** Here is the original in case you were curious.

Let me tell you this-- [[/r/Drama]] is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans "n[slur]"), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that [[/r/drama]] may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.
