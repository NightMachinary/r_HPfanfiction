Looking for fics where Harry is a cool quidditch player

Slash is fine, but preferably not Drarry Also please no major bashing


** Check out Loose Cannon over on FFN. Harry just up and quits the Auror training program one day to play Quidditch professionally for the Cannons because he decided to do what he wanted rather than what was expected of him. He ends up sleeping around a lot and turns into a socialite.

I can't really recommend it as -great- because while interesting and full of neat OCs it is up past half a million words and hasn't even hit the expected shipping yet.

  He survived the war---now it's time to grow up. Fourteen months after the Battle of Hogwarts, an overheard, off-the-cuff comment turns Harry's life upside-down. Goodbye Auror training, hello Chudley Cannons! And witches ... lots of witches (but no harem). Warning: Many tropes were harmed in the writing of this fic, and Cursed Child never happened. OCs galore. NO MORTAL PERIL.

  If Harry's baby brother, Daniel, is the Boy-Who-lived, then what of Harry? What is his role? Is he destined for greater? Or, is he to play a much bigger role in the future? Follow Canon's plot, with much bigger AU's plot as the story progresses.

** I'm not sure but this might be a story that I read when it was still around 10k words and I was like 13 years old. No idea how good it is :) linkffn(6864381)

  AU, Harry Potter was four years old when The Dark Lord attacked, Harry vanquished the Dark Lord but his baby brother takes all the credit. Dark but not evil Harry! Super Powerful&Smart Ravenclaw Harry. Starts with Harry's fourth year. HP/FD
