So I've been playing heaps of Witcher Recently, all 3 of them they're my favourite games series and one of my favourite book series'. So I was hoping for a Monster Hunting Harry either for the Ministry or for shits and giggles. I would prefer just set in the HP Universe as I'm not a huge fan of crossovers. I don't mind if post-Hogwarts or not. Don't mine pairings or no pairing.

Anyway thank you all.

The Lesser Kindness by Zeitgeist84 is a great HP/Witcher crossover. Zeitgeist writes some good stuff, especially Midnight Blues.

****** I meant in terms of Midnight Blues, to which I say, don't worry, it's not abandoned. The King of Limbs on the other hand... well, let's just say it has major issues and is in dire need of rewrite.

******** And you'll have to wait a bit longer, because I'm going to ride The Lesser Kindness all the way until the post-Blood and Wine depression fades away. Which might be a while, because there really is no fantasy series I love more than The Witcher, HP included.

That being said, I am chipping away at MB slowly, but it's proving difficult atm, considering I've put in only 4000 words into the next chapter of MB in 6 months, and 50000 into TLK in approximately 3. So, it's slow-going right now, but I'll get back to MB full-time when I find the inspiration again.

********* Fair enough, I love your style of writing, I'm an Aussie but my Dad's parents both emigrated from England so I grew up with a lot of British shows, music and general feeling from my Dad and his Parents. So your fics kind of bring back that childhood feeling, plus your writing is really good.

Also Blood and Wine has been spectacular, and I'm happy to wait. How come you want to redo King of Limbs? I read it only recently and I really enjoyed it.

********** Well, it's a good thing I can still evoke that feeling; it's been a /long/ time since I lived in the UK (and I mean a long time: one of my last memories there was watching Trainspotting in cinemas). It seems I've not gotten completely out of touch.

I want to redo The King of Limbs, simply because the beginning is a bit too unnecessarily wordy and obtuse. As I've learned from several objective parties, tends to turn off readers rather than draw them in. And when I reread them, I totally understand what they're saying. I still feel really proud of the later chapters in the fic, still, but sometimes I cringe reading the first couple. So, yes, TKOL needs rewriting, but given the TLK and MB being on my plate, as well as the eventual need to get back to Mass Effect fic I've left on the backburner for way too long, it'll be a miracle if I ever get around to it.

[[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/images/15/jun/bloody14.jpg][Unfortunately, I've already finished Blood and Wine]]. And it's giving me ideas for a proper Witcher fic, featuring Geralt, alongside Anarietta and a reformed Olgierd (in attempt to tie Blood and Wine with Hearts of Stone), trying to solve a high-profile assassination in Toussaint on Belleteyn night, two years after the events of Blood and Wine. I really, really want to do it, but also must resist the urge, because I've already a /million/ things I'm working on.

*********** Just started reading The Lesser Kindness. It's incredible. Your writing quality is up there with the best. I can't say much about the plot yet, because I just started.

You manage to combine one of my favorite book series - Harry Potter - with my favorite videogame - Witcher. Awesome. I was waiting for something like this!

And more Witcher fanfics? With this writing quality! Yes please!

************ Hey, thanks! I'm very flattered that you think my writing's that good, because I think it still needs to be improved. Nevertheless, hopefully I can manage to keep you entertained throughout the fic. I'd love to hear your thoughts!

And don't encourage me with the Witcher fic, because I might just go ahead and do it then, and fall even further behind on my other fics. :P

  It goes without saying that a Witcher's life is one of thankless peril. Mutations, vagrancy, a profession of murder, and all they get for it are insults and a few pieces of gold to tide them over to the next contract. Yes, life is bad enough for one witcher, but two, in one small village? In that case, peril doesn't quite do it justice.
