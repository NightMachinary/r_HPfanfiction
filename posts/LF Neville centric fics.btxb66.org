They seem to be incredibly rare so I'm not holding on to much hope at this point.

Specifically I'm looking for a work that has Neville as the protagonist and focuses on his years at Hogwarts. I have a particular interest in Herbology and all sorts of magical plants that could be thought up.

Also the idea of Neville secretly selling weed to upper years and having a mysteriously awesome reputation is incredibly amusing to me :) sort of like in "all the young dudes" by MsKingBean89 (sorry I can't link, I'm on mobile)

I've almost come to the end of my rope and written one myself but I'm afraid it would turn out horrible :(


** linkffn(The Cactus and the Toad; Becoming Neville)

Both are really good gen fics that are fun to read.

** Linkffn(Democracy by Starfox5) is the only Neville centric fic that I know, it's post war but there is a bit of Herbology involved, to be precise there's a part about ministry regulations on magical plants and old families lobbying to keep their monopolies.

**** Most of the other Starfox5 fics are actually relatively similar and he's one of my favorite authors, although there's not much Neville. Linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Marriage Law Revolution) has a little bit of Neville as light side but relatively traditional (compared to Hermione) politician, but that's about it.

  Hermione Granger deals with the marriage law the Wizengamot passed after Voldemort's defeat - in the style of the French Revolution. Old scores are settled but new enemies gather their forces, determined to crush the new British Ministry.

  AU. Neville Longbottom had good cause to be happy. Voldemort and his Death Eaters had been defeated. His parents had been avenged. He had taken his N.E.W.T.s and was now taking his seat in the Wizengamot. Unfortunately, some of his friends weren't content with restoring the status quo ante and demanded rather extensive reforms.

** I just finished [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/17186567][Mistakes]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/felix_atticus/pseuds/sebastianL][sebastianL (felix_atticus)]], which focuses on Neville as a professor at Hogwarts. His interest in Herbology plays a role. It's Neville/Original Male Character (with past Neville/Ginny) and first person POV, and those aspects are well-written.

Also:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/258555][The Lions of Gryffindor]] by [[https://archiveofourown.org/users/Lyras/pseuds/Lyras][Lyras]] - Gen; Neville's seventh year at Hogwarts.
