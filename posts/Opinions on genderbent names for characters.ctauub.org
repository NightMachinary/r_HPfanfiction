I'm currently writing a dark fem-Harry (with possession/corruption elements of the horcrux) and a gray fem-Ron who'll be twins with Ginny to keep the family dynamics. I might just scrap fem-Ron, though, if I find it doesn't work. Not entirely set on that.

Everyone else are the same genders.

When I started writing, I went with Harriet for Harry. But, as I've found out, I could start losing readers by using it. The same can be said for flower names like Holly. I've tried using Matilda (I like that name for a fem-Harry) but I can't vibe with it for this story for some reason. It sticks out as being the wrong name.

Fem-Ron names seem to be, generally, chill with readers. I haven't seen anyone complaining about them.

What are good fem-Harry and fem-Ron names that won't cause people to disappear as soon they read them?


** I usually find that names that are just gender transformed, i.e Harry to Harriet, Ron to Ronnie, or god forbid Hermione to Herman or something, kill my interest. I actually do like flower names for fem-Harry, Iris, Ivy, Hazel, Violet, etc., but agree with Inquisitor that it would be interesting to see a name from the Potter side of the family. I rarely ever encounter a fem-Ron. but maybe keep the Weasley theme of Arthurian names with something like Elaine?

** My general approach is that you should try to find an equivalent name to the one in canon. By "equivalent" I don't mean "closest in sound/appearance" but rather having the same connotations such that it exhibits the same naming preferences on the part of the parents.

For example, "Harry", at the time of the books:

- Is a "normal" name - it doesn't stand out as unusual or distinctive.

- Is traditionally English.

- Is generally used by the middle and upper class.

- Has royal associations.

So from these I take it that James and Lily like traditional, common names that are a little bit posh and with a strong English heritage. For fem!Harry, therefore, I like to see names which meet these criteria. Victoria, Elizabeth, Sophie, etc.

** My theory says Arthur and Molly kept having children until a girl turned up. If Ron was female, she would certainly be called Ginevra and would also be their last child. Yes, I agree you can just get rid of fem!Ron in this case and put Ginvera in Harry's year.

We had a few discussions about names for fem!Harry in this sub before. The fandom usually gives her a flower name according to Evans family tradition. But I think having her use names from her father's side is a refreshing change. Dorea/Euphemia Lily Potter sounds pretty good too. (Dorea for those who think Charlus/Dorea are her grandparents, Euphemia for those who accept Fleamont/Euphemia as her grandparents)

*** I never thought of getting rid of Ron and using Ginny or combining them, but, if I stick with a fem-Ron, I would go down the twin route. We already know twins appear to run in the family; it wouldn't be much of a stretch, in my opinion, if they had a second set.

There are some plot points that would require Ginny, some that would require Ron, and some that would require both of them. If I don't use fem-Ron, Ron's still going to be there, just in his original gender.

Honestly, I like the feel of Dorea. Euphemia is too proper, though I guess the nickname Mia could be used.

Sorry, I'm just very picky when it comes to names.

*** My personal work on fem!Ron has lead to Gwendolyn/Gwendoline (nicknamed Gwen) Cedrella Weasley. Ginny still exists because Arthur and Molly are like horny teenagers and are a bit careless about birth control.

Fem!Ron is also a case of ugly duckling. Weirdly built and awkwardly tall until she fills out and matures, and even outshines Ginny as a true example of how a Weasley girl is supposed to look.

** Don't kill Ron!! Surely there's space in your story for a Veronica or a Donna or something like that. A femRon that was not the last child in the family could totally have insecurities and a similar family dynamic as Ron Weasley. Or you could use logic and make femRon and Ginny twins...

** Honestly, I think the best thing to do would be to give her a name that fits your female protagonist without any focus on keeping close to the name Harry or any flower names. Those have been overused to death and often give off cliche vibes that might push people away early. Just name her like she's a character rather than naming her like she's a female Harry. If it's a flowery name like Heather or something that actually fits the character then that's great but if it's a random name like Elise that fits the character then that's great too.

Same goes for Ron too

*** Thank you. I'm pretty particular when it comes to names so they need to feel correct for the character, the world, match well with known (modern) family members, and vibe with both the tone and the rest of the cast.

Currently, that name for fem-Harry is Edith. It's the only name I feel suits all that. That might change, of course. I also like Josephine but not for this story.

I haven't yet searched for any fem-Ron names.

** I use "Holly" for fem!Harry. I know "Harriet" is popular, but that's really a bit of a posh name... reminds me a little more of a middle-aged rich woman than a schoolgirl. "Holly" is a bit of a sound-alike for Harry, but is a more down-to-Earth name.

I do use "Ronnie" for fem!Ron. It's obviously a nickname, but so's "Ron," so that's okay.

In my eyes, fem!names for male characters should ideally do two things: They should if possible give the same feel as the original male name (it helps a lot if they start with the same letter, has the same number of syllables, are soundalikes, or things like that), AND they should be plausible as female names. LIke, not BLATANTLY just a feminized male name.

(I will admit, I break that last rule when I write fem!Draco, whom I name "Dracaena." I justify that in-universe with how her parents were certain she would be born a boy, had already picked the name "Draco" and just altered it a little.)

** I vote for fem!Ron. You could try a number of flower names that aren't super flowery. Iris is a common one. More Potter like names is a possibility, or if you want a House of Black connection (could go with the popular headcanon that Dorea and Charlus were James's grandparents), there's a number of constellation names to choose from.

Also, what's the name of the fic? Is it published somewhere yet?

** Realistically, think fem-Harry would carry on the Evan's naming tradition of flower names. I personally always liked Hyacinth for Harry, but any flower name would do. If Ron were genderbent, He'd be called Ginny and canon Ginny wouldn't exist. Hermione would be called another literary name from a play or something(I think hermione was supposed to be from Shakespeare's Hermione?)Though most go with just close sounding opposite gender names because it would be less confusing. What causes me to dislike most genderbent fics though isn't names bjt that it just seems to be an excuse to insert an OC in Harry's place. FemHarry may be more in touch with the grooming side of her feminine side, but she still would be a particularly emotional, weak or sensitive person (understanding why Cho was crying diring the kiss scene, etc). Fem Ron would still have "the emotional range of a teaspoon", Hermione wouldn't just be chill because of a genderbend.

OP already stated multiple times that Ron and Ginny would be twins. So Ginny's still Ginny and Ron would have a different name. Also, fanfic, the Weasley's don't have to just stop once they have one daughter (hell, it's not even canon that they stopped having kids just because they finally had a girl).

** I find Hari to be palatable for female Harry but not Harriet. Things like Iris or Rose (basically how people call Harry's sister in a story) always get a thumbs up from me.

For Fem Ron it depends on what you want to do. For a bit of bashing I'd go for something like Rhonda, for normal Ron I dont dislike Ronnie which is a good fit in my opinion.

For some interesting genderbent names check out the Firebird trilogy. Plenty of good examples that fit the character and story (such as Justine Finch Fletchley, Gregoria Goyle), although not all are winners (Deanna Thomas).
