I'm fine with either, but I like Fem!Harry stories. I'm totally fine if its a Femme!Slash/Crossover story.

There are quite many Fics out there that has Fem!Harry / Harry either abandoned by the Dursley's somewhere in a other country or Ran away from the Dursley's. I want to find fics where Fem!Harry just outright rejects them once they try to get involved in her life, no matter what reason they give.

its always ''I'm your godfather...'' 'Harry cried and immediately hugged his newly known god father happily knowing he finally has someone he could call Family''

I'll be honest, I'm really kinda getting tired of those scenarios.


** Now I'm imagining Sirius finding her after all these years.

"I'm your Godfather, Harry," he says gravely.

Harry opens her arms wide. "Sirius!"

"Harry!"

"Sirius!"

"Harry!"

Then she kicks him in the nuts and walks off.

*** Bhaha better yet if Sirius just keeps calling her Pup. Not sure if the fic is still around, but I'm pretty sure I've read a fic where Sirius kept calling Harry pup, and never said his name once.

**** Probably forgot his name.

He half wants to say "James" each time, but then quickly realizes his mistakes and changes to pup

** I'd love that...hell, I'd ammend it to:

Harry rejects all adults trying to muck up his life ("Haven't you done enough? Placing me with the Dursleys/Allowing me to be placed with the Dursleys and allowing/forcing me to grow up ignorant of my own people and my place in society? Yes, you have so you have rescinded your rights to make decisions for me, the Dursleys forced me to grow up quickly after all! So SOD OFF/GET LOST!") and make decisions for him (or try to protect him!)

That would include:

- Dumbledore (for obvious reasons!)
- Molly (not his mom and too overbearing and overprotective!)
- Remus (coward who never tried to visit...he should have been smart enough to look up the Dursleys in phone-book!)
- Sirius (revenge was more important than Harry it seems, so why should Harry forgive him (Note: I love Sirius Black, but I think that Harry wouldn't be wrong if he didn't accept him ASAP!))
- Tonks (she's fun to be around, but she's a Dumbledore toady and frankly: She doesn't have any right to boss Harry around etc.)
- All order members
- Ministry flunkies/stooges/thugs etc.
- etc. etc.

ps: I'd love to read that!
