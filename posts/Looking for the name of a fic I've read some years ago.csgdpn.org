:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello.I sadly don't remember much of the fic I'm looking for, so I hope that you might be able to help. Here's what I remember:The Dursleys leave their house for good. If I'm not mistaken harry returns after the Goblet of fire and finds the house empty...Now here's the part that makes me wonder.I think that he decides that he can change how the house looks, he paints it, changes the inside etc, and if I'm not wrong he trains to become stronger. I think that Dumbledore was manipulative. I know that i'm not giving you a lot of info, but I can't remember more.I read that in... 2012? 2013? Something like that.


** Realizations, I think. Harry ends up living at the Leaky, meets an American family with witch kids. Gimme a sec.

Edit: yep, dat's der bunny. Linkffn(Realizations by Wishweaver)

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.
