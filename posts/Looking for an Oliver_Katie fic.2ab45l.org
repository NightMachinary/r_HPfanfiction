There's one in particular that's driven me mad because I can't find it, otherwise if anyone has any general recs for this ship, I'd love to hear them.

The one in particular I'm looking for started as a one-shot but got expanded to a multi-chapter. It's something like Angelina and Alicia come up with a list of ten reasons why Katie should ask Oliver out, they come up with nine, and then Oliver comes in with the tenth, saying that he wants her to. I believe this got expanded to something like 10 chapters, ending with a similar proposal of marriage. I've been searching for some time and can't seem to locate this fic!


** Misread this as Ollivander/Katie as I was scrolling... Sorry that's totally unhelpful but I found it pretty funny :)
