** Why did you pick the one year when it would be nearly impossible for the entire thing to be staged by Harry, Fred and George, or some other witch or wizard who wanted to play a prank on Vernon and/or encourage him to be a better person?

Unless...

"So, Ron, what did you do after you abandoned us?"

"Oh, Harry, listen to this. I played the /best/ prank on your uncle..."

*** lmao I didn't even consider that, I just picked that year because the last we ever hear of the dusleys was at the beginning of the seventh book so we don't know if vernon ever drastically changed on christmas day and from then on
