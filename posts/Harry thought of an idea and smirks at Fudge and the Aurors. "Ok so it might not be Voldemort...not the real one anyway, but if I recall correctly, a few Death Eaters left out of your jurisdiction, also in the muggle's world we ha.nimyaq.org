A twinkle appear in Dumbledore's eye when he sees what Harry is doing. "Theoretically, it might be possible that the escaped Death Eaters returned when things calm down and continue His work or they're could be people out there who are secretly His sympathizers or that they want to be Him," he said smirking.

Fudge gets frustrated that even the aurors nod in agreement while Lucius sweats.

Meanwhile in a secret hideout, Voldemort gets upset and shouts in Harry's head. "There's no one like me!"

Dumbledore probably needs to get his eyes checked in St. Mungo, they have weird tendency of twinkling all the time in the fics, it is probably curse or something.

#+end_quote

Most of the "shady" stuff Dumbledore did is result of JKR not being able to make her own plot excuses persuasive. Dursleys - living with them protects Harry. How exactly? JKR apparently didn't thinks it is important to explain, expecting audience to just go along with it. The same situation with her not bothering to explain how exactly Fidelius works. Situations isn't helped by the fact that a lot of fanfics are written by people who didn't even bother to read books, opting out to movies that dumbed things down in further. It is clear from the books that Dumbledore is intended as good and well-meaning person who is forced to solve several trolley problems along the way, but JKR implementation of this leaves too many edgelords with excuses for Dumbledore-bashing.

However:

1. JKR never bother to clarify it, so my interpretation as good as any.

** Huh, that gives me an idea...it was technically Peter Pettigrew that killed Cedric on Voldemort's orders, but he's supposed to be dead too.\\
What if, faking their death was S.O.P. for Death Eaters fighting a losing battle? Peter pulled it off with an explosion, his animagus form and a willingness to lose a finger, but most other Death Eaters could do it with a polyjuiced victim and Imperius. Or some magical delayed explosives and a well-timed apparation. Or an inferius with transfigured features. Or a hungry dragon with...well, polyjuice and transfigured inferi cover a lot of ground already. Or they could use Horcruxes too.\\
 \\
Come the graveyard, a whole ton of Death Eaters show up, but when Harry escapes and tries to warn Fudge, he's sceptical because "You've named just about every Death Eater confirmed dead in the last war!"\\
"They were definitely alive! They were definitely in the graveyard!"\\
"You-Know-Who and a couple of dozen of his followers rose from the dead in a graveyard to fight again? Preposterous, you've been reading too much Muggle fiction!"\\
 \\
And then later, when Harry is proven right and Voldemort and several of his 'deceased' Death Eaters are proven alive, the wizarding world collectively shits itself because a) someone or some/thing/ apparently has the power to bring the dead back to life and b) they're with the bad guys.
