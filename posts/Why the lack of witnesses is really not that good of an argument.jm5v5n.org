So, like me, many of you must have encountered some time or other the age old argument of the fact that Harry and Voldemort being the only living witness of Halloween â€˜81 being enough to disprove all the books that talk about the subject. I have two words in response: Forensic. Science.

We know because of FB:CoG that there are magical ways of determining what happened in some place/time accessible for any magical, so chances are that Aurors, investigators and, above all, Dumbledore himself probably have even better spells to determine such things, this without even considering things like the probability of things like divination or legilimens (which we just don't know enough about to determine their overall utility) being used to this end. plus, even muggle deductive methods plus the application of real-world forensic technics would be enough to determine a rough timeline.


** Most of the fics espousing that argument were written before the new movies were even an apple in Rowling's eye, no? Obviously the stuff she invented now but didn't even elude to before isn't taken into account by stories written before she invented the new stuff.

*** canon has time turners, priori incantatem, dark detectors, dumbledore's magic sense, etc. it's clear that actual investigations are possible, even if they're not done as often as they should

**** A very fair point. Maybe the latter is a stronger influence that the former? "Wizards don't do that sort of thing" even thought they have the ability to?

*** Maybe, but forensic science has been a field is study and an integral part of criminal investigation long before, potentially earlier than the books even, and when we hear about there existing aurors it's only a jump to concluding that the wizarding world would meet it's own version of forensics.

**** Sure, but there's an equal idea that the Wizarding World is backwards and behind and all Victorian and since we never see anything to specifically counter that, I guess people don't bother inventing it. The closest I've seen was that Harry/Fleur fanfic where her father was French Sherlock Holmes.

It's not a new problem - this sub does make the same Rowling complaint over and over in this regard. She writes a situation and has it go terribly in one book, then invents a solution two books later that would've made the situation go far better.

It is a shame that it's not more gone into, though. Magical Forensics could be really interesting, if someone got creative about it. Pensieves to go through crime scenes, krups to track scents, magical substances to find DNA and magical signatures and such.

***** I believe that JK said once that she wrote a series of books for children/young adults that she never really expected to be so thoroughly dissected.

****** Heh. Yeah. Sometimes it feels like we dissect and debate this fandom of ours as much as the Zapruder film.
