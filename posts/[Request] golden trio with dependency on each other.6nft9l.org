Well... I want to read fic where they are in a state of 'us vs the world', there is no other people to rely but ourselves, you two are the only one I have, something like that?


** Ron's not in the story, but the idea of an "us vs the world"/"we're all each other has" is definitely a major part.

  Professor Sirius Black, Head of Slytherin house, is confused. Who are these two strangers found at Hogwarts, and why does one of them claim to be the son of Lily Lupin and that git James Potter? Dimension travel AU, no pairings so far. Dark humour.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10493620/1/Ruthless][Ruthless]], linkffn(10493620), is exactly like that, but with a Slytherin Harry and Theo Nott replacing Ron.

The Trio experienced a similar situation in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12076771/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Girl-Who-Walked-on-Water][Harry Potter and the Girl Who Walked on Water]], linkffn(12076771), but only in their flashbacks of the War.

  AU. From the deepest abyss of the sea, a new menace rises to threaten Wizarding Britain. And three scarred people are called up once again to defend a country that seems torn between praising and condemning them for saving it the first time. Inspired by concepts from Kantai Collection and similar games.

  COMPLETE. James Potter casts his own spell to protect his only son; but he was never as good with Charms as Lily was. (A more ruthless Harry Potter grows up to confront Voldemort). Dark!Harry. Slytherin!Harry HP/HG and then HP/HG/TN.
