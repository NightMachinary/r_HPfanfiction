As it says in the title, any good fics following Tom Riddle or Voldemort? Preferably 100k+ words, I'm fine with WIP but nothing abandoned.

  What he had pictured in his head when he'd first thought of teaching were long, sweeping orations, students hanging on his every word, young minds being taken in and inspired by his message. What he did not fully consider, however, was that he would actually have to teach. (In which Tom Riddle begins teaching at Hogwarts and realizes just what a horribly stupid idea it was.)

  Loneliness was something that Harry Potter was accustomed to. He had learnt that there was none that cared for him, none that would rescue him from his misery and none that heard his pleas for help. Much to his surprise, however, Harry Potter had been wrong. Someone had been listening, had been there with him through it all. But, just who was 'Tom?

  Bellamione / "Remember when I told you I'd read her mind? I saw something peculiar. Bella," she went on urgently. "I think there's a possibility she could be--- she could be a venor floccus." AU, centred around Hermione Granger, a very best friend of Draco Malfoy, back when she was just a fifteen-year-old kid dealing with her inner demons, trying to deny the growing interest in a mysterious Bellatrix Lestrange.

  The world believes Lord Voldemort's been dead since 1981. He wishes for it to stay that way, thank you. It is 1998, now, and Hermione Granger signs up for an international mentorship program as a stepping stone for her after Hogwarts life. Draco Malfoy, never to be one-upped, signs up for the same program and scores Gilderoy Lockhart as his mentor, knowing he is Hermione's first choice. Meanwhile, Hermione is stuck with some obscure, hermit NOBODY that can talk to snakes. Ugh. Her life is the worst.Or:Hermione Granger has no idea what she has gotten herself into, all while Tom Riddle plays an American persona very, very badly. Not long into their mentorship, the anonymity of Tom Riddle fades and he must face consequences for his crimes.OR:Abraxas Malfoy loves Tom Riddle. Even though it is very difficult to do so.

  The last real thing Harry remembers is standing across from Voldemort and watching the killing curse fly at his face.Then he visited a fluffy white limbo that somewhat resembles King Cross Station and instead of choosing to move on or go back he does something else entirely.And wakes up in his cupboard on the morning of Dudley's eleventh birthday.Because that makes sense.(No. No it doesn't.)But Harry is going to roll with it anyway.
