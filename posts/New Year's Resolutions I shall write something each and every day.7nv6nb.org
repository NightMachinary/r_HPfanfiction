I normally don't do resolutions, but after spending the past week either drunk, playing old computer games, watching episodes of Doctor Who or all of the above simultaneously, I'm finding it very difficult to get back into a writing mood.

So here I declare, in a magically binding contract, that I will write 500, no wait, maybe 1000 words of my fic each and every day. To anyone else struggling in the war against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Written and his Procrastination Eaters I cheer you on!

Now instead of trying to think of a way to turn 'Order of the Phoenix' vaguely writing related (I'll be honest, it's been 10 minutes and I'm struggling to think of anything) I'm going to open up my latest chapter and start writing.

Good luck everyone! And a happy new year to you all!

Make the story about a female Voldemort and instead of actually touching on the plot of Order of the Phoenix instead just have Harry view her past in a diary while he's at school and slowly have him become smitten with her. Then just reference specific plot points as a way to delineate just where in the story the fic is. Problem solved!

** I wish you luck.

I managed it in 2017, using fanfiction writing (and some translation) to practice my German and Spanish, ending up at a total of 479k words for 2017 (aiming at "only" 300x2 per day), but that was esentially the first few months carrying the rest. (Of course, nothing of it is seaworthy enough to end up on FFnet...)

** Good luck! I tried this in 2016, not with FF, but just private journaling. I did end up with ~365 pieces of writing, but I definitely didn't manage to hit one every day. I'd recommend giving yourself some leeway in that regard (like shoot for a # of total words) so that you don't have an excuse to give up early if you miss a day.

*** Hmm... 300k words then? Been writing my fic for about a year now and have 270k so far. With what I already have written I don't think 570k total would be that difficult to hit - although it feels a lot more daunting than 500~1000 words a day...

**** I'd shoot for 300k words written (though you're right, that is a pretty daunting number to look at it) but wouldn't aim for the fic to be 300k words longer at the end of the year. After all, you might write 500+ words one day, then come back the next day and toss 80% and rewrite the rest. Don't let a number get in the way of judicious editing :)

***** That's a good point, I hadn't thought of that... But........ I don't think I've been in a situation where I deleted huge chunks of my writing in the process of editing. And maybe that's not really a good thing.... Well, I have a beta now, so it might be happening a lot more....

****** I've never written fiction, so I can't really speak to it personally, but I know there are lot of authors I like who are really big about judicious editing. And I've definitely looked back at old journal entries and noticed phrases or sentences that can be cut out. That's not even taking the plot aspect into consideration :P

******* No I definitely agree. I could have used someone telling me to re-do most of my earlier chapters. But it was my first fic and I just ploughed on for over a year.

**** Another method is to say that you want to write 1000 words on average. In this way, you can take a day off, if you wrote the day before 2000 words.

***** I'm worrying that sort of thing might be a slippery slope... I suppose it won't matter if I take the day off because I've already written a lot but if I start taking a day off and promising myself I'd write more tomorrow... You can see where that might lead...

Well, I've written my 1000 words today. It won't really be a problem for the next few days, the real challenge will come next week now that the holidays are finally over...

** You inspired me to maybe write my own fanfic, but first I need to find out if Hogwarts has a window big enough that a car could fit through.

*** Go for it! And you know... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it... Ask for a big window... If that doesn't work, I'm sure the house elves can help.

Good luck!

** Thank you to everyone who left an encouraging comment! Managed to blaze through 600 words pretty easily after I switched off everything else other than the word processor. Here's to hoping tomorrow will be just as productive!
