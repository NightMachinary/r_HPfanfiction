So I have been reading a lot of fanfics on fem!harry lately and have come to notice something that is starting to bother my a little bit. It's nothing major but can't people think of different ways other than making the appearance of the girl always seems to either be an exact replica of James or and exact replica of Lily with the same personality of said parent?

Now, I'm not complaining since some of the stories turned out really interesting, but I would personally think that Harry as female would look different than canon harry and not an exact replica of her parents. I can easily see fem!Harry having Lily's hair and Jame's eyes or vice versa like canon Harry.

In most fanfictions I've read, Harry, whether it's a girl or a boy, is nothing like canon James, Lily, or even canon Harry. Fanfiction Harry is way smarter than any canon child at age 11, he never fumbles his romances like the canon teens at age 15, and he never angsts over anything and actively seeks revenge instead of internally brooding.

On appearances, I've seen more combos of Lily's hair + James' eyes or James' hair + Lily's eyes than a straight up copy of one parent's traits. I have also noticed that Fem!Harry gets way more purple prose description than Boy!Harry, with repeated mentions of her sparkling viridian eyes and fiery vermilion hair.

However, there are rare times where Harry's appearances doesn't match either of his/her canon parents'. I've seen blonde Harry, whose hair color matches Petunia and Dudley (both blonde in the books), and brown Harry. For some reason, [[http://harry-potter-headcanon.tumblr.com/post/126179755754/can-you-explain-why-many-people-think-harry-potter][it's become popular in the Tumblr-creative community]] to make James Potter Indian, because the Dursleys are xenophobic white English folks and hate James' people, so obviously James must be brown. This makes Harry half-Indian and brown-skinned. I don't know where it originated first, but if you google "Desi Harry Potter" you will see many supporters and fanarts of this. I guess it became popular with Black Hermione being a thing after Cursed Child, but then again I don't go on Tumblr much.

There are over 25k stories with Harry and Angst tagged on FFN (out of ~170k stories with Harry). And any "Summer after fourth/fifth year" story is required to come with angst as well. At this point, it might very well be a law.

**** Must be observation bias, then.

When I used to read a lot of Indy!Harry fics, Harry slaughtered goblins with his dual-wielded zweihanders, mowed Death Eaters down with machine guns, and threw Unforgivables around like it was Halloween every day of the week, with zero guilt or introspection. If there was any angst in the fics I read, it was shallow, short-lived, and directed at other people who had wronged Harry, instead of the internalized survivor's guilt PTSD of canon Harry.

***** But usually even those start with a few chapters of brooding and angst before the love interest kicks Harry's arse and he dickslaps the shit out of everyone.

** I honestly can picture FemHarry with a much more wider variety of hair and eye colors, the Harry.

I can see her w/ blonde, black, and red hair, and green or hazel eyes. But for Harry, he's always going to be green eyes and black hair.

Both FemHarry and Harry also have pale skin, but depending on the direction the fic takes, I can also see them becoming tan.

For their facial features, I can see Harry and FemHarry with high cheek bones, thin eye brows, and long slim nose. Also their face would be angular and sharp.

** I think people reuse Harry's canon traits because their symbolism fits well with personality and plot.

Green works well for eye color because it's the color of the killing curse, symbolizing the fated connection of death between Voldemort and the child of prophecy. Also, green is just a less common eye color compared to brown, so the prophecy child gets to be a special snowflake.

As for the hair, messy hair fits with Harry's personality of being 'normal' and not fitting in with the upper crust of pretentious purebloods. It's also a connection to his/her heritage as a Potter and gives the pretentious Dursleys another reason to look down on kid Harry.

I do think that red hair would work just as well as black for a fem!Harry.

** I like to picture fem!Harry as either a dusky redhead with messy hair or a pale skinned, black haired child with wavy hair and a dusting of freckles.

** I've noticed there's a gender/ hair connection. Like if harry has kids or he has brothers and sisters, the boys typically have black hair the girls typically have red hair.

** I prefer femHarry to have the same colouring and overall look of Harry just because I don't understand why she wouldn't. I mean, gender has nothing (that I know of) to do with hair color or texture and eye shape/color. Red hair is a recessive trait so it is less likely than black hair, and Harry can't get the blond gene from Lily because as a red head she has two copies of the red hair gene. Again, I didn't get past basic biology in uni, but what we're talking about here is basic genetic inheritance. Hazel eyes are basically green eyes with brown areas, but green eyes are so harped on in canon that people cling to them.

Harry's kids have red hair because he has red hair genes to pass down and his wife is a red-head.

Harry's canon personality is not a carbon of his parents (they were both way more social than him for one thing) but canon characters draw parallels because they want to see his parents in him. I think that realistically a similar thing would happen to femHarry - people who knew the Potters would expect to see similarities and so actively look for them i.e. 'You like Quidditch? So did your dad! You're just like him!' as if 3/4 of the wizarding population wasn't obsessed with flying on a stick.

** One way to determine what Fem!Harry's physical appearance would be is to determine which traits are carried by dominant and recessive genes, presuming that magic doesn't do funky stuff to people on a genetic level. But I suspect that most people have neither the time nor the patience to sit down with a University level textbook on genetics to determine what a fictional character is supposed to look like, so they take shortcuts. The simplest being to invert which parent a specific trait came from, regardless of what biology might have to say on the matter.

*** Well, there's also the fact that genetics doesn't quite work the way you're suggesting.

** It's also interesting to wonder if aunt Petunia would treat a FemHarry better, maybe not having daughters and Vernon feeling less threatened by a girl. I few fanfic I've read her circumstances were exactly the same as Harry's.

** I always imagine fem!Harry as having Lily's coloring (red hair and green eyes) but looking a lot like James in the face. I don't mind if she has black hair instead of auburn, but one thing that can not change for me is the eye color. Green all the way!
