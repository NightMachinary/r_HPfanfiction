General trigger warning because the Gaunts were not a nice family.

I've been working on creating backgrounds for a lot of the canon characters, as well as expanding the wizarding world a little because I want there to be more people. Most of them will never get mentioned once I get back to writing, but they help me establish and keep track of family relations and other stuff.

This tree features the Gaunt family from the 17th to 20th century - I'd love to hear your thoughts and comments!

(please not that the writing is pretty tiny, so you might have to download the file to read everything!)

Featuring: Incest, underage pregnancy, stillborn children, age differences and plenty of death and murder, as well as a Riddle Jr. who is funnily enough the oldest Gaunt - by blood - in the past 300 years, all thanks to his father!

Some notes: - the whole Patriarch + Matriarch pairings are just there for me to identify the oldest family members I've currently added to my tree

- the lines that end in small circles stand for other family members that aren't currenty being shown

- I've based the names of the Gaunts off of the ones we see in canon (Merope, Morfin, Marvolo) and went with the whole 'first letter M, third letter R' theme they had going on

- IMO the Gaunt family is patriarchal, so all women who married into the family got their maiden names as a second name -> [First name] [Maiden name] [Gaunt]

- anyone not featured in canon (which is almost everyone) is marked as an OC


** You must have put a lot of effort into that, I'm impressed! I like the explanation for why the Gaunts were impoverished (that Xilia Burke took all the money in the divorce). It also explains how Burke got the money to set up the shop and maybe why Tom wanted to work there.

*** Thank you! Yeah, I realized that I needed a reson for them to loose their money, and given how abusive the family was in canon it seemed like a solid choice.

I imagine that she took quite a few dark artefacts in the divorce as well, which she sold to add insult to the injury. I also have the headcanon that the shopowner in 1926 recognized Merope and took the 'family feud' as another reason to rip her off

**** It is explained why they lost the wealth in canon is it not.

That the gaunts had expensive tastes and and poor spending habbits so literally spent the money away

***** I think that's mentioned somewhere, yes, but I like both so my headcanon is simply that they were already losing money every year and this was the final nail in the coffin.

Ofc it's just personal thought though, I'm not trying to convince you here üôÇ

** This is great! I like the colour code scheme and the detail in the relationships.

Have you also tried FamilyEcho? I use it for my HP reference and I've been working on the Gaunt side (always fun with duplicate lines that show up with cousincest) and trying to figure out who they could have married into to slowly diminish their "Great House" power.

*** Thank you! It's been a lot of fun coming up with all the background stories - though of course there isn't much space for all the details!

I tried FamilyEcho a while ago when I was starting out, but as far as I remember it only showed small sections of the family tree at once so I switched.

And I totally agree, something about adding incestual relationships just makes it so much fun!

One of the reasons I have for their ruin is actually their short lifespan! I don't know how you built it ofc, but for my tree, I imagine it's pretty hard to build up influence and connections when almost no one makes it past their 50ies.

I can't really imagine a proper family business for them tbh. It could be possible that they live of their inheritance, bribery from the wizengamot, and the occasional bridal dowry, but honestly - I can see them as simply living beyond their means.

I think they have some allies with the pureblood supremacists, but by the time my tree starts I see them as too mentally disturbed to be really welcome im high society - and to have actual friends as well.

**** FamilyEcho has tabs now - not sure if it was there when you originally used it - for biography, wedding details, burial locations, relationship connections etc!

I did the same - only canon characters over a certain age are older than their 70s but most die young. Some die after childbirth, or later. I also have certain date ranges where wizards just don't survive (1914-1918, 1920, 1930-1945; 1812 for earlier) due to disease, war, etc.

I'm going to start working on biographies shortly, why certain families have ties to others and the like. I have 1500 (!!!) people on my family tree, and it's been nuts doing faceclaims and fancasts lol. It's meant to help with reference for stories and family relationships. I have canon details but most are fan made other than the last names. üò≥

***** Oh damn, if it was there then I definitely overlooked that!!

I haven't really worked out war times, diseases and such, the Gaunt tree is honestly the only one that looks halfway finished, the other families mostly only have names (not even ages yet)

I do have just over 500 entries by now, but 1500 is insane!!! I can't even imagine how much time you put into this!! And the pictures!!! Holy cow! (Vernon looks way too handsome btw, how dare you?)

And I promise, I won't mess with it (I think I could technically edit Harry, but not anything else since I don't have an accout)

Also, I love that Rodolphus Lestrange looks hotter than TMR üòÅ

****** Haha no, I think I misunderstood you in your original post! You can only for certain family lines and then others disappear if they're too far removed from the main branch üòù

Lol yeaaaahhhh Vincent d'Orfino for a young Vernon (I know üò≠ but it's for a time travel fic) and Tom Mison (Sleepy Hollow) for Rodolphus. Finding "dark & edgy" British celebs is not easy for face claims with the right ages...

******* Yeah, that makes sense! Honestly I might have switched in the past, but thinking of transferring all these people is enough to make me cry üòÇ

Mmmh tell me more about that time travel!! Hot!Vernon sounds weird but in a good way üòÅ

You're absolutely right about the dark&edgy celebs though, they're desperately needed!

In her 2nd or 3rd year? Who am I to judge? I know a girl who got pregnant at 11.

*** Honestly that was less on her and more on Merefin, who is five years older. I imagine he forced himself on her, and her parents made her marry him when they found out about the pregnancy. Not a nice story, but then again, they're not a nice family. I do feel sorry for Caeludra though, she definitely deserved better!

** I like this. Is it finished though? If it is, why didnt you include Gormlaith Gaunt and Isolt Syres grandmother who were also Gaunts and are kinda cannon?

Also will you make Family trees for Potters, Weasleys, Grangers, Longbottoms, Lovegoods, Blacks, Dumbledores, etc... in the future?

*** Thank you! It's not exactly finished since the earliest date I included is 1675, so those two will be on there once I come back to the Gaunts.

This is actually only a part of a fairly big tree (around 500 people) where I'm trying to both connect canon characters and expand the wizarding world a little.

I've covered the Black family from 1780 - 1990 so far, with a big number of OCs forming a few side branches since I love the idea of the Black family being huge.

For the other families you mentioned I've only included canon characters plus a few that weren't mentioned (like Neville's grandfather), but I'm still working on it.

Honestly I'm focusing more on the dark pureblood familes right now since they're really fun to play around with.
