** I want this too. I can't remember a single fic where this happens, unfortunately. You'd think it would be a lot more common to kill one of the most hateable characters in the series.

*** I remember one where Harry transfigures her respiratory system into water-breathing, and he calls her Madam Marsh. I think it was Jamie Evan's and Fate's Fool, and it was only a paragraph or two long, but I thought it was very satisfying.

Although the death wasn't really all that long, and it was only after the joke was there for a while that it happened.

** There's this fic linkffn(101 Ways to Kill Umbridge), though it's not very good.

There's generally a disturbing lack of passionate retribution in fanfiction in my opinion. I mean, I know that sadism and torture are normally frowned upon, but c'mon, we read like 500K words fics where Harry constantly suffers from the actions of multiple villains, and in the end all they get is having a bridge fall on them and die or something. It completely robs us of catharsis. WHY DON'T THE BAD GUYS EVER SUFFER AS MUCH AS THE GOOD GUYS DO?

I think of writing a fic where every character I hate just suffers a lot, but I need a lot of rage to fuel me enough to actually materialize it.

*** I can't say I have any stories in which she dies just like that. I prefer either comedy or drama centred on character development, so I never was seeking out stories of this sort.

That being said, if her being humiliated is at least close to what you want, there's “Take no Umbridge” by Stephen Ratliff. It's a bit train-wrecky but it's enjoyable enough and it might prove itself helpful if there's no stuff of the sort you want.

As a contextual background: This story's leitmotif is that everybody continuously tries to piss Harry off as much as possible, and Harry's trying to be all reserved and in control of his emotions and whatnot because he's super-powerful but doesn't want to use his powers to encroach on others' free will (however the author imagines that).

  The escape of Peter Pettigrew leaves a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature, darker Harry, bearing the effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance... eventually.

  They expected him to be a paragon of virtue, a champion of the Light, the personification of all that is good and noble in their world...they were wrong. Explore the legend of a darker Harry Potter, seen from the eyes of friend and foe alike. Multiple POVs. Non-linear narrative. Rated M for violence.

** Have the read /Elizium for the Sleepless Souls/? The final chapter is focuses on Dolores. It's not quite what you're looking for but you'd probably enjoy it.
