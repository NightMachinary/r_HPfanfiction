:END:
the tagline was something about how destiny couldn't keep the golden trio apart or something

but this Hermione tracks down Ron and Harry (I think, might be the other way around) because she's gotten dragged into something and needs their help. They've never met, as she didn't go to Hogwarts

*** That's the other way around.

Muggle Cop partners Ron and Harry are assigned to protect seemingly muggle scientist Hermione, except it's actually reality hopping Witch!Hermione.

I like the first arc a lot, but it just failed to provide a reason to keep reading into the second one. So, if anyone has a premise for what they do after getting Hermione back to her world please let me know.

**** Well, they basically have to deal with the problem that Russia still wants them, so they need to find a way to keep their muggle families safe. And in the Wizarding World, Hermione has to make arrangements as well and wants to deal with Azkaban. And there is the problem with the Lunas' plans. And Dumbledore's.

***** Okay, I can see that. I guess I'm just more interested in the first arc then.

That being said, I still think you would've been better off splitting it into two separate stories (original and then sequel), but I suppose FF.net doesn't support sequels very well (unlike AO3).

(I'm a big fan of your take on Dumbledore, incidentally. Both in this fic and several of your others.)

****** I've thought about it (in hindsight) myself, but I usually only split up stories into series if there's a major change of cast/POV.

Also, the second part is taking a little longer than planned - I thought I would be done by chapter 50 at the latest, but tieing up loose ends took and takes longer than expected.

  Hermione Granger grew up in the Muggle World hiding her magical ability from those around her. That all changes when Ron Weasley, Auror, makes an interesting discovery while on a case. AU but keeping with the books.

  Hermione Granger is brilliant: she completed her PhD in Linguistics at 25, and is the youngest faculty member at the University. Ron Weasley, an unruly quantum physicist... well, he's getting there. But when Granger gets stacked with a project she hates and has to talk to other scholars at the University, their paths cross and become permanently intertwined. (Romione Muggle Uni AU)

  (COMPLETE) AU multi chapter ff that is canon in every way EXCEPT one: Hermione Granger never got her Hogwarts letter and never learned she was a witch. But nothing is as magical as love, and this story explores another way for Hermione, Ron, Hugo and Rose to end up as the tight, loving family we know from Platform 9 3/4 in the epilogue, and it explores their adventures from there.
