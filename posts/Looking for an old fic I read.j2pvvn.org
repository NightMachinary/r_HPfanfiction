:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
The only thing I can remember is that Harry used chains during the first task and basically forced the dragon into submission, obviously overpowered but I can't remember anything else. PS: Any overpowered recommendations are welcome


** Dragon is the first task.

** I've seen more than one fic using this idea however the only one I can recall is 'Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past' it is old and has been taken off from Ffnet but I know it's been saved on other sites.

** Linkffn(The Renegade by Greed720) is the only one I can find/remember, but it might not be old enough to be the one you're thinking of.

I'm also sure I once read a fic where Harry had to face a manticore or chimera or something like that in the tournament instead of a dragon and used chains to restrain it, but I can't find that one.

  His preparations had taken him years, but in the end it would be worth it. He had lost everything, but now he would get it all back, and more. For him though, vengeance was not the primary goal, but if he did happen to bring it down on his enemies. Then that was good too.

** Linkffn(5077573) is the only one I can think of, but uses rune based magical bonds rather than chains.

  In third year, Harry decided to quit Divination, following Hermione. Having to take a substitute course, he end up choosing Ancient Runes and find himself to be quite gifted. Smart Harry. Slightly manipulative. Rated M for later subjects and language.
