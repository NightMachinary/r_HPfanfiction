I feel like this is too vague, but I remember reading this one where she was talking with Harry about how she loved Dumbledore and about how could she not because he was the leader of the light that everyone looked up to and then she goes on to think to herself when Harry leaves her office, or whatever, that she loves him too, because he took the mantle of the Leader of the Light. It may have Dumbledore as dead, or just have the people disillusioned to Dumbledore's manipulations, id not really remember.
