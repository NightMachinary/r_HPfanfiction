No Elfling!Harry, no tenth walker, no slash, and steeped in LOTR lore. Very much a book oriented crossover rather than one based on the movies. Currently a WIP and I've very much enjoyed what's been posted so far.


** a small rundown of the plot may be useful

** Good recommendation. The author knows his/her canon (both fictions!) which means I'm not cringing as I usually have to when I read a Middle-earth fic.

Interesting plot, too.

** It's promising, though I feel like it switches a little jarringly between showing and telling events.

Hopefully there is more conflict, although the juxtaposition between HP magic and that of LoTR will make that more difficult.
