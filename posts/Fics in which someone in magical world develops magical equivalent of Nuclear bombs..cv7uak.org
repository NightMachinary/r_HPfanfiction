  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

After the Statute of Secrecy is breached and magic is revealed to muggles, Voldemort sees no reason why he shouldn't take over North Korea. Once he gets his hands on some weapons grade uranium from their reactors it's just a matter of casting a bunch of duplication charms and a few chapters, one week and one almost-WW3 later there's a few million less people on the planet.

  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** Do you mean equivalent big explosion, or just equivalent weapon of mass destruction? The Arithmancer was already mentioned as one where you can't transfigure antimatter, >! but the sequel includes a self-replicating swarm of killer robots!<. And there's linkffn(Petrification Proliferation) for a Person of Mass Destruction.

There are hints of the danger of combining magic with nuclear physics in linkffn(Following the Phoenix - Flashes). They plan to test whether you can transfigure uranium and then use it to power a reactor before the transfiguration wears off - but they don't dare test it anywhere on Earth, even in the middle of a desert.

  What would have been the appropriate response to a creature that can kill with a look being set loose in the only magical school in Britain? It would have been a lot more than a pat on the head from Dumbledore and a mug of hot cocoa.
