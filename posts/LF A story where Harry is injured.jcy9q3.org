and either goes to a muggle hospital or is taken care of by The Order... Or both. Preferably taking place in the summer between GoF and OotP, but I'll read it even if it doesn't fulfill that criteria.

And when I say "injured" I mean like, close to death injuries or just any type of injury that would take time to recover from. Bonus points if he dies and is resuscitated.

Thanks in advance for helping me continue my sadistic reading habits.

  When Harry dissapears and no one knows where he is, the WW considers him a fugitive. Tonks decides to investigate it and the things go to the hell. Lots of bashing and hints of H/Hr.
