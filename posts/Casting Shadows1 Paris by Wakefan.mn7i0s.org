Can you recommend me a fic like casting shadows. I like the OP Harry with different magic. In this fic it is from Earth dawn. In this fic he is really good at magic but no clue how to navigate socially. At the same time he is not to powerful to the point where he doesn't get hurt. The second part has only three chapters so I am looking for a long fic to tide me over.

Harry learns latain at a very young age and also learns how to chanel his magic through it (over time) and when he goes to hogwarts he finds tthat he is compleatlly inable to use the same magic as everyone else but he doesnt want anyone to know because he likes having a hidden ace up his sleave. I adore this fic but unfortunatly it is incomplete and I'm not sure if they still update but you should */definitely/* check it out.
