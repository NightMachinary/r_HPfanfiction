Hi! I just finished re-reading Shadow of Angmar, and I was wondering if anyone had any x-overs to rec me. Preferably gen or slash, though if the story is good I could read het. Thanks!


** I've only read two LoTR crossovers, Shadows of Angmar being the one. The other was "The Power He Knows Not" by Steelbadger

It's a fun and uncomplicated ride through the highlights of LoTR from book two and onwards. The romance between Harry and Eowyn is ham as hell and /somewhat/ uninspired IMO but it is central to the story and played completely straight.

If you are a bit of a romantic at heart, this story is great for an afternoon on the couch.

  Elfling!Harry. Except not. Jaded and cynical Master Auror Harry Potter gets sent to Arda to relive his non-existent childhood. Childhood sucks. Rated M for language.
