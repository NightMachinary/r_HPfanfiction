I read a short fic last night called “Harry Potter - the curse of undeath by MiNdZeRo” (can't remember how to link it properly I'm posting from mobile) I was wondering if anyone has anymore necromancy fic recommendations.


** Linkffn(to young to die) is probably the premiere necromancer!Harry fic. Vey Dark.

Also linkff(11574569) has quite a bit of necromancy exploration as well. Two words: undead quintaped.
