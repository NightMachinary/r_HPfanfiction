:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hi! Just remembered a couple of fics I read a while ago (good few years) that have popped back into my head. I think at the time of reading, neither were complete so was hoping to maybe find them again!

*#1*\\
This one was focused on Lily Evans, but in a Veronica Mars based story (basically she solved mysteries and stuff at Hogwarts). From memory, it was just titled Lily Evans (like Veronica Mars), I believe I read it on FFN and for some reason, I keep thinking the author's pen name had the word Phantom in it somewhere (this may not be true, I can't really remember). At the start of the fic, Lily and James weren't friends but were getting closer/together near the end but I also think she had some type of relationship with Sirius (again, not sure). I also think there was this thing called the Hogwarts Underground, which was basically like a club for the students. Quite possible that a friend of Lily's had died (maybe why she got into solving mysteries??) and she wasn't very popular at Hogwarts. I think it had around 30 chapters when I read it. Have had a search and I found some other people asking about a fic that sounded similar so maybe it's gone ://

Second one was Victoire Weasley and Teddy Lupin at Hogwarts but they weren't together. Both in popular friend groups: Victoire and her friends all had names starting with V so they were called the Vee's/V's or something and Teddy's group of friends were a bit like the Marauders I think. I remember one small part, two of Victoire's friends (twins and very rich I think) were having their birthday party and it was probably masquerade. One of Teddy's friends may have been a vampire or half-vampire and one of Victoire's friends a Seer. Can't really remember much more about this one, don't know title or author and this one was nowhere near to complete at the time of reading! I think I may have read it on HPFFA.

Thanks for your help!
