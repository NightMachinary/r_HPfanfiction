*** Is this canon? I thought this had always just been a theory and JKR just omitted illness because it wasn't important.

**** From Pottermore's final chapters on GoF:

#+begin_quote
  I decided that, broadly speaking, wizards would have the power to correct or override ‘mundane' nature, but not ‘magical' nature. Therefore, a wizard could catch anything a Muggle might catch, but he could cure all of it; he would also comfortably survive a scorpion sting that might kill a Muggle, whereas he might die if bitten by a Venomous Tentacula. Similarly, bones broken in non-magical accidents such as falls or fist fights can be mended by magic, but the consequences of curses or backfiring magic could be serious, permanent or life-threatening. This is the reason Gilderoy Lockhart, victim of his own mangled Memory Charm, has permanent amnesia, why the poor Longbottoms remain permanently damaged by magical torture, and why Mad-Eye Moody had to resort to a wooden leg and a magical eye when the originals were irreparably damaged in a wizards' battle; Luna Lovegood's mother, Pandora, died when one of her own experimental spells went wrong, and Bill Weasley is irreversibly scarred after meeting with Fenrir Greyback.

I'll admit that I've extrapolated a bit as to what constitutes "'mundane' nature," but I think that would cover Muggle influenza as well.

Oh, I agree. I've wanted to do a healer!Harry story for ages. I think there's a lot of opportunity for authors who want to delve into the pathology of the HP universe.
