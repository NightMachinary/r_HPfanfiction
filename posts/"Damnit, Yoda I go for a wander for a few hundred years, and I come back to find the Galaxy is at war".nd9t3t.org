TL;DR:

Long ago, Harry arrived in the Star Wars Galaxy.

Because his presence and his magic were pretty much Eldritch Abominations/out of context problems for that reality, he gains the ability to access the Force as well as retaining his magic as the universe tried to work out how to deal with him. Unfortunately, he's stuck being 19/20 biologically.

The caveat to prevent a stereotypical Indie-Harry story?

Unfortunately, his magic and the Force often mix like oil and water, causing completely unpredictable results (some hilarious, some outright dangerous, like causing terenteteks to /implode/).

Over his time, he gained a Caiphus Caine like reputation among the Jedi, becoming pretty much a revered Jedi despite not formally having a Master or 'legitimately' becoming a Knight (sort of like Luke) or the Jedi that rebuilt the Order numerous times after various Sith Purges in Legends' history). Sheer dumb luck and "impossible feats", basically.

He even "mentored" a young Yoda and Yaddle at one point, though that was mostly his giving them tasks to keep them out his hair -- incidentally, they believed these tasks were tests and to learn greater lessons by action... which unintentionally were the case!

He buggers off the Unknown Regions for a hundred years or two.

When he wanders back to Coruscant, he finds his little ship being hailed by the Grand Army of the Republic's traffic control/orbital defences. After getting into an argument with them (as his traffic control codes used with the planet's predecessor organization were pretty much, ah, "obsolete" at this point in time), they call the Jedi Temple.

Yoda gets personally involved after hearing just who it is coming back, and he vouches for him.

...He's excited -- which freaks the Council out a little bit, even Windu!

Rumors quickly spread and many try to catch a 'glimpse' of this "legendary Jedi" that's come home. Unfortunately for Harry, his reputation/legend grew while he was puttering about doing random shit.

As a small crowd gathers, he's already there, mingling with the associated Jedi.

He strikes up a conversation with Ahsoka, who (before she became bitter after her friend's betrayal and attempted framing of her) was still an excitable 15/16 year old.

After teasing her, Yoda finally makes his way down... and makes a beeline for her.

Yoda greets his "old master", and realization dawns on everyone around them -- especially a red-faced Ahsoka.

"Damnit, you little green goblin! I was having a nice little conversation here!"

They're in disbelief at the "disrespect", but Yoda laughs and beckons him to the Council Chambers.

"Damnit, Yoda! I leave for two centuries and the entire Galaxy is at war! What the hell did I miss?"

Unfortunately, while jaded, Harry's "hero thing" is still intact, so he reluctantly steps into the role of a "Jedi General".

Caphius Caine hijinks ensue.

Further thoughts:

- If Harry is instead a year or so young at 17/18, it could be an Ahsoka/Harry pairing -- especially that if she still leaves the Order, she sticks with him as a "consultant"
- If Harry's 19/20 or a little older, he could have a "thing" going on with Master Faye.

  - He fearfully asks if his "wife" is at the Temple, and Yoda laughs
  - Given they're both immortal and wander the Galaxy doing shit, they only occasionally interact/meet
  - To outside parties, he and Faye have a love/hate sort of relationship, and a slight fixation on each other
  - It's not known at large to the Order, so many are surprised to learn of it

- His "mishaps" cause his Clone Troopers to both respect, revere, and fear him.

  - "Here, I can help" is as terrifying to them as "Grievous is having a bad day"

- Anakin sees him as another option to save Padme, so it might throw a massive wrench into the plans of Sidious

So, yeah. Um. I dunno?

**** There's a reason I mentioned the era, not the plot. I mean really, PLANTS are the main villains!? Why not say; the Mandalorians(there was a brief battle between the Jedi and Mandos in the time period in Legends), or the Hutts, or the corruption in the Senate, or an earlier version of the Stark Hyperspace War, or borrow a page from Legends Second Galactic Civil War and have Correlia start something, or explain how the heck Yoda knew about the Rule of Two by having him have a run in with a Sith, or have there not really be an overarching threat at all other than background Sith manipulation like in Legends, or all of the above really!? Sorry about the rant, if it wasn't for the Filoni ran projects I might have dropped anything not feasible in Legends or directly tuned into the original Saga and instead jumped headfirst into fanfic and expanding my Legends portfolio. And yeah, Havoc!Harry can't use the Force but Magic definitely has an impact on it if I'm remembering the plot correctly.

Just use Old Republic for old timey stuff and Pre-Clone Wars for stuff closer to the Prequels/Originals, otherwise you might get leapt on by people who think you like that shit (out of all the SW fans I know, no-one likes the High Republic. At all).

** I know this is a prompt but I can never see Harry becoming a Jedi during the timeline with Yoda, considering Love and attachment in Harry potter is considered a good thing, where as in star wars the jedi seem to think anything considered attachment is a bad thing, Dumbledore and Harry would pity the jedi more then anything. I Also think Harry would be against using a slave army.

*** Ah, but would he consider /himself/ a Jedi?

Plus, there were Jedi that were okay with emotional attachments, even though they were frowned upon. I think it'd upset the Council if this legendary "Jedi" was chill with emotions and love.

Plus, ya know, that thing with Faye, if he's older.

Yoda chuckling at their antics while the rest of the Council/Jedi see these two revered Masters squabbling would be hilarious -- especially since Faye is supposed to be serene, kind, and chilled out.

Edit: And Harry pitying the more rigid Jedi could cause some of the younger members, and indeed some of the existing Knights, to question themselves. Ripple effects right there, I think. :)

** Nobody really noticed the man step out of the junker onto the spaceport's platform, cradling an arm and swearing to himself. "Bloody Mando nobs and their bloody blood debts" he muttered, passing through the security checkpoint without either Mandalorian noticing him.

Nobody noticed him when he got onto the hover platform. Nobody noticed either him or the platform as they sped down the military priority lane, weaving through squads of oblivious, Beskar-clad idiots. "Bloody tradition-obsessed knobheads. It's like dealing with the fucking Prussian Ministry all over again."

Nobody noticed when he docked at the prison. Or when he knocked the guards out. Or when he panicked upon noticing he'd accidentally knocked out Kenobi again. Or when Kenobi snarked at him all the way to Satine's cell. Or when he put his hands on their shoulders and apparated them to the platform his junker had just landed on.

Then, someone did notice him. Harry had developed a very literal interpretation of the meaning behind 'curse word', so when he noticed his ship burning away merrily on the concourse, he strung together just enough foul language to keep himself calm /and/ send the flames of his ship off to set an arsonist or two ablaze. That level of rage fuelled cruelty drew the attention of what looked like a Sith Warrior straight to him.

"Oh bollocks." He groaned as he sent the big bastard flying without the benefit of a jetpack. "Aren't there supposed to be like two of you left at any one time nowadays? I'm getting Sith Empire flashbacks here."

*** I could kinda see Ahsoka filling a sort of adjutant role, if she still leaves the Order: I mean, while she wouldn't be a Jedi, she'd still be under the wing of a "revered" Jedi "Master" and still helping the war effort for the Republic.

If Harry isn't younger and it's not an Ahsoka pairing, her being considered a little sister figure, much to her indignation, could be hilarious.

Heck, it may put Anakin's mind at rest compared to Clone Wars canon... er, except for when she gets caught up in his shenanigans. Then he'd likely have a heart-attack or twelve after finding out, haha.

"She rode a rancor!"

"Ah, no."

"Oh, that's a relief. I knew Snips would be a handful, but that sounds too risky even for her to try."

"...It was a mutated rancor."

"Please tell me she didn't scream like a little girl."

Maybe he could offer Bariss a choice for redemption, too: I mean, her reasons for turning against the Jedi were pretty sound, even if she acted pretty scummy about it. If she realizes he's not like the rest of the current Jedi in attitude, she might consider a deal where he "rehabilitates" her. But, that might be a bit too far fetched/convoluted.

I mean, A romantic relationship/pairing is fine and to be expected, really, but three-way/poly relationships are either written by "one hand" by the author or are the focus of fantasies.

Unless it's a love-triangle, which is actually completely different to a Poly, I never think of Poly relationships in my prompts/ideas.

Unless it's where he dates one girl, they break up, he dates another, and the first girl is still around, and there's tension/issues/lingering doubts/feelings there with the Ex -- but that's more life than some idealized version of Polys.
