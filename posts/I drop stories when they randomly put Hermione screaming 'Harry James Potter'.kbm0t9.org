** OK, now I am imagining a random scene from canon, interrupted by Hermione screaming "Harry James Potter!" at random intervals.

** That brought to mind a possibly interesting idea for a story. A little tragedy, a little horror. Possibly fun. :)

Hermione keeps the Time Turner after they rescue Sirius - the usual Harmony rationalisation of needing time to practice - but it turns out the Time Turner got damaged on the night they rescued Sirius. The Turner may still protect against aging of the body, but no longer so for the mind, and so time travel isn't safe for her anymore. Every jump muddies her mind a little bit further, takes just a little bit more of her memory.

When she finally realises, Hermione, desperate to retain the memories of the few friends she's ever had for as long as she can, makes sure to interact with them as much as possible, keeping those treasured thoughts at the forefront of her mind, knowing full well that each interaction might be her last as all her memories of them drift away into confusion as Cause and Effect intertwine like a mandala. All her nagging, her persistence, her constant use of their full names, is just her trying to hold on.

Could be an interesting exploration of early onset dementia in a younger person who treasures their mind.

** That's not the worst; when Hermione calls him just 'Harry James' I cringe and stop reading immediately.

** I do find it weird the over emphasis fanfic writers put on middle names. Maybe my corner of the world is unusual but I don't think full names are that commonly used when angry with someone (sometimes if joking angry), and even then I think using the middle name is overkill? I can't recall my parents ever using my middle name.

*** It might be an American thing? I've never heard it here in the UK (or known anyone here who's experienced it) and I've only ever seen it in American Media (movies, games, tv, etc).

** As you should. You could classify this as minor bashing, but oddly enough, this is (or at least it was) typically found more in Hermione wank and/or H/Hr stories than bashing fics.

*** Often followed by Remus/Sirius/whoever remarking that Harry and Hermione are like a married couple or comparing them to James and Lily.

** Typically, the usage of your full name---at least in America---is something done by your mother, and lets you know that you really have fucked up this time, and are in a LOT of trouble.

I'd imagine the usage of Harry's full name is to call attention to the fact that Hermione acts more like his mother than his friend---or to just clearly state her role as the Mom Friend.

I'm willing to bet that the writers that do this are American and aren't aware that this isn't a global phenomenon. I'm only just finding out that people in other countries have never experienced the terror of having their mom say their full name when they've done something wrong.
