As the title says I'm looking for a SSHG fanfic, What I can remember is: Severus and Hermione become close, start falling for each other. Her parents aren't muggles, but magical and the women in her mothers family comes of age their magic gets stronger Painful transformation, with shields around Hermione, she calls for Severus and even though the others says it's to dangerous he goes to her They become immune to the unforgivables

Hope you can help me Bibeat

*** I read SS/HG but I've never read this one.

You could try asking over at the [[http://snapeyluvshermy.livejournal.com/][SS/HG Fanfic Recs]] LiveJournal page. Maybe someone there might know the answer.
