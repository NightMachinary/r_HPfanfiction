If you want to talk to other [[/r/hpfanfiction][r/hpfanfiction]] users or just some Harry Potter enthousiasts, come with us on ##hpfanfiction on Freenode. You can use this link if you don't have an IRC client (which is way friendlier): [[http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##hpfanfiction]]

[[/u/denarii]] has created this channel a few months ago and there is some people that come and go but some of us are always there so come and talk with us. :D

The information is available on the side menu but I thought I might attract some more people by reminding it and giving a direct link for those of you who are not used to IRC.
