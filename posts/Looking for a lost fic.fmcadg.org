It's called "The Very Reluctant Saviour of the Wizarding World" and for some reason, it's been deleted from AO3 and [[https://fanfiction.net][fanfiction.net]]

Do any of you know what happened to it?


** Hey, my old account was ynmidk. I deleted/nuked my old accounts mid-November because I kept receiving really hateful PMs over the course of multiple months which really had nothing to do with my fics but were just personal attacks for seemingly no reason.

I recently started re-uploading a couple of my old fics (/Lavender Brown: Hogwarts Champion Extraordinaire/ and /A Different Perspective/) and I plan on doing the same with most of my other fics, /The Very Reluctant Saviour Of The Wizarding World/ included.

My new accounts on FFN and AO3 are the same as my Reddit. Sorry again, at the time just disappearing for a while with my fics seemed like the best course of action and kinda still does tbh. üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

*** I don't understand doing something like that. I understand wanting to disappear because the jerks of the internet have gotten to you, but why not just create a completely new account and start over? If people are personally attacking you, presumably because of the content of your stories, they can easily find you again if you reupload them.

**** I did say "which really had nothing to do with my fics". All those people did was to attack me personally. I think they were just internet trolls and I got unlucky there and I tried reporting them and blocking them but there just were more. At times I would have like ten or twenty PMs telling me to kill myself and that they hoped my daughter would die. She's not even two yet. Not once were my fics mentioned. I couldn't take it anymore so I just burned my old accounts to continue with a new one at a later time when I wouldn't feel as terrible anymore as I did at the time.

Besides, I still want to finish my fics and there are so many people who want to see my fics finished. /The Dark Lady/ alone had over 1k followers. I'd feel terrible to leave them hanging like that and the same goes for everyone else. I recuperated in the time away and even went to therapy (voluntarily) to help me deal with that stuff and I feel stronger than I did during that time.

So, as sensible as starting over completely may sound -- and I /did/ think about it -- I couldn't bring myself to do it. I love what I do and I love my fics and sharing them with the HP community and yeah. While the attacks were not targeted at my fics I /do/ know there's a risk that I might be sought out again if they end up finding me coincidentally. Still, I'm confident I'll be okay this time around. üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
