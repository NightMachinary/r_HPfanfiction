** ...oh, weird, pretty sure I read this today. He rocketed the dragon, dropped a grenade on the merfolk and strong-armed them into bringing up all 4 hostages, and used a flamethrower to get through the maze. Lemme check my browser history.

ETA: Come to think of it, I /do/ recall at least one other that involved using an RPG on the dragon; so, apologies if this isn't actually the one you're looking for.

  When his name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, Harry decides to stop "rolling over" and "just taking it." He has "Marauder godfathers" and decides to have them help him strike back. A one-shot. H/G eventually

  Harry gets picked for the Triwizard Tournament. He does not like this. Mayhem, destruction, and HHR. OOC Harry. M for violence and frequent profanity.

***** I very much enjoyed the concept that Purebloods would have themselves Obliviated after an injury or humiliation, making them literally incapable of learning from their mistakes. Honestly explains so many "technical insanity" incidents in canon, especially from Draco.
