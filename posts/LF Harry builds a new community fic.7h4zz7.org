I'm looking for a fic where Harry and others create their own community / society and fight for what is right. Something similar to Sunset by Bobmin, or The Harem War.


** Esama's "Island of Fire" series is the closest thing I can think of. There's 5 works in the arc; hasn't been updated since last year, but stops at a reasonable place.
