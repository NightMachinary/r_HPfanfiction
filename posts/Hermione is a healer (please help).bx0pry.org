:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to find a fanfic that is Hermione x Snape, Hermione has healing powers from a very young age and heals the small creatures that need help in her back garden as a child although her parents cannot see them. Snape had been cursed I believe by voldermort to be a beast / monster, he is badly hurts and appears before a young Hermione and she helps to heal him and comfort him. The Snape creature then visits her throughout her years until the final battle until she finds out who it is and then the plot twist at the end. I would be extremely grateful for any help finding this again, thank you.


** Hmm, I'm not sure, but corvusdraconis is right up your alley if you are into the crackfics.
