[Warning: Very minor spoilers for Hunter x Hunter's combat system]

Whilst an argument can be made that it is the ambiguity of HP's magic system which enables such great fan interpretations to appear it incredibly hinders “magic-intensive” fics. By that I mean fics which place the usual abundant character interactions in the passenger seat in favour of magical combat, progress in magical studies, and the exploration of magic itself. In regards to the nature of the magic system, I'm not referring to a simple dragonball power level system, but one with complexity that explains the varying magical power of the characters.

In my personal opinion, the best example of such a system is Hunter x Hunter's nen system. It efficiently explains the different strengths of characters, as well as why they face certain limitations and allows for incredibly creative combat styles. Harry Potter's system in comparison is also segregated, but in an arguably detrimental manner, as well as not well-defined and consisting of poorly translated Latin canon and fanon spells. I don't believe I should have to skim most combat scenes in fanfiction if I haven't learnt a plethora of bullshit spells by heart, and I don't believe fanfiction readers should have to suffer as a result of Rowling's failures as an author.

If a fanfiction were to emerge that's amazingly popular and has a well-reasoned similarly popular system of magic I really believe the community would benefit from such a quintessential system of magic.


** I would argue that the open nature is a great boon independent of what you are writing. It gives you the freedom to make magic exactly what you need for your story, from some well researched Norse runes up to "enchanted AK-47s".

Even with well-defined canon magic you would often run out into situations where you need to be creative, but you have to keep the whole thing in mind instead of inventing magical spikes which shoot out of the ground and impale people. And if your ideas are incompatible, you have to make up your own thing either way.

*** I think too many people forget that using magic is not the same thing as magic itself.

Magic is as it always was. What people do is the thing that changes.

How do people end up doing what they do? A hypothetical example:

Ancient wizard caveman can make fire without sticks. Holding wood staff makes fire better. Many generations later, tying feather from some birds to some sticks makes fire much better. Generations later and wizard staffs are a thing some guy accidentally teleports and loses his foot. He remembers what teleporting felt like and learns how to do that and tells his clan what he did.

Rinse and repeat until you have wizard enclaves with their own internal knowledge. Various wars and power struggles result in lost knowledge and one way of using magic starts being used instead of another for purely political reasons. Eventually wands happen, a sort of informal government happens, etc...

Just knowledge and events building on previous knowledge and events until you have the modern wizarding world. Lots of lost and suppressed knowledge. Always more to discover or invent.

Edit: also wanted to say, you mentioned that if a popular fic with a good system of magic were to occur it would be great, you should take a look at Out of the Night, it was on its way there.

** I would think the ambiguity of canon is more help than hindrance. It gives writers freedom to interpret and portray things how they like, as you wrote. They can invent whatever they want for their story and have it plausible for canon.

That being said, in my opinion having (and explaining in detail) a complex 'system' is pretty boring to read, no matter how well conceived. You don't need any of that to write a decent battle scene.

** Well, with regards to combat, the thing is that any system can and usually is "gamed" - both by authors and by the characters using it. If you're risking your life in combat, you generally go for what works best when fighting. I encounter this often when writing battle scenes. Sure exotic spells would add colour - but few of my characters would use exotic spells when a simpler spell they know by heart would work as well or better, and few would learn a lot of exotic spells when there are simpler spells who work in more situations. The Stunner is a staple for very good reasons, for example, and superiour to most spells in many situations. Many fanon spells are basically useless from a tactical perspective because they need to hit the target, but then don't take it out at once or even need a second spell to "complete the combo". You can see that in games: If there are spells who take out a target in one hit, then debuffing the target is only viable if that's easier than hitting with the kill spell and makes hitting them with a kill spell easier.

So, even if you add a rich, creative range of combat spells, odds are most characters will use the same select few if they were staying in character.

** I'm not a fan of battle sequences, but I would have also liked to see JKR develop a 'harder' magic system for HP. I mean, Care of Magical Creatures (Hagrid went overboard but it usually covers safer and more common creatures) is an optional course starting in year 3 but Astronomy is so important that it is mandatory for 5 years - why? Unfortunately JKR sucks at world building - I feel like her writing process was "here's a plot, now let's see what interesting characters and random magical elements I can shoehorn in?"

** I feel like magic shouldn't be completely explained like nen's type diagrams and power/defense formulas,but it would be nice if it was more like avatar's “magic.”It should still have defined rules that can be slightly stretched.

** I'm reading a Harry Potter story, not watching a Dota/League game.

I don't want to be able to do a calculation of how many hitpoints a character will take and what set of debuffs and DoTs apply to them.

I want combat that shows the strengths, weaknesses and personalities of the participants in a creative way.

Take, for example, linkffn(A Black Comedy).

ABC has amazing fights which showcase the personality of Harry, Sirius and James pretty darn well, and are a pleasure to read. You don't need to know the pig latin spells, the scenes work anyways, because nonjon is a good author.

And those scenes are that great because of the freedom of the looseness of canon. Sure, nonjon would probably also be able to write an impressive scene with a hero with four Dota-style abilities, but the creativity of both the spells he uses and how he uses the established magic arms is nothing short of amazing.

And in canon, regarding the new films: It is an amazing way to differentiate normal-skilled characters that treat wands as guns from the high-skilled amazing characters that use magic creatively and seem to be less affected and restricted by "point-and-shoot"-spells.

The magic system in HP works pretty well imo, and allows for creative fanfiction without being as soft as the LOTR-system.

** I don't buy this in this context. While it's generally true that creativity tends to be (for want of a better term) cooler in a system with clear limitations, Nen in HxH is incredible open in what it allows for many of its characters to do.

Sure HP is a lot broader but the creativity is more in how the spells are used as opposed to the spell itself being the product of creation. See a lot of Hermione's spellcasting. Also this:

When is there poorly translated Latin in series? A lot of people seem to think JKR was stupid or something for not simply pasting in complete, real Latin words instead of mashing together bits of them. But what they fail to note is she's going for style, ease of speech, etymological comprehension and memorability. /Expelliarmus/ is used because it's really easy, even for young people, to read the word and have an immediate idea about the effect ("Ah, I bet that expels, or rather, removes, the target's weapons or what have you", as an example).
