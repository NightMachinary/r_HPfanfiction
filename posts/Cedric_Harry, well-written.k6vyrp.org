I randomly became obsessed with Cedric/Harry the other day but am having trouble finding decent fic\\
- a lot of the stuff on AO3 is either not well written or the Cedric/Harry pairing is just one of many and not really the focus. Does anyone have any recommendations? Bonus points for post-Hogwarts fic where Cedric is still alive. Sex scenes are fine (read: yes please) as long as Harry is of age.


** I got you, OP!

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/14016627]] - This one is freaking funny! It starts after the quidich match in 3rd year where Harry gets attacked by dementors.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/22953583]] - This one is a bit different. Harry falls in the Veil at the Ministry during the fight in the fifth book, he goes to a different universe as that Harry's sister.

​

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/8517286]] - In this one Harry has a crush on Cedric, it's not finished yet, but the author said it was going to be pre-slash

** Would you be interested in an ongoing fic? I'm currently subscribed to one called Stay Alive for now. It's very slow but also very well written. Basically without spoiling too much it's an au where Cedric doesn't die in the cemetery and it kind of follows the fifth book but with Cedric still there.

#+begin_quote
  Harry spends the whole summer before fourth year feeling restless. He chalks it up to the weird dreams he's been having, assuming Voldemort is responsible. And for some dreams, that's true - but what about the other ones? The ones that feel... familiar?Back at school, things change one morning in September, when he and three other students wake up with the memories of the four Hogwarts founders in their heads. They don't know why they've returned, or how it happened, but they know one thing - they changed the Wizarding World before, and they're going to do it again. It's about time they shook things up a bit.Tagged underage for Harry/Cedric (14/17)

** I can't remember the name but a while ago I read a good Harry/Cedric on AO3 that became Harry/Edward Cullens because Cedric was somehow sent back in time by Voldemort, lost his memory then became a vampire. You can probably find it under the Harry Potter/Edward Cullens relationship tag.
