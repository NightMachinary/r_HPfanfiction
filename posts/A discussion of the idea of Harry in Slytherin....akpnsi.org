Okay, so quite a while back, one day I was bored and [[https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4829/46832221072_0912b5c994_n.jpg][I did this edit in Photoshop]]. After I did that, I started looking around for decent Slytherin!Harry fics, but I've not been impressed with what I found, because most of the ones I have found tended to fall into one of two categories:

- Harry is evil, an overpowered Gary Stu, or both. Which I hate
- Flip the “Gryffindor Good, Slytherin Bad” canon script(which is my biggest problem with the franchise as a whole) but without actually addressing the problem. Usually, these end up being some flavor of “Slytherin Good, Gryffindor Stupid”, with Harry and two random Slytherins taking on the role of the canon Trio, with no other substantial changes. Which can, I suppose, be entertaining, but isn't really all that interesting

What I was really looking for was one where the main characters are *not* all in the same House. So that you have, on top of everything else, the challenge of maintaining a friendship in spite of the prevalent animosity between different Houses. I'd be curious to read something like that...

Come to think of it, I am considering /writing/ something along those lines myself, though I'm struggling with the story because I don't want to end up with just a rehash of canon. So I'd be especially curious to discuss with folks here what we think might happen given main characters being in three different Houses.


** On the Way to Greatness - linkffn(4745329) - is my favourite Slytherin Harry fic by far. He's definitely not canon Harry, nor does he magically become friends with Malfoy or get along with Snape just because he's a Slytherin, which is a trope I see a lot. He really feels like a Slytherin. If you're going to read it though I should mention the first two years or so are still very similar to canon and feel rather summary-like but the story definitely takes off on its own after that.

**** Yeah, Snape and Malfoy - /especially/ Malfoy, who's an arrogant git - being suddenly friends with Harry is one I see quite a bit of where I have a real hard time, because Malfoy is an even worse bully than Dudley, and I really don't see that being any different. If anything I think it would probably be even /worse/ with Harry being in the same House.

Snape is more complex, because on the one hand, Harry is the spitting image of James - who was a right foul git towards Snape in his own right when they were at school, from the little that we know - but on the other his personality and character seems very /unlike/ his father's, and IMO possibly closer to his mother's. So there's narrative potential there that's wasted in scenarios where, as you put it, Harry suddenly befriends Snape.

Later on I changed the tie colors and the emblems on the uniforms. Initially I used the movie colors, so Hermione was in +red+*/blue/*/silver(which are the Ravenclaw colors in the movies). A week or so ago I went back and switched the silver to book-accurate bronze.blue, which I actually think looks better.

** Oh, I still think Lightning on the Wave's massive epic, The Sacrifices Arc, deals with this beautifully. Each House is so diverse, full of well-rounded characters who defy easy categorization, that it quickly become apparent that, even though Slytherin!Harry certainly qualifies as Slytherin, no character is merely the sum of his or her parts, and the differences between Houses are way overblown by the characters themselves until they slowly, painfully learn better.

This Harry is certainly a kind of Gary Stu, at least in terms of raw power if not a lack of flaws (he's got them in spades). But he's also the most democratic Harry I've ever read, and the fic is focus on equality and justice in a way that no other is. So perhaps it's what you're looking for.

** There is a very good chance that Harry will be murdered within his sleep a week into the year.

However, since we are here to discuss a possible story, let's disregard that.

I don't think that Harry would make friends in Slytherin, at least not in his year. Malfoy is still a racist, spoiled brat and a bully who is way too much like Dudley for Harry to like. Since no Slytherin calls Malfoy out, ever, it seems unlikely that Harry would get along with any of them. I mean, we are talking about the boy who went to save the Stone without any obligation or combat capability.

No friendship with Ron, given his attitude towards Slytherin on the Hogwarts express. No friendship with Hermione since that required a troll and being Ron's friend for the exact sequence of events to happen. He might befriend her later on, but certainly not in a canon fashion. Malfoy and his "followers" are out, so no Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy or Daphne (Pansy's friend in extended canon). Honestly, either Ravenclaw friends or some Muggleborns who don't understand what the whole fuss is about (Harry Potter a Slytherin? So what?).

As for the plot, fast forward through year one. The stone should not concern Harry without Ron and Hermione to "solve" the clues and without them, the conversations with Hagrid would go differently as well. Show Harry befriending Padma and Terry, or maybe Megan Jones. No assimilation into the Weasley family.

Year two would be tricky since Harry has not a lot to base an investigation on. He knows that Malfoy is talking shit without a Tom Clancy infiltration mission. No "friendship" with Myrtle, so he does not get the diary. However, that may leave it clogging a pipe in that toilet instead of returning to Ginny, so the attacks might fizzle out on their own. So probably fast forwarding again.

Year three is where the fun can begin, the course entirely depending on Ginny's fate. Ginny dead = No Family vacation = No picture in the Prophet = No Sirius escape = Pettigrew does not leave for Albania. Of course, that chain might diverge at any point I mentioned.

*** In canon, Ginny broke free of the Diary and dumped in Myrtle's bathroom. If it were not for Harry nosing around there, the Diary could get lost for many years.

A Slytherin Harry is not likely to do that.

Thus, Sirius breaking out in Year 3 is very provable. But since Harry lives in Slytherin Dungeon, while Sirius targets the Gryffindor dorm, people are going to ask questions. My take is Sirius eats Wormtail and goes on the run. Next year, Barty Jr breaks free too and goes on the run. These two guys are going to drive the plot forward.

**** I agree that (Mo-)Ron would be out of the picture (he's too narrow minded and prejudiced (he's a more intelligent Hagrid for fuck's sake and believes that all bad wizards are Slytherins!)), same for Hermione (at first at least) because no troll (or if there is, then Harry wouldn't know that Hermione is missing as she's not in his house and he didn't witness Ron being a dumbass (or if he did he would still not know that Hermione is missing, unless he pays special attention to her!)...Hermione might DIE! Hell, this could be something that kicks Harry into action as it shows a cunning and ambitious guy (Slytherin after all) that the wiz-world is fucking dangerous and schools aren't a safe-place at all, so he'd take steps to make his survival more likely! Especially if he's a pariah in his year and Malfoy is abusive towards him without being stopped by Snape, despite being a fellow Slytherin! He's basically alone, he has no friends (he might talk to some of the upper years, but true friendships? I doubt it!) in his house and he knows his life might be on the line, so what would he do? Learn magic, maybe even truly dangerous (dark!) magic! Fighting fire with fire and all that!)

Hell, Harry might not even end up on the Quidditch team (would a first year Harry who's not in Neville's house and is constantly hounded by Malfoy - without anybody backing him up etc. - care to catch the remembrall?)

I agree that he'd stick with neutral purebloods ("House divide? What do I care? Sides in the last war? My family was neutral!") and half-bloods and especially muggleborns ("Houses? Seriously, they aren't super important!")

Yeah, Malfoy being at least as bad as Dudley(if not worse) to me would guarantee that the two would /NOT/ end up on any kind of friendly terms. And Crabbe and Goyle are basically Malfoy's brainless muscle for most of the series, so the three of those would in all likelihood be the bane of Harry's existence, especially given Snape's own obvious bias towards Malfoy.

On the other hand, while it is true that in canon “no Slytherin calls Malfoy out, ever”, it's also true that I think out of the entire year, there's only like, five Slytherins that get any mention and only two or three that get any meaningful development. That leaves a lot of room for possibly developing some of the others.

What I've seen a lot, which I find less interesting even if done well, is that usually two random Slytherins end up becoming “Slytherin Ron with a different name” and “Slytherin Hermione with a different name”. Which falls into the same trap that canon does by concentrating the main characters all into the same House.

Speaking of which, here's another thought I had. I noticed reading the book that a disproportionate number of times, Gryffindor and Slytherin end up being in the same class together -- they're consistently the same two Houses together in Snape's Potions class, Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures class, and they're also the same two that are in Lupin's Defense Against the Dark Arts class. Even Madam Hooch's flying lessons in Book 1 specifically groups the two together. There are very few, if any cases where Gryffindor is in the same class with one of the other two Houses(I think Professor Sprout's Herbology class mentions a Hufflepuff student being in the same class at one point, but it's the only one I can think of)

That's something else that I think I'd want to change, because by varying the House that Gryffindor(or Slytherin, as the case may be) has class with Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff.

Eh, maybe. The foundation for the Harry/Ron friendship was, IMO, already laid long before they arrived at Hogwarts, when they met on the train. That said, Ron's own prejudiced attitude towards Slytherin would be an obstacle -- one that Harry would, I think, be quite keen to overcome, particularly since he would have very few other friends his own age.

Speaking of Year 2, here's one thought I just had that /does/ complicate things quite a bit.

Assuming, unlikely as it is, that Harry ends up finding the Chamber of Secrets...no Sword of Gryffindor, since we know that the sword presents itself “to any worthy */Gryffindor/*”, and Harry would be disqualified based on that criterion...so how does he kill the basilisk?

Destroying the diary is still feasible, albeit with a great deal more difficulty. But even assuming he destroys the diary and defeats Tom, there's still the massive snake to deal with.

***** I actually don't think Hermione would make it to third year. Surely Ron would still insult her and she'd run off, and Harry and Ron not being friends and Harry not being in Gryffindor means no rescue mission. The teachers, in canon, arrived too late. I think Hermione might be toast.

****** Not necessarily. We know that accidental magic can make you shock resistant and elastic. Neville was thrown out of a window and simply bounced back up. And without Harry there, Ron wouldn't be making that remark in the first place, or at least not make it at the exact time Hermione was nearby. The odds of that scenario happening like it did without Harry involved are ridiculously small.

Lord knows /that's/ true. IIRC, it's mentioned in /PS/ that the troll incident was a major milestone in that Hermione mellowed out considerably after that. That said, Hermione as a Ravenclaw would be around a lot more students who are more likely to be similarly...unpleasant, which makes things interesting in terms of how that might affect her character as well.

** Eh, there are a fair number of entertaining fics that run with the idea. In addition to InquisitorCOC's recommendations, PoS linkffn(11191235) has much larger divergences as the story goes on, and the main characters are definitely spread out. There are several other fics that also address the issues you have with Slytherin. Another great fic that isn't a Slytherin fic, but has all the child characters in different houses, is What You Leave Behind linkffn(10758358). Harry is aged up a year and is friends with Cho and Cedric.

For your idea, you could go with the structure of a more AU fic like Black Luminary or Hogwarts Battle School- you essentially change the setup and specifics of the world fairly drastically, no canon events occur, but you're still working with similar pieces, characters, locations, etc and the fic still takes place at Hogwarts and captures the same feeling of magic. Or you can go the PoS/DPSW route, where you're essentially still inspired by and following canon events, but draw them out and still adding literally dozens of fresh twists rather than just one or two. I don't want to get into the specifics if that'd spoil the fics for you, but let me know if you don't mind spoilers and I can elaborate on some specific stuff that's done very well in these worlds.

Also, you have to think about it from a logical standpoint- the house system, as it's used in real life, is really just a way to organize the kids into groups for support, housing, and scheduling ease. And the proximity principle means you're likely to form stronger relationships, both good and bad, with people that you're physically close to regularly. It takes extra plotting to make a stronger relationship naturally grow with those extra barriers, rather than another "Harry is in Slytherin/some other house, but oh wait! Neville and Hermione are still great friends with him just because they're popular characters," which ends up happening fairly frequently.

Also, many fics play up/overplay the animosity between houses and herd mentality, if anything, so you could always go in a different direction.

That's true as well, which I think is part of why the idea of splitting the Trio across different Houses appeals to me. I mean, take Ron for example. The two of them meet and are already well on their way to being friends even before the Sorting. So I think that Harry at least, who has never had a friend his own age before, would be likely to work harder to keep that first friendship even if they were split into different Houses.

** The problem with Slytherin stories, besides the fact that they play into the tired (Gryff good/Slytherin bad or Slytherin good/Gryff stupid) trope is that many of the older years are going to have parents or relatives who were locked up or killed during the first war with Voldemort. And yet almost always, Harry is semi-widely accepted or doesn't have a hard time or he can't find a single person to bond with

It's why Mira Mirth's story was good, because they showed that weird balance where he befriended Millie and Blaise, who had their own reasons for not falling completely in line with the rest of the house and he had to walk a fine line in his house. You may wish to try With a Forked Tongue, I Lie in Wait, which also shows an interesting balance although Snape is out of character nice towards Harry.

I always thought it would be interesting to see a Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw Harry, tbh. I never really saw any cunning, unlike Hermione, but he has almost blind loyalty.

*** There's a (so far) decent Hufflepuff Harry fic on Potions and Sniches titled "Odd Wizards" by Timorous, but 1. there is only one chapter so far (sep.2018) and 2. the site itself has to do with Harry & Snape so all stories on there have to have (at some point) those two be main characters. No romance though, and you can sort by the kind of Snape you want, so if you want him to be a complete ass you can use that flare. I don't even think their relationship has to be amicable, I read one where Snape's mean/asshole attitude towards Harry was absolutely vile and over the top and it was...something else.

Just a heads up in case you're not a fan of Snape & Harry stories (again, never romantic)

** My main problem with "Harry in Slytherin" fics is that it hardly ever does anything interesting with the characters.

Let's face it, in canon the Slytherins are barely characters at all... Draco Malfoy is the only real three-dimensional Slytherin in Harry's year. Otherwise? Pansy Parkinson's a bitch with no redeeming qualities and Blaise Zabini is arrogant and self-obsessed... and Crabbe and Goyle are stupid minions who don't even get a spoken line until the very last book. The rest of the Slytherins are just names. They get NO characterization. The only thing we know about Milicent Bulstrode is that she's ugly and has a cat. Theodore Nott can apparently see Thestrals, but he gets no attention in the books. The rest of them are just a bunch of names, if that.

With Slytherin!Harry, a fanfic author has to essentially create a lot of OCs with canon names.Problem is, fandom cliches are rampant, and so we get awful stuff like Daphne Greengrass, Ice Queen of Slytherin, and a house of children obsessed with political manipulations, written by people who don't have the first clue about children OR about political manipulations.

Only a FEW stories I ever read made the Slytherins interesting characters, and none of them featured Slytherin!Harry.

I want to give them a chance after reading The Red Knight the other day (only until ch13 or so) - the writing is better than most fics I read but I just can't seem to get into the dialogue and jokes, I thought the interaction between Ron and the characters would be amusing but for some reason it's just not doing it for me.

**** Well, the gold standard, of course, is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3979062/1/Hogwarts-Houses-Divided][Hogwarts Housed Divided]] by Inverarity... of course that's a next-generation fic about Teddy Lupin's first Hogwarts year, and is mostly OCs... but Inverarity has the gift so rare in a fanfic author that he can write OCs that are actually interesting and fun to read. All four houses get a good showing here, including Slytherin.

Slytherins in this fic aren't your average "elite of Hogwarts, master political manipulators at age eleven" fanfic Slytherins... they're a bunch of children and teenagers who want to seem big and bad, partly to cultivate an image, partly because Slytherins just ARE a little nastier by nature... and partly as a defense mechanism cause the other three houses hate them. I love this fic; it doesn't turn Slytherin into misunderstand woobies, but it gives plenty of reminders that however nasty they can be, they're still just KIDS.

-

When it comes to stories set in Harry's year with interesting Slytherin characters... eh... I could have sworn I read some... but the only one I can actually think about right now is Sekrit Project by Chilord... which isn't on any traditional fanfic sites but can be read on the Fanfiction Federation site. (You have to have a forum or Tapatalk account to read it, but it's here: [[https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/fanfictionfederation/hp-sekrit-projekt-t468.html]] )

Mind you, Sekrit Project,,, isn't... the best fic ever. It has some really neat ideas, like Harry and Ron getting involved in the organizing of the Triwizard Tournament (thereby disqualifying them form actually taking part in it) together with Slytherin girl Tracey Davis, and Ron developing a talent for potions, but there's ALSO cliches galore, the first few chapters are a pain to slog though because there's an overuse of the Marauder's Map (and the Marauders aren't nearly as funny as Chilord seems to think).... annnnnd there's more than a bit of "male sex fantasy" vibe there because one of the big plot threads involves a potion accident that turns ALL the Slytherin students, male and female, first-years to seventh-years, into incredibly hot girls.

...yeah. And, let's put it this way, they're very clearly incredibly hot girls that are written by a heterosexual dude.

Thing is, though, SOMEHOW in this fic the Slytherins are FUN to read. Both before and after their transformation into incredibly hot girls, they have PERSONALTIES. They have conversations that are interesting. It's also kind of nice to see Tracey Davis be the main Slytherin for once, not Draco Malfoy or Daphne Greengrass.

The Gryffindor/Slytherin conflict's also done better than in many fanfics, because this fic at least points out that both Gryffindor and Slytherin are at fault.

** The Slytherin Harry idea has been done to death, to the point where it's a cliche and very trope-y; it has to add new things or new twists in order for me to find it personally interesting.

I feel that him being sorted in Ravenclaw or Hufflepuff is written much less, and could potentially be written interestingly.

What if Harry hid in the school's library at the Muggle school, away from Dudley? What if he was more interested in studying or learning about the Wizarding World at large?

What if his loyalty showed up more, what if he displayed other personality traits that would show him being sorted into Hufflepuff? What if he could unite the four houses this way?

I like the Slytherin Harry idea, but the execution is often rather poor or indifferent about the ideal. (IMO; from what I've seen).

** Yeah, I get it, but from the outside Gryffs really are dumb! Seriously, Harry is 11 when he stops Voldemort the first time, yes he tried to get help from McGonagall, but after that fails he doesn't even try other professors or send for the Aurors (hell, he doesn't even know what an Auror is till year 4 when (Fake-)Moody shows up!)...nope, he rushes in "Super-" Harry to the rescue (despite the fact that he isn't super and Voldemort plays with him and he knows how outclassed he is! Yes it is brave, but it is also mindblowingly stupid and suicidal (not something normal teenagers do! Hell, IMHO that shows how much Harry values his own life, which isn't much! Seriously, he treats his own life like a throw away item!))

They are also narrow minded ("All bad wizards are from Slytherin!" - Yeah right, explain Pettigrew and some other DEs then, who are not Slytherin but Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and probably even Hufflepuff!)! Even supposedly super-smart Hermione is narrow minded ("You are all barbarians and slavers! Slavery of houselfs is immoral...etc." - has she cracked open a book on the subject? Has she asked the professors and her classmates about the subject? I don't think so, it's not in the book after all!)!

They are also prone to violence (yes, Draco deserved it, but they attacked him on multiple occasions (Hermion punched him for example!)) instead of looking for other solutions!

Sure the Slytherins are - from their POV - cowards, but their solutions (letting Harry and Ron run into Snape instead of duelling them etc.) are more creative and certainly better than a direct attack!

ps: I love Slytherin Harry fics where he has to fight for his place (and has setbacks!) - It's a long way to the top after all (yes: I like AC/DC!) - and has competent opponents who will not just lay down and take it!

Yeah, I'm inclined to agree that Harry's shocking disregard for his own safety does border on the stupid. Being selfless, as Harry is described by Dumbledore at one point, is one thing. But Harry demonstrates a near-total lack of concern for self-preservation at multiple points that seems abnormal even for a Gryffindor.

Not that I disagree with you(I don't), but I think the prejudice is less "all bad wizards are Slytherin" and more "all Slytherins are bad". The net result is the same, of course; inherent prejudice against one particular House, resulting in Slytherins in general, with only one or two exceptions, being typecast as "The Villains" - a serious flaw in the books IMO. Nowhere is this more evident than in Book 5, where the DA includes students from /every single House EXCEPT Slytherin/. You're telling me, in that entire House, there's not a single student who realized that Umbridge is evil scum and wanted to do something about it? ^{I actually had one or two ideas as to how to handle that, if I ever were to actually start writing this as-yet incomplete story idea of mine}

Well, she punched him in the movie. In the book, she slapped him - though that doesn't really change anything, and let's face it, Malfoy completely deserved that. Then, speaking of Hermione, there's the incident with the birds in /OotP/.

Oh, I definitely agree, and that's something I'd like to cover if I ever write this; Harry ends up stuck in Slytherin, with most of the House including its Head being so prejudiced against him that he has to struggle to fit in and fight for his place.
