** Linkffn(the crown of MÃ©tis)

Explores White Magic, which is effectively light magic. I recall enjoying it quite a bit! Focuses only on a young Tom Riddle and a few OCs though, not Harry or Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  Your betrothal to Thor was convenient- brokered as an alliance between two powerful families. Your marriage to Loki was... unimaginable. And yet, here you are, standing at the alter promising yourself to the God of Lies, Mischief, and Chaos. With no family or allies, you navigate Asgard entangled in a treasonous plot. Fueled by revenge, and blinded by hatred, you'll do anything
