It's a Femharry/TRM/Voldemort(I'm Not Sure). So, FemHarry goes back in time(Marauder) with Eleven year old Tom(I think its horcrux in her head). She pose as a teacher in Hogwarts and Tom as her son(adopted I think). She started working with Voldemort and I think they are sort of distance cousin(Or she tells him that). Tom gets jealous of her and Voldemort been close.
