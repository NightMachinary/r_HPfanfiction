So in 'The Well Groomed Mind', there's this moment when Tom tells Harry about how Joseph Leeds warded pretty much an entire city (I think Dresden?) against magical transportation and then single-handedly killed most of Grindelwald's elite by blowing it sky high using Fiendfyre and muggle bombs.

I just wanna read more stories with insane shit like this, please give me your best 'oof what a crazy fucker' moment fics.


** Linkffn(Lady Archimedes) has a scene where she releases self replicating micron scale rune stones to create a Grey Goo to eat her enemies.

  Sequel to The Arithmancer. Years 5-7. Armed with a N.E.W.T. in Arithmancy after Voldemort's return, Hermione takes spellcrafting to new heights and must push the bounds of magic itself to help Harry defeat his enemy once and for all.

** Can't remember the fic name (and really isn't on the same scale) but there's one where, in the graveyard duel, Harry conjures a swarm of butterflies to both shield against curses and then transfigures them into blades that he launches at Tom.

** This sort of thing is quite common in linkffn(Divided and Entwined), if you can stay interested in the story for long enough. Though a lot of it involves explosives rather than magic.

*** I would not say the bombs qualify as "insane shit" in the story. However, Voldemort's use of a particular limb-crippling curse should qualify, both how he spread it and what it turned out to do.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
