It was on fanfiction.net as story 8982722 I was several chapters in and got too busy to finish. Now it says: "Story Not Found Unable to locate story with id of 8982722."


** You can get it here on Dropbox. -> [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/rx8xrkmxcqvt932/Lena%20Phoria%20-%20Cruel%20and%20Beautiful%20World%20%5BRated%20M%5D.pdf?dl=0][Link]]

The author has [[https://www.amazon.com/Broken-Wings-Cruel-Beautiful-World-ebook/dp/B01HG0FWT0#nav-subnav][published a book]] based on the fic and has removed the story from FF.net.
