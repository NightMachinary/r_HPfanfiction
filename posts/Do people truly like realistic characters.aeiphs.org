The fact that Gary Stu/Mary Sue fics are so common and popular makes me think that a lot of people don't like realistic characters as much as they would like to think.

Also, many hate how Harry is so frustrated and angry in OoTP no matter how it makes sense for him to be that way considering his situation. Seriously, try to consider everything Harry had been through during that year and tell me which teenager wouldn't be frustrated. I would argue that a lot of /adults/ would have reacted worse than Harry if they had been through everything he did. I mean he was traumatized by the death of Cedric Diggory and when he returned to the wizarding world he found out that the media slandered him and his new teacher was an evil creature that literally tortured him for simply telling the truth. That is too much for a 15 years old. Objectively, it makes sense that he would be angry and act irrationally yet many still seem to hate him for it. It makes me think that people dislike it when a character shows too much weakness.

Now, I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with Gary Stus, if this is what some people prefer, then who am I to judge. I am just asking to see what people think.


** I personally don't want realistic characters. Overly realistic characters are boring, too much realism always is. I want to read a fantasy story, which means I want the characters to be fantastical. The problem I have with the more Stu/Sue characters is that they are too far the other way, perfect flawless characters are also just boring.

What I want is /believable/ characters. Characters which have their own reasons for doing things, their own beliefs and choices. Even if those characters are absurd they don't detract from the story being told.

**** Pretty much.

Like in fifth year, everyone loves to make a big deal about how Harry ignored the mirror Sirius gave him for Christmas. But that was in the middle of his teenage angst "I must do everything myself" phase. Even though Sirius told Harry to use it whenever he needed him, he never actually told Harry what it /was/, so Harry chucked it into his trunk and resolved to never use it in order to not tempt Sirius into doing something stupid that would get him caught. (Going from memory here but I think that's the gist.)

We also have the benefit of hindsight and a third person narration to inform our thoughts on the matter.

On a tangentially related note since I brought up Sirius, I'm a complete sucker for stories that give him the happy ending he (IMO) richly deserves, because the majority of his life was shit and I think the story of the Marauders in general is utterly tragic.

** What matters most for me is that characters are unique, consistent and developed.

By unique I mean that once you get used to each character it should be possible to tell who's doing and saying what without actually having the name mentioned. I'll give you exceptions for things like Fred and George.

By consistent I mean that once character traits are set they remain constant or evolve in realistic ways over time. That's one of the problems I have with Black Luminary - Harry seems to lurch from one thing to another for no good reason.

By developed I mean that we've got to know stuff about the character; how they became the way they are and so on. There was a book club story a while back where we were told that one of the OCs was "dark" and the other wsa "nice" but they were just labels and never adequately explored.

As long as those criteria are fulfilled I'm not really that bothered if a character is realistic. A story like "Harry Potter and the Marriage Contracts" by Clell65619 has characters that are way over the top but it's still a fun read.

I think you have to have either all characters being realistic or unrealistic though. Having one hugely overpowered character amongst a population of otherwise peopleis a recipe for a really dull story, for instance.

** The thing is, people have different tastes and opinions. One reader's Mary Sue is another reader's underpowered useless character.

Personally, I loathe characters with more issues than National Geographic. It breaks my Suspension of Disbelief if people who can't deal with their faults and function are portrayed as being officers, for example. If you can't control yourself and have to lash out everyone "disrespecting" you, or will jump at every challenge, no matter how suicidal, you don't get promoted in the Military, for example.

I want to read about heroes, not bundles of nerves who only succeed thanks to author fiat and have more complexes than a Woody Allen character.

** Personally I wasn't really annoyed by Harry in OotP. I found the bit where everyone did their best to stomp on Harry, occasionally including his friends annoying.

Seriously, all it would have taken is a note from Dumbledore slipped to Harry by an Order member saying "Harry, Voldemort is building power and might be spying on you, so I've asked your friends not to write you. Also, you have a direct line to Voldemort in your head, so I can't be sure he won't try to use that to read your mind if we're in the same room. Sorry about that."

That took me about two minutes to write, and would have cut half the drama.

** Realistic. What is realistic? Do you have any idea how fucking weird our world is? There is a species of shrimp that cracks its claw so fast that it creates light. There is a sea slug as big as a small dog. There's a fungus that turns ants into zombies. There are people who wear fursuits of anthropomorphic animals because it turns them on. People have built cities on the slopes of volcanoes. The Voynich manuscript is one of the most famous works of writing because it's so fucking weird that we have no idea what the fuck it is.

I think people like /interesting/ characters. What makes a character interesting? Characters who are proactive, competent, characters who are odds with their situation (SI are decently popular because who hasn't wondered how they would do dropped into a dangerous fictional universe?).

Mary Sues are derided because they tend to accomplish everything without struggle, and aren't stories basically about struggle? Struggling to do something, to get somewhere, to get out of somewhere, to become someone. Brandon Sanderson blah blah journey before destination. It really is about the journey. Game of Thrones wouldn't be great if Daenerys had sat on the Iron Throne in Season 2. But we saw her struggle and grow and that's why I care what happens.

This post is meant a bit tongue-in-cheek of course, but the point stands.

** I don't think people like realistic characters, but rather characters who are extraordinary, yet believable.

Canon Harry is a believable character, but still he possesses an almost superhuman resiliance. Not only does he cope extremely well with the abuse he suffered at the Dursleys, but he also manages to grow up a normal teenager despite facing at least one murder attempt every year. A more realistic approach would have led to a darker and angstier story, which wouldn't be the magical tale we know and love. Nonetheless, he is still believable. While most people wouldn't be able to cope with these experiences as well as he does, it's very probable that people exist who can.

** That's a broad question. Certainly some people like realistic characters, others... probably not. Plus, not everyone will agree on what makes a realistic character or who should be considered one. I find some people tend to struggle with enjoying characters who act what they consider to be irrational despite how very human that can be. In addition to those factors, there always tends to be some backlash on male characters who act too emotionally. Which may help explain some of the responses to OoTP Harry.

Personally, I find it depends on the story/genre. Sometimes fantastical, larger than life characters are part of the appeal. I certainly don't watch Star Wars, for example, for down to earth and realistic depictions of the human condition. That being said, I'm good either way, though I do tend to be drawn to characters who are both consistent and flawed.

I'm the first to admit that my story "No Longer Alone" has a rather "slice of life" tone. It focuses on characters and their interactions, not Harry on some grand quest for fame, fortune and knickers. The fic is mostly about friendship and family. And I get a lot of positive feedback on it. But also some people simply don't like that kind of narrative because they prefer more action-focused stories.

** People want /more/ realistic characters, not /perfectly/ realistic characters. This distinction is important, because in the situations that fantasy finds the characters in, the most realistic characters would fail, would cower, would flee in terror. In fantasy like this, the protagonist needs to be able to go beyond the bounds of normality. A Mary Sue then becomes a problem because they succeed at everything that matters, and there is no real conflict to be interesting. They are popular because the are self-inserts without the name, and badly written ones at that, allowing the reader and the writer to feel the experience of winning without having done much at all.

Even if Harry Potter isn't 'traditional' fantasy it still falls squarely in the realm of escapism, so by virtue of that alone I think readers do not first and foremost desire "realistic" characters and interactions.

The portrayal of Harry in OotP is only realistic if you already accept many concessions without further consideration (why isn't he traumatized, instead of just grumpy? PTSD? a lot of obvious framing of him as the 'hero' type, no matter his frustrations, etc). So I wouldn't agree with your analysis that this is done by JKR for realism and instead more for dramatic tension: I think OotP does a good job of straddling that line between making Harry human and still have him be the ceaseless hero, but I think in a "serious" novel a lot of this stuff wouldn't be as easily accepted.

Now in regards to Gary Stus I think people who write those stories are either very young or reject basic dramatic structure and are just looking for wish fulfillment. I don't see the problem so much in the character being "unrealistic", but instead in the lack of tension, the lack of any kind of heroes journey and the almost complete dismissal of (internal) conflict - at best all threats are external. Not that a "comically" perfect character isn't a huge problem for suspension of disbelief as well, it just opens a whole other can of worms in addition to that problem.

I don't really understand what you mean to say. Harry is obviously traumatized about Cedric's death to the point where he even has nightmares about it. Also, tbh a lot of 15 years olds are just as frustrated as Harry without even having the same excuses he had. It's common for that age.

****** Maybe... but I feel that's giving the work too much credit. I simply cannot see any ambition of JKR to write some kind of psychological thriller like that anywhere, particularly not in how blasé she ended the series in regards to Harry's character. She just keeps unloading on the guy for the sake of plot and dramatic tension, without ever really paying tribute to those actions. Harry just keeps marching on (because he's so awesome).

Edit: just to be clear.. I can see where you're coming from and I might agree with you if OotP were the last book of the series. The wasted potential of that book with the (IMHO) broken promise of Harry coming into his own is one of my bigger problems with how the series continued.

** I like Mary Sues if they are done right - if they have a few flaws etc to make them comparatively believable. Like a fic with powerful! Harry who has to study and practise a lot to be badass, and who has flaws in his character like rashness or manipulativeness.

Percy Jackson is the best example of that kind of character.He is unrealistic when it comes down to it but he has flaws and, despite his power, is not the smartest character.

Tl; a character being OP'd or a Mary Sue is fun if they come by it slowly, or have a few flaws. The occasional fight lost, the occasional weakness, that sort of thing. Likewise a villainous Mary Sue is huge fun to read. Thanos is proof of that.

** My issue with OoTP is the exact opposite. Harry went thru a lot of shit that year and on GoF, and still he can't torture the woman who just killed the only "family" he had? The same woman who disabled his friend's parents? The same woman who loves his mortal enemy even more than Harry hates him? Come on! That's just bullshit. There's no way a person couldn't\\
That and his talk with Lupin in DH after Moody's death about using stronger spells on Death Eaters are true back breakers for me. I know it's because the book was initially made for children, and I'm not saying I don't love 'em. But the character development overall could've been better.

Harry might well have plenty of anger, but apparently that isn't the right mindset, and he /isn't/ sadistic. He doesn't get a thrill from causing pain for its own sake. He doesn't consider it an art form. He gets mad, definitely, he feels hatred, but that apparently goes no further than knocking the target off their feet. Proper torture requires something more twisted and cruel than just a desire for revenge.

Actually, it's ironic that he never casts the killing curse in canon. He could probably manage /that/ just fine.

The most flak I've gotten over it was that Harry needed Tonks to bail hin out of a spot of trouble instead of some "mission impossible" style of escape, even though he literally had a wand to his back. I mean, outside of against Voldemort, an Auror who was taught by Mad-Eye is bound to be the better fighter than a teenager without any form of formal education.

Just because Harry is the Chosen One, that does not mean he'd suddenly be Barney Stinson and seduce every girl in sight. But at the same time, a "realistic" Harry would not object if a girl pulled a "naked man" (as long as he finds her reasonably attractive).

There is a difference between "realistic" characters, and characters that have depth. I think people get that confused, personally I find "realistic" characters to be boring most of the time...but adding depth to the character can bring it to life in a better/different way than making them a god does.

I like to do character sheets..and give my characters flaws...and then write myself a backstory for why they have those flaws. That then influences every sentence they speak and every decision they make. They come alive in my head and I almost don't "write" the story anymore so much as write down what the characters are doing in my head.

** When I started out I preferd Mary Sues but after some time I wanted more realistic ones that have flawes and all not just flat parodies

** My opinion on realism, be it in stories, videos, movies, etc., is that realism is only as useful as it is enjoyable. It would be realistic to know what harry eats for breakfast every day and what all his homework assignments are and to follow him through all the days where Nothing Much Happens, but that's boring.

Of course, there are plenty of times where realism ads to the enjoyment, but it's not inherently a good thing.

In the case of Cedric's death for example, it would be realistic for Harry to be so traumatised he just breaks down and can't be The Chosen One™, but that makes the story less interesting.

I think the main reason people dislike moody Harry in book 5 and 6 is that it's boring. People don't like moody people in real life, so in that sense it's realistic that they don't like them in fiction either.

  That... and things like Albus Severus. It's not a realistic reaction.
#+end_quote

this is a good example of people using 'it's not realistic' to mean 'i wouldn't react that way' or 'i don't like it'. harry respects and loves dumbledore, and saw himself in snape even before he found out snape was opposing voldemort. it's entirely possible and realistic for harry to respect and honour these men
