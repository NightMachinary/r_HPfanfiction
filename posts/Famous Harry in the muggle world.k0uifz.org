Exactly as it says in the title, people.I read a good one awhile ago it was WGWL and she was famous before Hogwarts for iceskating,I can't remember what is called but I remember it was really good. Loads of muggle borns already knew who she was but anyway I would really like a famous Harry in the muggle world.

  Karma is real. It's a lesson that many have to learn the hard way. James and Lily Potter made the biggest mistake of their lives. The daughter they abandoned was more than they thought, and she becomes everything they wanted her twin to be. Belladonna Potter has her own plans for her future and no one will stand in her way. Hard work forever pays. A/N:fem!Harry, Wrong-GWL, Tomarry.

  The Dursley family, who valued normalcy above all else, would of course never dream of keeping their orphan nephew in a cupboard, or of making a spectacle of him. That isn't to say they wanted to spend all of their time and money on him, however. From the salvage of broken toys and unwanted junk, left alone to his own devices, Harry built dreams.
