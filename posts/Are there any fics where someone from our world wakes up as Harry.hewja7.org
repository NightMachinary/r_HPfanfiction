** Linkffn(Ghost of Privet Drive) comes pretty close, with an SI being brought to young Harry as a ghost, but he doesn't take Harry's place. Still an excellent story, though.

  "Fix it" said the Fates. "Fix what? With what tools and skills?" I asked. Being dead was only the first of the obstacles. And then I found myself in an understairs cupboard listening to a little boy quietly sobbing. Oh. Fix THAT. In which a sarcastic old git is dropped into the awful childhood of Harry Potter. SI, no ships. Rated M for foul language and canon-level abuse.

*** Closer still would be linkffn(Harry Potter, Self-Insert by 15RedStones) which is exactly what OP was asking for.

  I am a 18 year old fanfiction writer, schoolkid and computer nerd. I also just woke up in the body of 8 year old Harry Potter. How did I get here? No idea. What am I going to do? Priority one, survive. Priority two, drag this world into the 21st century.

**** If the SI were to be Harry it would still be considered an SI. But yeah I'm not aware of any that fit this description. SIs aren't super popular in this fandom (at least compared to say Naruto) so there aren't a ton of well known ones in general. I've seen Draco ones, but I don't think I've seen a Harry one, or even a Ron or Hermione one.

**** Right, I was not exact: one subcategory of SI stories. They are usually just the same as time-travel stories in structure. They think with knowledge of future they can fix everything, but usually situation turns more complicated. I don't care much about them, so I don't remember if I have ever read this type. The only SI story (not of this type) which seemed readable is linkffn(13041698), but that's self-inserted-into-newly-created-character story.

*** I mean, not really. There are self-insert fics where people are just an extra character and are dating a canon character.

  AN OC in the Harry Potter world. My OC dies in his world and wakes up in a new one with magic in the body of Harry Potter. How will he cope with having magic, being Harry Potter and how will he change the fate of the Harry Potter world?
