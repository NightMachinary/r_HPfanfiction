Draco Malfoy was thinking about Harry Potter again. Harry was an optimistic Sarcastic with tall legs and short arms.

Draco walked over to the window and reflected on his Mysterious surroundings. He had always loved Magical Hogwarts with its cheerful, cautious Castle walls. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel delighted.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather some/one/. It was the an optimistic figure of Harry Potter.

Draco gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was an energetic, patient, butter beer drinker with skinny legs and muscular arms. His friends saw him as a plastic, pongy patient. Once, he had even helped a tan owl cross the road.

But not even an energetic person who had once helped a tan owl cross the road, was prepared for what Harry had in store today.

The rain hammered like bouncing toads, making Draco Confident. Draco grabbed a solid blade that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers.

As Draco stepped outside and Harry came closer, he could see the united smile on his face.

Harry gazed with the affection of 4721 snooty outrageous owls. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want Relationship."

Draco looked back, even more Confident and still fingering the solid blade. "Harry, I have always loved you," he replied.

They looked at each other with shocked feelings, like two kooky, knowing kittens running at a very virtuous Easter, which had piano music playing in the background and two witty uncles cooking to the beat.

Draco regarded Harry's tall legs and short arms. "I feel the same way!" revealed Draco with a delighted grin.

Harry looked Happy, his emotions blushing like a new, narrow newspaper.

Then Harry came inside for a nice drink of butter beer.

THE END

Draco Malfoy was thinking about Harry Potter again. Harry was an optimistic Sarcastic with tall legs and short arms.
