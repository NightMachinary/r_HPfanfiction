I wonder if I can I just edit it and make a Note or replace the chapter with the updated one? Or rather live with it and write around it? It's nothing too major, and it's been bothering me so much that I overthink it instead of going to sleep. I'm not all that confident in writing so I'm not sure what to do with it. It's in the latest chapter, so it wouldn't change much, I also don't have too many readers, but I'm afraid it upsets people. How would you handle that?


** Professional authors often will have several revision passes for the entire story before publishing. I've heard of authors rearranging chapters, splitting the actions from one character into two, removing characters entirely (killing off your darlings), editing every line of dialogue, and much, much more.

If they, who have possibly spent more time writing than you've spent being alive, have to revise their stuff, what makes you think you're exempt? Writing makes a story. Editing and revision make a story good.

*** But professional authors don't publish I and then add something that's not spelling or super minor things, I believe. I see your point though! Thank you! :3

** probably depends on your writing goals. if it's supposed to be fun I'd change it. if you're trying to put in the hours of learning by doing, maybe this is a challenge.

‚Äã

you're writing for free (I assume) and if people don't like the fact that you changed something, they can read somethign different. at most I would keep a record of the thing that was changed in an AN or in my profile or in a separate story.

‚Äã

but then, I've never written a story, soo... make up your own mind ;-)

*** I am writing for free, so I guess you're right. :) a challenge would be nice but then again I've never written before so this whole thing is a pretty big challenge on its own :D so I guess I'll just switch it up :3 thanks so much for the input :3

** Is your only contention with it that it might upset people?

If so, ignore it and move on. Never let the demon of 'what people might think' invade your thoughts, or you'll end up quitting writing. Everything is offensive to someone. Write the story as you feel it should go, not what people might not get upset about.

*** It is though. I'm actually really afraid that people get what I write :D but I can see that's that pretty counterproductive. I will do my best to ignore it and stay positive :3 thank you!

** You should primarily be happy with your own writing. If you feel you made a mistake that changes the story in a way you can't be happy with than change it. Maybe people will like the story more with the change. I'd inform the readers with an AN at the start of the next chapter if you decide to change it.

So much this! Also be very up front to your readers about why you are changing what. They probably don't want to re-read an entire chapter so it's always good to give a short summary of the change and why you changed your mind.

** As [[/u/B_ucko][u/B_ucko]] said if it's primarily to learn you could treat it as a challenge and roll with it.\\
Though for myself I'd correct it if possible and update the chapter, then leave an Author's Note at the top of the next chapter for those that have already read it.

** You can always do what I do and go back and change it and not mention it. If my readers are confused ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è oh well üòÇ. But seriously, it's your story, and you really don't owe anyone anything. Go back and change it so that you love it, and if you feel it has really made a huge difference to the next chapter and/or the rest of the story, start with an author's note at the top and address the issue. Good luck!

** Guys thank you so so much for all your lovely input! It motivated me a lot to actually change it up and just go with what i think is more fitting and think a little less about what people are thinking and do more what I feel like :3 also All the tips were very helpful. You are wonderful ‚ù§Ô∏è
