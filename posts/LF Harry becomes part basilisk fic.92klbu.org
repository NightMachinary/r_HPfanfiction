What the title says. The summer after CoS, Harry slowly starts transforming into a part basilisk, runs away from Dursleys and ends up in Knockturn Alley (? Or did the author make up another alley? idk) in a hostel living with other creatures - vampires, werewolves, hags and I think sirens were there too? Does anyone recognise it?


** Hmm...I remember it, but from a googling...I think it's Serpens Armarum by Evandar. [[http://www.fictionhunt.com/read/4385420/1]]

It's definitely got a basilisk-Harry, and a hostel for creatures appears in chapter 6 or so.
