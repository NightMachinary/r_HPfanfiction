Hi friends. Looking for fics where Harry is labeled a dark lord. Even if it's just because he has “greater good” traits where he's fixing the perceived wrongs of the world.

Hope y'all are having a great day :)

  Death isn't good for the soul and dead things can't die twice.Harry dies too many times to be fine. After the war he goes travelling; he and Tom Riddle always were too much alike for their own good.

Post war story, the wizarding world went right back to its corrupted bigoted ways after the war, and now their cruelty threatens his Godson. Harry's had enough and takes matters into his own hands.

*** Hello! *waves awkwardly* I just finished this fic yesterday, but I saw your reply here and just wanted to ask if you can rec any other Dark Lord Harry fics like this one? I'm not really a big HP fan and I don't really ship anyone, but this is the first dark Harry, postwar fic I've ever read and it is /gorgeous,/ so I've been looking through this entire subreddit looking for more recs.

Any suggestions you might have would really be appreciated. Thank you.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4343191/1/Warrior-s-Heir][Warrior's Heir]] is an AU fic in which Harry is transported to an alternate universe that has a Dark Lord Harry Potter and a boy-who-lived Tom Riddle. It's an interesting look at how even Harry's good intentions could slide towards extremism if he didn't have a strong moral compass to guide him. Unfortunately it's a dead fic, but the part that exists is excellent. linkffn(4343191)

  DEAD. Harry is thrown into a world where purebloods are condemned, Tom Riddle is the Boy Who Lived, and the Dark Lord is someone he'd never suspect. Will his emerging abilities be enough? Should he support Riddle - or the Dark Lord? No slash.
