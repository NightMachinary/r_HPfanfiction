I enjoyed the pairing and am looking for something fun to read next.


** I wrote an ultra fluffy H/Luna oneshot recently for the Harry/Luna discord.

I also have an ongoing H/Luna fic, but it's fairly dark and nothing like Luna's Hubby (by that, I mean the entire plot isn't resolved in the first chapter by an adult haha).

  Rewrite. Based on a comic by the great MoringMark. Takes place after AToTS. Filbrick Pines decides to call his alive son moments away from dying. Unfortunately, a certain sweater-wearing twelve-year-old hears their conversation. Stan and Mabel fluff. Please read and review.
