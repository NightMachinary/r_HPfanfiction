Instead of reading the actual HP books. I would love a cracky one shot of Harry reading and reacting to the children stories that have him as a main character. Possibly when one of his kids request a bed time story and he accidently grabs one of Ginny's old copies


** I know FloreatCastellum has written something like, but I don't know the title. You can check her stories on AO3. I think they're cleaning the attic at the Burrow and Harry comes across a box with the books inside. Ginny, Molly, Ron and Hermione are there, but not the kids.

** Not the focus, but the first chapter of Linkffn(The Truth Behind A Story) has a scene like this. Post Harmony fic where the Canon books have been published as the truth by Rita and Harry is a reporter.

  A quick step into the regular life of Harry and his family. A mostly sweet and fluffy story. AU. Please let me know what you think! LAST CHAPTER is UP!
