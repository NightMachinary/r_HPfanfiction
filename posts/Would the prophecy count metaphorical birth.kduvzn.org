Like if Ron had a life-changing revelation in late July would that count as born as the seventh month dies.


** Traditionally, prophecies are often depicted as being rather vague or fulfilling themselves in unintuitive ways that only make sense in hindsight. A metaphorical birth is exactly the sort of unexpected twist that I would expect a prophecy to have. Though the revelation would have to be sufficiently life-altering to qualify as a rebirth, and would probably need to involve taking a new name or something like that.

However, the prophecies in Harry Potter are more straightforward than most. The first one is certainly ambiguous enough that it could be fulfilled in an unexpected way, but it ended up meaning exactly what everyone thought it meant. Trelawney's second prophecy was even more straightforward, and basically said exactly what was about to happen.

But I don't think anyone will complain much about using an established fantasy trope instead of following Rowling's lead. I know I've seen plenty of fics that have used creative interpretations of that prophecy before.

Was it, though? Or was it fulfilled by some minor character in the background while everything /thought/ Harry fulfilled it, hmm? :P

*** please when the seventh month dies...

which calender did the magic use? the Chinese New Year for example is at a different date. Or why not born in September, which literally is named the seventh month

** One twist I haven't seen yet is that the prophecy was /heard/, not /read/, and "born" (i.e., "given birth to") is a homophone of "borne" (i.e., "carried"). So, the prophecy was actually about someone being /transported/ to some people who thrice-defied Voldemort at the end of July.

** Possibly? I think it'd need to be something that was "a new start" or even "like a phoenix from the ashes, Ron rose from the tragedy". Ron himself would have to change in some important way.

Or like TheLetterJ0 said, a new name or something. A new identity he takes on.

** Absolutely. The twistier the prophesy, the better. One of my favorite fics had Harry stillborn after Lily was hit by a Death Eater curse. Later that night, Kal-El was borne to the Potters instead of the Kents. The Last Mage of Krypton linkffn(12191520)

** I think it'd depend on whether people would know or care about it. Like if he tells everyone that he felt born again, then maybe.

I personally am more of an atheist when it comes to the question of whether there's a sentient "magic itself" or "fate" being behind things like that. I prefer the explanation that prophecies are retroactively caused by wizards caring a lot about significant information, and similar to accidental magic that causes the information in question itself to be slightly magical which allows seers in the past to sense it.

Since the time travel of information gets initiated after the event, seers can't control when they can receive a prophecy, while active divination is initiated by the seer before the event and can be controlled. Also since the prophecy requires lots of people to care about the information, it's always something important, while divination can end up being about something completely benign.
