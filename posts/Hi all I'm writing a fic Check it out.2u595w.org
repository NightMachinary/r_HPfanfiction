So I've started writing a fic - and I would love for some more people to check it out, and comment on it. It's only 2k words for now, because as a college student, I don't have much time for this at all. It's the first story-like piece of literature I've written since middle school, so bear with me. It will, eventually, become very, very AU, when I find the time to continue it.

Comments and criticism are welcome. I'm looking for a beta. English is not my first language. Feel free to ask questions and whatnot.
