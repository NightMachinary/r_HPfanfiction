Not fics where his parents never died. I'm talking about "never grew up with parents" Harry meeting the rents. That angst. That gourmet shit.

The only thing I ask is no Harry/Voldemort or Harry/Snape fics. Otherwise, anything is fine.

** linkffn(11619134) has this. It's not the main premise, but the story is a great fun of a romp and that's part of it.

([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8678567]])

Harry travels to AU no Voldemort instead Tom Riddle is a healer also Harry's parents are there but not married to each other. There is no slash a little different from what you asked but it is really good ðŸ’œ

** /How Like Home/ linkao3(22810651) Harry winds up in an AU dimension where Voldemort never was. James and Lily never fought in any war and are very concerned when comparing Canon Harry to AU Harry (short, scrawny, flinches a lot, hexes when startled...), what kind of Hell dimension did he come from?!

#+begin_quote
  When Sirius falls through the veil, Harry chases after him, determined to find him on the other side. Instead, he finds nothing at all. When he wakes up, he is informed by Unspeakables that he is from an alternate universe. Thanks to his uncanny resemblance to his counterpart, Harry is readily recognized as a duplicate of Harry Potter, a normal fifteen year old boy, and is entrusted to the care of Lily and James Potter. From them, Harry discovers that Voldemort is not, and never was, a threat in this universe. Now, Harry must adapt to life with loving parents in a peaceful world.

*** This isnt really a good req. Its a lot of nothing. No talks between harry and really anyone. There little harry lily interaction. James isnt really around. No important talks or decisions are ever made. I read it just a bit ago and was like, well that pointless nothing happened and it felt empty and hollow.

**** Have we read the same story? Like, I was initially a bit wary after your comment, but I then managed to read the while fic in one go and I actually found it pretty good!

Harry does have moments with both of his parents and, while I'm not the biggest fan of abused!Harry stories, I found his reactions to everything relatively believable for someone in his position. I have at least one Harry&Lily and one Harry&James moment still in mind right now and the story still ongoing... I'm not quite sure where your rather harsh criticism came from to be honest.

** Harry and Ginny travel to the Marauder Era, pretty old but it's fine in terms of prose and tone. Pretty old though.
