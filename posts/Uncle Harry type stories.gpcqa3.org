Stories where he hangs out with his Godson Teddy, and his nieces and nephews. Can be Canon Compliant or AU.

Do not want it to be Cursed Child Compliant though.

Am fine with: Het/Slash/Femslash Threesomes/Bisexual/Asexual. (Doesn't have to focus on pairings).

No Weasley Bashing. No OP Harry. Harry smarter and more powerful then in canon is fine, but I'd like for it to be believable.

Can be on any site, can be any length, anyone can be the main character,

The plot itself can be anything, but would like family type of moments.

In the mood for something like: linkffn(12282305) but it doesn't have to be exactly like that.


** Not exactly, but almost:

- linkffn(Dudley's Memories by paganaidd;Snape's Memories by paganaidd)
- linkao3(Holly at Hogwarts: Now and Forever by Forest_of_Holly) and the rest of [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/62351][the series]] ... it is a way more complex than just that and Harry is not the most important characters in the story, but he works exactly as the mentor to the main heroine.
- linkao3(Grow Young with Me by Taliesin19) ... again, not primarily about the uncleship, but he is there very much a parent.

  Minerva needs help delivering another letter to #4 Privet Drive. At forty, Dudley is not at all what Harry expects. A long overdue conversation ensues. DH cannon compliant, but probably not the way you think. Prologue to "Snape's Memories".

  Sort of a sequel and a companion piece to Dudley's Memories. Harry is finding a healthy outlet for his "saving people thing" in the form of one damaged little boy. In doing so he finds himself thinking about his old teacher, quite a bit.

  "While the children were all very close with their aunts and uncles, close-knit as they all were with each other, there was no mistaking the obvious special liking they all had for Uncle Harry. Not to mention the liking he had for them."

** If you'd enjoy a oneshot, [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/18769666][Biografy]] is super cute.

** Harry spends a lot of time with Teddy in linkao3(Somebody to Love by khasael) but the focus is more on Drarry and Draco trying to have a familial relationship with Teddy. He has some sweet moments with Teddy in linkao3(Howlr) too but again, more about Drarry and Harry's friendships.

Edit: that's weird. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4230765][Somebody to Love]] was up just a week or ago so - I read it around then - but it looks like it's hidden right now because it's part of an ongoing challenge.

  Howlr is the new dating application enchanting Witches, Wizards and Everyone in between. Are you looking for the one or a one-night stand; it's all here folks. Howlr is sponsored by Weasley Wizard Wheezes, the same team that brought us the Spellular just two years ago. Ginny Weasley, famed chaser for the Hollyhead Harpies, swears by the app, â€˜guaranteed to make sparks fly,' she says. The magic awaits you!
