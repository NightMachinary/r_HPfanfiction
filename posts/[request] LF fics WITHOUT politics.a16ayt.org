I'm looking for fics that happen at Hogwarts, feature HP as the protagonist and have him facing Voldemort. OC's are fine, full on crossovers are less fine. Easy so far.

Here is where things get interesting, I want fics where politics do not come up. No lords, no ancient houses, no ministry of magic, no daily prophet. Or rather, these things can exist provided they are background;

not sources of conflict, not consuming word count and largely glossed over when they are mentioned.

Suggestions please!

  As per the Hat's decision, Harry gets Sorted into Slytherin upon his arrival in Hogwarts---and suddenly, the future isn't what it used to be.

*** I read it to somewhere in year 5 before stopping. Maybe time to give it another go.

** I just reread Harry the Hufflepuff linkffn(12863701).

It qualifies but updates very slowly.

  Not going to school would have been way too much effort, and besides, Harry had promised that since last year was a bit boring, he was going to not try to avoid everything this year..
