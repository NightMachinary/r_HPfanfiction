Hello all, I have recently been reading [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8830247/1/Shade-Blood-Ties][this]] and have found myself cheering on Legion. Who is the villain of the story in a sense. Do you all have any stories where you cheer for a villainous victory? Why?


** I think plenty of people love ruthless, smart, villainous protagonists, which explains the popularity of 'Breaking Bad' and 'House of Cards'.

Hermione is highly popular partly because of her dark side, and Harry was no saint either. The fandom further harbors great love for villains such as Draco and Snape, even Voldemort and Bellatrix have a significant following.

My top favorite fanfic is *Seventh Horcrux*, linkffn(10677106), which basically features a villain, who is a mixture of Harry Potter and Voldemort, as the main character. Many on this subreddit love that fic, too.

  The presence of a foreign soul may have unexpected side effects on a growing child. I am Lord Volde...Harry Potter. I'm Harry Potter. In which Harry is insane, Hermione is a Dark Lady-in-training, Ginny is a minion, and Ron is confused.

**** She's ruthless when someone crosses her- see: Marietta Edgecombe and all the stuff she did to Ron when he kept being an ass to her. Also she impersonated Malfoy's minions as Plan A in second year so she's willing to go way into illegal activity if it's for something she's convinced is right. Convince Hermione that something is just and nothing will stop her from pursuing that justice.

**** I'm assuming Hermione's dark side would be referring to her blackmailing Rita Skeeter and the contract that mutilated Marietta Edgecombe's face. I'm pretty sure that was permanent, too, as I recall a reference of Marietta attempting to hide her face with makeup later on, so not something easily reversible, at least.

Personally, I like Hermione more because she's a brilliant witch, though, as well as how she stood up to Bellatrix Lestrange's torture. Of course, her dark side is pretty awesome, too.

** No matter what story I read, I cheer on Voldemort. I just can't deal with him being an idiot or Harry overpowering him. If Harry suddenly wins with Voldemort in a duel I just nope the ef out of there.

** linkffn(6256154)

It can be argued that Harry is the villain of this story - he is ruthless, he doesn't hesitate, he doesn't take prisoners.

  Broken and defeated, the War long since lost, Harry enacts his final desperate gambit: Travel back in time to the day of the Third Task, destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and prevent the Dark Lord's resurrection...all within the space of twelve hours.
