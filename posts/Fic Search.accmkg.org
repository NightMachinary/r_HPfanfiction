Harry Potter time travel. Harry is dropped of at the Dursleys'. Uses metamorphmagus abilities to make himself older. Apparates to goblins. Later in fic Harry Lives alone he dances, is androgynous ie. Wears womens clothes, looks femine, wears makeup. He is a dancer and has degrees or PhDs. Sirius, Remus, Dumbledore and some others come looking for Harry so he can be admitted for his first year of hogwarts. Dumbledore keeps trying to get harry to move in with his relatives despite never living there and him repeatedly telling dumbledore he's emancipated. Harry goes to hogwarts. Is sorted into slytherin. Finds a secret parseltongue guarded room. I can't remember anything else. There may be minor errors in my description I read the fic ages ago. Thanks to anyone that helps. - Matthew.
