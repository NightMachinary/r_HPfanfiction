So, I'm trying to flesh out a foundation for a Magical America in a fic I'm working on - but as I'm not American, I'm struggling to work out what directions to take it in. I'm not expecting y'all to flesh out a world for me, but I was hoping to get a little input from actual Americans here.

*Step one*, do Americans consider the *Magical America that Rowling came up with appropriate or realistic*? Is that how you think Magical America would actually have turned out? If yes, I take what she wrote and fill in the gaps for anything it doesn't provide that I need. If not, I have to make something up myself.

*Step two*, if Rowling's America isn't the way it would be, how would it be? Would *'Magical America' have unified like Muggle America*, or would it *remain like the Colonies*, a bunch of separate outposts of European and Native occupants with *no unified governing body*?

*Step three*, how strong would *cultural unification* be, whether it was actually a single country or not? Would the *Magical Cultures of the Colonists* have melded together, would the *Native Cultures* be suppressed or would they also *meld together*? Or would they *remain broadly separate* with only a little mixing? Would Magicals have human *slavery like the Muggles*, or just *House-Elves*?

*Step four*, the magic itself. How would *magical practices have changed* due to the meeting of *Native and Colonist*? Would they? Or would *Natives* use *whatever they use* and *Colonists* keep with the *wands*? What would you expect *Native American magic to be like*?

*And finally, a request.* Do you have any *fics set in Magical America* that you think *accurately portray what it would be like*? Or fics that have *specific elements of worldbuilding* that you'd like to see continued elsewhere, if the fic's setting as a whole isn't fully accurate?

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

** 1. I hate the term no-maj. I like the idea of Scourers(?), but I feel, and correct me if it's there, the religion element is missing from the narrative. A large group of American wizards, I feel, should be prime for a Voldemort or Grindelwald like wizard to radicalize them. Overall I'm fine with it.

2. Unified

3. I think some would have taken advantage of slavery

4. I think the magic of natives, colonists, and Africans would have melded together, but some parts would remain separate. I do like the idea of Natives (and Africans) being great healers and fantastic at wandless magic.

Is it just a clunky term or does it feel not-American? Is there a term you'd prefer, or a particular criterion you'd see as making a term like that feel right?

**** No-maj just feels like an unnecessary attempt to make us different. I appreciate the effort because we do use different words to describe the same thing, however, I don't think it's something we'd go with. Maybe it could be a legal classification while citizens stubbornly cling to 'muggle.'

#+begin_quote
  Why do you think that?
#+end_quote

Witch trials, Scourers, and simply being the minority would make them come together in a government sense. It's entirely possible, especially with my slavery belief, they would be culturally segregated.

Yes, and I think JKR does this with Natives preferring wandless magic.

Very fair point. Protection in unity and numbers and all. So, would you see that as singularly unified - like Magical America is one society with one government - or as more of a loose Colonies-esque coalition like other people in this thread have suggested?

** I would definitely expect to see a lot of variety in background and reason for immigration. The colonies first immigrants included a lot of religious radicals that wanted to practice their own version of Protestantism so I could see magicals coming wanting to have a different approach to magic.

I think because of the relative ease of travel you'd see much more mixing of magical culture even though certain areas would have greater influences from the areas their immigrants were originally from. Like a Scandinavian flavor in Minnesota, or Scots/Irish in Appalachia.

I would think that you wouldn't get as much of African magical culture through the slave trade because magical people in Africa would have probably been able to better avoid capture by non-magical slave traders. You would have muggle born enslaved people born in the US, so it'd be very interesting to see what would have happened with those people, would they have been left in slavery to find their own way or removed from the community of their birth and brought into the greater US magical community? I could see magical enslaved people being a huge part of the Underground Railroad.

I think there'd also be very strong influences from the native population and their intrinsic magic of the land. Would blood magic and sacrifice have a greater role because of Aztec practices?

Consider that scholars believe about 90% of the native population died as diseases like small pox spread through an immunologically naive population. Would the magical natives been immune due to magic or would they have suffered similar losses? The answer to this question in your universe would drive how much the magic of the America's would influence the US magical population.

Rowling's stuff about the US seems pretty inappropriate to me. The term for muggles sounds like a racial slur to me to be honest. You certainly can't just slap Native American names on the school houses on top of a European style school culture. I imagine native magical teaching would be more based on mentorship and apprenticeship, with way more varied specialties and strengths depending on the tribe and their culture.

Sorry about the novel, this is a very interesting concept, can't wait to see what you write!

*** First off, thank you for the novel! Feel free to keep talking, it's very interesting to read and the more info I get from actual Americans here, the more realistic and accurate my eventual portrayal will be. :)

Also, apologies for all the questions. Feel free to answer as few or as many as you wish. :)

#+begin_quote
  a different approach to magic
#+end_quote

Magical Radicals is an interesting approach - kind of makes the 'America is the land of magical technology miracles' trope from old 'Harry goes to America' fics seem more interesting, too. :)

I also kind of like the idea of a country founded by a bunch of Elizabethan-era Doc Brown types. :D

#+begin_quote
  ease of travel
#+end_quote

Travel being easy doesn't necessarily mean you'd actually make the trip. If Magical America was a bunch of xenophobic compounds of Magicals trying to be as isolated as possible, they would probably not make those trips, no? You think there would be that kind of interaction?

#+begin_quote
  see what would have happened with those people
#+end_quote

Do you have any opinion on what might've been more likely to have happened? Would there be that same Abolitionist movement in the Magical world as there was in the Muggle? I have ideas, but I'm coming at this from a British perspective, so I'd value the opinion of an actual American. :)

#+begin_quote
  Would blood magic and sacrifice have a greater role because of Aztec practices
#+end_quote

That is a solid point. I hadn't considered drawing things in from as far as Central America. I was thinking more natives like the Cree or Iroquois or Lakota. I suppose the Spanish may have pushed that with Cortez, huh?

#+begin_quote
  immune due to magic
#+end_quote

I'm of the magic overwrites mundane reality school of thought, so I'd definitely say the magical natives would've been immune to the Muggle diseases at least. Not the Magical Ones, most likely, but definitely the Muggle ones.

#+begin_quote
  The term for muggles
#+end_quote

No American likes the no-maj, huh? :D

Is there a term you think would fit more accurately? Or a criterion a term might need to meet to seem more authentically 'American'?

#+begin_quote
  certainly can't just slap Native American names
#+end_quote

Amen. Though I can see someone trying that to be inviting to those cultures and said cultures just taking one look and unanimously concluding "Hell no." :D

#+begin_quote
  native magical teaching would be more based on mentorship
#+end_quote

From my understanding, this is about right, though a bit less singular than the mentorship term implies. If they wanted to teach hunting, a team of hunters would take a group of boys out and would teach together. Wikipedia calls it 'Learning by Observation and Pitching In', which is a technical term I actually kinda like. :D

**** I'm happy to give my 2 cents! For context I'm a white female from the Midwest born in the mid eighties. I'm definitely no expert on Native American culture, some others in the thread had good ideas about how to get more info about that.

I love the idea of Elizabethan Doc Browns! American culture has a very strong bias towards the next big thing that pushes innovation. I would expect more wand cores, more different types of focus objects, staffs and awls, etc.

Regarding travel, people adventurous enough to leave everything behind and start over are frequently willing to do it again and again looking for the opportunity they were seeking (think Oregon trail, etc.). Life for colonists was often very difficult and groups of people couldn't afford to completely isolate themselves. They needed to be able to trade, a lot of them (maybe all?) needed help from native peoples before they could reliably plant and harvest crops. Ships arrived in the Americas with the wrong tools, the wrong seeds, the wrong skills. I just don't think that complete isolation is likely or feasible except for maybe a few outliers. You'd definitely get concentrations because people tend to clump around other people like them.

Depending on the time period I could definitely see the xenophobia being focused outwards towards non-magical people.

My guess is that US is that magicals would have house elves and magic which would be more efficient and cost effective than enslaving non-magical people so they'd view it as a muggle or mundane problem that didn't particularly effect them. This one is more subjective though, there are a lot of possibilities and paths this could take.

As for dominate native magic I think you could choose any of large successful societies of Central or North America. My understanding is that native populations had way more mobility than modern people imagine and with that comes trading, war, and intermarriage so there would be common threads of culture and magical practices throughout.

Considering Cortez, I could see the magicals from the first contact locations being able to get away and warn the others. Then the other locations could be hidden and protected before the Cortez and his troops reached them.

For terminology I like someone else's suggestion of “mundane” or “muggle” or “mugs” depending on how old the term “muggle” is. To me “no mag” doesn't follow the normal pattern of English language slang, it's awkward to make plural “no mages”?, and when plural it's too long. We tend to stick to 1 or 2 syllables if you think about slang terms for groups of people: “Dems,” “Tories,” “rednecks,” etc.

The Ilvermony houses remind me of a fad in maybe the 30/40/50s of “Indian” themed summer camps for children that were pretty ick looking back on them.

I think you probably have the right of it with learning by observation and pitching in (modern day on the job training lol). Then you are learning what's useful to your role in the community. Maybe something like guilds?

#+end_quote

A most excellent point. I'm definitely getting an image of a kind of Crystal Palace-era Magical Great Exhibition crossed with a Flea Market where people hawk all their fancy new experimental gear. Would you think that sort of experimentation would be legally regulated, or would they leave it at "don't reveal us to the Muggles and try not to die or kill people"? Either way, I can see a Nerdy Knockturn-Alley Grey-Market in experimental doodads popping up. :D

#+begin_quote
  I just don't think that complete isolation is likely or feasible except for maybe a few outliers.
#+end_quote

A very fair point. Maybe not for the Muggle Stuff (though some might resort to trading with Muggles to get resources or techniques they don't know how to do with magic - that innovation aspect of America, yes?), but I can definitely see the new immigrants having to trade in Magical Specialisms and Resources such. "Our potioneer can't make Potion X, so we'll trade you a gallon of that for this kilo of Dragon Scales" etc. Plus, America does love its entrepreneurs, right? I can't remember when that 'Haves and Soon-to-Haves' nonsense started exactly, but I'm pretty sure it was fairly early on. Maybe a few travelling Sales-people out to make their fortunes, perhaps? :)

#+begin_quote
  the wrong tools, the wrong seeds, the wrong skills.
#+end_quote

Very good point. I hadn't considered that the Magicals might fall into that same 'diving into the unknown without the right equipment' pitfall that the Muggle Colonists did. That's a very interesting foundational factor to play around with, their lacks and the ways they might bend to meet them.

Yeah. There have been a lot of different tones and responses taken to that by Americans here, so I'm expecting that'll either be determined by my next-steps research or left to my discretion.

#+begin_quote
  Considering Cortez,
#+end_quote

That could be fun. I like the idea of little pockets of highly survivalistic Aztecs hiding out from the conquistadors. Kind of fits their tradition and founding myths. :)

Those guidelines make sense. Convenience and Cadence. I'll keep that in mind, thanks!

I just googled that and... yeah, ew. Very Peter Pan-movie Native American tones to that.

#+begin_quote

#+end_quote

Yeah, that could work. A little more emphasis on training than regulation and standardisation, that could definitely provide a nice balance between the two traditions.

** quickly jotting things down, I'll try to edit this later

as always in hp stories there are two main approaches to depicting society; a satirization of the modern day with bits of folklore and a historical reconstruction more akin to alternate history. the first is what Rowling does, so that's what I'll start with.

in order to write satire, you first have to decide what aspects of society you want to focus on (this is your main question). different people will have different opinions on what's most important/appropriate, but I think there are a few things which stick out when we look at canon. JKR focuses mainly on nobility politics (doubling as a racism allegory), consumerism, and bureaucracy; as an american the first things that jump out to me are commodity worship, political theatre, and stubborn independence. there are lots of ways to then handle these ideas but one possibility could be to equate wealth with magical power and have political leaders selected via a wrestling-style cage match, with the audience voting on the winner. or there are less absurd options, lol.

in order to answer your question about how unified I think america would be, my answer is ‘not at all.'

for the alternate history perspective, as usual it would take research. america's current culture is far younger than most of europe's, so imo you would need to look at the influences separately. i.e. what did the americas look like before colonization -> what did europe look like when it was colonizing america -> how did the colonization merge or change the existing cultures. I'm not at all well-studied on first nations culture so don't know that I can say the best way to portray it but I think the best thing to keep in mind is the enormous amount of variety. america wasn't one unified nation before colonization, it was countless relatively small cultures which had been mingling for centuries. for specific ideas I usually read folk tales from the culture I'm studying.

if I had to pick a single approach for this sort of portrayal, I would prob make the country a bunch of distinct communities with only a loose overarching structure. this sort of gestures towards both the nature of tribes and states and provides a lot of options to expand on. if we keep population levels approximate to Rowling's, that could mean something like a few hundred towns ranging from a few dozen people to a few thousand people, scattered around the country.

kind of running out of steam here, but as a final note I generally find the ‘other culture knows wandless magic' thing kind of boring. obviously there's a reason wands exist, so if you want another culture to not use them it makes more sense to focus on what they /do/ use than what they don't.

** Dude, if you haven't read the Alexandra Quick series, by inverarity, you're missing out!

It's a nearly completely original story that takes place in the midwest starting in 2007, IRC. It's got native american magic, Appalachian magic, conflicts between chinese and Japanese magical cultures in america, and so much more.

It treats america as a real magical melting pot, and focuses a lot on all the smaller magical communities that exist in the world outside of Britain and a little bit of greater Europe.

It is not based on JKRs magical america, because frankly, her version of magical america is not very good.

Even more specifically, things like the hippy communities of California, the coastal communities of the Outer Banks of North Carolina, but the best is the small-town mundane descriptions of living close to a highway.

** I think blood purity would be a non issue but... Race still would. If the Americans overthrew the British wizards like their mundane counterparts, they probably wouldn't have house elves since mainly the rich have them. So I can see them having black slaves, probably magical . And building off the "Africa is good at wandless magic"... Well I could see them "breeding" slaves into kinda like house elves, except like fully human. Just really good at wandless magic but subservient.

*** That would indeed be fucked. But I'm trying to take this along lines actual Americans think would fit. Even the most utopian fantasies have their fridge-horror underbellies and Eugenics would certainly class as a horrifying underbelly.

When you say no house elves because the Rich had them, was there a particular cultural push against acting like Rich British People or do you just mean that the Americans wouldn't have the resources that the Rich People did?

**** First, I wouldn't imagine it as full on eugenics, more how they raised them. I.e raise them to be slaves. And I could see America back then doing it, America used to be kinda fucked up. But it could still be something the former slaves could come back from. Like they are still human and if they are broken out of the slave mentality they could become functioning members of society.

To the second thing. A little bit of both. They wouldn't have the resources and it would be associated with the rich.

** The two biggest problems with what J.K. Rowling's written about magical America are firstly, how she handled Native Americans; and secondly, her utter failure to say anything about slavery and the Civil War. As for the Scourers, you really have to ask yourself, what the hell was going on in the North American magical community prior to the Statute of Secrecy that had something like a third of the community willing to sell out the rest of them?

With slavery, I don't really see American magicals as slave-owners; anything a human slave can do, a house-elf can probably do better. On the other hand, before the Statute and Rappaport's Law I can totally see them as slave-/traders/, because a wizard who knows Aguamenti and can cast Expansion Charms can transport more slaves across the Middle Passage and deliver them alive on the docks of Kingston or Havana than a Muggle could. And God knows the demand for slaves on Caribbean plantations dwarfed that in the Thirteen Colonies; the average working life-span of a newly-arrived slave on a sugar plantation was around seven years before they died or were mutilated in a horrible fashion (snakes, machetes, grindstones, boiling cane syrup...)

In MACUSA proper, I suspect the authorities would have had to monitor the southern plantations for slave-born magicals, because leaving a magical child in slavery sure as hell sounds like an easy way to make an Obscurial.

With Native Americans, I can easily see a lot of tribal magicals trying to resist compliance with Rappaport's Law and the MACUSA authorities coming down on them like a ton of bricks. If the removal of those Native American witches and wizards makes it easier for their non-magical relatives to be driven off their lands, that would have been no skin off MACUSA's nose.

** Really the only bit I know about Rowlings America is the term no-maj and its terrible. It sounds like a racist term one little group came up with that a foreigner overheard and assumed was what we all called muggles.

Realistically there would be about 7 or 8 different terms in use depending on the area of the country (like with soda, pop, coke, etc)

For fic purposes though if I wrote in America I'd use wizard and mundane

**** Around my area it would probably be something Najavo related, but you're probably better off going with something like Magical/Mundane across the whole country.

If you want to really narrow it down, look into what cultures were in the area you're writing and see what their shaman/medicine man/etc were called.

Edit: But that also depends on if the American magic society is less diverse than mundane society. With floo and apparation the world is a little smaller, so it may not have developed the same differences that the real life states did.

***** So, maybe a general term like Magical/Mundane with specific regional differences dotted around? eg. A big Muggleborn uprising in one area of the country might lead to Muggleborns being known by a nickname from the leader of the Rebellion. Like we in the UK used to call Police 'Peelers' after the guy who founded them.

Good idea on the cultural areas thing though. I have a copy of that native tribes map that made the rounds on Social Media a while back, plus one for the European interests in the Colonial days. I can find a lot of that off the back of those.

#+end_quote

That is also true. It really does seem to depend on how isolationist each magical bit would be. Would the French Magicals stick to French territories, and the British Magicals stick to British territories, the Dutch Magicals the Dutch territories, and so on? There seems to be some variation in opinions on that.

**** It's not that I find that particular aesthetic appealing, although the idea does interest me. It's just the way that I imagined a magical America to be. Like for example, there's some parts of America that are largely untouched, like the desert areas of America for example, either American wizards are hidden there or they live openly but don't actually do magic.

** I think that [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/4626147?view_full_work=true][Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach]] would be a good starting point. It does have Native American magic schools as well as a few regular magic schools. The Americans' equivalent of the Ministry is known as the Department of Magic, and the head is the Secretary of Magic.
