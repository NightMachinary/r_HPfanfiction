** Hermione turned to Ron and stared at him like a crazed conspiracy theorist.

"Don't you two know that the neo liberal feminist agenda is going to force us all to become queers?? It's in the ground water, they're turning the freaking /frogs/ gay! It's all over, we should dissolve society and live out an existence of anarchic hedonism!"

Ron balked and looked at Harry.

"Harry, mate? I think it's time to yeet Hermione off the Astronomy tower."

So they did and lived a peaceful life thereafter.

** For context: blackpilled means to check out completely from the political process because you don't feel like you can change anything. Red pilled means you're a gullible, hypocritical dipshit.
