So I finally tried to read this the other day and gave myself a headache. I got to chapter 36 before calling it quits. Ignoring how the series was trying a failing its attempt to make magic make sense (given maybe it accomplished it later), the characters drive me up the wall. My main issue isn't the fact that each character has like 10 different subplots going on with one another, but how the characters are all insane. I know people are complicated, but this series makes people out to be the most complicated wishy washy thing ever. The characters were not consistent with any of there actions/feelings for more then a couple of paragraphs before they changed tracks. If the inside of other peoples heads are like this then I am terrified. Draco, Harry, Hermione, etc. all kept changing their minds every other second. I felt like I was suffering from whiplash the whole time. Maybe I am being harsh... or just being an ass. However, I have heard some good things about this series and had high expectations for it. This is really just a rant now that I think about it. Anyway, just expressing my opinion. If you liked it, good for you! (not being sarcastic). Everyone has different tastes. This one just made me frustrated because I kept telling myself that it must get good next chapter and I was just being impatient. What did you all think of it?


** I've tried to read it as well and it really did turn me off after a while.

The first sign of issues with the fic was seeing Harry go into utter dramatics over something he had the mental capacity to handle a lot more rationally (ironic for a fic with a derivative of that word in the title), and McGonagall had to basically tell him to pull himself together. [ EDIT: On reading that spork of HPMOR someone linked, oh my god, I finally remembered which section this was and Harry's overdramatic weepy bullshit was so repellent I had to skim that section even as sporked. ]

The later dealbreaker was when the author admitted to not having read Deathly Hallows and so had a fundamental misunderstanding of the interactions between Severus Snape and Lily Evans as children - and how that played into Snape's own interactions with Harry years later.

The cherry on top of that sundae was when the author had Snape purposely pose a question to Harry in a way that was calculated to elicit validation rather than have an honest discussion, and when Harry gave the best answer he could give based on the information given and doesn't validate Snape's side of things, he drops the bombshell and is like "that kid was me".

That really just rubbed me the wrong way.

**** I'd actually forgotten one of the even more repellent things in the fanfic, which is that the author does /not/ have Harry making for the hills as soon as Draco Malfoy tells him he'll rape Luna Lovegood when he's old enough. I guess it was so incredibly jaw-droppingly bizarre in just so many ways I put it out of my mind lest I wonder if Less Wrong is actually sane.

("Shock value" is not a valid licence to put any old thing you want into a fanfic, ffs.)

To circle back to your statement, I'm not convinced the narrative structure /actually/ delivers any lasting consequences for Harry, especially on reading the detailed deconstruction on the web forum linked here wherein other characters get Flanderized or rendered very OOC to talk up how amazing Harry Stu is.

***** I'm not sure how that chapter is repellent, given that Harry's response, rather than leaving Draco to his depraved plans, is to start plotting to undermine Draco's bigoted world view, and burn down the system that enables that kind of thinking. You can call it naive and doomed to failure, if you like, but it's hardly an ignoble response. /And/ he persuades Draco to give her a reprieve.

** I liked the first few chapters, when it was more comedic. "When I come back I expect to find this shop still standing and not /in any way/ on fire."

Then it increasingly ditched the humor for convoluted subplots as the tone got darker and darker, all while the whole "applying logic and science to understanding magic" thing kinda went out the window in favor of Harry Stu. It felt like a serious bait-and-switch, which is one of my biggest pet peeves in fanfic. Interestingly, one of the author's Favorited fics on ffnet is the other contender for worst bait-and-switch fic among what I've read.

*** The problem is applying science never really got explored. It's mostly Harry spouting off bullshit psychology as truth (which ironically a lot of got caught in the replication crisis) or thinking really hard and finding the right solution.

There's never a case where his non magical background leads him significantly astray. For instance, it would be more interesting if everyone had different levels of magical ability (which is true irrespective of how big your mana pool is given people have different abilities to memorize and perform precise actions especially in sequence or under pressure).

This would lead to a more interesting conflict between Draco and Harry regarding blood purity, for instance. Just like not having house elves be slaves can be more interesting.

The problem with HPMOR is it tries to position itself as a realistic setting where people use the power of rationality, but it's actually an OP power wank where people defer to Harry's bullshit. Like Mcgonagall, despite being a useless bint in canon, would beat Harry's shit in if he acted like did in HPMOR especially towards her.

And where a surface level understanding of science gives you super powers. You know, despite science being "wrong" in the real world as for instance quantum mechanics and general relativity don't mesh and more importantly being wrong in universe as it clearly doesn't account for magic. But because of the MC's pigheadedness we're still supposed to believe conservation of mass should hold and transforming into a cat is a big issue because of it.

In general, my view is that I tended to enjoy reading the story and it has some interesting ideas, but on reflection a lot of it is dumb and that is in large part because the author is a whackjob.

Also, I found it ironic that the ending is essentially Harry is so pigheaded and impressed by his own brilliance, that he had to be bound by an unbreakable vow to not destroy the world. I'm not sure how it's supposed to stand as a way to indoctrinate people into rationality in the face of that.

**** The point of the ending, as I see it, is to emphasise that learning to do better is a slow process, and that everyone on Earth is a very long way away from getting everything right. Even learning all about how to recognise and describe your mistakes just means that you would be able to produce a long list of things you're doing wrong - not necessarily that you can suddenly fix them.

There's a reason the associated community calls itself "Less Wrong", ie still getting lots of things wrong, just trying to make less mistakes than yesterday.

***** That would be a decent message that matches the intent of a rationalist community, but I still think it the actual message is a bit warped in the story.

As I see it, this kind of process should be self driven to be valuable and you need a certain amount of humbleness and introspection to achieve it. Neither of which I recall to be traits of the MC.

The fact that he's forced into a semblance of this at the end of the story at gunpoint isn't good pedagogy as throughout this story we never see his bullheadedness lead him significantly astray. This kind of message has more impact if we're actually shown throughout consequences of not re-evaluating what you think you know, rather than a big external hammer at the end.

And yes, in my opinion, it is only possible to enjoy this series if you are willing to treat the major characters not as representations of hypothetical people but as walking archetypes and functions, as if they were in a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commedia_dell%27arte][commedia dell'arte]] play.

Basically everyone I've talked to who liked the fic doesn't care for HP fanfiction, and vice versa -- HP fanfiction fans generally don't really care for the fic, or at least consider it overrated. Personally I don't care for the fic in the slighest.

As for the controversy, that isn't because of the fic itself -- sure, it has some iffy stuff (the Draco Malfoy scene at Platform 9 3/4 comes to mind), but that's no worse than a lot of other fics. The reason it's controversial rather has to do with the author, and the way he generally behaves.

** When it came out, it was new. No one else was trying to write that same story - there wasn't another OP smart!Harry longfic around that tried to be comedic, or if there was, it was less readable. It was also a part of an ongoing discussion that was going on in fandom about the ideas presented in the books.

It was also a lot fresher and more immediate in style, because it was churned out about as fast as the writer could write it. It was easier to be forgiving, because it wasn't a finished work, and the fun was in seeing what would come next. No one knew, not us, not the writer, nobody.

Now all the tropes are tired and old, the zeitgeist has moved on, and the piece has been reworked to death.

I liked the ending and overall I did like the story, but ye god it had massive flaws even at the time. It was just different and new and very funny. The dreadful parts, the good parts, it was all fun, all part of a conversation.

Even back then, the battles dragged for far too long, it was just fun watching what, as [[/u/turbinicarpus]] points out, are more archetypes than human characters.

I went back for a reread and didn't get far at all. I prefer to think of HoMM as an event rather than literature.

** I think that when it comes to how magic in Harry Potter works, you have to meet it halfway, instead of trying to correct it. Stories like Victoria Potter, or The Prince of Slytherin do it well. Methods of Rationality does not.

It's completely natural that if you write a more serious story (as is often the case with fanfics, since you have canon for 'whimsical' take on magic), you will want to try contextualise things that don't work in a more realistic approach otherwise. However, a better way to do so is to simply draw away reader's attantion from them, rather than fixing them, because then you only invite MORE scrutiny on aspects of the story that don't work at a conceptual level.

** I liked it at the time of reading and there were interesting concepts but it might be because whenever something didn't make sense to me, I just assumed I was too dumb to understand it. But now I see it just throws around a lot of scientific jargon and uses the asshole genius trope to seem intellectual. It even takes some of the logical parts of the Harry Potter world and makes them nonsensical and complains about how illogical it is. One prime example I noticed is early on when Harry is complaining about how it doesn't make sense that his bag can understand what he wants. But the thing is nothing in the wizard world is voice activated like that (except for objects with specific instructions like brooms with "UP"). In the book and movie you retrieve things from a bag with Accio which makes sense. The writer made up his own illogical magic thing then complained about it.

The pacing was also bonkers and it got too preachy at times.

Also it wasn't until I read Pokemon: Origin of Species (a series I highly recommend) that I saw how poorly the "scientific method" was utilized in HPMOR.

It's a thought-provoking read, and quite funny if you like that style of humour, but the characters are not really a strong point. They're not terribly written, I've seen far worse, but they're not the highlight. It sounds like you're struggling with that.
