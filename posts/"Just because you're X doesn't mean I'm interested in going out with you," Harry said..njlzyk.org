Initially, my thought for this was a DC cross with Supergirl (not the awful TV show), but this could apply really in theory to any crossover where there's a female lead.

It came about as a thought about subverting the typical fics where Harry /must/ get together with a character as part of the cross. So, what if he's uninterested and basically rejects the female lead?

Basically, Harry gets accepted into the Justice League as a junior member or as the associate belonging to one of their sub-teams/younger teams.

He ends up meeting Kara/Supergirl as part of the normal "meet and greet", and she's pretty much taken with him straight away: He's her age, is "charming", is British (I'll never understand why American girls go crazy for us!), isn't already taken, and isn't evil or against the League (which is sort-of depressing, if you think about it).

Harry, however, is not with her: He finds her clingy, a bit overbearing and intimidating, and is exasperated by her attempts to always impress him/hit on him.

The other Leaguers find it amusing, and treat it like a drama show on TV; some, even Diana, muse about "young love", while she looks at either Bruce or Clark (depending on the continuity) longingly.

To be clear, it's /not/ harassment/stalking but...

You know that awkward time when you're in high-school and college and you always try to partner up with your crush as part of a project? Or try to drop hints constantly? Or where a character pines for another one, like the aforementioned Diana with Clark or Bruce? Yeah, it's like that.

I dunno if that came out right: I've always had trouble with articulating my thought-processes.

But, yeah: This could apply to anything, really.

Harry with a Slytherin girl? Harry with someone who's considered magical or crime-syndicate royalty/a Mafia princess? (Could be funny if he meets a veela princess or something).

It's pretty open.
