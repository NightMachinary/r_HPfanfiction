So I'm reading this fic (about 8 chapters in) and on the one hand in kinda enjoying it, but on the other hand Harry 's stupidity is starting to become too much... He doesn't know or understand 90% of what's happening and his angry outbursts are pretty much ridiculous. Is this going to improve or should I just give up?


** The story is infamously bad, so there's no shame in just giving it up.

** I honestly thought that 98% of the story was incredibly well written, and I waited years for it to be completed. I thought the world building and background on a lot of the characters and scenes was well researched and thought out.

But that last 2%... man, that ending was such a let down.... Its like the author just gave up and decided "fuck it i'm out"
