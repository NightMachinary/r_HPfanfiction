[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][AU. Salazar Slytherin once left Hogwarts in disgrace, vowing to return. He kept his word. A thousand years later he rules Wizarding Britain according to the principles of blood purity, with no end to his reign in sight. The spirit of rebellion kindles slowly, until the green-eyed scion of a broken House and a Muggleborn genius with an axe to grind unite to set the world ablaze.]]

Basically hugely AU on the level of something like The Firebird Trilogy, Slytherin became immortal and rules the wizarding world. He introduced a caste system of Slytherins on top, Gryffindor's are warriors, Ravenclaws are thinkers and Hufflepuff is everyone else and muggleborns are casteless unless raised to one of the castes.

The really cool thing is how canon is manipulated, so everyone has their caste animal tattooed on their left arm like a dark mark, Grindlewald is still around and has been waging a war against Slytherin for decades, the Weasleys are well regarded for the amount of sons they've sent to fight in the war, the Order is a resistance group but they are viewed like Death Eaters, the Death Eaters are a famous squadron that served under Commander Riddle who. It's just really, really good. Only 12 chapters so far but >100,000 words and updated fairly regularly.


** Nice recommendation! This'll jump to the top of the list. I wish they updated quicker, but it does look pretty regular like you said.

** One of my favorite fics. I like recommending it to fans of Applied Cultural Anthropology, because of the somewhat darkish!Hermione pov.
