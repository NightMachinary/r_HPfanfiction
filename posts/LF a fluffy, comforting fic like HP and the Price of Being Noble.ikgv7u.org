I just finished HP and the Price of Being Noble and I really, really liked it (and was so bummed out it isn't finished).

I liked the Harry/Fleur(/Gabrielle/Hermione) angle, both for the very skillful dodging of the obvious Haremfic tropes and for the occasional totally T-rated but very cleverly erotic scenes.

But really, what I liked most wasn't the main pairing, but the mood of the whole piece. I really loved the optimism, the author's whole attitude of "now see how all those problems can be solved with actually COMPETENT and well-intentioned characters" (really, my favorite character is Alain Delacour, who's completely unrealistically kind and wise and competent and a perfect father-figure in every possible way). I loved the small details, the descriptions of domestic life (I'm a sucker for these) and cool magical artifacts, the characters just enjoying themselves and each other.

I'd love to read some more stories like that. Doesn't have to be Harry/Fleur of course, or even romance-centered (though certainly wouldn't mind if it has some cute cuddling). I'm mostly looking for optimism, "sane" problem-solving (though please no outright rational-fics: I want comfort and cool stuff, not long-ass rants about Bayes and everything being stupid and illogical) and characters having fun.

â€‹

Oh, and PLEASE let it be finished, because I don't want to be left hanging again :D

** Been a long time but I remember good things about Letters, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6535391/1/Letters]].

Kinda slow, lots of quidditch.

*** Thanks!

A bit too much quidditch for my taste (I don't like sports at all), but nice enough.

Definitely better than "Cadmean Victory", which would've definitely given me nightmares if I was the type for it.

*** OK, 'Letters' is hilarious. Not because of the content, but because of the author, who keeps insisting he doesn't like writing the romance, and just wants to write about the quidditch.

** I started reading this story the day after I read your post. I just caught up. It was very well done and well written. I hope the author comes back with more. Would love to see where it goes. Try, although abandoned as well, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3703793/1/]]
