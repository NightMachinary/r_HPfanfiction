I keep seeing people change Harry's name to 'Hadrian', it's getting so common that I feel people are taking it as canon. what's wrong with the name Harry?


** In a world where names like Lucius, Nymphadora, Sirius, etc. exist.. Harry seems kind of plain. It's a fantasy novel. If you want our character to BE epic then they need an epic name. In cannon Harry fits because to be honest Harry is very plain and average. One of my favorite things about fanfiction is its ability to truly change who Harry IS. And still feel honest enough to the source.

Edit for spelling. On mobile.

*** I agree that fanfiction is great with it's ability to let people change characters into what or who they want but I feel that the name change is completely unnecessary and it's becoming very common for people to put that as his full name that it just seems to be there with no after thought, which means that people are almost taking it as canon: the sky is blue, Harry's name in fanfiction is Hadrian, and Dumbledore should have said it calmly.

If you want a fancily named Harry, just call him Hadrian? There doesn't need to be too much thought, right?

Unless they repeatedly call him Hadrian, it doesn't make or break a fic for me.

** I think the goal in those fics is to make Harry sound more 'aristocratic' to reflect his sudden inheritance of all the ancient pureblood houses to ever exist or somesuch. It usually achieves the effect of being a bit cringy.

** Harry is as Petunia once described it, a nasty common name. When renaming to Hadrian they are either trying to add class for pureblood related stories. Alternatively I have seen some where they are trying to work around the ridiculousness of magical contracts like those of the goblet of fire by giving him a "true" name which people wouldn't know so they couldn't bind him. In this later case its a plot device and the first Harry related name they think of perhaps because of the number of the first type.

*** For the record, unless they were written within the past calendar year, most fanfics when referencing the father of James Potter ignore the whole Fleamont thing because it simply didn't exist at the time the story was written.

Fanon has held for years now that the parents of James Potter were Charlus/Charles Potter and Dorea Potter nee Black.

Also there's the point that Fleamont came from Pottermore, which a lot of fans (myself included) don't view as canon and choose to ignore.

**** I hereby claim that, if I ever end up writing a Harry Potter fic where James Potter's parents appear, they will almost certainly be Dorea Black and Charlus Potter. (Though my current fanfic plans don't have anything to do with them at all - I'm more likely to write about Lily's family. Which, IIRC, doesn't yet have much canon on it, fortunately.)

Mind you, after /Cursed Child/, it's hard to properly feel what's canon at all. That story pretty much just took a bunch of bad fanfic cliches and ran with it. Meanwhile, many of the /good/ fanfic cliches were pounded into the ground (it was pretty much accepted fanon that North America is really progressive regarding Muggles and non-pureblood wizards, until the No-Maj article came out a few months ago, explaining that it's actually somehow even worse than Britain).

***** yeah see, that's my biggest issue with fics. The line between fanon and canon has gotten so blurred over the past couple of years by Pottermore and Cursed Child that it's hard to tell where it lies anymore.

At this point for the purposes of my own entertainment and enjoyment I've just decided on thoroughly ignoring anything touted as canon past the original 7 books and 8 movies. JKR's pottermore writings and the cursed child have just screwed the pooch for me in terms of what's canon to the point where I have to laugh at it and say she'd have been better off not writing them.

A huge part of why I got into Harry Potter fanfiction in the first place is because it was always such an open world to put your own ideas into, and that it had a culture all its own outside of the books and movies. The pottermore writings and especially cursed child have just taken so much of that open world away for me that I have to ignore them completely if I still want to enjoy the world of Harry Potter. IMO, JKR screwed the pooch big time and really shouldn't have written pottermore or signed off on cursed child.
