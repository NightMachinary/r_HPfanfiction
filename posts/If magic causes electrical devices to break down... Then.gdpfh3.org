What if electric fields causes magical devices to break down? Or, since a spell can loosely be argued to be another kind of magical device, traveling through the air, what if strong electric or magnetic fields could absorb or refract spells?

Imagine: EMPs, Tesla coils for nullification fields, or using muggle power plants for witness protection, an MRI for breaking the Imperius...or unblockable lightning guns

We know Diagon Alley doesn't affect London, either because it's a dimensional rift or whatever, and when Arthur repairs Dudley's tongue he doesn't break the living room, so the small bleedoff of magic from spells nearby doesn't break them. Similarly, electricity or electromagnetism doesn't affect magic, mostly because someone struck by lightning isn't going to be casting magic. But with a powerful EM field...?


** I do remember a story where a runaway Harry couldn‘t be found, because he lived in a storage basement right next to the junction boxes and HF transformers for a college.

Don‘t remember title or author unfortunately.
