Was trying to get some more of my fic bookmarks sorted and realised I had a folder for this trope with exactly one fic in it. Can't really justify keeping it for one fic, but I can't think of where else to resort it (the fic in question is Scars by Phoenixgirl26 - link below) and so I figured I'd ask to see if there are more fics I can put in that folder.

I don't mind who, I don't mind how, and I'm okay with whatever level/type of abuse, but I'd like fics that look at people finding out about how Harry was treated at the Dursleys. If it's severe abuse, I'd prefer it to be non-graphic or have those scenes be skippable, but that's not a requirement.

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. Basically, anything goes. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

#+begin_quote
  Rather than allowing Harry to stay at Diagon Alley after he blew up Aunt Marge, the Ministry sends Harry back to the Dursleys. Harry returns to school after a terrible summer, to find that he's not the only one with this kind of secret. A student has been killed by his family. New screening measures are put into place by the Ministry: Every student must be given a medical exam and interview to look for child abuse. With Dumbledore facing an inquiry, Snape is entrusted with the task of making sure EVERYONE receives one. Answer to the "New measures for screening abuse" challenge at Potions and Snitches. The first chapter contains a character death and the whole story is quite dark. It begins at the beginning of Prisoner of Azkaban and is AU thereafter. Also note: this story is a "Snape is Harry's biological dad" story. This is not supposed to be the central theme of the story, but people have gotten annoyed that I didn't tell them at the beginning. Another note: There are no pairings in this story, or explicit sexual content. There are, however, mentions of homosexuality. Since there are no pairings, there is no slash content, but if the mere mention of homosexuality offends you, read something else.

******* It's a good fic with slow development of the Snape mentors Harry relationship. Lots of good writing and it acknowledges the trauma of Ginny, Neville and Harry really beautifully. It has many references to suicide/suicidal characters, in case that's a trigger. I should mention there's also a Severitus angle, but it's done respectfully (as in Lily doesn't cheat on James).

  When Rachel Snow - the Girl-Who-Lived - is sorted into Slytherin House her life changes for the better. She makes a friend, and then another, and slowly gets used to the idea of magic. One small problem. She hasn't spoken in three years and waving her wand around does nothing. Her Head of House, Professor Snape, seems determined that she will speak again and learn to cast magic. Rachel isn't so sure, but she's willing to try.

  Harry comes into a very unexpected inheritance. He is a creature both rare and very dangerous, a creature that is black listed by the British Ministry. So now he must avoid detection at all costs, whilst choosing his life partners and dealing with impending pregnancy at just sixteen. With danger coming not just from the Ministry but even other creatures, what was he supposed to do?

** I'll try to give warnings if the abuse is above canon-level, but it's been a while since I read some of these

- The [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/31886][Memories and Dreams]] series is touching. I love characters working through complex emotions. It all starts with Harry helping Minerva to deliver a letter to #4 Privet Drive. It's not so much about people 'discovering' the abuse as it is about Harry working through the abuse. It is complete.
- A new favorite of mine is [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/16052816/chapters/37478033][Away Childish Things]]. There is a potions accident that causes Harry to be deaged to the age of ten. Draco has to take care of him. This teaches Draco quite a lot about Harry's childhood that he wouldn't have otherwise known. I'm not super familiar with the de-aging trope, but I have heard that some fics use the concept to inappropriately pair characters of vastly different ages. That is NOT the case in this one. Complete
- In [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/839169][The Uncle]] (oneshot) Remus rescues Harry from the Dursleys.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4172226/1/A-Hero][A Hero]] is from Dudley's POV. It won the Quibbler Awards (not sure what that is, but included in case it's relevant). In this, Dudley reads a story with an abusive family and, through it, is able to realize that his own family was abusive to Harry. Vernon and Petunia do not take this realization well.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/987408/chapters/1947158][Stealing Harry]] is an AU wherein Sirius never went to Azkaban (for reasons explained in-text). Harry spends his days going to Sirius' bookshop until Sirius discovers canon-level abuse and steals Harry away. There are consequences. Sadly, the author is unfinished, but they got up to year 3, so I think it's still worth a read.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/25925863/chapters/63012685][Realizations]] was one of the first fics that got me in the fandom. The author dropped it ten years ago and is coming back to it this year and reworking it. It was originally published between book 5 and 6. WIP
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10678911/chapters/23643603][Blood Magic]] is another old classic and one of the original Severitus fics. Harry receives a letter from his parents on his sixteenth birthday revealing that Snape is his bio-dad (not an affair or a rape, like I've seen elsewhere; this was planned). It is complete. Includes discussions of his abusive past.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4912291/1/The-Best-Revenge][The Best Revenge]] is a Snape/Harry mentor story. I like this one because Snape is still a bastard, but he's not the kind of bastard that can watch a kid get abused (canon levels) and do nothing. It is complete.
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2006636/1/Catechism][Catechism]] is a little aged, tbh. The author hasn't updated in a few years, but true love lasts a lifetime. This is a bit of a rough read, but all the worst stuff is in the first chapter. This is above canon levels of violence against Harry. Basically, the Dursleys turned Harry against magic and he kind of has a house elf mentality. It is a WIP.
- [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/742072/chapters/1382061][A Year Like None Other]]: Harry gets a letter from the Dursleys, forcing an impromptu visit supervised by Snape. How will Snape react to seeing Harry's treatment by the Dursleys? In ways that are not out of character but also not super dickish. Complete with one sequel complete and another in the works.
- I'm not super clear on the timeline or the point of divergence on this one, but that's not really the point of it, anyway. In [[https://archiveofourown.org/series/1471166][HEX series]], Harry's trauma at the hands of the Dursleys is explored. They're more about exploring the characters than the plot. My favorite of the series is the third one, but they're all good
- Oh, totally forgot this one! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1807847/1/Prometheus-Bound][Prometheus Bound]] has HIGH levels of violence/abuse in the first few chapters. I remember it being a tough read, but I really loved it in high school. Complete
- [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/1/Gabriel][Gabriel]] is abandoned. At 5, an abused Harry is taken in by a powerful family. He is basically raised to be a child soldier. I like the world building here.

  Do you- do you think I can't handle it? Harry, we've been through hell, haven't we? We've both seen hell, and we're both still here. I'm here, like I've always been here. I think I've proven whatever it is, I can take it. I'm not going anywhere.” Her voice had taken on a defensive edge, but Harry could hear the hurt beneath it. She thought he didn't trust her. She was wrong. She was so wrong.  “I know. I know you can. It's not that. It really isn't, it's just-” There are things we haven't talked about. Things I didn't want you to find out, not like this. Things I shouldn't tell you like this. He coudn't bring himself to say it, but she was watching him with those eyes so he took deep breath and tried again. //One shot set after the war. Harry and Ginny are living together and just trying to get by. Harry has a particularly bad episode and he and Ginny talk a little bit about what life was like for him at the Dursley's. Because they've all been through a lot and Harry needs to start dealing with his childhood trauma, dammit!

  The Dursleys have had it out for him ever since he was dropped on their doorstep. But Harry has Hermione, and it isn't so bad. Until she suddenly leaves him and enrolls at Hawthorne Academy. Then, it suddenly is. AKA the non-magical high school AU that nobody asked for
