  What if Wormtail hadn't told Lord Voldemort the Potters hideout. What if he took Harry straight to him instead? A Dark Harry fanfic. AU Mild HG

  ON HIATUS. READ PROFILE! In a different world where Voldemort is gone and the Potters are alive, Harry is chosen to be in Slytherin House. Years after, he falls for a Gryffindor girl. What will come first? She or the Slytherin pride? HG. Please R&R

*** Tried it but the first half of the first chapter already has too many cringe worthy moments for me. (E.g. Lily and James demanding a second sorting because Harry's in Slytherin, or Sirius starting to cry 'real tears' when James asks him to talk to Harry...)
