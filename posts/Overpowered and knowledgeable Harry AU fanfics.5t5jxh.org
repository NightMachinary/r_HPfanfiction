I'm looking for some fanfics that portray Harry in an almost too powerful way that is super knowledgeable about magic and has people look up to him.

Fics where he travels to a different dimension like linkao3(C'est La Vie) with prior knowledge is awesome.

Where he is immortal like linkffn(The Long Journey Home) and helps develop magic is a favorite.

Or where he is reborn again and again like in linkffn(Put Your Galleons Where Your Mouth is) or linkffn(Again and Again) is also another awesome possibility.

Essentially, knowledgeable, powerful Harry from either rebirth, AU or immortality is what I'm looking for. Hopefully completed or not completely abandoned.

I have already read linkffn(Delenda Est) and didn't like it as much as I had hoped.

Please no harems!

Bashing is not preferred but is alright as long as it doesn't devolve in the Greater!Good!Dumbledore! or Greedy!Weasleys! Trope I see.

Slash and romance is okay as long as it's well written and doesn't consume the whole fanfic, gen!fics are preferred though not necessary.

Thank you so, so much!!!! I love these kind of fanfics and I can rarely find well-written ones anymore! Thanks again!!!


** You are going to like I'm Still Here: linkffn(9704180).

Basically Harry from a universe where neither side gave up, and the world broke around them. Harry manages to get back in time, and because he is the protagonist he is of course very powerful (/sigh/). It turns out that Draco /sort of/ came with him as well, and he helps Harry. Note this is not a good guy Draco, this is merely Draco not wanting to die and having grown up to being more measured.

They land in an alternate universe where a female version of him is in that position, and the Potters still live. But he wants nothing to do with them.

Kathryn518 and her co-writer Plums have both improved as writers as the story progressed, and as such we see the story steadily improve and move away from the rather normal stories you find on ffnet.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

#+begin_quote
  The war ends on Harry's twenty-first Halloween, and, one year later, with nothing truly holding him in that world, Fate takes this opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new, stress-free life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. A life where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived instead, James and Lily are still alive, and that Harry Potter is relatively normal but a downright arse. Dimension-travelling Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why he's fourteen again. And why Fate thinks, in all her infinite wisdom, that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

*** I just finished that yesterday and i must say i'm a little disappointed with the direction that story took.

It felt like the author didn't really know what he wanted to do with the story; it started almost like a history textbook(disregarding the first chapter) then it got more personal thanks to some interaction with Ellie and Josephina and after that the war in France reminded me of 'Band of Brothers' with Ford's team.

(Which was awesome but it just felt like a different story suddenly.)

The main problem i have with it though is that Harry took a complete sideline role after the Civil War and instead of focusing more on domestic issues and politics the author decides that harry needs to get back into the battlefield which was just weird.

It got especially ridiculous when he started 1v1ing that Jaeger guy with a fucking sword.

I get that the author wanted to make him a conqueror and warrior king but after a certain point it just felt so out of character. Sure, he's always been a soldier but he also had a vision, a goal and a whole bunch of political cunning and all that just got sidelined for some cheap action scenes.

We don't know anything about how the Kingdom/Empire actually works, it's all about the specifics during the wars which is interesting but you need to focus on more than that and the whole Hughes vs. Elicia situation just gets ignored for 20 chapters and then suddenly comes up again for some ridiculous reason.

I'm not even gonna get into the conflict between Harry and Elicia that came up in the latest chapter. There were so many points and events in the story that could have made them split up or have a serious fight over policy, events where it really /should/ have happened, but instead the author always told us that they love each other and Ellie supports what Harry does and now suddenly for no reason at all Ellie distances herself from Harry.

The whole thing just felt artificial, as if the author had a rough plan written down when he started and always sticks to it, despite having changed minor things that should have had an impact on how people would react to certain situations.

--------------

Now that i've ranted I want to say that i still liked the story, i still read all 650k words in a few days, I just think that it could have been a lot better if the focus of the story had shifted after the Civil War, away from combat and more into court politics and domestic and foreign policy.

** Might want to look into the "Lone Traveler" series started by The Professional and continued by Dunuelos. Harry flubs an attempt at going back in time because "he had nothing left to lose" and instead goes to a different reality to fix stuff. Once he does he goes to another reality. Lather, Rinse, Repeat. Basically a Harry Potter does Quantum Leap sort of thing. As it goes on he gets more and more powerful. Some realities he goes to has the "Evil Dumbles/Weasleys" but some he doesn't. Hell he doesn't always end up in a HPverse world. He's gone to Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, Star Wars, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Joan of Arcadia, The West Wing, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other worlds.

  When things go wrong in one world, wizards seek help from another. Unfortunately what you want and what you get can sometimes be entirely different things. A tale featuring Harry, Hermione, Luna, Susan, Neville and a whole host of others. Loosely inspired by "The Meaning of Fear" by Rorschach's Blot. Rating for highly probable violence, and likely bad language.

  Harry James Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived, the Defeater of Voldemort, Chief Auror, Master of Death, finds that he is five years old. It should not surprise anyone that things in Magical Britain immediately become rather strange.
