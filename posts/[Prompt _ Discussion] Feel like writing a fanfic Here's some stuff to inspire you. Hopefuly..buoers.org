"It culminated late last night,\\
From pointed fingers starting fires that burned since years ago...\\
We've fallen out of love."\\
He said, "Ron, I do believe I've seen Virginia to the end,\\
I find myself about as far as I can go."\\
Then he said "Friend, you learn to love to feel the words you hate to hear,\\
Just shut your mouth and then the truth comes stinging clear,\\
You find you're wrong and it's your problems all along,\\
And then you love someone, but not till then."

Haunted by computer screens,\\
The world around him,\\
Grass was greener on the other end.

She could see it in his eyes;\\
The love had left, or it had died,\\
And she was left that way...\\
With nothing left for her to say.

So she said "Love, you learn to love to feel the words you hate to hear,\\
Just shut your mouth and then the truth comes stinging clear,\\
You find you're wrong and it's your problems all along,\\
And then you love someone, but not till then."\\
"You love, till then you love,"

It took love to finally see the pointed fingers back at me,\\
A silent mouth, a broken heart, a sword retired.

So a sword retired...

I said "Love, you learn to love to feel the words you hate to hear,\\
Just shut your mouth and then the truth comes stinging clear,\\
You find you're wrong and it's your problems all along,\\
And then you love someone, but not till then."\\
"You love someone"

What does everyone think is happening?
