Meet Daisy.

She's 11 years old, getting ready to go to Hogwarts, and very excited to be finally starting her medical education.

However, magic is going to turn out to be something of a problem for Daisy, because she is completely non-verbal.

When Daisy was a baby, her mum snapped one day when Daisy wouldn't stop crying, and accidentally cast an overpowered Silencio charm on her baby daughter. Since that day, Daisy has not been able to make any noise. No talking, whistling, footsteps, clapping - nothing she does makes a sound.

The best healers and spell damage specialists haven't been able to undo the permanent silencing charm. Wracked with guilt, Daisy's mother fled and abandoned her family when Daisy was still a baby.

Daisy is now very close to her father. To cope with the situation, both of them learned to communicate through British Sign Language. She also loves to write letters, since it's the only way she has found to communicate with most people. Having discovered that her condition allows her to sneak around without making any noise, she has a mischievous side, and is particularly fond of sneaking up behind her dad to grab him suddenly, making him scream like a girl.

--------------

So I'd like to write this myself if I have the time/skill. I have some ideas about plot moments, such as other students being unsure of Daisy due to her condition, to her struggles to perform magic without being able to say the incantations.

Any thoughts, and would this be something that people would want to read?


** Just got recced this fic and loved it. It's a fem-harry, with some tougher tones but is a really good fic. But the main is initially mute from childhood trauma and how she improves. It's a very sweet story.

** I'd love to read this! Sign language has always been a bit of a special interest of mine so I love reading about characters that use it haha

The specifics of why she's silent sound interesting too! I can imagine how unnerving it would be for her classmates never hearing her approach. I wonder, how far does this reach? If footsteps are silent, does that include when she's wearing shoes? If she was holding a mallet, would it not make a noise against a drum? If that's the case could she silence something by touching it? How close to touching something could she get before it stops making noise?

Sorry for the textwall, this is just a fascinating concept to me!

*** I'm glad you like the concept!

In my head, the silence extended to anything where she would be directly making a noise. Therefore, if she were wearing shoes, it would be silent since it's attached to her, but beating a drum (to use your example) would probably make noise, since she's inducing something else to make the noise. Same applies if she drops something, glass for example. If she was to tap the glass, silence. If she drops the glass and it shatters, people notice.

Whatever rules that apply, they'd have to be consistent.

Imagine how frustrating it would be to not be able to get people's attention except visually... I think it would make a person feel almost invisible. I think that people would start noticing the eerie silence around her... no rustling, no breath, no shuffling, no cough or sneeze... a void of noise.

***** You've pretty much nailed it, that's why people would be unsure around her at first.

I also had an idea for a scene where she is learning to do magic. One of her professors (it was Flitwick in my head) has noticed that she struggles due to being non-verbal, so is giving one to one tuition.

The method Flitwick uses is to have Daisy hold her wand while Flitwick uses it to perform a Lumos spell (so both are holding the wand). In this way, Daisy is encouraged to learn the feel of the magic for spells, and can eventually learn to replicate it herself without saying the incantation aloud.

In this way, it would be much more of a struggle for her to learn magic, but when she has cracked it she's at an advantage because literally all her magic is non-verbal.

*** I read this really good book on Wattpad called "Silently Falling" where the main character can't talk due to trauma. It's not fanfiction but since you said you're interested in books with characters who use sign language I thought I'd mention it. I've reread it a few times since it's so good.

  "Sunshine, what guy do you know has a weird fetish with sign language?"

  She's the aftermath of a high school party nightmare. Tragedy robbed her of her innocence and stole her voice before she had the chance to speak out. The court called her a liar, and the guilty was set free. Now memories plague her mind and trap her in solitude.

  She was forced to learn sign language, struggling to find a way to voice her silence.

  He's the definition of the boy she tried to stay away from. The epitome of harsh rumours and hopeless fantasies. The source of lies and blame. He's analyzed, misunderstood, and utterly mysterious.

  And he may be the one to find her voice.

  When they meet, she gets accustomed to his arrogance and he gets accustomed to her silence. An essay is what brings them together, but what happens when he starts asking too many questions?

  Will her past continue to drag her down, or will he save her?

  Fate has a funny way of bringing people together, but it doesn't always work how it's supposed to.

****** Wizards still wear glasses -not just Harry - this means they still hadn't come up with something to help with vision issues.

So, it's clear that, for whatever reasons, they hadn't solve everything yet.

So, a character can be born mute or deaf and wizards hadn't find the fix.

That being said, I think it's a moot point for this particular prompt, since I found very interesting to explore the full effect of not making any noises. Not even clapping or footstep or anything.

Which Daisy here use to play pranks, but could be both very useful in other ways, but also not so great. How she gains attention from someone that can't see her ?

Say, Hermione is coming her way with a tower of books that block her vision, for some reason Daisy can't get out of her way. Someone abled would just say stop. Someone mute could still clap or make noises to avoid the collision? What does Daisy can do ?

** One thing that could be interesting to explore is using sign as the starting point of a new casting system. Honestly, the words aren't even necessary, as shown by everyone being required to learn silent casting in 11th grade (6th year). Everyone! (Well, those taking wand-related classes, anyway.) So, basically the words are just a crutch for the apprentice caster, and that kind of crutch could be replaced by hand and arm gestures, like the somatic component of spells in games like D&D. She'd need to figure out how to handle both gesturing the "words"/feelings/whatever the spell needs as well as the casting motions, but even those are also not really necessary. She could combine the wand movements with her own brand of pseudo-sign (similar to the pseudo-Latin used in the books) to make her own casting system that would be difficult for others to understand or counter.

The only big problem I see with such a story is that it would be really cerebral, very inside her head, since a bunch of 11-year-olds aren't going to learn how to sign just to talk with her. Hell, not even the teachers would. So unless she also gains some form of telepathy (basic Occlumency plus basic Legilimency?), which might scare the crap out of people, she's going to be very, very alone. And that's kinda boring to read. No interactions in a school setting for kids doesn't leave a lot of room for plot.

Oh, and she could also concentrate on the "witchcraft" part of the curriculum, the part that doesn't use wands. That's more than half of the classes! Only three require wands. So if she specializes in potions, herbology, creatures, history, astronomy (and maybe rituals?), arithmancy, runes, etc. she won't even need a wand.

And for communication, while she can't use a transcription charmed quill, maybe a thought-transcribing quill could save time?

I see your point about the cerebral nature of the story. However, I think there may be ways she could learn to communicate with others. There's always written notes (she could use something similar to the paper airplane memos at MoM), or perhaps if it's set in a time where Dumbledore is alive, he can teach her to use the same "ribbon" conjuration he uses to display the lyrics to the school song in PS. That could give her the option to have her own personal subtitles.

** Fascinating idea! I would love to read this.

So Daisy is non-verbal, but it's all she's known. She's never going to speak. There's a lot of things to explore with this.

She cannot speak, so some branches of magic--Charms, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts--would be very difficult for her, regardless of how sympathetic the professor is.

Other branches--Astronomy, History of Magic, Herbology, and to some degree Potions--would not be more difficult. At least at first--more advanced Potions does appear to require incantations.

So right off the bat, you have a potential for Daisy to connect with the Herbology professor. Whether it's Professor Sprout or Neville, I think there's something to explore there.

On the flip side, depending on when this is set, in her Potions class, Professor Snape may find her quietness as deliberate disrespect. If Snape is cruel to Daisy because of this, it may be interesting if Daisy is reduced to silent tears.

If she's constantly writing, she's probably reading quite a bit as well. She could be an excellent essayist, especially if she's taken to writing her essays as epistles. You could have her be able to get higher marks on the written exams and papers than Hermione--but Hermione could be dismissive since /"Daisy can't actually cast magic."/

What House would she be in?

Her playful sneakiness seems awfully Gryffindor-y, and I think she'd get along well with Ginny if she offers to help prank the Twins.

On the other hand, given her closeness with her father, becoming friends with Luna, who also adores her daddy has a certain sense to it. Two odd birds of a feather in Ravenclaw.

Keeping in mind, she's non-verbal, Daisy may well be the target for bullies. If they do something to hurt her hands--say, a Stinging Jinx, for example--then there's no way for her to communicate with a professor who did this to her.

Regarding house, I can see an argument to go to all four really. You mentioned valid reasons for Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Hufflepuff may be an option as they are the most accepting of all the others, and would be least likely to ostracise her because of her condition. Slytherin would likely see the enforced silence and it's inherent sneakiness potential as a boon too.

***** Well, turnabout is fair play, but I would imagine she'd be hard to catch in that way! But that doesn't mean he can't get her back in other ways...

Anyway, since he's a single dad I would imagine he'd be quite devoted to his daughter, especially due to her condition and her mum's abandonment. She might end up being a little bit of a daddy's girl because of it.

****** Yeah, I can imagine that turnabout would be tough for Daisy's dad...but then again. that's half the fun!

If she can sneak, maybe he can hide...and right when she's least expecting it, Daisy gets a visit from the tickle monster...

Yeah, I can imagine that Daisy must be the apple of his eye. In addition to using British Sign Language, there may be other things they do together. I imagine he must read to her a lot. And they might write each other notes throughout the house.

Hmm...what comes to mind now is the dynamic between Castle and his daughter Alexis.

** so i'm autistic and "selectively mute" (hate that term, but not gonna get into that rn.) the way i see it is that if a student cannot speak, they just cast spells wordlessly.

we get the impression in canon that nonverbal magic is pretty rare, but. we think all sorts of things irl are rare that are quite common for disabled people to have to do.

  Hazel Potter has always been strange. People say she knows too much and says too little. When Aunt Petunia utters that forbidden word, 'magic', it sends Hazel on a hunt for the truth. If only the Wizarding World could have guided the direction of her search... femHarry with a focus on witchcraft

** I'm DHH (Deaf/Hard of Hearing) I was born hard of hearing but with in just enough residual hearing to use hearing aids since I was a baby. I was also mainstreamed in a hearing school in a rural area with few specialized resources using my hearing aids, a tool called an FM system where the teacher clips a microphone as close to their mouth as they can, usually on the top of their shirt, and their speechius directly transmitted into my hearing aids. It was the 90s so my side used a mixed of the made up systems signed english and SEE 1 and 2, which are made up by hearing people and no where near completely full native languages like ASL or spoken English.

Deaf and dute and such use of signed language is usually dint in a pretty stereotypical way to DHH people and against our cultural norms. People mean well byt patronizing and infabtilizing DHH people is just as destructive as blatant discrimination if not more so.

This can be well done but please be aware of these things and Deaf cultures to start off kn the right foot. Too often I see unrealistic and patronizing results.

If you or anyone has questions about this Deaf/HoH/deaf mufe, it characters that use a real po sign language like ASL or BSL let me know and hopefully I can help some!!
