I'm so sorry for posting another of these, but I'm getting quite desperate. I feel like I have read all the good fem!Harry stories out there. I tried finding new ones using scryber or what's it called, but came up short. And the more promising ones are still in their children shoes with a few thousand words. So yeah, if anyone could drop by good fem harry fics that aren't recomended enough I would be most thankful.

On another note, could someone give me links to fics where the main character owns a bar or something similar? They are always fun to read and while they aren't long, most of them are sweet.

Thanks in advance ;)

  Holly is prickly and poisonous like her namesake, only with Hermione she's more normal. Dark and disturbing Girl!Harry tells her story via an enchanted journal.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool]])

Moratorium is probably my favourite fem Harry story and I feel like I link it a lot and I've seen Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool linked fairly often but once more won't hurt anyone.

Sorry if you've read them already but they're really the only fem Harry stories that immediately jumped to mind that I can say I actually finished reading.

  Harry Potter was never a good little child. Harry Potter learned the hard way early on, that the good only won in stories and fairy tales, and so to adapt, Harry Potter chose not to be such a good little girl anymore. Gray!Harry Dark!Harry Manipulative!Harry Fem!Harry F!Harry -COMPLETE-
