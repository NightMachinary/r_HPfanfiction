For me, it's not even the crack pairings. I just can't read anything with a teacher-student relationship.

Hermione and Snape, Harry and Snape, or even the rare Ron and Snape fanfics make me immediately click away. Ship what you want to ship, no shame in that, but Snape was the same age as Harry's parents would have been! I can't.


** I really struggle to read Harry x Draco.

I'm not sure what it is, but something about that pairing really grates me.

Maybe its just that most of the fics which put those two together tend to be absolute rubbish and I've been really unlucky in not reading any of the good ones, but I can't remember enjoying any fics where they were together.

(if anyone has got any good ones I'm super open to changing my mind though!)

  “It's not for long,” Hermione said. “By the time we get back to Hogwarts, the Unfettering Brew will be ready.”“Listen to you!” Ron said. “He's got to get through a month with the Dursleys and a month at Malfoy Manor. With Draco Malfoy.”“Yeah, thanks,” Harry said, because he hadn't just spent the last week contemplating just how much more horrible his summer holidays were about to be than they'd ever been before.

  Draco snorted. “I'm not reduced to penury. I want something considerably beyond money, and I rather think you're the only one can give it to me.” “You want the Invisibility Cloak,” Harry said, flatly. He'd half expected as much; it was the only thing he had that Draco could want---“Don't be stupid, Potter,” Draco said. “I want my reputation back.”

With Ginny she's got this big family and it doesn't make sense that she's the special one with all these magical powers and the growth spurt because then you have to write that in for all the siblings or justify it somehow.

**** If you read between the lines, the pairing actually makes loads of sense. The main reason, there are LOADS of examples in the books where Harry/Ginny share a joke or a look about something they find funny. They have a similar sense of humour, which speaks to how they view the world.

** Anything with Remus/Tonks.

I know it's a canon pairing but it's always made me feel uncomfortable. There's the age difference, the fact Tonks kept pursuing an unwilling Remus until he said yes and even when they're together they both seem so unhappy, especially Remus.

The (admittedly non-canon) Hogwarts Mystery mobile game is set when Tonks is a 5th year student and Remus is an adult, which just makes it feel even more uncomfortable.

** I 100% agree about teacher-student pairings, and I'll add in any other adult-child pairings like Remus with Hogwarts-age Hermione. Also, any fic where an adult-minded time traveler pursues a relationship with a fellow student(s). Age of consent exists for a /reason/, people!

As for Dramione, that one only works if the fic puts in enough work in character development for the two of them to actually be in a place where they could like and respect each other. Maybe if it was set years post-canon, or started early enough at Hogwarts to steer Draco away from his Junior Death Eater ways.

** I freaking HATE McGonagall/Dumbledore. I get it in stuff written before the later books though. It's not even just because Dumbles is gay or they're old and I find it gross. It's just like, if two people of different genders know and interact with each other, do we REALLY have to make them romantically interested in each other? Is nothing sacred?

Also, McGonagall/Harry but specifically the trope where McGonagall gets de aged to look younger or where Harry specifically remarks like "She had to have been pushing 70 but her magic kept her perky and tight." That's literally so gross to me. If you want him to sleep with her for some weird reason, don't just reduce her to another name in the long list of magical flashlights Harry has charmed. Keep her McGonagall.

I'm so conflicted about Harry/Tom. I don't like the pairing but I like pureblood!Harry powerwanks and those normally go hand in hand. It's creepy when he raises Harry and they are supposed to become a couple. It's creepy when Harry's in 5th year and Tom is like 45. Most of it is just too creepy for me. I only accept like, Harry-sent-back-in-time stuff and maybe teen voldemort stuff.

Snape/Hermione and or Snape/any hogwarts student. I don't mind if it's like 20 years after the war and Snape is 55 and Hermione is 37. But anything while they're kids is too much.

I literally was reading a fic on ff. That was supposed to be Evil!Harry but had a 10 year old Harry kissing a 24 year old in the first chapter. It wasn't even acknowledged as weird or illegal either! The conflict was literally that the 24 year old had a boyfriend. I don't think it was an actual pedophile that wrote it. It seemed more like a 14 year old who didn't know how fucked up that was. But thenon of the reviews even mentioned how disgusting it was!

** I wonder what search terms you use because I don't think I've ever seen Ron/Snape. Personally I don't mind Hermione/Snape per se, but I stay away from teacher/student versions of it (which is by far the most common).

There are 3 canon ships I stay away from: Romione, Jily and Remadora. I don't think any of them (except maybe teenage James, but I like to think he grew up) are bad people, but I just can't stand reading fics shipping them.

For Romione, the reason for this is because I don't think they're compatible. I always figured they were too different and wanted different things. I can see them as close friends, but not close enough to cohabitate in a romance. Hermione would be annoyed by some of Ron's idiosyncracies (for instance, I can see him litter his stuff around the house and Hermione being annoyed by having to take care of it), while Ron would get annoyed by Hermione's long periods of absence from home due to her incessant need to overwork.

My main issue with Jily is having read one too many fics where he chases her relentlessy until she caves in. While we only see James do this once in canon (defense O.W.L. aftermath), the scene implies that it's a common occurence given her quick-witted response. And I don't see this as romantic, but just downright creepy. Not saying she should've ended up with Snape instead (which is what fanfics generally seem to consider as her only alternative), but I think that in a canon context, she could have done better than both of them, for different reasons. Full disclosure: I like Snily, but not in a canon context -- I can only see it if he makes less shitty choices of friends and future. I already disliked Jily when I got interested in this ship -- in fact, it likely contributed to it.

I dislike Remadora for somewhat similar reasons as Jily, but in reverse. My impression of that ship is Nymphadora badgering Remus relentlessy about a relationship, with him caving in at the end of HBP, with peer pressure from others after Dumbledore's death. That scene really rubbed me the wrong way.

There are other ships I stay away from, but if I were to list all non-canon ships I avoid, we'd be here all day.

Fanfiction makes Snape love Harry because he has his mother's eyes, or love Hermione 'cause she's intelligent and muggle-born like Lily, or make Lily the bad one in the story to Snape to love someone else. Or make Snape a much better person than he actually is for Lily to love him.

I don't know, they just don't do it right. Snape needs to fucking learn what is REAL love, not just put someone to replace Lily nor make her look like she's bad for not loving him back.

Get the man out of Hogwarts. In fact, get him out of England. With his level of self-loathing, he won't need much to start confronting his own issues. Set it in 1983 or something, because post-PS Snape is way too far gone. He will never be a really positive character but at the very least he might not be as ruinous.

It's really well-written and intriguing where Voldemort travels back in time, but we haven't gotten to the self-cest part and I am super dreading that bit. [Though now that I'm writing this out, I actually don't think it's the self-cest part that freaks me out, but the fact that Tom first believes that the Voldemort who he meets back in time is his father... so yeah, I think that's the real issue for me here.] I guess I like the idea that the only person in the multiverse that Voldemort could actually learn to love is himself lol... but I think I would greatly prefer that in a father/son relationship style rather than romantic.

​

Also, speaking of incest, I had this weird shower thought the other day, like the idea that someone travels back in time and somehow becomes their own father... then that would also make them their own grandfather and great grandfather, and basically your family tree is one leaf.

**** Yeah... it's getting to the point where I might not be able to continue on unfortunately. I really liked the beginning though. I liked the idea that somehow Voldemort coming back in time and showing Tom some attention actually managed to make him into a compassionate guy (despite all things suggesting the opposite would happen). I had big hopes for a Tom that treats Hagrid and kittens with kindness lol. But yeah, writing that out now seems pretty naively optimistic. Whoops! The author is still really talented though!

  A strange man adopts Tom Riddle and it is not his father, as Tom desperately wants to believe. Stranded in the past, Voldemort once again comes to the conclusion he's the only one he truly needs.

Harry x Hermione/Ginny/Luna/Snape/Voldemort/Malfoy (Both of them)/Bellatrix

A marriage between the two can only end up in a divorce, or one of them being repressed.

**** Agreed. I don't actually hate either character either. Like you said, they don't mesh. JK Rowling said herself in an interview after all the books were released that she regretted the pairing. They are just too different in fundamental ways to make the pairing plausible. Long term there marriage would just never be able to withstand there so different personalities. Like you said, it's too much arguing. I don't see the chemistry at all.

Also true about Hermione not putting her life on hold. She deserves someone who also doesn't want kids, or just to be on her own. She deserves happiness and I'm not convinced she would ever have it wholly with children. I feel like she would be resentful to them, because she would constantly be thinking of the things she could be doing. The advancements in magic she could be discovering or the adventures in far off lands she could have. I've never really considered this opinion before but now that you say it, I find it to feel so right for Hermione. It just clicks. She started off as this character that only wanted to follow the rules and blossomed into this independent badass witch who as you said, now I wholeheartedly agree: doesn't need a man (or woman, as the case may be), in her life to feel fulfilled and content.

** Student/teacher relationships, incest, and relationships where one of the characters becomes the step parent of a classmate are all hard passes for me. Even if they aren't the main pairing in the fic. I don't normally read m/m stories because I'm a she/her bi so it's meh for me. If it's not the main pairing and a side couple then it's not an issue.

Also if the characters get together and it's justified via bashing. I like Harmony as a ship in general, but so many Harmony fics are Weasley bash heavy. Or at the very least lots of Ron bashing.

** When i first started reading fanfiction i got really into harry/voldemort, and i used to absolutely love it because of how ‘romantic' it was for harry to forgive voldemort for killing literally everyone he cared about and hundreds of other people too, or how they ‘shared souls' because VOLDEMORT MADE HARRY A HORCRUX!?? but now looking back i've realised how messed up the pairing is.

I can now only read harry/voldemort if it is major AU, like the train to nowhere by MayMarlow or Consuming shadows by Child_OTKW (go check them out if you want to).

Anything that follows canon with harry/voldemort makes me want to throw up sometimes, especially with how their relationship ends up because voldemort CAN LITERALLY NOT FEEL LOVE and thinks of Harry as a possession he can own, and acts like it as well, as they always use he always does weird power plays or the repetitive 'prove that you love me' . It's awful to see people romanticising a relationship as messed up as that as most of the time it is literally a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship.

So yeah, no Harry/Voldemort for me

I guess I am just not the happiest in seeing Harry slowly compromise all of his good principles because Tom is being charming and Harry is thirsty for 50 year old men. You could at least pair him up with 17 year old Riddle, and have Harry gradually convert him over to being a good person, but nooo, it's always Harry X 50 year old man who has crucio'd him multiple times and literally (in most stories) killed one or more of his parents.

While it's plot relevant, because Tom's beauty is a large part of his brand of sociopathic charm, and the halo effect from attractive people works even on people who aren't sexually attracted to you, this sort of thing makes it really easy to queer Harry Potter, because you can read the whole thing as a sort of fucked up sexual awakening for a poor queer kid who doesn't have the time for teenage exploration.

** I personally dislike any fic where the author has decided to include lgbt characters then has all their characters act like its a totally normal accepted thing in a society stuck in the 18th century. I know it's not a specific paring, it's just the kind of pairings that really annoys me. The especially bad offenders are Harry/Draco and anything involving Snape as many authors try to excuse the problems with their views by portraying the magical word as a perfect paradise that is somehow beautifully antiquated and massively progressive at the same time.

Obviously not a historian but weren't the ancient greeks pretty cool with gay people? And by modern standards, they are pretty antiquated socially in other areas.

**** check out the old greek myths.

tons of gay sex.

though in the greek myths, you tended to have a wife and then a boy lover.

yes boy not man.

the greeks had views on what is acceptable in their culture and that view is a bit icky.

I might be wrong, but I belive the roman view on it. it is fine to have gay sex if you where the dominant one

I also have heard the quote some where. women are for children men are for pleasure

but I could not tell you if that is a real quote or a made up one

*** I get why you'd dislike this, but at the same time not everyone wants to read a story where people are being oppressed for being gay. Personally as long as you can explain it I don't care. (Plus, weren't several societies in the ancient past accepting of gay people to an extent anyway?)

** Harry and Hermione, this feels like incest to me and also so much Weasley Bashing in these fics, which is huge turn off. Any fics with Dark super powerful Harry or Hermione. There's no Ron fic like this. Dumbledore bashing, Weasley Bashing. Snape pairing with Harry, Hermione or even Lily. Draco and Hermione ship, any Hermione ship which isn't Ronmione. I know wolfstar is a big fan favourite but I rather like them as uncles who have a life of their own for Harry, and most keep calling Harry cub or some other wolf pet names which is really cringy to me. Mcgonagall and Dumbledore, or Voldemort!!
