I've always been a big fan of vampire stories, particularly ones with very old vampires that have experienced a lot of history and participated in events in the past. Are there any vampire Harry stories or stories where Harry gets raised/trained/befriends old vampires? Or any vampires really. I'm okay with crossovers as well, but not a huge fan of sparkly vamps lol any pairings or slash is fine.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

  The bonds of blood hid Harry Potter from those who wished to harm him. Unfortunately, foreign dark wizard Joachim Petri had no idea who Harry Potter even was. A wizard "rescues" a clueless Harry Potter from the Dursleys, but not all wizards are good people. Eventually Necromancer!Harry, Master of Death!Harry, no pairings.

  Fem!Harry. Harry didn't know what a vampire was. Was it any wonder she thought drinking blood was normal? Rated T for insinuated graphical images. No longer a one-shot.

** linkffn(Valeriana Natassa) is fantastic. Only 3 chapters but the chapter are /huge/, it's at 93k words. Well written and the chapters are each like small stories on their own, so even though it updates slowly, you don't get that unfinished feeling reading it. Also, the vampire is super old and has lots of experience. After the first chapter, her life is explored in detail.

  Harry strikes a deal with a vampire and ends up getting far more than he had expected... (Canon compliant till the end of the fifth book but with a whole bunch of invented back story. How much do we know about Potterverse vampires, after all?) No slash, potential Dumbledore bashing, kickass vampire!

** The only good vampire fic I've ver read: [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/5185][Forver Knight by DeliverMeFromEve]]

Incidentally it's also one of my favorite fics. It has some great OCs and interesting Vampire Lore. Though it's borderline pornography for the first few chapters... and the original HP magic is relatively understated in a lot of ways, I guess to give the Vampires something to do.

Speaking Hellsing Abridged, linkffn(Best Served Cold) the later chapters have Harry as Alucard's walk partner. Mayhem ensues.

In my own fic, linkffn(A World Unseen: Vol II) The Ghoul Studies Professor is a vampire named Abraham Alucard Trocar. (He was Stoker's muse.)

  Unexpected time travel can provide endless hours of entertainment...if you do it right. Under any other circumstances Harry would have done everything in his power to set things right the Gryffindor way. Too bad he's learned a lot since that final battle. Meet the biggest prankster in the Ministry's dreaded Audit department, and with one heck of a grudge to grind!
