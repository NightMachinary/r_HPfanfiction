I follow a few fanfiction communities, and the HP community seems to have the most fascination for the anti-heroes or downright villains like Malfoy, Snape or Riddle. In particular, they seem to be very often included in pairings with the heroes of the franchise. To be clear: I'm wondering about the disproportionate amount of fanfiction compared to other fandoms, this isn't to diss these characters.


** Anti-heroes are everywhere in popular works from Wolverine to Holden Caulfield. The bad boy or the curmudgeon forced into something he would normally rail against. You can even see Carl from "Up" as an anti-hero.

One of the driving forces for characters in fiction is change. How does our hero change over the course of the story?

When you look at Harry, he changes a lot from a little boy bewildered by this magical world he's been plopped into to a confident powerful young man fulfilling his destiny. Looking at Draco, there's not a lot of change there. He starts out and stays a sniveling shit with practically no redemption in canon. This leaves a void to be filled by eager fan fiction writers. A chance for redemption for the writer's favorite bad boy. This also plays out with turning Harry Dark. Light, powerful, happy Harry is boring. Dark, powerful, brooding Harry is exciting!

I'm not involved in any other fandoms apart from HP these days, so I don't know if the anti-hero thing in the HP fandom is disproportionate, but if you look, you'll see them everywhere.

** I've always assumed it was something to do with the general demographics of who writes and reads fanfiction. At least when I first got into fanfiction as a teenager, I was super into edgy, angsty anti-heroes. So I assume its something similar for the those who got into the fandom. It's interesting to watch an author over a long period of time, because from my own anecdotal experience, they tend to move away from the angst and anti-hero focus.

Now this is just my own personal theory, but I think a lot of writers like to try to "redeem" some characters in some manner, to justify their like or attraction to one of the characters. There are so many fanfics that have the cliche "Oh I was an evil douchebag just to fool everyone, I actually am a super good person" and that just writes itself as an anti-hero and I think that has to do alot with it.

Its also good to remember that that fanfiction is alot of peoples first major efforts at creative writing and most people will tend to imitate things they like in these attempts. And I think it's much easier to write an anti-hero than a proper hero, since there is a whole lot more leeway with characterization.

Counterpoint: This is, to some extent, /necessary/ for fleshing out a character, because [[http://lesswrong.com/lw/i0/are_your_enemies_innately_evil/][nobody believes themselves to be the villain]], and (metaphorical) comic-book villains are therefore ridiculously unrealistic.

**** Rebuttal: that isn't fleshing the Character out, it's answering for all their bad actions like cold blooded murder, racism, sexism, bigotry, genocidal actions, torture and other things that would violate a person's human rights with "But my parents didn't love me so I get to do all this, say sorry and get to be a good guy... Plus I got abs" Draco doesn't get fleshed out but gets rewritten from a sniveling coward into a man with a nigh indomitable will who has a back story extremely similar to Harry only without having to wear rags.

**** You are correct in that. Villains that aren't grounded in reality or have understandable motivations aren't compelling characters. And in a "villain" focused fanfiction, giving them a understandable motivation and backstory is a tenet of a good story.

But my point rather isnt that villains shouldn't be compelling, it's how authors tend to excuse characters. For example, Draco is "redeemed" from his sexism, bigotry, and vileness as being misunderstood, confused, or scared of his father. And not that that isn't a good motivation, but it's done very weakly, tries to have their cake and eat it too, or even just doesn't follow the characters own logic. It isn't that writing a villain is bad, it's that a lot of the attempts in redeeming a character seem more like wanton impulses than actual character arcs and motivations.

It isn't that villains are always bad characters, it's that too often in fanfiction, people don't understand how to write a logical, compelling antihero/redeemed villain. At least that's the crux of my argument.

** Nowdays, I like to read fanfic that is somewhat different than canon. So it's more interesting to read about antiheroes or villains because there is so much that we don't know or can only speculate about.

Afaik, in the Star Wars franchise, there are some people who contend that the Empire did nothing wrong. It's a different perspective that's thought-provoking in some ways.

Like others have said, redemption plots are very popular because bad->good is way more fun to read than good->winning.

In the HP canon, Snape is presented as nuanced. Reading through the first few books, there can be a few interpretations of why he did something. I don't think Draco was truly redeemed; he seemed to develop some sort of conscience halfway through HBP. And Riddle is interesting because his backstory brings up so many questions regarding nature vs. nurture and whether or not his rise to evil could have been prevented by any number of factors.

** Anti-heroes and interesting flawed characters are fine. The problem is that Draco is neither of these things, and I do not understand why people like him. Draco is an annoying piece of shit and doesn't go through any sort of redemption, he just gets terrified at the modus operandi of the Death Eaters, after eagerly awaiting it for years. Come on, are you telling me he wasn't aware they tortured and killed people? The guy wouldn't give a shit if mudbloods got murdered, unless he was doing the murdering. I can accept Snape being a decent person somewhere deep-down, but with Draco it would take very strong character development. However, most fics just start out with him already being a decent person who got put into a hard spot, and hey he's also totally in love with Hermione. Yeah, pull the other one.

The only good Draco story I've read is Turn by Sara's Girl, and that's mostly because it's well-written and uncommonly good slash. Still, it takes quite a bit of suspension of disbelief.

*** Yeah, I just can't buy the Draco is a Good Guy Deep Down™ story. His most defining traits are his spinelessness, his stupidity and his racism. If you take those away, he's not actually Draco, you may aswell create an OC (or use Theo Nott. */Why don't people do this???/*).

If Draco had mentioned offhand that he wasn't friends with Blaise because he was black, there wouldn't be 1/10th the amount of these stories, and yet, when he spends the whole series wishing death upon Hermione because she's muggleborn, it just means he secretly likes her.

He's essentially Dudley Dursley with magic and racism.

*** While I do agree with you that redemption fics for Draco are usually lacking, in canon he is not fundamentally evil: he is a child, paroting what his father said, raised to be arrogant, who lives in a fantasy where the good and powerfull pure-blood protect society from the evil muggles, their magic-stealing spawns and the defiler of his culture. While having him shedding his whole upraising like an old shirt is unbelieveable, it is possible to have him leaving the fantasy his father teached him through years 5-7.\\

****** I'm not impressed with Voldemort either. Canon Voldemort hardly expressed much competence beyond raw destructive combat power. He was compulsive obsessive, refused good advice, and only relied on fear and terror. So he was basically another typical monolithically evil Hollywood cartoon villain.

Dumbledore could have easily killed off best of his supporters in the DoM and derailed his plan by who knows how long. But of course, the 'good guys' must not kill or they might sink as low as their enemies! Even with 'good guys' fighting with both their hands tied behind their backs, this guy barely managed to hang onto power of a medium sized country for 10 months, before being overthrown by mostly teenagers. He got killed when trying to take back a high school.

On the other hand, he was a genocidal maniac without a shred of redeeming qualities. His leadership style was so unsustainable that he was betrayed by multiple inner circle members. He mutilated his own soul to the point that he was permanently suffering from compulsive-obsessive disorders and extremely poor decision making skills. In the end, his own foolishness (for example the excessive reliance on Avada Kedavra) got him killed and he was sent to rot in hell forever.

--------------

The pre-Horcrux Tom Riddle, however, could be far more interesting. I often wondered how much more he would have achieved if he had just followed more 'conventional' routes to power.

But then again, I like to view Hermione as the good version of Tom Riddle, and that's part of the reasons she is by far my favorite character.

To me a Draco, who does terrible things and repents and builds a family is 10x as interesting than a Harry who never does wrong or if he does its omce because plot and he has to have a flaw.

Then for dark crazy or pure evil villians we have to ask why and how? How did they get that way, and why do they make the decisions they do? Does Voldemort have a soft side? Or is he the madman the entire time?

*** Going back into fandom history archives, there seem to have been fans of Snape before the movies came out (I think I came across some posts dated 99-00). A lot of the rationale seemed to have to do with Snape's "protective nature" of the Trio (searching for them when he thought they were in danger/trouble in the first 3 books). After the fourth book, rich!pureblood!Snape tended to feature in fanfic, which lasted until OotP.

As for Draco, in Chamber, some fans thought he was weighed down by the expectations of his father (based on that one scene in Borgin and Burkes). Some interpreted the whole Hippogriff saga as a cry for attention. Ofc, based on the end of the series, these interpretations aren't entirely true. But he did become a sympathetic figure in HBP with the bathroom and tower scene.

Based on anecdotal evidence, Snape fans tend to be middle age women, and Draco fans tend to be teenagers. However, Daphne fans and harem/multi fans tend to be men/teens. Obviously this isn't the case for everyone, but demographics clearly play a role in what someone likes.

He was ordered to do something way out of his league as a way for Voldemort to punish his parents. While Draco is confident and boastful in the beginning of HBP, he's overwhelmed and terrified in the last two scenes. Even Dumbledore noticed that Draco lacked the intrinsic will to kill him before the other Death Eaters showed up.

Before HBP, Draco is really annoying and presented with a "non-weak" personality. There is some complexity added to his character in HBP, which can make him more sympathizable depending on the interpretation

I like seeing them overcome their flaws, I like seeing reasons for the way they are. The world isn't black and white and I feel like it's nice to see things from another perspective where even bad people may have good qualities and reasons for being the way they are.

Plus, for characters like Snape I just love his sarcasm, cynism and intelligence. I also like the more slytherin approach to problems, breaking rules when needed, using subtle manipulation and careful planning vs. rushing straight into battle head on.
