I mostly read Drarry/Dramione, but I want to start reading Marauders fics and don't know where to start! What are some good ones Please let me know the classics, the favorites, the long ones, slashfics, ANYTHING Marauders!


** Start with [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10057010/chapters/22409387][All the Young Dudes]], it's a classic and it actually merits it.

It's Wolfstar-centric (Sirius/Remus) and goes from their first year all the way til OOTP. It diverts from canon in Remus' backstory but otherwise it's canon-compliant and the divergence actually adds a ton to the story. It also has one of my favourite OCs in fanfic.

Don't be frightened by the high word count. I promise it's worth it.

  What Sirius told Harry about running away from home left a lot out. Here we find out what happened when he ran, why he ran, and the things that developed after. This is an AU fic, originally posted on FanFiction, ongoing and revised. Read, enjoy, comment. No Slash, angsty and dark.

** If you like Dramione you definitely should try Fall Through Time linkffn(11379882). Draco and Hermione time travel back in time so it's both Marauder Era and Dramione. It's quite detailed and characters' and relationship' get realistic development.

There's also The Last Marauder linkffn(8233539). It's Remus/Hermione and though I wasn't fan of all the plot lines (including actually making Remus/Hermione end game), there was a lot of things I remember liking -- Hermione has interesting relationship with Sirius and Slytherins/Death Eaters who's not whitewashed nor made cartoonishly evil; Lily for once is written as a realistic teenage girl who has her flaws (there's absolutely no bashing, she's just not an instantly likable saint she's in many fics).

  "In the last twenty-four hours, Draco Malfoy's life was flipped upside down. Not only was everything he'd ever known gone, but now the only person he had to rely on, hated him with every fibre in her being. Draco Malfoy was stuck in the past with none other than Hermione Jean Granger." Dramione. Non-canon. (Remione included.)

** Since you read Drarry and Dramione, I assume you're a fan of enemies-to-lovers. While I don't have a Jily fic to recommend since I don't read that ship myself, I believe you'd probably like fics focusing on that ship, given that James and Lily wasn't exactly on friendly terms during the earlier years. I can, however, recommend some non-Jily Marauder-era fics.

I recently read linkao3(Hero of the Story) which I liked a lot. It's Hermione/James, portrays Hermione as Peter Pettigrew's sibling (he doesn't become his canon self in this fic, but we see the clear seeds towards how it could have happened in canon). The fic sees her get close with the Marauders and a couple of Slytherins, which makes the fic stand out to me since fics usually only focus on the Marauders, or only the Slytherins, while painting the other group as the bad guys. This fic avoids that, without excusing the poor decisions that the major Slytherins people focused on has done or is doing, nor excusing the very real bullying that the Marauders did during the early years. My biggest gripe with it is that Hermione is a bit of a Mary Sue in the fic at times.
