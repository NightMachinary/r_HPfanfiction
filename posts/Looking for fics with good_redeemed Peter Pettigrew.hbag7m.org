The only fic with a decent characterization of Peter Pettigrew that I've seen is the promise series. What are some good fics where Peter never defects to the death eaters or redeems himself later on?


** Well, there's Sarah1282's [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8669569/1/Don-t-Waste-It][/Don't Waste It/]], which is two-chapter Peggy-Sue fic starring Peter Pettigrew.

*** Okay, now seems like a good time to ask. Wtf exactly does Peggy Sue mean? I see it a lot on here. I know what Mary Sue means, of course.

TL;DR:

A character is given a chance to go back and relive their life, with their current knowledge. Like any number of fics where Harry is sent back to his 11-year-old body just before Hogwarts with the knowledge of the future, such as /Oh God, Not Again/ by the same author; or, for a more serious take, /Nightmares of Future Past/ by S'Tarkan.

***** Thanks! Very familiar with this trope. Just never knew it was called that. It must be a new thing. I just got back into fanfiction fairly recently. Last time I was really into it was 2013. Knew a lot of those fics then, but I don't think people called it Peggy Sue then. Could've just been oblivious, of course.

****** I'm afraid it's probably the latter, as the term was certainly being used back then.

******* That actually makes sense. I was more about just reading the fics then, not so much getting involved with the community. Usually just sorted by favorites/kudos or sometimes looked at an author's favorites. This whole recommendation/request thing is quite the innovation for me!

******** Considering there's over 800,000 fanfics for /Harry Potter/(not counting crossovers), on FFN alone, sometimes its the only way to separate the wheat from the chaff is to get recommendations.

********* I quite agree. Incidentally, we are lucky to have such an incredible offering. Most fanfiction is garbage, it has to be said, but if even 5% of the HP library is worth reading, that's still /40 thousand stories/ for cripes sake. I haven't even scratched the surface. No other fandom is anywhere near that fertile.

  Sooner or later, every character gets their shot at a second chance. This is Peter Pettigrew's. He may not deserve it but he certainly wasn't happy with how things ended up. The only question was how to get a better future without having to possess the kind of bravery that the lack of had sent him running to Voldemort in the first place...

** linkffn(The Forsaken Fidelius) is off to an interesting start, though it hasn't updated in a few months. It's basically following canon events, but completely reinterpreting Peter's behavior.

  Peter would die to protect James and Lily. But Lord Voldemort won't make the choice that easy for him.

  What if Peter had come to his senses before everyone's lives had been ruined? What would have happened then? Rating is for safety.
