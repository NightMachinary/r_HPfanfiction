** I like it. I'm about to finish book 5 but I think it focuses way too much on magic and stuff than the characters and there too many child prodigies for my liking (Alec, Aidan, Albus, Lucas, Rose). The plot twists are good but some are a bit predictable and the OCs are interesting and believable (Desulgon, Wilcox, Exo, Eftan). They're all complex. It introduces new things too and they're all believable and they fit easily into canon.

Overall, I like it and I highly recommend it.

** Honestly, this series was incredible. I wouldn't mind reading it multiple times. It gives me so much nostalgia because it reminds me of the Percy Jackson series.

**** Oh yeah, I definitely wouldn't judge the series based on the movies, haha. It's been a little while since I've read the books, but I think that if you like Harry Potter, you may like that series as well. However I would like to point out that the tone is definitely a lot more playful than HP. Also, if you've read Homer or other epic poetry, the theme of a long quest with many trials will stand out as a very prominent part of the entire series, which makes it quite entertaining and exciting in my opinion. This is why I think the Albus Potter series that the OP recommended reminds me of the Percy Jackson series.

***** Oh, thanks! =)

I know that Harry and Percy are similar in personality except that Percy is funnier and more extroverted. I also heard about the playful style of writing.

I've never actually watched the movies but I heard that they were too awful.

Again, thanks! I'll definitely check them out once the Harry Potter obsession had died down a bit. I've honestly only read the Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children series after the books and I can't get through another book. Everything seems too...boring in comparison to Harry Potter. I don't know, maybe it's because it's the first series that I truly got invested in.

*** The author admits that Albus is a Gary Stu but he starts becoming a bully and a jerk in book three. Everybody calls him 'perfect little Albus Potter' as a nod to his Gary Stuness. He's also too nosy.

The first book was slow but it gets better. I think it's because of all the child prodigies and Desulgon is ridiculously OP but he serves a better role later. I was honestly surprised by him. He was/is my fav.

** Eh, in my honest opinion, it tries too hard. Nearly every Chapter has some form of exposition in it that they couldn't let you know with flashbacks (why wasn't first Chapter the Duel with Inget so we didn't just get Harry giving exposition about everything?)

Next there are the annoyingly over specific descriptions and the annoying lack of creativity. It tries too hard with the whole 'new cool' wand things, to the point where it got annoying after Albus' sorting.

There is no tension, no build up, no reasoning, just spontaneous moments.

*** Same. I think I read 2 and a half books, and then I just couldn't do it anymore. I really like the idea of the Muggle World finding out about wizards, but it just sort of happened...and it wasn't as exciting as I would have thought. Plus, Albus was annoying. Gotta give the author props, though; he wrote seven books and FINISHED them. Not many authors do that.

P.S. Also, I like your flair. Not sure if it's a reference to the new John Green book or the infinite regress problem, but still cool either way.

** I look at it this way. I have to decide the stories to read and the ones that not good. The best way is the Favs and Follow numbers. They, in my mind, is the best way to see good stories. If a story, after 3, 4, 6, 8 years, has only 200-400-600 Favs or Follows, there is a reason most time. So in this case NoahPhantom published book 1 of his series on Oct,2012. that's 4.5 years ago and he has Favs:467 and Follows:229. And that is his best one, the other's have very low numbers.

Book 2 Favs:268, Follows:134, Book 3 Favs:300, Follows:192, Book 4 Favs:308, Follows:220, Book 5 Favs:227, Follows:188 Book 6 Favs:203, Follows:168, Book 7 Favs:226, Follows:280.

I admire that you like NoahPhantom and his series so must, but in my mind there are more series and stories to read first.

I am not interested in next gen nor any of the other stories with a tertiary canon character as a primary focus as the stories are inevitably an OC set in the Potterverse. I also will probably never read Alexandra Quick for the same reason.

There are many good stories that never gained a following or the buzz needed to make them popular. The lack of popularity isn't necessarily a comment on the quality of the fic, nor is the inverse true. Enjoy what you enjoy.
