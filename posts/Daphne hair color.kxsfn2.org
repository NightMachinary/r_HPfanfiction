Why in some fanfics daphnes has dark hair


** Daphne appears just once in the entire series and is just a name:

#+begin_quote
  Hermione's name was called. Trembling, she left the chamber with Anthony Goldstein, Gregory Goyle and Daphne Greengrass.
#+end_quote

-/Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix/, ch 31.

There's no mention of how Daphne looks (or even which house she's in). So she's basically a blank slate.

** Her hair colour isn't stated in canon. It's popular to give her blonde hair as part of the Ice Queen trope, but it's not at all necessary. In two fanfictions I've written involving Daphne, I gave her dark hair, mostly just to be contrarian.

It's worth noting that in an old essay on Harry and his 39 classmates, called /Secrets of the Classlist/, it's explained that the Greengrass surname implies a particular location (East Anglia) and ancestry (Anglo-Saxon), which fits the blonde-hair stereotype.

** Some people assumed a background character from the Order of the Phoenix movie is Daphne, who just so happens to be blonde. This has never been confirmed (and doesn't matter regardless) but people originated the idea from there and ran with it, and it then intersected with the Ice Queen trope.

That's why she is normally seen as blonde. But since she has no canon hair colour (and her sister, Astoria, was depicted with darker hair in DH part 2) some also like to give her a different hair colour.

** Because the actress who played Astoria has dark hair.

** My preferred Daphne Greengrass in linkffn(3912184;4236594) is dark-haired and orphan. It really doesn't matter.
