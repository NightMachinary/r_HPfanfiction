There was a Lich, Werewolves, Vampires and tons others that love Harry and raise him as their communal child basically. I read the fic a couple of months ago but I completely forgot what its called.

  What if the horcrux in Harry's scar hadn't quite been as contained by the Blood Wards as Dumbledore planned. Rather than twisting Harry's personality, it darkened his aura. And the dark creatures of the magical world really liked that aura. Gee. Sucks to be a Dark Lord trying to make your comeback. VERY AU. Just for fun.
