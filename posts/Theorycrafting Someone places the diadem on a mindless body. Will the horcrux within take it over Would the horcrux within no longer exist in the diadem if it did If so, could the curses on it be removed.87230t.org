** I see where you're going. You're wondering whether you can dehorcrux the Diadem by having the soul possess someone who's been Kissed.

Well... I would say that Voldecrown could, nay, /would/ possess someone who tried wearing the Diadem, but that doesn't unmake the Horcrux; like with Diarymort and the Diary, his life would still be tied to the object, and destroying the object would be necessary to kill /him/.

*** Agreed. Crucially I believe that the body needs to have a soul - from what Voldemort said in CoS, he needed to "feed" on Ginny's soul to gain the strength to possess her body. It's not something he was able to do right from the moment she picked it up.

A soulless body like a Dementor victim would not have any soul to "feed" the horcrux the strength it needs to possess things.

I don't think that's quite right. There were two processes at play: at first, he possessed her body, for which he needed to build up trust between them. Then he tried to magically create a body of his own, and /that/ was what he was seeping Ginny's lifeforce for.

***** The way Diary!Riddle explains it definitely presents it as a single continuous process, where him being able to create his own body using her lifeforce is the culmination of a progressive, gradual process:

#+begin_quote
  “If I say it myself, Harry, I've always been able to charm the people I needed. *So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted... I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets.* I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her...”

  ...

  “So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. *But there isn't much life left in her... She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last*... I have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew you'd come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.”
#+end_quote

Emphasis mine. It's clear from what he's saying that the building of trust by giving of secrets is the same thing as feeding him her soul - another example of HP magic taking figurative language literally.

****** Hm, you're probably right. Still, there's probably an additional bit of magic at play during that confrontation; possessing someone doesn't /naturally/ lead to a disembodied soul forming itself a new body, or else in First Year the whole Quirrelmort thing would have gone very differently.

****** Right, but mindless =/= soulless necessarily. That might be what OP meant, but someone who is essentially brain dead in a comatose state could probably still fit what OP was talking about. The soul would still be there (I guess??) but the mind would be gone.

I don't think a brain dead comatose patient would necessarily be a good fit for the diadem but... I guess that would depend on what a writer wants to do.

No, that is not the definition.

This is the actual text that says what a horcrux does:

"used to conceal parts of his soul"

"Once created, the Horcruxes make the wizard immortal as long as they remain intact"

nowhere is it written that a soul needs to remain inside to continue to function.

imo if the diary was successful in resurrecting voldemort the diary itself would have continued to be a horcrux despite the original soul piece no longer being inside of it.

The role of a horcrux is to hold that soul piece. If it no longer holds a soul piece, it's not a horcrux. It's no different from a milk jug, especially as that milk jug also is used to sell water, juices, and more. It's just a jug.

** I think there has too be an exchange. Ginny poured her soul into the diary with the writing, the trio experienced sadness while wearing the locket (which was indirect contact and not nearly as effective as the diary). If you placed it on a mindless body it would do nothing as the body couldn't give anything for it to exchange or use.

** That's an interisting question, one that I don't think can be answered with canon facts. The only point of reference we have is Ginny and the diary. Ginny had to write her worries and, if Voldemort is to be believed, pour her soul into the diary for him to gain her life force. How that would relate to a mindless body is hard to say, but I would guess that it'll not be necessary (kind of like he possessed a consenting Quirell).\\
On the other hand, with the diary he reappeared as his own body from the time he made the Horcrux and Ginny would have died had he been successful. I assume the soul piece that was in the Horcrux would then be in the new body, making the Horcrux free of his magic. If that means it'll be destroyed or returned to its original condition I couldn't begin to guess
