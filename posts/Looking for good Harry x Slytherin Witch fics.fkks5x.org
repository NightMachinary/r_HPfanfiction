Looking for some real good Harry x Slytherin Witch works.

They can be with any Slytherin Witch, though I don't often see many Pansy, Tracey or other witches(OCs). I would be really interested in ones that aren't with Daphne, but I still like those.

Please no OP or Evil Harry - I'll take as many recs as you all can give, have the time to pass!

** When I hear Harry x Slytherin Witch, my mind just reads Harry x Witch. I think if your going to do a slytherin flic right with a witch you need to read the one where he leaves his brother at hogwarts and quits to transfer to durmstrang. His family is distant for sure but that Harry x Calypso story is really witch gritty. !Dark, full of Romance(i think).

I think that story sets the bar for what I want to see in a good Harry x Slytherin flic. They need to take the girl and make her unique and see how much they can really form the story around what she is about. Something more deep and complex than just. Oh look at my cold mask, your cute can you melt it? I think !Dark stories make it easier. Its true the abondoned and ill treated end up in the snake quarters. Use that back story to your advantage.

I don't even know why im writing this i don't think you asked for my opinion. I'll post something I gave at least a 7/10 to.\\

*** No that's perfect! I dislike the ones where he instantly melts away the coldness that's accumulated for years and years. If you have any more that fit such criteria, please share them!

edit; I definitely looked up that Harry x Calypso too - I would love more similar to it if you have them!

Thank you very much for the fic rec!
