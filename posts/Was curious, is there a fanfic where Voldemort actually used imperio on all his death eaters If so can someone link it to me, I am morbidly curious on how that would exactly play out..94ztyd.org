#+TITLE: Was curious, is there a fanfic where Voldemort actually used imperio on all his death eaters? If so can someone link it to me, I am morbidly curious on how that would exactly play out.

** Possibly the inverse of canon? Rather than various Death Eaters (MacNair, Malfoy, Carrow, Nott, etc) getting out of prosecution by claiming they were Imperiused, maybe they really were Imperiused but a rapid Barty Crouch Sr. doesn't believe it or accept it as an excuse?

I suppose there's also the various other possible forms of bewitchment as well. Confundus charms, love potions, Polyjuiced doppelgangers...and there's that obvious victims of the Imperius (people being Imperiused to slaughter their own family and friends, Aurors in battle being Imperiused to turn on their partners, et-cetera) tend not to leave witnesses alive. The existence of the Imperius curse could potentially be a not-well-known thing; maybe it was only realised that Voldemort and the Death Eaters used it, after the first war was over.
