The fic had a brewing romance between Harry and Daphne, but Draco threatens harm to Daphne's family and she gives him up to Voldemort.

I also vaguely remember her leading him to Hogsmeade, bit thats it.

*** Crap. I started reading this (on Chapter 2) and I am not sure if I want to continue. Does it work out for them as a couple? Feel free to PM me.

**** you should keep reading because its a interesting take on a common trope in fanfiction but it gets quite dark and their relationship is a main plot point, but it definitely isn't a romance story like the Genre states.
