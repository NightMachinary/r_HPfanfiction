I've read some HP/xmen crossovers and really enjoyed some of them. Im hoping to find a few more. Harry can be a mutant or not, I'm not super picky. Can have slash or bashing or pretty much anything as long as the X-Men have a prominent role. Bonus points if Harry goes to Xaviers School for Gifted Youngsters. Super bonus points for fics with Kitty Pryde and/or Nightcrawler.

  Rescued from the Negative Zone by the Fantastic Four, Harry Potter discovers he is a mutant and decides to take up the cause of equality between mutants and humans (among other causes). How will a dimensionally displaced Harry Potter, one who is extremely intelligent, proactive and not afraid to get his hands dirty effect the marvel universe? Pairings: Harry/Jean/Ororo/others pos.

***** It has smut, but I wouldn't call it a smutty fic. It's an incredibly small percentage of the content.

** I really like these. They're all complete.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11083509/1/][A Very Special Muggle]] by dri-dri93 Kurt had no idea how he'd ended up in this lantern-filled hallway with paintings that seemed to watch his every move. He'd only been trying to do some recon on an old Scottish ruin. OR: A short conversation about Blue-Skinned Honklesnorts, Apparating, and how normal "weird" really is to a wizard.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10072556/1/][Freak Like Me]] by black.k.kat A bout of accidental magic takes Harry Potter, all of six, to Munich Circus. There he meets a boy with blue skin and a similar talent. Freaks stick together, right? Slash.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7748339/1/][The Boy Next Door]] by nacomah Slash Harry/Pyro. Magneto receives a tip that a powerful young mutant lives on Privet Drive. Posing as a family, Magneto, Mystique, and Pyro become convinced that their neighbor, Harry Potter, is the mutant they're looking for.

[[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/7123916/1/][Mutant Son]] by nacomah SLASH non-graphic. The Order discovers that Voldemort has an heir, a mutant named St. John Allerdyce. They bring him back to Headquarters where he meets the boy wonder. A relationship develops made more dangerous by the vicious war of which both are a part.

** [[http://web.archive.org/web/20080308011248/http://www.themedicinewheel.net/series/computer.html][The Room with the Computer]](link goes to the fic on the Wayback Machine) is a crossover with the X-Men movie-verse. Following the death of Jean Grey, Scott Summers takes up the post as Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. Other X-Men also appear in certain chapters.

Not a very grand or action-packed fic, but worth it for the look at the differences between wizards and mutants... and for the epilogue, where Arthur Weasley gets a ride in the X-Jet.

The problem with X-men/Harry Potter crossovers is that there are barely any that are both complete and good. Most are either abandoned or poorly written.

  Agent Harry Potter is a menace, Logan's sure of it. It doesn't matter that he's absolutely charming, or that he smells like almonds. So does cyanide. COMPLETE.
