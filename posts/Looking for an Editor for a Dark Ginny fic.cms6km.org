Hi, I'm working on a story with a dark Ginny and I need an editor. I write frequently, so updates will come bi-weekly.

** I'd do it although it depends on how you write.

You might want to change the flair though.

*** It's a slytherin ginny's POV on book 2-7. Diary tom convinces her to help him get back a body; along the way they have to fight voldemort.

Oh and along the way Ginny goes from nice girl to dark witch.

**** Interesting. Will the Harry/Voldemort plot play out similar to canon (Sirius, Triwizard, Umbridge, Dumbledore dead, Horcrux hunt?) or will the plot be completely different (Harry killed in the chamber?)

***** The book plots happen at the same time as the ginny and her crew are running around doing there things, sometimes those stories will collide like in the case f surius and other times theyll be further in the background

****** How's the CoS plot going to end? Harry obviously won't stab the diary if Tom ends up surviving, what will happen instead? Will another student be framed for the attacks?

******* I have a plan for that. But I can't spoil the twist without revealing who the big bad is and the premise of the book

**** Interesting, have you considered them merging their powers and personalities into a single new character (still called Ginny)?

***** I was thinking of doing an alternate end where ginny and tom's personalities become so in sync that that happens, but for the original story I have another plan

** People have already offered you help but I would be very interested and more importantly invested in such a project too. Whatever you decide, I'll certainly keep on the lookout for it whenever it comes.
