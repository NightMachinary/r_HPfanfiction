I want to see your best fics that tell of the marauders time at hogwarts. Which one got you hooked on that specific type of fic and which ones have you read since then that you would recommend?


** All the Young Dudes is definitely my favorite marauders era fic, I might even say it's my favorite HP fic.

It spends most of the book in Hogwarts but towards the end it sorta speeds after James and Lily dies all the way up to PoA.

It's slash though (Remus Lupin/Sirius Black) so if that isn't your thing you might want to skip this one.

** I've recommended it a few times recently, and I'm going to continue to do so because it's one of my favourites. linkffn(James Potter and the Sword of Gryffindor)

And I just started rereading linkffn(The Teachers' Notebook) and remember enjoying it quite a bit for how it portrayed the teachers' thoughts when the Marauders were in school.

  Inside this story you will find the chronicles of the 7 years of torture the staff of Hogwarts had to endure, from their point of view, due to 4 boys. That's right. None other than James Potter, Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew.

** It's a lot AU but linkffn(One Step Forward, Two Decades Back) is awesome. Hermione gets sent back to Marauders era by Ron using a spell on her and she ends up as Sirius's sister and completely changes things for the Marauders, Severus and pretty much every other character. It does have the Dumbledore is evil trope thing but in a way I hadn't seen before.
