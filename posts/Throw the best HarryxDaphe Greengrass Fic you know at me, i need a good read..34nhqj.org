** I'm a fairly big Harry/Daphne fan, I can give you a few of the popular ones that I've read and enjoyed. Here we go:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5244813/1/A-Champion-s-New-Hope][A Champion's New Hope]]- Beginning during the Goblet of Fire, Harry looks to different friends for support after both Ron and Hermione refuse to believe that he did not put his name in the Goblet. Including one unexpected friend: Daphne Greengrass.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9750991/1/Angry-Harry-and-the-Seven][Angry Harry and the Seven]]- Just how will Dumbledore cope with a Harry who is smart, knowledgeable, sticks up for himself and, worst still, is betrothed? A Harry who has a penchant for losing his temper? Ravenclaw/Smart(alek)/Lord/Harry Almostcanon/Dumbledore Non-friend/Ron Harry&Daphne (Haphne). No Harem. Rating is for language and minor 'Lime' scenes.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4334542/1/The-Grass-Is-Always-Greener][The Grass is Always Greener]]- During the second term of Harry's sixth year, he ends up saving Daphne Greengrass from a fate worse than death. To repay him, she teaches him Occlumency and they get to know each other well enough to learn that labels are not always useful... HP/DG.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/649126/James-Spookie][James Spookie]] also has a bunch of Harry/Daphne fics. It's easier to just link his profile and let you look through there on your own.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned by SeriousScribble]] is a pretty well known and beloved HarryxDaphne. Harry is an auror in this crime/drama fic. I've just decided to finally read it, but many people have already read it (not sure if you have as well). In any case, if you haven't read it, give it a go, it's pretty good.

*** That story was horribly depressing for me because I got blindsided by the genre. Good suspense and very interesting storyline, but I walked into it expecting some romance and got... well that story.

It was a really good read and a great story. I'd definitely recommend it but definitely not something I'd read if I was in the mood for some Harry/Daphne fluff.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5012016/1/Partners][Partners by muggledad]] - Having the right partner can make life much smoother. The right persons can complement each other's strengths and support each other's weakness. Love really does make the world go 'round, especially with a Dark Lord after your blood. HP/DG -- Fairly fluffy but readable if you like the pairing.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6926581/1/Thanks-to-a-Snake][Thanks to a Snake by lucky14now]] - Harry is affected more by the abuse at home,that, a chance meeting with a snake, and a marriage contract send him down a different path. -- I've got a note next to this one saying it was slow by not bad once you got through it.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5400129/1/The-Wrong-Choice][The Wrong Choice by The Unusual Suspect]] - Starts in the middle of DH - What if Hermione left the tent when Ron had asked her to come with him? How will Harry respond? What repercussions will her decision have on the Wizarding World? Will All be well? Who will Harry end up with? Ron bashing. -- Fairly short.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6307611/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Siren-s-Song][Harry Potter and the Siren's Song by hermyd]] - When Lily's secret is revealed Harry runs away from home and meets a girl unlike any other. But she can never be with him, and he would never even suggest it. Things change drastically when his mother's legacy turns him into something no one expected.

[[http://bobmin.fanficauthors.net/The_fall_of_the_House_of_Potter/The_fall_of_the_House_of_Potter/][The Fall of the House of Potter by Bobmin]] -- Good if you can log on to it. [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/daphne/fhp/a/1/The+Fall+Of+The+House+Of+Potter/Bobmin/1][Alternate Source]]

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6272062/1/Rabid-Plot-Fox][Rabid Plot Fox by Catherine or Cate]] -- Collection of HP/DG ideas/oneshots. Some were quite funny.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10668763/1/The-Frozen-Phoenix][The Frozen Phoenix by Demonic-Slytherin224]] --This is a WIP that you might enjoy keeping an eye on.

[[http://ficwad.com/story/214496][A Different Sort of Bond]] -- Takes the mick out of some more traditional soul-bond fics.

Then there's the list on [[http://www.ultimatehpfanfiction.com/daphne][Ultimate HP FanFiction]] which might be worth flicking through.

P.S. I agree with the other suggestions, this is my recs with those that have already been suggested removed. I've only put on some of the higher rated fics, if you want stuff that's only OK (or mindless PWP) rather than good let me know and I'll add some more.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6257522/1/A-Fine-Spot-of-Trouble][A Fine Spot of Trouble]] is a very good read and is not at all a marriage law fic.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10766595/1/Harry-Potter-Three-to-Backstep][Three to Backstep]] Is pretty good if you don't mind Hermione being in the relationship too. It's still ongoing, but there's pretty frequent updates. The story features time travel and soul bonds. Harry, Hermione, and Daphne out maneuver their enemies here and it's a fun read.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5835213/1/The-Marriage-Contracts-Redux][The Marriage Contracts]] should be a fun read too. It sort of plays off the usual marriage contract cliche. Harry has a really good friendship with Neville in this story and some of the banter is hilarious.

[[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]] was a really nifty read. I really enjoyed the presentation of the story. It's sequel [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Matryoshka_Vignettes/index/][Matryoshka Vignettes]] was also pretty cool. It made me wish there was another in the series simply because I wanted to read more. Pretty highly recommended.

** The trouble with most Harry & Daphne fics is that 90% of the time, it's a forced marriage signed by Lily and James and Daphne's parents at their births.

First of all, no matter how desperate things get, canon Lily would *never* do that, so already that plot line is unfeasible to begin with.

Secondly, what the hell exactly is "The Ice Queen of Slytherin?" and why is it such a popular description of Daphne? It's just a cheap gimmick for Harry to "warm her heart" with his goofy pleasant charm.

Find me a good fic without those two elements, and I might consider reading it.

*** I much prefer the idea that Sirius got James and Mr. Greengrass drunker than any mortal has any right to survive and the contract occurred as a result. Lily and Mrs. Greengrass refused to speak to their husbands for a while afterwards.

... I can't recall which story this was in though.

Yea I don't like it also but I think so many people read fics of Daphne like this, they assumed it was accepted canon or fanon. Also I think some authors think it gives daphne's personality aloofness that harry doesn't get from canon pairings. That his ability to love can warm the coldest hearts.

What I do love about this pairing is that daphne brings a slytherin perspective to harry. She like most pureblood slytherins have great knowledge of the political landscape in their world. Something neither Hermione nor ginny can provide. Closest person that could help harry with this is neville but I don't know how many lessons he paid attention to as a shy insecure child.

The [[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IceQueen][Ice Queen]] archetype has existed for pretty much forever (well, since Shakespeare, at least). "Ice Queen Daphne" became popular in the fandom following the first popular Harry/Daphne story, Jeconais's [[http://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Perfect_Situations/Perfect_Situations/][Perfect Situations]].
