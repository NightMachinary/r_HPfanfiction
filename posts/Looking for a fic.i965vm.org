I once read a fic that Hermione and Ron were overheard by Susan about Sirius which led to him getting a trial and dying. I'm trying to find it again and I remember Harry distancing himself between the two of them and Hermione marrying a muggle. I would appreciate it if someone can post it down below. Thx

  Years after Hogwarts, Hermione reflects on the decisions she made and the friendships lost. She, Ron, and Harry discovered first hand the truth in the saying 'Careless talk costs lives'. AU from GOF.
