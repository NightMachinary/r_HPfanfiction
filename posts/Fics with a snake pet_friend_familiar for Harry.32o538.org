I remember reading some fics where Harry meets a snake early on and befriends it but I can't remember their names. I'm interested in all such stories, especially with non-evil Dumbledore (can't stand evil Dumbles). Can you please help me find some of those stories?

*** This is my obligatory warning every time someone brings this up. Great, great trilogy, /worst ending EVER./

The FFN versions won't have the complete series, I believe the full version is on fictionalley.

** Just about the exact opposite, since it is Harry /becoming/ a snake familiar to Hermione: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8137134/1/Hermione-Granger-and-the-Prince-of-Serpents][Hermione Granger and the Prince of Serpents]].\\
I came across this one yesterday and it's an enjoyable read, if on a delay and written by someone who definitely isn't a native English speaker.

** I have read To shape and change, but it was long ago. I think I'll read it again. I haven't heard of the Psychic serpent. Thank you for pointing it out to me. Do you know of any more?

  He found Aunt Petunia sitting pale and distraught on the spotless kitchen tiles, gibbering as that evening's chicken dinner did a rather acrobatic tap-dancing lap of the room, squawked loudly, and then fled. [Harry raises the dead. It's less useful than you'd think. Eventual slash, canon AU, rating very likely to rise.]
