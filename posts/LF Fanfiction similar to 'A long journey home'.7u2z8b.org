I know this probably has been asked before, but A long journey home linkffn(9860311) is the best example I have for what I want. Basically I'm looking for a fic revolving around a character (anyone, even OCs) who is knowledgeable/influencual/powerful (not necessarily OP). It doesn't have to be set in the cannon timeline or setting, and can even be a crossover as long as it's possible to enjoy the fic with minimal/no knowledge of the other fandom. The said character can be a secondary character as long as they have significant influence on the story. So, any suggestions?

** Of a Linear Circle really appealed to me in the same way A Long Road Home did, with a single character making a big impact at various points throughout time. It is also regularly updated. linkao3(25241499)

  In one world, it was Harry Potter who defeated Voldemort. In another, it was Jasmine Potter instead. But her victory wasn't the end - her struggles continued long afterward. And began long, long before. (fem!Harry, powerful!Harry, sporadic updates)

** An interesting one might be linkffn(The-Burning-Truth). It's a story about James, Sirius, and Lupin coming together as teenagers, and gives more perspective on their motivations and relationships as teenagers.
