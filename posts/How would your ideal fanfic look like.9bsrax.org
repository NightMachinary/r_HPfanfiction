** - A seven year Hogwarts AU where Voldemort didn't have horcruxes and genuinely died on Halloween 1981.

- Each book of the 7 book series would tell a self-contained mystery/adventure within Hogwarts, similar to the first three books of canon.

- There would be significant slice of life/boarding school/coming of age elements and the tone would develop as the children age, going from a children's tone in the early years to young adult after, say, third year.

- Harry would be depicted as having talent with magic similar to that of his parents.

- Harry would still have his scar and it would still have granted him some of Voldemort's powers, but it would not be a horcrux. Exploration of these powers would be a developing theme across all 7 years.

- Another recurring theme would be Harry's fame and how he deals with it.

- Certain canonical events would still occur as they did not rely on Voldemort's continued existence: namely, Lucius' Chamber of Secrets plot (diary would just be an enchanted object, not a horcrux) and Sirius' escape from Azkaban. However these would play out differently, with Sirius successfully clearing his name.

- The Tri-wizard tournament would be shifted to the final book of the series and Harry would compete as Hogwarts' champion.

- Harry would date various girls over the years but the final pairing would be Harry/Fleur. Fleur is the same age as Harry and competes against him in the Tri-wizard tournament, which is where they meet. It would be a bit of an "enemies to lovers" type romance.

*** I would read this at the drop of a hat. I disliked that the Triwizard occurred when it did in the books, we weren't able to appreciate how skilled the best students of each school are really supposed to be. We know the Marauder's became animagi and made the map in their school years, and Snape was making his own spells. Getting 12 OWLS isn't exceedingly rare (iirc Percy Weasley and Crouch Jr. both managed this), and in terms of magical skill I imagine Triwizard champions would be a cut above even this.

TLDR: Triwizard in 7th year with Fleur romance or friendship development please.

#+end_quote

For most people (not me though), this would be making him too "OP". Compared to his parents, canon HP can be summed up in 2 words - wasted potential. James and Sirius became animagi at 15 and created the Marauder's Map in school - and after he ran away from his house and bought his motorbike, Sirius enchanted that thing to fly. They weren't just good with magic, they were prodigious.

And Lily, well, Slughorn mentions her as one of his best students, along with Snape. And Snape, as we know, was inventing spells and modifying potions before he was 16 - since he was friends with Lily for five years, it would be a reasonable assumption to say that they probably worked together on those potion modifications and the spells (not Sectumsempra though). Snape would have made Levicorpus with Lily first, and invented Sectumsempra later after Lily stops seeing him with rose-tinted lenses. Sectumsempra also seems more complicated as a spell, and Snape even made a counter for the curse, probably while he was in school himself.

Compared to his parents in talent, canon HP does /nothing/. There's that one glimmer to his potential when he casts his Patronus, but that is it.

But this is a nice idea, and you're good enough that you'd be able to pull it off too.

*** I like it... suggestions:

Year 2 with Delphini Riddle, in the same year as Ginny, born just months before her father got the reverse AK and her mom went to Azkaban. She is the heir and everyone knows it. Only she's not the one messing with the chamber, its a red herring. She's a contrast to HP, where ppl don't like her because of who her parents were and she's reviled for things she has nothing to do with.

Year 4, instead of the tri-wizard, have a vampire teaching DADA. Include a sub plot involving the rights of magical beings (non human or part-human) or maybe throw in some major magical disaster causing interaction between the muggle and magical worlds. Would like to see Hermione dealing w/ reverse culture shock story and this would be a good time to do it.

** - Pairing: Harry / Bellatrix

- Setting: Timetravel. Early Marauder generation. Harry is as old as Bellatrix (and Bellatrix is 7 years older than Sirius)

- Themes: The rise of Voldemort and the turmoil that creates in the pureblood circles he targets, portrayed by Bellatrix and the Black family as a whole. We delve into why the Black family was / became so fanatic. We see the politics of Britain change gradually. We hear and notice back room deals, intrigue and manipulation. On a personal level, Harry tries to draw Bellatrix away from Voldemort, while Bellatrix tries to draw him to Voldemort.

- Characterisation:

  - 7th year (post-Battle) Harry - slightly disillusioned with the old Dumbledore, but absolutely convinced of the righteousness of the cause. Suffers from both the trauma of the battle and horcrux hunt, as well as from the stress of the timetravel.
  - Bellatrix is canon!Bellatrix, just younger. Extremely interested in dark magic, highly intelligent, incredibly skilled but also quite unstable (not necessarily violent yet).

- Plot: Harry is sent back in time. He hits the early Marauder era and is 7 years older than his father. He is found and brought under protection by Dumbledore who knows of the timetravel. He makes Harry a deal. He helps Dumbledore get a headstart on Voldemorts plans, and in return he offers Harry an identity (as the Potter identity was unthinkable). Harry becomes a myth made flesh. He becomes Geralt Grindelwald - son of Grindelwald, adopted by Dumbledore in secret (papers get forged) and starts his 7th year. The name alone draws Bellatrix to him. Grindelwald. It has a powerful clout still in certain circles. He is invited to the Black family, and many old followers of Grindelwald look with interest to him. Dumbledore and Harry see the opportunity to rally under two flags and Harry is thrown into the politics of rich and pureblood Britain (and Europe). Eventually Harry has a choice. Lucius Malfoy is on a good way to become Elder of the Wizengamot. Arcturus Black guarantees Harry (Geralt) his support if he A) candidates and B) connect with the Black family by marriage. Dumbledore pushes Harry to agree. Harry, biting the sour apple, marries Bellatrix and becomes an Elder of the Wizengamot, delaying and outright destroying Voldemort's plans for Lucius. Harry splits those Elders that would have normally all flocked to Voldemort *but* he lacks substance. What was still a relatively loveless relationship now becomes usefull. He needs Bellatrix to back him and give him credibility. In turn, Bellatrix asks of him certain policy. They try to out-manipulate each other while playing the perfect couple to the outside world. Meanwhile Voldemort prepares for a strike. He attacks Harry and Bellatrix. The assassination attempt fails, but Harry sustains heavy injury while shielding bellatrix from harm. That changes their dynamic. Bellatrix i sopen to the thought of Harry actually caring about her (even if she doesn't even dare think about love. He just /cares/), rather than thinking of her as a (expendable) means to an end. Plus, she is disillusioned about Voldemort. Her focus switches from his ideals to the hybrid ideology she and Harry were creating through their arguments and fights.

I'm not sure about any details. But thats the beginning to a plot I had rummaging around my head for a bit. Especially the relationship of Harry and Bellatrix should be a challenge and chance to grow for both characters. They share goals, but not ideologies. Its important to emphasize that /both/ want "the best for Britain" and have vastly different views on what is best, and how to achieve it.

The ending would be Harry and Bellatrix, in a loving relationship that has developed through much hardship, standing on top of the political game, surpassing even Dumbledore and Malfoy, with Voldemort defeated. Harry should have developed an opportunistic, cunning and ruthless side, while Bellatrix should have found a stability and acceptance of her emotions and love.

*** That would make quite an interesting political drama if you were to develop that idea further. Harry somehow trying to convert Grindelwald's followers to the guardians who preserve what Voldemort tries to destroy, maybe even reforming the Knights of Walpurgis under his own banner a few years down the road. Him starting as Dumbledore's pawn and eventually becoming his own man, trying to stay under everyone's radar for as long as possible.

The one thing I am not sold on is Bellatrix's support of Voldemort at that early point, but maybe Nymphadora could be used as a living proof that he's wrong about pureblood superiority (and maybe later Lily).

**** My explanation for Bellatrix' early infatuation with Voldemort would be her interests and desires. She is interested in dark magic, because she desires power. Power and "the climb" are her endeavors ([[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxlIraEV8n4][An apt inspiration would be Littlefinger's worldview]]). She believes Voldemort delivers opportunity for both, if you bring with you the necessary ruthlessness to take your chances.

When I think about it, their relationship could be well described by the question of what would happen if Varys (Harry) and Littlefinger (Bellatrix) from Game of Thrones / SoIaF worked together. Littlefinger is is working for his own gains, while Varys works for the good of the realm. Both are ruthless. Both are smart and cunning. Both do not shy away from extremely underhanded and cruel plans (if necessary, in Varys' case).

The "dynamic change" is essentially the moment Bellatrix realizes Voldemort is a dead end road, and the only way for her to climb is Harry's name, clout and prosperity (mixed with the genuine suprise that somebody gives even a single fuck about her as a person. At the point of the attack, Harry would/should have a much easier time without her constantly interfering and trying to steer).

** I have one I want to see, but is not everything that I want (some of them contradict).

*A world where wizards didn't decide to hide and instead turned against the muggles*:

- Wizards, instead of casting some sort of mass mind/history alteration over a period of time, used the collective magic of the world's communities and the far superior methods of transport and communication in the 17th century to summon immense natural disasters. In the span of half a decade, the major blood lines of the world were extinct and the the fortresses destroyed. Communication and borders fell apart while the wizards remained unperturbed.
- Finally the magical world came forward to alleviate the trauma, essentially making the remnants of the former countries exceedingly loyal to their saviors. After a short time, and with their almost divine powers and 'beneficence,' they began to take on near god-status in the eyes of the muggles.
- Wizards became the new high class, given a status similar to the Brahmins and Kshatriyas in most of the world, with the non-magicals essentially becoming the equivalent of the labor class.
- Beings, such as goblins or house-elves, were still lesser but were given something equivalent Vaishyas, or the artisans and merchants. Not as powerful or important, but they were still above the non-magicals, who were then known as Shadows (as in a shadow of wizards/witches).
- Fast-forward three-hundred years to the future. Story follows Harry who is a member of a special magical hunter group (for stolen magical knowledge, which is like their prize possessions and often kept exclusively in families). Would begin here showing his life in the British Isles, which have been raised up from the ocean to symbolize the status of Britain in the world.
- Magical Britain is divided into seven rulerships, though there is no king per se so much as a set of magical individuals agreed upon by particular members of the community (but it must always be a prime number). The Weasleys have several members there.
- There is no blood purity. However, what there is is a /control/ of spells and magic. The magical society essentially has its own form of interwoven political machinations. Additionally, magicals have become more competitive and serious about being more talented. This means the average magical skill of wizards/witches is well above what it was in canon. New magics and spells exist, with far more innovation, while certain branches ended up neglected or underused. What Dumbledore and Voldemort were in canon, their are easily a hundred more in Western Europe alone.
- The greater magical-ness with the Shadows has lead to a variety of changes, including their general service to the magical community. They work as laborers, and while they aren't give equal treatment they aren't really abused as a general rule.
- And then their are the mixes. A witch named only Lady Chimaera attempted to find a way to improve her subjects by mixing traits from magical creatures like Dragons and Runespoors with the Shadows over a century before. The results were mixed, but ultimately her work was successful and she began to create an army on Cyprus. Eventually this was beaten down by the pair of Battle Mages Grindelwald and Dumbledore, but her creations survived and the magical communities allowed them to intermingle. People even began to incorporate the techniques further, both in the Shadows and the Wizards, who had a far higher survival rate on the whole. So many people with certain unique abilities exist beyond what can be performed by the average wizard.
- Harry is a mix as well - James Potter was a normal but fairly talented wizard while Lily was a fairly talented magical born from a pair of mixed Shadows. My thought was that he is mixed with a Demiguise, which would be helpful in certain ways but he could hide it easily enough, since people much of the mainstream frowns upon wizards who mix as well (impure and all that), and Harry is only reasonably talented (he is like 19 at the start of the story, educations start at 4 for magicals)

Does this sound interesting? I hope so, cause I've been writing it for a while now. And I haven't given away any of the plot, just some of the world and background.

**** Not yet because its a toss up between where I'm deciding to go forward out of several fics:

1. This fic, I was thinking the title would be something Astrologia.
2. A 1979 fic short fic staring Sirius Black in a brief (1-6 chapters I'd say) buddy cop mission to track down a Death Eater who is making waves.
3. A time-travel fic where Harry has only one year to repeat the Triwizard Tournament after getting oneshotted in the Graveyard, but he has some company. Its called The Iridescent.
4. A post-war fic where Harry and Luna are married and are on a journey through the magical communities of East Asia as Magizoologists to follow the trail of a certain species. I was thinking the Fenghuang, since its sort of a phoenix and Harry would feel a connection to it.
5. A partial AU where Neville is the Boy-Who-Lived, and Harry is in Hufflepuff. The catch is that Harry is actually really talented with magic (he wanted to repair his mum's mind after she was tortured) but Harry from a series of events in his past is afraid of being in the limelight since all it does is isolate you (Lonely at the Top of the World). So he just pretends and tries to get along with everybody while secretly studying with Dumbledore, who helped allow Remus to raise Harry after Sirius fled to chase down Pettigrew. I was thinking 'Scoptaphobic' or 'Salt of the Earth.'

I have complete outlines and several chapters /written/ already, with endings, but I don't want to commit until I know what I want to invest in.

**** Several things comes to mind.

1. Make them relatable. Maybe with a tragic backstory, like Loki in the first Thor.
2. Have them be an activist, you know, someone campaigning not for themselves, but for a cause that either you or the characters can get behind. In one of the stories that I'm writing, for example, I'm trying to create a situation where muggles begin to pose a legitimate threat to wizardkind, and so Voldemort, when he arises, positions himself not as a conqueror, but a savior to his species.
3. To piggy off your idea about Harry and Hermione...have the protagonists turn dark. Make them fall down a slippery slope, because if there's anything I love in movies/literature it is corruption and redemption arcs. Think Harvey Dent in Batman. A good character initially, he becomes a villain by the end, and I would love to read a fanfic like that.

** *Pairings*

- Given my own relative inability to write romance, I'd avoid pairings. If I must, I'll stick to canon, because I don't have a problem with any of Rowling's pairings. (Note that not having a problem with WHAT Rowling wrote is not the same as not having a problem with HOW she wrote it)

- Lots of one-on-one scenes between characters, platonic or otherwise

- I tend to prefer the Harry Years at Hogwarts

- Plot--I'm toying with a "Ginny Gets Sorted Into Ravenclaw" story. The idea got into my head a few weeks ago and made itself at home. Percy is condescendingly patronizing towards Ginny in Flourish and Blotts and she's so frustrated with him, she resolves to prove she's smarter than him. This leads to her being sorted into Ravenclaw, because /wit beyond measure is man's greatest treasure./

As for the rest of it...It's still making itself at home, but it won't tell me what'll happen.

** I have an (only in my head, thus far) series-spanning For Want of A Nail in which Tonks spots Harry and Hagrid going into the the Leaky and ends up tagging along. Basically it would be a 7-year story in which the Tonks would end up being the adults in Harry's life rather than the Weasley's.

Somethings this story would include: 1) Andromeda is not a ‘Dumbledore knows best' figure, in large part because she wanted the Potions Professor gig after Slughorn and she's angry he chose to protect a Death Eater rather than hire someone who actually wanted to be a teacher (and who, very much at the time could have used the protection of the castle precisely because they weren't Death Eaters.) She is also a lot less understanding of his decision to place Harry with Petunia.

2) Ron & Hermione are both still his best friends, but the Tonks become closer to the Grangers. The Tonks are also a little more encouraging of Harry's social development. In no way would that make him ruthless 12 year old politician, but he does get a little bit better handle on making friends and dealing with people. Tonks is basically his big sister and takes the role very seriously.

3) The pairing would not be Harry/Ginny because Harry doesn't go the Burrow every summer so she doesn't get the canon-exposure therapy to Harry. She's not a bad person, isn't going to potion him, she just never fully got over the crush weirdness and they don't end up getting to know each other well. I keep thinking the pairing would be Harry/Katie, but it could end up only being a school thing.

4) Sirius would survive, but would be more of an uncle figure. Remus & Tonks would not be a thing because Tonks knows how lonely & desperate Harry's childhood was so she's less understanding of Remus' issues.

5) I also have a rough idea of a Potter Place: the home of multi-generations of Potters (because spoiled James Potter didn't grow up in a cottage.) I wouldn't make it a manor house, but there would be more than a few acres. I sort of have actual house in England that I imagine it would be like (although that house is in London rather than near Stinchcombe, as the Potter's would be.) Harry would also be, with the encouragement of the Tonks, more interested in asking questions about his family. (this in all honestly could be a completely different story, as well.)

Mostly this story hasn't been written because I like world-building, but have less talent in story building and also, I'm sort of bored with Voldemort as a villain. If I did write this story, I might consider ending Voldemort at the end of Goblet of Fire and then switch (back) to a mystery of the year format for 5-7. (And would write GOF as more of a mystery in the vein of 1-3.)

*** Well, I'm writing a story where Harry is adopted by Andromeda after the third year with Tonks becoming his big sister (role wise, they don't call each other that). It has many similar themes to what you are describing, even if Remus is not involved with Harry's life, Sirius is getting patched up by a mind healer abroad and Dumbledore isn't an moron like in far too many fics.

I toyed with the idea of starting it first year (and a Katie pairing), but neither really fitted the plot I envisioned.

** It would be somewhat like canon, but

-A greater emphasis on character actions and doing a consistent, believable development of said characters. So Harry doesn't go from furious anger followed by despair, only to spend the summer and school year after mostly focused on trivialities like being jealous of a girl he hardly knows. Come on, he just lost his last decent family member, he's fucking alone in a way few could stand.

-More sensible antagonist actions. Replacing Moody for the entire year is stupid, all they needed to do was impersonate him during the Third task if they weren't going to do anything before that.

-More political intrigue between different factions in the Ministry to institute their policies as law. I'm kind of doing this myself. I could see Lucius playing both sides until he was sure one had the edge.

-The pairing would be a realistically developed and portrayed HHR (think 'Definitions of Romance' and 'The Augurey'). For Harry who resembles canon, this makes the most sense to me overall. Having high school type relationships beforehand is reasonable, but I can't see Harry taking those seriously unless there's a real emotional connection and understanding between the two.

-Protagonists aren't useless morons.

** First off, Harmony, as I've no memory of being as utterly captivated and obsessed with a pairing as much as I am with this one.

As for story content, I'd love to see a fic a la Stanrick's sort that has a faint Douglas Adams feel to the humor without being overtly comedic. I'd love to see a full run of Hogwarts (years 1-7) that, as in some of Stanrick's stories, has a distinct slice of life quality to it. I think there's enough fics out there dealing with Voldemort and his influence on Harry's life and upbringing, so I'd love to read a long story where he just isn't a factor. I'd still appreciate conflict and adventure, but without any mentions of prophecy or obligations to save the the world. Just a couple of students dealing with a school that has a proclivity towards creating some sort of drama.

I think the best aspect of Harry and Hermione's relationship both in canon and in the hypothetical romantic context is how there's little inherent qualities in either of the characters that would promote their affiliation with one another. They bond through a series of experiences and develop their affinity over time. So I wouldn't be too fond of them becoming lovers and soulmates halfway through their first year, but I like the idea of them becoming friends pretty early on. It'd also be nice to have Ron in there somewhere. I do think he has problems and that Hermione is a better friend than him, but I don't dislike him as a character and I enjoy stories where he's given a chance to mature or where his more comedic aspects are focused on.

I also like stories where the muggleborns have more of a voice and reference things that the rest of the students don't understand (though not to the point where the story becomes Ready Player One) in particular I liked what Stanrick did in his stories when he had Harry and Hermione make jokes would confuse Ron or the teachers.

- Harry is straight up a Dark Lord/Lady growing up. It's an evil v evil story: the Fanstastical Racists of Voldemort vs the Grindelwaldian Racists of Potter. The Ministry is helpless, and whomever wins, everyone loses.

- Limpieza de Sangre but Voldemort doesn't die and instead the plot goes on. I know there's a sequel, but I'd rather the ending of the first be different.

- Dumbledore vs Grindelwald, a six chapter miniseries detailing their initial friendship, their breaking apart, the duel, the aftermath, and two postwar discussions on life and stuff.

- Tropeverse. All the worst tropes in fanon with all the worst characters in fanon. Picture: multiple Lord Potters running around, lemon drop addicted Dumbledores, and Ron being Voldemort at least 12 times. Basically, the crackiest crack that ever cracked.

** I don't know if it would be my ideal fic but I have an idea that I would totally love to read:

- a canon-compliant First-War fic where we get to see how Voldemort became so feared that nobody dares say his name.
- maybe starting with an ordinary family (OCs or canon dead characters?), getting attached to them, seeing how they lives despite the gradual unease that the War is causing.
- maybe this family was actually the first one to be strike down because of the Taboo...
- and thus the reader will start following other families, seeing their struggles for normalcy, for their safety... seeing how the fear is gradually gaining all Wizarding World... Seeing the Imperius Curse in action in the Minitry and the true horror of it. How people starts to be suprisingly killed/betrayed/tortured by their loved ones... How everyone will become to distrust anyone but themselves...

​

Well, basically, something that will make us truly understand the horror that Voldemort truly was during the First War (because, tbh, the Second War was not as impressive as what I was imagining for the First based on every adults' reactions when they talked about it in the books...)

** My one that I'm failing to progress with, basically XD

Pairings: The pairing is currently uncertain, but it won't be a harem story :') I think Harry actually deserves a nice few dates with people before meeting his future partner, unlike the complete trainwreck with Cho. I mean, maybe he'll have a trainwreck relationship, but he deserves a nice one too!

Setting: AU with many similarities to Canon. The largest difference involves the depth of magical theory. I have an almost Gaiman-esque view of magic, in a lot of ways. I want that aspect to feel more profound. I'm also aiming for more depth politically, historically and socioeconomically. Surprisingly, this is actually an area I haven't had that much trouble with.

Themes:

- Harry's personal growth. This should be the primary focus. It includes how he grows socially, psychologically and magically.
- Clash of Titans: Voldemort, Dumbledore, heavy hitters on both sides, eventually Harry.
- Magical theory!
- Exploration of history, be it Hogwarts specifically (so much to explore!), specific families or on a larger scale altogether.
- The rights of different groups in society
- A much heavier leaning in style towards British Public Schools, a la Black Luminary by Yakage.

Characterisation: I like most of the Canon characterisation where the protagonists are concerned. Major differences include Harry (coming to terms with his childhood, starting shy and growing into a hero); Dumbledore (a tired old man who is a genius academically but is sick of constantly trying to do the best he can with very limited resources); Malfoy and several of the Slytherins (I actually want them to be cunning and ambitious! Not 11yr old politicians, but people who grow into their strengths); Death Eaters (increased competence); Voldemort (increased competence and an actual agenda)... I also want to give more screen time to underused characters like Hagrid and Dobby. House elves will be nerfed, though!

Plot: the part I find most difficult. I agree with Taure about a 7 year series with heavy mystery elements. I've been using alchemical theory to theme things (I suspect JKR did something similar tbh, especially after I saw notes relating to Basilisks in the 2nd stage of the creation of a Philosopher's Stone) and to throw an alchemical bent on Harry's education. Trying to weave together the different areas I'm interested in into something cohesive is a nightmare, and my biggest hold up.

Ending: I only know this in the vaguest terms so far. And since I'm actually trying to write this, I won't reveal it here anyway! XD

In other news, I would love to see a time travel fic where the time travel has more effects than just a single jump. Like, exploring paradoxes and how magic deals with them. It's hard to pull off but the odd occasions I've seen this touched on, I've been very happy.

** A next gen Scorbus fic that's all seven years at Hogwarts. Rose is a good friend to the boys, not a mean girl who dumps her best friend over a school house. The Weasley cousins actually exist and aren't all Gryffindor carbon copies of their parents. No time travel, no Voldemort 2.0, no self insert Mary Sues for James Sirius to fall in love with.

OR

Wolfstar raises Harry fic with most of the same events as canon. Harry is in Slytherin but doesn't become best friends with Draco or a budding dark lord and Snape is still a jerk. Harry has a wider social circle but Ron and Hermione are still his best friends. Dumbledore is a manipulative well-intentioned extremist as per canon and gets called out on his shit. Maybe Harry has an adopted sibling or two. And just because I love him, somehow Teddy Lupin still exists (maybe Tonks was a surrogate to Remus and Sirius' child, or maybe he's a random orphan they adopted, I don't care). Basically what could've happened if Harry had loving guardians.

** My ideal fanfic is a doozy: Harry/any multi pairing, optionally with transgender Blaise, black Hermione, and 1980!delfy (cuz voldie and Bella are too old to be normal human parents barring edge cases.) must be smutty. Again, throw in as many tropes as possible. Ron gets paired with lavender or padma. Panju can exist. Teddy is a must, and metamorphs change gender at will. I have more to say.

Voldemort is immortal and aged 71/72 when he "fathered" Delphi. There's no expiration date for men in that regard. Bellatrix would be 47 at most (world record for motherhood is 67), which could still be possible even without magically extended lifetimes (100 is not that uncommon with magic IIRC).

** Ideal: gay pairing (preferably Harry/Draco but Harry/any male is good too), lots of angst and adorable boyfriend caring for Harry. At least slightly graphic abuse. Rape is a bonus. Sick fic is great too. All three is perfect! I do enjoy bad Dumbles, good malfoys. Slytherin Harry. Powerful Harry is great too.

Not ideal: Harry/Ginny pairing. Actually any Ginny at all unless she is being rediculed or severly harmed. Fics in a non magic setting are also boring. Settings other than Harry at Hogwarts is not interesting so no next gen fics or ones set in the past. Thats about it really.
