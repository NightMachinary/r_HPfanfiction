  Time and time again the Bad Guys do bad things and get away with it. Time and time again the Good Guys take the low blow and just soldier on with their upper lips stiff. What might happen if someone couldn't hold it together? How would Magical Britain react? More to the point; who would they blame? A little One-Shot in documentary style.

*** ~notices 'upper lips stiff' in the description~

Heh, I just thought of a tagline for any 'Englishmen go psycho' fic/movie/etc.

"Stiff Upper Lip? More Like Stiff Middle Finger!"
