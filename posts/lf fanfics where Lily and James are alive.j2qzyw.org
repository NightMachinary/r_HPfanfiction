Hey guys, are you all right? (If not, I honestly hope it gets better, if so, great!)

​

Well, I've been browsing some fanfics recently, and I found a topic that interested me a lot, and I read some stories like that and I was really enchanted! I'll give a brief summary of what the stories are like, come on?

​

- Lily and James alive

- Lily and James neglect Harry, BUT repent and try to reestablish a bond with their son.

- Lily and James alive, think Harry is dead, but Harry appears at Hogwarts very well alive!

​

(Ah, I read The Darkness Within, it's a great story, if you haven't, please read it!)


** This is the only one that I know of. Sadly incomplete but a good story nonetheless.

  Lily and James survived Voldemort's attack, but their infant son was believed dead. Twelve years later, Harry Potter is found and brought home, but the real struggle has just begun. Ensemble fic about a family's recovery as old enemies return.

** A Different Beginning by Breanie: linkffn(4489910)

This is probably my favourite non-dimension-travel story in which James and Lily live to raise Harry (at least, James lives to raise Harry from early childhood, Lily gets put into a coma but comes back into the picture later). No neglectful Potters, no bashing whatsoever.

Both this fic and its sequel are complete.

** Three of these have James & Lily raising Harry's brother; Harry has been left to others to raise for varying reasons. Needless to say, there are a lot of surprises for everyone, and James & Lily don't always show in the best light.

"Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches" by LeadVonE; WiP, very intense story, amoral Harry. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw]]

"The Green in the Grey" by TheBlack'sResurgence. Also a WiP, but more recently updated. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12886674/1/The-Green-in-the-Grey]]

"Who Dares Wins" by OlegGunnarsson. A 3rd WiP, and it isn't just Harry who is surprised! [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13182638/1/Who-Dares-Wins]]

"Fall of the House of Potter" by Bobmin356 (RIP). Haphne. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7508571/1/The-Fall-of-the-house-of-Potter]]
