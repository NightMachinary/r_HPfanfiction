/Canon is what actually happened in the series/

/Wished-for is what you wanted to happen/

/Fanficiton is what you enjoy reading/

What are your favorites?

*Canon:*

Well...I'll go with Lupin/Tonks, since I was disappointed with how the other relationships turned out. Big time. Others (the ONLY others) are Arthur/Molly, Bill/Fleur, Lucius/Narcissa and George/Angelina...but Lupin/Tonks is definitely the favorite. I honestly find their "opposites attracts" relationship rather endearing. And Tonks is so fun! And I did love Snape's one-sided love for Lily.

*Wished-For:*

Harry/Hermione 100%. I don't think I'll ever get over them being together and they are the number favorite wished-for couple. Also Neville/Luna. Harry/Luna would have been /very/ sweet if it was handled carefully and then Neville could have been really cute with Ginny (awkward boy, popular girl).I wouldn't have minded Viktor/Hermione as well!

*Fanfiction:*

Snarry. Also Snape/Hermione, but Snarry dominates for some reason. Snape/Lily too (I seem to be Snape-addicted). Sirius/Bellatrix for shits and giggles. Of course Harry/Hermione and Lupin/Tonks too. Harry/Luna is really endearing as well.

I'll read other stuff, rare/odd pairs and crack if it is well written though! Like, Bellatrix/Hermione. Never thought I'd like it, but the fic I came across was /amazing/. No stuff like Harry/Hedwig or Sirius/Kreacher unless I want to brain-bleach myself. That Hagrid foursome with the golden trio was so horrifying I've never gotten over it.


** Canon: Lily/James. Just by what we've been told in canon, each person had to have matured quite a bit before having a romantic relationship, and they were only 21 when they died. We start the book with their deaths! It's tragic. We don't really know much of anything about their relationship, but we know about the individuals.

Wished for: I was a big fan of Harmony when I was younger. Now I think they're more like siblings, but this was prior to 6-7 being published. I also really really really wanted WolfStar to be canon, even if it was in the past.

Fanfiction: the only couples I typically go out of my way to look for are Hermione/Sirius, Hermione/Remus, and WolfStar. I'm picky about the first two- time travel shenanigans are preferred, or post war. I enjoy various rare pairs though.

**** *Lily/James*: I honestly really liked linkffn(tears on the balcony by byebyebirdie), but I'll need to do a reread once the 3rd in the series is complete (last update a month ago). I recently read linkffn(love and other tragedies by fancyeyes) and loved it. You might find linkffn(key limes by cgner) cute. It's short.

*Harmony:* I actually don't have any on my favorites list, so I don't have any I can really recommend. Part of the problem is just the way a lot of them are written. They tend to start out OOC instead of developing that way. Maybe I just run into those too often.

*Wolfstar:* I have linkffn(Momentum by children of the shadows) on my favorites list but I honestly don't remember it. linkffn(3963147) was pretty good.

*Hermione/Sirius*: I'll always recommend linkffn(The Debt of Time by shayalonnie) and linkffn(Roundabout Destiny by maryroyale). I absolutely love them. Debt does feature some Remus/Hermione. Both are time travel.

*Hermione/Remus:* A standard is linkffn(the last marauder by resa aureus). linkffn(This Time Around by Disneydoll0424) doesn't seem to get recommended very often, but it's interesting at least. linkffn(overclocking by EuphoniumGurl0) is rather entertaining.

** Canon: Lucius/Narcissa. I don't do fanfic that makes them dislike each other. I like Harry/Ginny, but don't love how it's presented in canon.

Wished for: Viktor/Hermione is easily my most wished for. I think they suit pretty well (yes, he's into sports and she's not, but they respect each other, and he's much deeper than just his Quidditch).

Fanfiction: I'll read pretty much anything if it's recommended to as well written, but I really have fun with Tom Riddle or Voldemort/Harry. I blame Athey.

I thought he was really good with Hermione. I wouldn't have minded this being an actual cannon ending either - it would have been great to see how their long distance relationship played out. And he's a bit older than her too - something I've always felt was good for her.

Seconding this, and, also, him being "into sports" hasn't stopped her from marrying Ron. Furthermore, while most people know of him as the Quiddich seeker, notice that the Goblet chose him as the Durmstrang champion on his merits: he is one of the bravest and most talented and hard-working wizards in Durmstrang. (That said, JKR really should have looked up how a Bulgarian would or wouldn't mispronounce Hermione's name: it would be nothing like in the books.)

**** Yup. I actually think they're one of the better potential couples in the books, so it kind of kills me that they don't end up together.

There's not much. Most of the really good ones are more ficlets, too. This linkao3([[http://archiveofourown.org/works/474798]]) is about the best I've got, sadly. Sometimes it pops up as a well written side pairing though. I'd probably be a more obsessive shipper if more Viktor/Hermione fics existed, because it's kind of my OTP, but they're really just not plentiful.

*** One is a hardworking genius surrounded by average people, the other is a jealous oaf who can't stand other people getting attention (yet refuses to work to achieve anything himself). I don't see how that equals to 'bitchiness' on a same level.

The only way I can see them come together is purely on hormones, followed with her then being too stubborn to admit she made a mistake and him not wanting to let his trophy woman go.

Then again, with him constantly tearing down her self worth for the entire duration of their boarding school experience, she might be too damaged to realize she's in a bad relationship and deserves someone better (being in a relationship with someone far less intelligent is VERY frustrating, even without Ron's personality being incompatible with hers in multiple ways).

It's not like both Snape and Draco continuously humiliate and mock her, isn't it? but I suppose in your mind it's just tsundere. Of course, Draco is much better than Ron - it's not like he's a jealous brat who can't stand other people getting attention, yet refuses to work to achieve anything himself.

As for your point, I did point out why I liked those pairings. And both of them had actual reasons at the time for acting like such bastards towards her. Reasons that to me make the redeeming part more interesting and thus appealing to read. I wouldn't want her to end up with either of the men the way they /are/ in canon. Hence it being a fanfiction pairing. There is no way either of those would have worked without an additional book focused on working out those issues. Which is what fanfiction is for!

Lol, like what? hating mudbloods and Gryffindors? the fact that she helped Harry? meanwhile, Hermione was constantly patronizing, insulting and nagging Ron, and yet one offhand comment when he was 11 is all it takes for you to think he's abusive. But I guess that, since he wasn't an evil piece of shit, he doesn't deserve "redeeming".

**** As usual, the anti-R/Hr is a mask for one's hatred of Ron. What more to expect?

We always hear from anti-R/Hrs: that Ron can't stimulate Hermione intellectually, that he always tears her down, that he's emotionally abusive (and has the potential to physically do that too), yet we never hear of the flip side: can't Hermione loosen up? Hermione also tears Ron down sometimes? Hermione has actually sent birds to attack Ron, and she attacks him so badly that Harry has to use a Shield Charm to protect Ron. But no, of course, only Ron is to blame.

I'm not even that much of a R/Hr supporter, but I'm tired of the utter hypocrisy. I'd be more tolerant of people who dislike R/Hr if they didn't use that as a cover for their Ron bashing. It takes two to make a relationship work, you know.

She has a hard time accepting this new her at first, but over time she learns to live with it. This puts her at odds with her old friends who still see her as a very giggly woman.

1) Yes, while Harry is as lazy as Ron, he still comes across as being the smarter of the two. Ron, though of course not stupid, is the slowest of the trio nearly always.

2) Harry does find Hermione annoying (and yes, she is VERY studious unlike him...lol) but at the same time, they rarely argue or fight and get along for the most part, far better than Ron and Hermione who are constantly snipping at each other and get into serious fights far more often than Harry/Hermione or Ron/Harry do.

3) Hermione is very patronizing, this is one of her worst traits and rather aggravating to boot. Again though, this doesn't seem to get under Harry's skin that often as it does with Ron; Harry just accepts it as part of Hermione's personality and moves on without it letting it get to him the way it does Ron. Again, Harry and Hermione get along far more calmly and with far, far less annoyances.

4)

#+begin_quote
  Hermione needs a challenge

And she gets that with Harry, considering what he has to do and his..."fate". She gets it helping him out through the years, solving mysteries, helping him on his quest (she's the most loyal one of his friends)...intellectually she doesn't get a challenge (she doesn't get that from anyone unless you want to fan ship her with Snape or something...) but she gets a lot of adventure and physical/mental challenges just by being Harry's friend.

And PLEASE stop throwing around the word abuse like it's candy, abuse is serious and not to be taken lightly, when it IS occurring. (which it isn't from Snape or Ron honestly.

***** Ron doesn't think that, he's acutely aware that he's poor in relation to someone like Harry or Draco, and knows that even people who don't come from magical families, like Hermione, are better off than him. He also knows, that out of all of his brothers, he's the least likely to be successful: he's not as adventurous and dashing as Bill, nor as hardy as Charlie, nor as smart as Percy, nor does he have a flair for business like Fred and George. It's one of his biggest insecurities that's hammered over and over again throughout the series. I don't know where this entitled bullshit comes from. Yeah, he's jealous of Harry's wealth, but he never takes advantage of him and often outright refuses whenever Harry offers to pay for him. Hardly the makings of a entitled bastard.

The thing about Ron is that he behaves like a teenager, which might seem annoying next to Harry and Hermione, who do behave more like adults (a little bit less so with Harry, what with his occasional temper tantrums, but still pretty much true), but is entirely acceptable when, you know, you're an actual teenager.

******** I don't see either Harry or Ron becoming an Auror really, with the characters presented in canon. The problems with authority that especially Harry has make it rather unlikely (cops have to follow orders/rules). The only way I can see it happen is with a form of nepotism as a result of him being the greatest war hero after May 1998.

From what we've seen in the 7 books of how the wizarding world works as well as both Ron and Harry's characters, that is a far more likely route for them to auror office than hard work and proper conduct.

Also, since people seem to be really misunderstanding me: I do think Harry can work for things, and I do think he could get a proper carreer in something else, I just don't think he would function well as a member of a militarized police force.

********** Yeah but one of my big problems with Harry, especially towards the end of the series, is that he doesn't really ever put in hard work>>>>Achievement.

Like yeah, he kills Voldemort. But it's not like he outdrew him, or found a clever way around his defenses. Instead the final duel is this incredibly anticlimactic moment where they cast simultaneous spells and Harry's wins because reasons.

My point, and I think OP's, being that once Harry isn't just gonna win because reasons how good is he actually at following orders, doing things by the book, respecting due process rights etc. Essentially, how good of a cop would he be?

I don't see much of a difference in Harry and Ron's intelligence levels at all. Both of them got the same number of OWLs and pursued the same profession. I can't see how you can support H/Hr and dislike R/Hr based on this argument.

I guess you're right, i mean, J.K tells us they both got 7 OWLs, unfortunately she never reveals Ron's grades where we do know Harry's. (1 O, 5 E's and 1 A.)

Again it comes down to how you personally interpret the cannon version of the books. I would right more but this seems like the kind of thing that will be discussed in the debating ring. :)

**** My suggestion for the debate threads in the survery was this pairing, and for a mod to emphasize that people shouldn't express their opinions in voting, as aside from unintentional slight at a group I've belonged to myself for most of my life so far, I've mostly tried to give reasons. Yet even outright insults towards me get upvoted while arguments where I do little but reference canon and explain my interpretation get down-voted, it feels rather hostile. It makes me think debate threads are not going to go over well in this sub.

** /Canon:/ To be honest I don't very much like most of the pairings from canon, but I like Bill/Fleur. It seems well-written from my perspective.

/Wished-For:/ Remus/Sirius. The whole Tonks spanner-in-the-works seemed really out of character for both her and Remus (I *love* both of them as characters though), and I felt that R/S had a far larger amount of subtext.

/Fanfiction:/ Well, OP said it. Hermione/Bellatrix is a rare pairing, but I enjoy what few fics there are. R/S is great fun, as is very occasional non-Harmonian Harry/Hermione. And if you count the /Alexandra Quick/ series as technically Harry Potter, which it is, I ship Alex/Anna more than anything else in the world and will be severely disappointed if Inverarity sinks it.

But I just can't for the love of me see why people insist on this being canon. If anything, Sirius should have had feelings for JAMES considering how he was always closest to James and he never got over his death, and how he still remained incredibly fond of James years later. Not to mention, subtly pushing James' mannerisms/personality onto Harry who after all does look just like his father except for the eyes...
