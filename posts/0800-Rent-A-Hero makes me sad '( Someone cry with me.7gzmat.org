I just binged it and really loved it. Damn, I wish it was complete. Normally I don't mind but damn I really wanted to see what happened next... It ended on such a cliffhanger! Still recommend it though. Anyone else crying over incomplete fics?


** I actually wish I didn't read it. Stopping where it did sucks so much. There was build up, then more build up, then more build up, and then we get absolutely no satisfaction. It's a bummer.

** I can't cry over it - except maybe tears of frustration? I really fucking wanted to see what happens with Tonks.

Does anyone else get the sense that Tonks was pulling a double entrapment? I got a theory that the first time she was revealed with the patronus was maybe staged (though equally possible it was accidental)... and then there were all the apologies, the pledging of her loyalty and the dark magic healing she used to transfer Harry's wounds to her. The talk by Mr. Tonks too felt kind of too well constructed to lead Harry towards a favorable decision. As I was reading all that, my gut was telling me that she pulled all that shit to make Harry trust her (because she was finally confessing to the "truth) and she /still/ intended to report to the Order. Leading to a possibly even bigger "oh shit" moment in the future, when Harry would discover her continued spying and shit would spectacularly get fucked up.

*** It's pretty clear that that's not the case tbqh. Dumbleodore is multiple hundreds of years old at this point (just look at that sweet ass medieval beard) so he's definitely got the whole metamorpagus timeturning thing figured out from his brief fling with WWII starting self-cest because I'll bet you never noticed that if you rearrage the letters in Grimdelwald you're just a few letters short of a Dumbledore, symbolizing how Dumbledore was always just a few cuts above the rest of humanity in intellectual power. See when scar man shows up he thinks huh. That's a potential sex slave but legal so he takes steps. First he tries Tonks because why not give cuckoldry a shot because what's the wosrt that could happen when you can just kill one of the participants and replace them but then that gets fucked up because tonka is incompetant so he decides that if you need the job done right you need to di it yourself and kills her to take her place in scar slave's bed. Unfortunately Andromeda notices so he has to do the same to her. So at this point we've got at least 5 sub-Dumbledore's running around to get Dumbledore prime's rocks off but we don't know from where in the time stream each Dumbledore is or whether there are more around we haven't found out about and maybe evern some that the Dumbledore's don't know about because obliteriating yourself is high fashion for wizards which realy explains the state of their schooling if you think about it.

Does that help with the frustration?

*** Tonks was the best part tbh. /spoiler warning!!!/ At first I really hated the whole Amanda subplot but the Tonks reveal was awesome. I wish it would be double thing you're talking about, but I gotta say I'm not sure. I have a sense from the writing that it might just be Tonks falling in love with Harry, tho what you're talking about sounds way more interesting. Not that we will ever know :(

** Yeah I was following it while it was still updating. He went through about 2 months of updating every second Sunday, then went dark for about 8 months. Then he did the same again for about 3 months, I used to love coming home on those second Sundays anticipating a new chapter, then he just stopped again. Been nearly 2 years now, I still nurse a tiny bit of hope that he will come back to it, but it is one of those stories that is slightly painful to think about. It would be so much better if it was a shitty story, but it really hit all the right notes, and he was so close to getting to the meaty part of the story, its what makes it so bittersweet to read.
