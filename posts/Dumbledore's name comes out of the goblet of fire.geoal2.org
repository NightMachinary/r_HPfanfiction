Has anyone ever run into a fic where this happened? I can see it maybe in a time travel fic or some other way of having future knowledge and it gets arranged. Let see them go oh there is nothing to be done, it's magic contract will just have to compete then.

Bonus points for both Harry and Dumbledore's coming out of the goblet.

Edit: someone found this one about to read it any others

*** Okay so I'm not sure if this fic has that happen at all since it mainly focuses pre-Hogwarts, but for anyone thinking about reading that particular fic, it arbitrarily descends into pedophilia and semi-smut child orgies halfway through. Literally six year old children having sex with each other. Better to stay away

It's a shame too because until that came out of the blue it was really well-done

  Hermione dies to a surprise attack just before walking off into the sunset and wakes up to find out that her life up until now has been a video game or at least that's what all of the signs are pointing to. This is her attempt to play through the game as other characters so that she can try to get brought back to life.

  AU, taking place during GoF. How Harry fulfilled the prophecy without ever learning about it: He is given a weapon and gets creative with it. The Dark Lord doesn't know, and never will.

  Hermione realizes that some nonsense will inevitably befall Harry on Halloween 1994 and decides to soften the blow by inviting two more unwilling Champions to the Tournament: Peter Pettigrew and Tom Riddle. [Parody. Crack. Oneshot. Ron, Dumbledore, and Fudge bashing.]

** I didn't know that as I never truly read it. Eg i never even finished the first chapter. Summary made it look interesting and my keyword search from the OP request made it seem like it would match. It's one of the 110 fics that I downloaded because I thought it might be interesting but haven't read yet.

Though are you sure this is the fic you are talking about? I did a quick search on various words that are typically in explicit fics and there were very few hits and many words didn't have a single hit. And the words that did hit they were not part of a sex scene.
