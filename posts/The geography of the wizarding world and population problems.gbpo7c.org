This post isn't about wizarding Britain, because every time it's talked about there's always an unsettled conflict about how big the population is. Rather, I'm curious about how wizards refer to countries. For example, we know that there's Transylvania addressed as a seperate country at least, and in the Muggle world, it certainly isn't. Neville's uncle goes to Assyria. No one can deny that there aren't Assyrians nor an Assyria, but it isn't a country now. The region no longer bears that name. Nowadays there's well over 1 million Assyrians.[[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_population_by_country&ved=2ahUKEwiwh46quJPpAhXt1uAKHV5vA1AQFjAaegQIExAB&usg=AOvVaw0Q7GwyoZM1gpWFrx4ygh_Y&cshid=1588362770631][source]] . I'm not sure how this holds up but there just be a magical community there. Assyria is not the problem however, even though it (along with Transylvania) does raise questions about it's wizarding population. What confused me is Liechtenstein and Andorra.

Andorra's population is very low compared to the UK, and in 1994, we can assume the population is around [[https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Andorra&ved=2ahUKEwjd_9LMuZPpAhUvyoUKHVSfDnIQFjANegQIAhAC&usg=AOvVaw3_OArdJPjOizJ49vjqzDmy][60 000 individuals]] . With the UK, whether the population is 20,000-40,000 (the figures most often thrown about), there's good reason for a Ministry of Magic. And factoring the population at that time, let us say around [[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2009/oct/21/uk-population-data-ons][58 million]] , that's a really small percentage from 0.034% to 0.069%. If we apply this to Andorra at that time, we only get 20 to 41 individuals. Why does this need a ministry?! That's a very large family. Why, I guarantee that if were to count my extended family, it's over 50 people.

#+begin_quote
  "Now, if you could bring me that memo from the /Andorran/ Minister of Magic, I think I will have time to draft a response..."

  Barty Crouch, GOF
#+end_quote

I can imagine Crouch stressed out while the Andorran minister is sitting with his family. An old dude, well into his two hundreds with his large family eagerly anticipating the reply from Crouch, gathered around his feet. I'm not making this up, there's an entire ministry for Andorra.

Then there's the issue of Liechtenstein. It has an even lower population than Andorra, and yet it has a Quidditch team and a fan club for its augurey. It was also called upon for an ICW meeting. We also know there's a Transylvania and an Assyria but why do we not have Persia still around for example? Why can't we say that Ethiopia is still referred to as Abyssinia? Where do we draw the line for when the borders for magical folk end? The only way we solve the problem of Andorra is by three options:

a) The distribution for wizardkind differs from region to region as a percentage of the overall population of a country. For example, let us say X country is at 0.05% while another one is at 0.7% and some countries even stand at 1% of a total population. Some have been strong enough to endure historical events, and even when in the Muggle world the region doesn't bear the name, the magical population stands strong as a seperate entity.

b) There are far more witches and wizards in the world and thus, the magical population of the UK is well over 50,000 witches and wizards. I do not have a problem with there being a ministry and a whole legal system because wizards differ vastly from muggles, but at 60 people for Andorra, it's frankly ridiculous. With the case of the UK even at 3,000 (as per Rowling), they require a legal body just for obliviators alone, because a few stray individuals can cause a lot of trouble.

c) Andorra doesn't actually have a ministry in the official sense of the word but because of formalities, Crouch refers to him as the Minister. It may be just a little secluded village somewhere no one knows about in Andorra, and entirely withdrawn from muggles, so it's like a much larger Hogsmeade. Because not every country has to be an emulation of wizarding Britain.


** Canonically, we don't really know - for instance, I don't believe that we have a map of the Wizarding World, and from the way it's canonically organized (Statute of Secrecy in the 17th century + the way there's only a handful of major schools), it'd seem likely that the borders of Wizarding states would be very different from our current day ones. (For illustration, [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/1700_CE_world_map.PNG][here]] is Wikipedia's map for the year 1700, a decade after the Statute of Secrecy).

It's likely that even before that point, Wizarding and Muggle political entities would have diverged, too - certainly since then. However, canon doesn't go into it... which is a /good/ thing. JKR is very bad at numbers, and not good at all with painting over swathes of the world in a weirdly singular way (eg - Britain gets a school, whereas the rest of Europe only gets two, and each of North America, South America, Asia, and Africa each have only a single school... which makes no sense at all.

So, I think the canonical approach was that JKR decided she wanted foreign officials/teams, and just picked and chose from existing ones or regions, without really thinking/planning how it'd be in comparison to RL populations.

For fanfic purposes, I think it's fair/fine to throw aside an examination of canon and just redo it from scratch for everywhere outside the British isles - it's all vague enough, and badly enough made, that I don't see a need to try to reconcile it.

Number wise, I'm also all for turning the numbers way up, since JKR has an admitted poor grasp of numbers. However, population distribution doesn't strike me as something that would be constant throughout the world - seems to me like, particularly after the Statute of Secrecy, wizards and witches would have congregated together. So wizarding Andorra might just have happened, through a quirk of history, to have been a safer place for wizards to congregate. (Eg, maybe during the French Revolutionary/Napoleonic wars, a bunch of wizards/witches ran off to Andorra to stay a bit more out of it and ended up sticking around). The small principalities throughout Europe might have just been a more promising way to stay away from muggle affairs - or, alternatively, we could justify their continued existence as due to Wizards/Witches using magic to stop larger muggle countries from invading or caring about those regions.

***** I'm not certain - while a competent adult wizard/witch would be able to get away, the children wouldn't - and I'm not entirely certain on how well educated/competent most magic users would have been at that time (eg, in the canon timeline, there's a lot of wizards who can't manage a decent shield charm. Four centuries earlier, would that have been more widespread or easier?) Wasn't it also the whole point of the Statute of Secrecy?

At the very least, even if we take the idea that they were useless towards wizards/witches, it would still be an inconvenience.

******* Accidental magic is not something consistent, though. It certainly can help protect someone, but can it do so repeatedly? Eg, Harry turned his aunt into a Zeppelin, sure. But he didn't turn /everyone/ into one - and it only takes one other person stabbing him for it to end badly for the wizarding child.

It's also, to my understanding, the canonical explanation for the Statute of Secrecy (persecution by the muggles). I know that the severity of it does seem to waver in canon (there's one wizard that seemed to like getting burned, IIRC, and repeatedly made sure to get himself arrested for it - but it's also used as wizards being worried enough to go into hiding)

I've always assumed these are just the biggest, best known schools, but there are many smaller schools all over the world. I also think there would be places that have a master-apprentice system instead of schools.

** I think it's likely that wizards tend to group together, in Britain it's Diagon, Hogsmeade, Godrics Hollow, Ottery St Catchpole and a few other places with a high concentration. Except for these hotspots most of Britain has almost no wizards. Andorra might have a pocket of wizards similarly sized to Hogsmeade or so. Mostly wizards from all over the Pyrenees that go to Andorra for shopping and socializing because it's the nearest wizarding place.

Edit: Maybe the reason there's a hotspot in Andorra and not in a village twenty miles outside of it is because of economics. To make cooperation easy wizarding governments share the same borders as their muggle counterparts, and all wizarding governments have to enforce secrecy in their own territory, which includes obliviating muggles and taking care of magical creatures and plants, all of which is expensive. Since Andorra is tiny they can have a much smaller secrecy budget than France or Spain. Lower government expenditures means lower taxes, which means that wizards want to do business there. Thanks to Apparition any wizard within several hundred miles of Andorra can easily go there for shopping. This means that despite having a relatively small population, Andorra would have a huge area around it where wizards might live outside but shop and work in the country. Because of it being a business hub it'd also have a disproportionately large permanent wizarding population. Even if it's just a few hundred wizards, it'd need a permanent government capable of enforcing secrecy, because if they don't they'll just be absorbed into France or Spain and it's bye-bye tax haven. France and Spain are probably not happy about Andorra siphoning away from their economies but neither is willing to let the other take it. The ICW doesn't care who runs it as long as secrecy is secure.

Tl;dr: A little worldbuilding on magical Andorra based on economics and politics.

** The world (muggle) population has grown a lot in the past few centuries, at different rates in different places, and there's no reason to assume the magical population grew at the same rates. So if wizards were around the same % of the population everywhere ~1000 years ago, the %'s could be completely different today. Although that still wouldn't really explain Lichtenstein or Andorra.

Or it's possible that wizarding populations in different areas have little or no relationship with muggle population #'s either today or historically. Wizarding transportation was way more efficient until airplanes were invented, so maybe wizards moved around a lot historically and concentrated in different areas for reasons completely unrelated to why those places have X muggle population.

For Assyria vs Persia... they're the same place, really. [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Map_of_Assyria.png][Assyria in 671 BC]] vs [[https://www.persiansarenotarabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/empire-banner-1.jpg][Persia in 485 BC]] Persia was larger but you can't really have both because the 'core' of both empires was more or less the same place (Fertile Crescent).

*** I think you're a bit off. Although both Persia and Assyria were empires at some time, and the Fertile Crescent got taken over by them, they are also both specific, different regions. Instead of taking their borders at high points (the Neo-Assyrian empire and the Achaemenid Empires), it's more precise to look at the regions (or their more 'core' territory).

Persia is further east - it's just the old western name for Iran, or the various kingdoms/empires associated with such (Achaemenid Persia, Parthia, the Sasanids, etc). Assyria was a sub-portion of the Fertile crescent, centered around the ancient city of Nineveh - something like the extent of Assyria in [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Ancient_Egypt_and_Mesopotamia_c._1450_BC.png][this map]] is closer to how 'Assyria proper' might be. It's hard to say, because the ancient near east had a lot of peoples, and thus a lot of regions - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Near_East#/media/File:Ancient_Orient.png][here's]] another breakdown of it with general groups, though depending on the time period one entity or another might occupy larger portions. I know Assyria got used as a regional term well afterwards, though, to cover that rough area within Iraq.
