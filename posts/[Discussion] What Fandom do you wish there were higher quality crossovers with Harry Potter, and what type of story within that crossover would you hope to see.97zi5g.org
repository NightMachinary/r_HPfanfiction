** Game of Thrones.

Ideally I would love to see a young Harry (maybe 4th year after or during the Triwizard), being thrust into the GoT universe. His limited pool of magic would make some problem solving more interesting than him being a fully grown, fully capable Auror (or similar). He'd still be an incredibly powerful being, as even WIngardium Leviosa alone would allow him to cheat his way through Westeros.

There are two stories I would love to see him being engaged in. Either Jon Snow's or Daenerys Targaryen's.

Some points I'd think would be interesting for him would be:

- Saving Ygritte
- Becoming a dragon rider
- Saving Sansa much sooner
- confront the warlocks
- and so on andso forth...

*** I had two ideas.

1) Young Harry (and others if you want) are dropped off in GOT hundreds of miles north of the wall. The closer they get to the wall, the more their magic fades.

2) same premise as above but the entirety of hogwarts is transported north of the wall when Harry is 11. This starts about 5 years before GOT events. Once again, they can't go south of the wall with magic.

**** This reminds me of the Old Kingdom/Abhorsen series; Charter magic is much weaker when you get into Ancelstierre, a non-magical country separated from the Old Kingdom by a vast wall. Having magic reduce in efficacy would be a nice mechanic, especially if he has to go to King's Landing, Dorne or across the sea to meet with influential people.

**** I was thinking something along the lines of finding out that wizard magic comes from the sun somehow and once you get far enough away from the Sol system's sun magic stops working.

This presents unique opportunities however. If you can capture someone and drag them to the Sol system you can magic them up. I also like the idea that portkeys work even at galactic distances but they're a one way trip because they stop working as soon as you get there. This makes Sol a new type of smuggling because you go there and then portkey your cargo to where you actually want it.

Cerberus could be a magical organization. Statute of secrecy could be a thing of the past and everyone knows about magic. What would the rules be for organizations when magic exists? If a Wizard uses the imperious on someone and stays in the Sol system, that spell keeps working and the wizard just tells them to follow the orders of their handler. To the STG something like that would mean visiting the Sol system is "this is your last job because you're not with the organziation anymore once you return" type of thing.

***** I don't think that would be enjoyable, because a Harry Potter fic /must/ have magic as an integral part of it's story. To have magic tossed out in 99% of locations would reduce it to a Mass Effect story with a powerless wizard.

  Harry Potter finds himself, and his normal bi-polar luck, pulled out of a quiet retirement and into the limelight of the 23rd century. He finds a grand new stage upon which his 'saving-people-thing' can act, and before he can say no, is pulled into the middle of a galaxy-spanning conflict. Rated 'M' for bad words and eventual sexy shenanigans, re-worked and re-posted. Enjoy.

Also there is nowhere near enough hot Warhammer 40K action. Which is terribly sad because Harry Potter fan fiction can lend itself exceptionally well to grimdark. Just imagine Dumbledore looking all sad and telling young Harry "In the grim darkness of the future there is only war"

** You know, what I really want to read is a story where Harry gets thrust into another fandom and just really, really doesn't interact with said fandom's main cast outside of blink-and-you-miss-it cameos.

I've been working on them and, fair enough, they're actually really challenging to write effectively, as you're trying to write about Harry actually being in the Universe of the day rather than in a Hogwarts with ray guns and space ships.

Ideas so far include (along with fandom):

Harry becoming a merchant in a feudalistic setting. This can work for Naruto, the Avatar series and, funnily enough, Game of Thrones. Just Harry selling stuff to different villages, cities and states whilst having his canon-typical luck come into play. It's challenging because being a merchant in such a situation is a very tetchy career choice. Sure, Harry is basically free to roam, but nobody's going to be particularly surprised if he dies going from point a to point b one day... and their surprise at seeing him alive reflects that.

Harry gets thrown into an Isekai without your normal Isekai's plot armour. The girls think he looks weird, the ROB hates him, his command of the language is basic, his gear is shit and his physical condition isn't anything to write home about. Basically, he's got the survival prospects of a jellyfish sucked into a jet turbine. Yeah, he survives, but it's always by the skin of his teeth. Could feature Harry's epic and injury/trauma-filled climb to the middle ranks of your average low-level guild in a dungeon setting, for example.

Basically, pick any Isekai and apply that premise to it. It'll immediately blow the competition out of the water, I can guarantee it.

Harry getting thrust into star wars/halo/etc... and being forced to take the equivalent of a space bus for a long time instead of jumping into the story with a spaceship ready to go. Even Star Wars doesn't hand ships out like candy to random humanoids from barbarian planets that haven't even gotten FTL down yet. A space ship, especially one that can travel faster than light, isn't something you can just learn at the drop of a hat-which virtually every fic ever set in space just handwaves away. Training for piloting one of those takes months, maybe even years, before someone can truly say they can pilot a ship (let alone captain one, which is a whole other plate of chips). There's a bewildering array of things to learn Harry's never heard of before and he just jumps into one and manages to get it off the ground on his first try? And then plays GTA with spaceships? Seriously, reading a fic where Harry actually has to learn shit before flying off into the great unknown would be a wonderful change. Star Wars, Honor Harrington, The Culture, basically any setting where FTL-capable small vessels exist.

Harry the magic detective that knows magic, not forensic techniques. Again, he has to learn them. Again, it takes a long-ass time to do so. Again, it would actually make things so much better, especially if he gets into an argument with the lab techs and is sometimes proven wrong. NCIS, Dresden Files, Castle, Lucifer, you get the idea-cop shows with a sense of humour because Law & Order was basically as dry as mummified salted cod from the word go.

Harry the criminal. Not a rogue. Not a scoundrel. Not a cad. Harry steals stuff to survive and assuages his guilt by going out and becoming a vigilante/good samaritan when he's not playing cat burglar. Best places for this-the Dredd Universe, because why not? Ghost in the Shell, where he has to deal with the cops' techno-magic fuckery. Dishonored, where he repents his wicked ways because Corvo spends his downtime trolling the criminal populace with how much better he is at their job than they are, which leads to sticky situations for one Potter.

Harry just doesn't give a shit. Harry gets plonked into the main plot line, sees the young up-and-coming heroes getting into their epic quest and... sits down in front of a crystal ball, grabs some popcorn and watches the show from a safe distance. I really don't care where it goes from there, but the thought of 5-6 chapters of Harry pulling an MSTK 3000 on the protagonists as he watches from his heavily warded bunker in the middle of Siberia strikes me as hilarious. Apply to: Every YA novel ever.

And finally, the one fandom I would love to actually see-an HP/STALKER series crossover. Not Harry goes to X, but The Zone comes to the HP 'verse and is centered around an important magical location rather than Pripyat (though not Hogwarts). Features Harry stuck in The Zone with some crazy, gun-toting muggles who completely ignore his ability to do magic because that Artyom kid was running around with a psychic baby alien, so cast away mini-Gandalf!

Can be used as a crossover for STALKER, METRO, Gravity Falls weirdly enough, Welcome to Night Vale, Stranger Things, It and the grand-daddy of them all, 'Roadside Picnic', the book by the Strugatsky brothers.

And that's it folks.

*** I do remember reading a pretty fun story, where an amnesiac 11th Doctor ended up in control of eleven year old Harry's body. He didn't have his memory, and yet his mannerisms and way of behavior are just incredibly in character that the fic is honestly one of my favorite stories. The MC really does behave like the 11th Doctor would upon landing in an unfamiliar, but fascinating new culture; so much so that it ends up reading like a particularly good, particularly long Doctor Who arc.

** Harry Potter/Star Wars, where magic isn't clearly superior to the Force, at least in a fight. linkffn(8501689) is reasonably good about keeping magic and the Force roughly balanced - Harry is formidable moreso because his abilities are exotic and unknown - but he's still arguably the deadliest single being in the galaxy and certainly in the top five. Something where it's more even, where an experienced Harry is roughly on-par with an ordinary Jedi (rather than the very top-end) would be sweet.

This might require a younger Harry, one less trained in magic before joining the Star Wars world, but I'd still love to see it.

** The Magicians, by Lev Grossman. I haven't gotten around to reading all of the books, but I love the syfy series, and the potential for high quality crossovers is insane. Just the possible interactions between the two magic systems is incredible.

My personal head-canon has always been that the magic portrayed in the Magicians, is actually magic as practiced by muggles, which is why it's so hard, why they have to memorize Circumstances, and why it can get "cut off" (like how houses can get their power cut); they're manipulating an external force instead of using an in-born power. This would help explain the Statue of Secrecy, why wizards don't rule over muggles, and how muggles ever could have been a threat; muggles have numbers, and their top 10 or 5 percent is smart enough to be magicians (in the books you have to be a genius to be a true magician), and magicians, while practicing magic that is often slower and less showy than wizards, can pull of some pretty intense stuff (like literally summoning gods, explaining how witch hunts and church inquisitions could have gone very badly for wizards).

The story I'd most like to read is some strange tale where Dudley, by some miracle, is born smart enough to be enrolled at Brakebills, and calls up Harry like "Hi, I kind of got to kill a Beast to help save a magical world; you've done this before, any tips?". But honestly any story about a magician wandering into the magical world, or a wizard wandering into the Magicians world, would do.

The two series have power levels that interact so strangely with another. On one hand, teleporting is a standard power in HP, and a unique power in the Magicians, possessed only by Travellers. So on that front wizards look stronger. But in the Magicians travellers can literally port to different planets and planes of existence. Fairly high level wizard objects are things like the Cloak, and the Elder wand, with the most useful daily life powerful object being a Time-Turner. The Magicians version of a Time Turner can create possibly endless time loop, in which it is possible to actually change time.

It's like, in the Magicians, everything is far more difficult than in HP, making HP wizards far more versatile. But on the other hand, the sheer level of power a Magician can exert with enough prep time is nothing to sneeze at. But I've yet to find a fic like that, so I guess I"ll have to write it xD

*** I've never even thought of crossing those two particular stories, but now that you mentioned it I'd love to read it. Maybe integrated like you've written, maybe just harry teleporting or some traveler teleporting him in the magicians world. But it'd definitely br interesting that's for sure

** One that AFAIK, nonexisting, which is HP/Red Rising Trilogy. I want to see the Red Rising-verse and Darrow being confronted with the possibility of magic, and how that changes the course of the books, lets say, Darrow found Harry out during the Institute, Harry might be in one of the houses, though the most sensical one for him to be would be Pluto, but that's Jackal's house. Or even Mars itself, play some part because of Harry's past.

Also, would have to give Harry the same Gold makeover that Darrow got. Perhaps the Sons found a "person" that was kept in a cryogenic stasis (exactly like in "Brown Coat, Green Eyes, which is the inspiration for this rabbit.) for future emergencies within the magical world, but something went wrong because the Golds somehow killed all the wizards in secret, so Harry would have a motive against them.

Just please, for the love of god, NO slash. Even if it seems lke the logical choice considering there's Roque, Cassius and Sevro as possible partners that could fit quite easily. Darrow would be more a strech considering we already know he's doing everything cuz of Eo.

Anyways, that's my ideia for a HP/RS.

What I want is more HP/Inheritance Cycle fics.

AFAIK the only 4 good ones or even remotely interesting (though both BCaL and BWaC are fantastic, imo) which are By Courage and Love, By Wisdom and Courage (2 different but with the same start and premise, authorized by the original writer) To Train a Dragon Rider and the one where Harry merges with Shruikan.

Sure, there's more fics, but none are remotely good and as interesting. I want a fic where the different branches of magic are exploited and explained, similar to how it works on BWaC and a bit less in BCaL. With romance because I'm a sucker for romance... Even would work with a femHarry dragon animagus that when teleported to Alagaesia gets captured mid book 3 by Galbatorix and then he learns her ability to shapeshift and forces her through his different and unknown magic (to her, at the time) to copulate with both Thorn and Murtaugh as a way to guarantee not only his obedience but his loyalty, but ofc firing backwards as Murtaugh and Thorn both change their true names due to their love or their hate against Galbatorix, granting them leeway to escape with her in tow. IDK, just seemed like a interesting point. A book fought with a witch that isn't a rider, but "has" a dragon, Eragon and Murtaugh side by side way before the final battle.

Thats it. Oh, and please, could someone write a good fucking femHarry/Percy Jackson, please.

** I'd like to see a realistic Harry Potter falling into Middle Earth cross over. I just want something like Home with the fairies linkffn(6024634) where everything is gross, no one speaks English (And there's no convenient "translation charms") and they don't just fall directly into the lap of the nine walkers and immediately have romantic chemistry with Legolas or whatever. But instead of a normal human it's a Wizard/Witch at OWL level proficiency who is suddenly whisked away to Middle Earth. It doesn't even have to be a known character. In fact I would prefer an average Hufflepuff protagonist (Pureblood with little understanding of muggles to play up that initial confusion about where/when he is).

But most of the ones I've looked at feature Harry as a hardened post war veteran and powerful duelist use to fighting and being the chosen one destined to defeat great evil and already use to roughing it due to his horcrux hunt. There's little room for character growth

*** Might not be exactly what you're looking for, but it is one of the best crossovers I've found linkffn(The Shadow of Angmar by SteelBadger). IIRC it doesn't feature a superpowered harry, the worldbuilding is fantastic. There's little to no romance that I can recall, and it isn't set during the time of the fellowship.

  The Master of Death is a dangerous title; many would claim to hold a position greater than Death. Harry is pulled to Middle-earth by the Witch King of Angmar in an attempt to bring Morgoth back to Arda. A year later Angmar falls and Harry is freed. What will he do with the eternity granted to him? Story begins 1000 years before LotR. Eventual major canon divergence.

*** Try Not Quite a Maia by KarasAunty - it doesn't have Harry falling into middle earth, but it DOES have Neville, Molly, and a wonderful third character galavanting through in ab absolutely magical and well-written masterpiece. If you know LotR lore, you'll love it!

Rating: PG-13 Middle Earth has a problem: Gandalf the Grey is AWOL in Time and Space after destroying the Balrog of Khazad-dum. But who will take his place in the Quest to defeat the Dark Lord Sauron? Not who you think... HP/LOTR Crossover. Wildly AU! UK English.

I know nothing about LotR, but I'll take a look at what you just linked because it sounds interesting.

** Well I for once can't complain about the quality of some of the story's in the Harry Potter Percy Jackson crossover pool.

Both fandoms have great writers and some of the crossover are written well. Others not so much and i am at a point where I can't find any more good of them.

Generally I would say the fandomes mix well and there is a lot of potential that gets picked up by some writers.

But what I would like to see are some PJ/HR story's because I feel like there are some greate plot opportunities but there are non of them. At least I could not find one
