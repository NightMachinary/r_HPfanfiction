One of them to me is A Cadmean Victory, when Harry goes internet Edgelord. Or when people write an overly French Fleur.


** I don't know if it was meant to be funny, but one line about Snape's biceps toned from all the cauldron-lifting in an otherwise great hurt/comfort romantic fic almost made me unable to read the rest.

makes you imagine a whole different, more stamina-oriented potions class. Hope they focus on Cores.

** I had to drop quite a lot of the fics in the angst genre because I couldn't stop myself from laughing. There's a line that, if crossed, makes a tragedy hilarious if it becomes overly exaggerated and stops being believable. So I'm just sitting there thinking /"Oh, Vernon ate Hedwig? What's next, did they use Harry's picture album as toilet paper? Maybe Dudley cuckolded him? Come on, pull the other one"/ at what the author intended to be an emotional moment.

I needed that laugh. You're right though. Maybe they'll use his broom as mulch for the garden too.

It gets ridiculous. Of course, if I read a fic where Vernon ate Hedwig, I'd probably bookmark it for being hilarious.

** Not exactly a character, but more character death. I was reading a post-war fic written before DH, It went into the "Hermione lost her parents" trope. That in itself that is not uncommon, if you want to write a fic without her having parental guidance. Common ways this usually happen are Death Eaters killing them, Hermione's spells being irreversible, or even just the occasional random occurrences (Heart attack, car crash, etc). This fic fell in the latter category, them suffering an accident, and compared to how it normally is it was unintentionally hilarious.

They both died in a FLIPPING SKIING ACCIDENT. Not Death Eaters or memory charms gone wrong but instead THEY MANAGED TO KILL THEMSELVES ON VACATION. Not how the author intended it to be taken, but in comparison to how they usually are lost is just plain funny.

*** Speaking of deaths, in The Archeologist, a fic that occasionally gets recommended here, Harry's twin sister Rose acts in Lily's stead: Voldemort tells her to stand aside (at Pettigrew's request, who was her godfather), but she doesn't and willingly gives her life for her brother. Adult Harry who reincarnates into that world muses about it and feels humbled by her sacrifice.

She was *one year old* at the time. It's entirely too ridiculous to be taken seriously.

******* Snape pleas with Voldemort to spare Lilly, Voldemort agrees, unknowingly entering into a sort of pseduo-magical-contract. When Voldemort betrays that contract by killing Lilly, Voldemort is cursed in a way when things directly concern Harry Potter. It would be neat if Snape had intentionally set this sort of thing up, like a "at best James and Harry die and Lilly comes to me for comfort, at worst, Harry lives and Voldemort is cursed" kind of thing.

I also like [[/u/starfox5]] 's take in linkffn(12592097), where Lilly uses blood magic, with herself as the sacrifice, to protect Harry.

  AU. Framed as a thief and expelled from Hogwarts in her second year, her family ruined by debts, many thought they had seen the last of her. But someone saw her potential, as well as a chance for redemption - and Hermione Granger was all too willing to become a lady thief if it meant she could get her revenge.
