I really love fanfiction, and have read a huge amount of stories. What I am looking for is something I haven't already read. I ship Remus/Sirius, Sirius/Hermione and Remus/Hermione. I can also handle Harry/Hermione and Sirius/Harry(in or out of family setting) if they're well written. Pretty much anything is cool with me, including marauder's era, marriage law and time travel. So, if anyone could help me out with some harder to find fiction, that would be awesome. Thanks!


** You probably haven't read [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] considering it's a short oneshot of Dennis Creevey taking pictures after the war. Boring, right? No, instead, it slams into you like a freight train.

I don't really have any hard to find recs for your pairings, but if you click on my name and look through my previous posts, you should find something longer you haven't read yet. I particularly recommend [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/1/Forging-the-Sword][Forging The Sword]]

And here's a few things I haven't recced yet because they're not up to my usual standards, but you've probably worked through most of those already. These are my almost recommendable stories.

Note: None of the stories have slash pairings because I don't read slash. So someone else will have to rec those stories to you.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3571753/1/The-World-As-We-Knew-It][The World As We Knew It]]

The summary: "Destroy the Horcruxes---that's Harry's goal, until an Aperio throws him and two other unknown people into a world where the prophecy never existed, his parents and Sirius are alive, and Ginny went to Azkaban for opening the Chamber. Canon pairings, preDH."

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5725656/1/Fate-s-Favourite][Fate's Favourite]]

The summary: "You always get the stories where Harry goes back into Tom Riddle's time, then either stays or gets sent back. End of, unless he tries to make Voldemort good. But what if thing's went differently? What if, just once, someone followed a time traveller back?"

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time To Spare]]

Harry and Draco get sent back in time to the first war and wind up working together to try and stop it. This story gets dark, but it's decent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8490518/1/Error-of-Soul][Error of Soul]]

Harry/Hermione story making fun of all the soul bond fics out there. Decent length, but incomplete.

That's all I got for now.

*** I dumped my HUGE favourites list for specific stories, but I'll hook you up with some of my favourite authors:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/866426/Children-of-the-Shadows]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178165/picascribit]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1546225/remuslives23]] [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/veeagainst/pseuds/veeagainst]] [[http://archiveofourown.org/users/rageprufrock/pseuds/rageprufrock/works?fandom_id=136512]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1855510/angelically-devilish]] [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/809459/LadySeradeRETURNS]]

There are a lot more I like but if you look at their favourite stories and authors, there's lots!!

I tend to use FF.net a lot and search through there. Granger Enchanted is pretty good, too.
