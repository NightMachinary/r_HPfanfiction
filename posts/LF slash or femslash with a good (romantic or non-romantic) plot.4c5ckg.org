Every time I try to look for these it's 95% just smut. I'm thinking something along the lines if Always and Always or Delenda Est but f/f or m/m if possible?

Femslash especially! So hard to find. Odd pairings welcome.

Edit: Didn't really want to reply to everyone because I'll basically be saying the same thing, but thank you so much and please know that I appreciate your recs very much!


** Philosophize writes great stories involving f/f pairings.

** Oh, you're looking for a femslash version of Delenda Est? I have /just/ the right fic for you. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7410369/1/Time-Heals-All-Wounds][Time Heals All Wounds]] is a fantastic Hermione/Bellatrix fic that far surpasses Delenda Est in writing quality, pacing, plot, and emotional torque, and unlike Delenda Est, it has a brilliant, gut-wrenching ending. It has a total of one somewhat explicit sex scene - in the midst of 52 chapters of non-sex. Another great non-smut femslash fic is [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/897183][The Letter]], which is Hermione/Ginny post-war. Also, [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/1178165/picascribit][Picascribit]] has a /ton/ of great Remus/Sirius stories.

--------------

Since this is [[/r/HPFanfiction]], I hesitate to rec anything from other fandoms, but if you know anything about the Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus series, there is an /amazing/ Reyna/Annabeth fic called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1168965][How Deep is the River]]. Just thought I'd add that in.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6486690/1/Rebirth][Rebirth]] was pretty good. It's a pseudo!Harry/Tom because Harry isn't actually Harry.

I remember thinking that [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again][Again and Again]] was okay, but not fantastic, but you might want to try it. Harry/Voldemort.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2580283/1/Saving-Connor][The Sacrifices Arc]] is also good, and Harry/Draco.

That's all I've got because I don't read much slash, and there isn't very much good femslash.

I've seen Saving Connor recommended many times, and tried to read it. And then I dropped it around 1/3 of the way. Nothing really happened, only Harry and Draco were fleshed out in any way, and info about both were rather repetitive. Author managed to make Harry's upbringing really creepy, but aside from this?

So does it get better? Do I miss something? Or is it just one of the things that are popular, but bad?

**** It depends on what you mean by 1/3 of the way through. If you only got part way into Saving Connor, than you didn't get nearly far enough to form an opinion on the story. If you mean you read 1,000,000 words of the series, than, no, it probably doesn't change much and you just don't like it.

It does tend to get repetitive with Harry, but that's justifiable given his character. If you don't like it, you don't like it, but that doesn't make it bad.

And nearly 30k words should be more than enough for story to get on its feet. So while you are right that the fact that I don't like it doesn't make it bad, the fact that the story has many flaws while not really offering anything makes it bad.

******** I'm sorry, but you're wrong. In a single novel, yes, 100 pages is generally the amount people suggest for deciding if you think something is good or bad, but this is not a single novel. It's more like twenty. You simply cannot get anywhere close to an actual opinion of a series when you've read less than 1% of it. Look at other fantasy for examples. Very few people will tell you that the first books of A Wheel of Time, The Malazan Book of the Fallen, or The Dresden Files is representative of the whole series.

That's not to say he can't decide to stop at any point. If he doesn't like it by 100 pages, there's nothing wrong with saying he doesn't like it and stopping. However, he can't say he's formed a valid opinion on it's quality at that point.

**** The pacing slows down tremendously as the series goes on. It's a seven year series and the last two years take up nearly half of it.

One of the things that I liked about it -- though "like" is probably the wrong word -- is how the author tried to give the impression of an elaborate set of pureblood rituals but wasn't quite smooth enough to sell it. The result was a number of overly specific rituals and traditions that Harry (of course) could read instantly. If we project from what we saw to the complete set of rituals and traditions, purebloods would read Burke's Peerage and practice the language of flowers just to take a break from the rote memorization and symbolism.

There are some awesome moments in it and some neat ideas, but the author needed to pare it all down.

** Saving this thread, as we appear to have very similar tastes!

As for recs, I will happily recommend you towards the works of Copperbadge, who is not (to my knowledge) on ff.n. linkao3(Cartographer's Craft by copperbadge) is an alternative seventh year, Harry/Sirius with time-travelling Sirius. There's a bit of het in it--Remus/Tonks--so if that's really not your thing, then be forewarned. I don't recall anything in there that's above a medium R rating in terms of sex.

His other fic (actually a series!) that I'd recommend is linkao3(Stealing Harry by copperbadge). Remus/Sirius, and shows the process friends -> lovers, in the context of them taking Harry from the Dursleys, and follows through Harry's time at Hogwarts, though alas only in summary form from...fourth or fifth year on, but it does have a conclusion.

Really, go read anything by copperbadge.

Other authors on AO3 I'd recommend include REwrites, picascribit, potatoalchemist/pommedeplume, remuslives23, and LadyFaceElena. All are pretty R/S-centric, but other pairings do occasionally appear. LadyFaceElena in particular has a lot of non-smutty stuff!

I highly recommend the R/S Games as well, yearly contest that puts out a LOT of amazing fic consistently. Their front page is on [[http://rs-games.livejournal.com/][Livejournal]], with the fic mostly archived on Dreamwidth. A lot of the writers post their stuff to AO3 as well.

If any of that strikes your fancy, let me know--I've got lots more recs but am truncating here so as not to overwhelm.

** What, no mention of Those Gilded Chains? In a HP thread requesting F/F? Heresy! linkffn(7755315). Because Bellatrix could have been awesome, and deserved better than to be written as a cookie-cutter mad!sadist!villain who existed to be evil. Often dark, sometimes adorable, slow-burn romance with emphasis on Bellatrix's past. Basically convinced me that Bellamione is worth reading.

linkffn(8587736) In The Long Run. Hermione/Ginny that deals with the desperate repair of a failing relationship, rather than the formation of a new one. A much under-utilised angle when it comes to romance fanfiction, imo.

linkffn(3292970) Image of You: Visceral, painful, but ultimately worth it. Can't believe it's not tagged 'angst'. Well written, but certainly not for the faint of heart.

linkffn(7559031) Witnessed here in Time and Blood: Sweet yet dramatic Fleurmione goodness during DH.

linkffn(6507212) Entwined GoF Fleurmione which remembers Hermione's holiday to France in third year. Something cute and fluffy to take the edge off of Image of You.

Yeah, I know I'm late to the party, but some of these needed to be mentioned.

**** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/community/A-Woman-s-Love-Femslash/90503/99/0/1/0/20/2/0/]]

This community has saved me a lot of trouble on the 'finding femslash' front. It doesn't really have quality control, but there's a crap-ton of various lesbian shipfics collated together. I mean, normally you'd have to go through each individual character combination and try to filter out the obviously awful Harry/Multi crap from the pile. Or, you know, hunt through femslash writers' favourites and the various other tiny communities that gather together like fifty stories tops, and kind of cobble together a collection of readable stuff.

I'm not really that much of a slasher, but I love balanced yet intense, conflicted relationships, and that can be really hard to find in het, especially HHR (my old favourite ship, to my shame). Been meaning to get into reading Drarry, because it always seemed like their antagonism would make for interesting relationship dynamic, but for now Hermione/Pansy and Hermione/Bellatrix are basically my crack cocaine :P

  In a world where Voldemort never existed, Bellatrix Black is a cynical and dour detective working for the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, subdivision Magical Homicides. When she is tasked to solve a murder at Hogwarts, a certain resident genius called Hermione Granger happens to be her prime suspect. AU, Bellamione, liberal amounts of fluff.
