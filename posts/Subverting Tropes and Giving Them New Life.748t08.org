So we can all agree the the HP Fanfiction community has a lot of old tropes and worn out cliches that get used over and over in the same ways, and that we're all more than sick of them in one way or another. I'm talking about things like:

- Lord Potter fics (Harry inherits everything ever and becomes heir to everything ever)
- Creature fics (Harry or someone else finds out they're part *-insert some creature here-* and have to deal with the fallout. Usually Veela or something similar)
- Manipulative Dumbledore or Weasley's (does what it says on the tin really)

So with this in mind, what can we as a community do to make these tropes breath again? They only /became/ tropes because they were well-liked and popular after all, so there is something in them worth looking at. Where can we take some of the old cliche's to make them feel new and interesting again?

Maybe list some tropes you like (or even ones you hate!) in a comment and then give ideas on how to maker them more enjoyable!


** Personally, I'd love to see a subversion of the Lord Potter fic where Harry inherits a few minor things from families wiped out in the last war, and ends up learning about his actual humble family lineage and picks up a skill in tribute; perhaps he opens a small crystal shop later on because one of his great-aunts that was fond of his parents loved crystals and studying them or something.

He doesn't end up mega-rich or with 4309823174 titles, but he gets a neat hobby that might lead to niche-skills and some fun world building instead of absurd politics at age 14.

*** I always liked the idea of the Potter's being the magical equivalent to old world FedEx, the Pot in their name is a reference to what they transported everything around in, mostly because they could enchant them

They were the only Stalls anywhere with fresh fish in the desert, no Salted Fish for Potter Customers, forget wilted plants or leaves for your food or portions, it's all completely fresh. Oh you need to send a item or tool to your family back home or someone on the road? Contact the Potter's and your Husband Son or Brother would have their things in a fortnight rather than several months.

*** Honestly, you could just do that with the Potter family. If you look up their founder, they're hardly high nobility. They've had a few important people in the family though. The first Potter invented a bunch of useful medical potions (and got rich for it), so that could be the skill. Although... that might be a bit too easy to overdo.

It'd also be quite good if the more interesting heritage came from the Evans side, especially if it's not magical.

** We had discussions about subverting Lord Potter trope before. Several people proposed having Harry inheriting tons of silly obligations alongside his titles, such as giving 77 sheep to the descendant of X who was still alive but Harry couldn't find, or marrying the female descendant of Y who turned out to be an insufferable airhead.

**** I'd like to see a fic in which indy!Harry went off on his own and got quickly killed as a result. Manipulative!GreaterGood!Dumbledore had no choice but to step up his own game. He finally dropped his pretense of being a 'nice educator', staged a coup with Amelia Bones, knocked off Death Eaters and their sympathizers in the Ministry, and declared 'total war' on Voldemort.

Every captured Death Eater got supreme Veritaserum and Legilimency treatments, before being executed. Voldemort's horcruxes were quickly reduced to the Snake, after they seized most Death Eater vaults. The Ring claimed several curse breakers, but the Stone was now safely sitting on Dumbledore's desk.

A furious Voldemort lashed out by stepping up his terror attacks. Losses were high on both sides, but with numbers on Dumbledore's side, Voldmort was slowly losing. Fearing for his immortality, Voldemort made one more horcrux, resulting in more lost wits and decision making skills. Eventually, he fell for a trap and was captured. After pushing him through the most grueling interrogation, Dumbledore oblivated Voldemort to his infancy and put him under Draught of Living Death. When the final horcrux was destroyed, they executed him.

** I'd really love a Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Gryffindor-Slytherin-Hufflepuff-Raveclaw fic in which he'd actually have to deal with being that Lord. Just imagine the level of stress and bureaucracy that would bring, not to mention that if we go with that trope, you'd have to manage a /huge/ political responsibility. I'd enjoy if this trope would not end up allowing him to liberate himself, but in turn shackle him down even more to a life of inherited fame, endless paperwork and mindnumbingly boring politics. I wouldn't even care if at the end, Harry would come out of it victorious, as long as his struggle with this would feel like an actual, almost impossible challenge.

In tow with the Lord Potter trope comes one of the tropes I'd really like demolished and rewritten. Harems. Give Harry a harem *but* imagine it as if that really were 7 girls stuck with the same man. First of all, we of course have to have the ones who love Harry. Gotta make this trope be a feel-good one, after all. So we take... Hermione and Daphne (that seems like a favorite combination) to take House Potter and Black. Give Peverell to some edgy OC thats obviously an author self-insert... we call her Sary Mue (her greatest failure is she cares too much for other people), Gryffindor to Ginny, Slytherin to Tracy Davis, Hufflepuff to Susan Bones and Ravenclaw to, of course, Luna. BUT. Now we stop right at the threshold where we would make them cutout characters with no desires, passions or agendas who are only there to underline how great Harry is and let them be /interesting 3-dimensional characters/. Hooooo boy, here we go. First of all, Ginny fucking hates Hermione and Daphne for being best girl. Bitch War 1.0 incoming right there. Hermione starts bossing around people and out of the left corner comes a wild Daphne who uses "Ice Queen-Slytherin-cunning" to divert whatever Hermione wanted into what she wanted. Hermione is furious, Daphne is too. BAM! Susan eventually just fucks off back to her aunt until Harry finally remembers her existence and booty.calls her to make that much needed Hufflepuff heir. Awkward and really weird sex scene included. Tracy Davis gets absolutely overshadowed in every aspect of her being by Daphne and just to add some more conflict is also a lowkey pureblood racist and kinda hates Hermione. Luna is her usual self and just drives everybody up the wall by throwing butterbeer corks at them, or something. And Harry has to fix it among all his other problems. Yay. Optional: He gets some consorts. Lets have some usual ones. Fleur is one, and /of course/ she is a full Veela plus Allure - we are making a trope fic here, after all. Every other girl absolutely hates her because for some reason Harry is rather eager to get that particular babytrain going. And lets be honest here... she is an /unnaturally beautiful Veela/ that melts male brains and even though Harry is our hero here and can withstand /"THE ALLURE^{^{TM"}}/, he's still a hormonal teenage boy who is offered sex with a /unnaturally beautiful woman/. Then you add... ehm... fuckin' Bellatrix Lestrange for some reason. Turns out becoming a consort doesn't erase being a blood purist. Though shit, Hermione. Sorry. End it with Harry just merging all Houses (because thats suddenly a thing) and make the girls fight it out in a magical Battle Royal.

** So a while back someone responded to my issue with Molly miraculously being near Harry to ‘guide' him to 9 3/4 by it being a ‘game' to her youngest.

And I thought about it. Thought oh it's cute. I hadn't thought about it.

But then I thought about it more. Granted this is anecdotal, but I've watched many nieces and nephews as well as friends kids cross the age threshold where playing those games are no longer cute.

Ginny would have been ten. For Molly to play those games, if that was the intent on her end is actually very childish.

I bring all that up to say this.

How do we turn the idea of manipulative Weasleys on its head?

Well. There's a start. The parents/kids accidentally do things around Harry that affect his behavior that can appear manipulative. At the end it's all explained and they all have a big laugh.

Then Harry uses his power to demand retribution and enslaves Ginny.

I kid. They all just still laugh.

***** Speaking of Statute, why would it be risky? Do you listen to random people who say some meaningless words? Or do you just ignore it as something you heard out of context.

What do you mean by the last part? I wasn't suggesting that they're some sort of guides. I was proposing that instead of some genius masterplan to ingratiate themselves with Potter, (plan that would require Potter to just be there, at the right time, and not have gotten guidance from other people who went to 3/4) they instead just happened to see some kid with an owl looking clueless and attracted his attention.

You know basic kindness, without putting in too much effort?

I suppose if you want to put a darker twist to it, you could say that they recognized Potter and only helped him because of it and that they would have ignored him if he was someone else. As in they saw an opportunity and took it. They are not however comic book villains, they dont make complex plans that require many little things going just right.

Its wierd as fuck that they wait til the muggle born are 11 to include them in their world.

Like. Theres clearly history here. And a certain amount of an anachronistic asceticism going on here. Muggle parents can't know how to teach and influence their kid on acceptable behavior in the Wizarding world. Yet these kids will be thrust into that world at 11.

So. Should the Wizarding world take these kids and raise them after birth? The kids would grow up better integrated, certainly. But also ripping families apart.

** Well, there is a basic thing that most of the authors using such tropes don't do and what should always be done. Think through the effect on the world. If you can inherit some cool skills due to your heritage then others besides Harry should do it too. There should be rules that prevent amassing million of votes on one person and if there are not ones, then there should be others who amassed a lot of votes.

Another basic thing is having actual conflict, Lord Potter stories often suck because they are used to make Harry cool and awesome at no effort, manipulative Dumbledore sucks because he is incompetent at being manipulative and eleven years old easily sees through and foils his plans.

It's mostly about execution, about things making sense in the wider picture, etc. But most of the writers who are eager to use tropes do that because they lack imagination and thus lack the imagination to think of consequences of those elements existing in the setting.

** I like Lord Potter Tropes, but rarely find any that are well-written and have progressive plot lines.

I think what makes the Lord Potter ones better is if there is a decent backstory, such as the fanfic Gabriel, which outlines a plausible backstory and there is character growth so that Harry /grows/ into being a Lord but isn't the main plot even. Or the one where Harry is adopted by the Goblins type deal.

I think anything where Harry comes into being Lord through another family by adoption or otherwise early on in his life is best.
