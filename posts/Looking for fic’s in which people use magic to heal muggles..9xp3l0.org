*** I'd probably open a hospital in the muggle world and cure people of stuff, with the one caveat being that ‘you aren't going to remember what I did. When you wake up, you'll be cured'. That way the statute is upheld and all the muggles are obliviated, but when the magical world is eventually discovered I can get remembered as a hero for saving tens of thousands of lives, even if nobody knew how I did it at the time. Plus, it'd be nice to save tens of thousands of lives, and I'm sure I'd also make quite a lot of money.

How will the statute be upheld? You'll be known as a miracle worker within weeks/months, scientists and TV crews everywhere and the ICW will be on your ass hard.

***** Nah. I'm a miracle worker, and if it's tested and experimented on it stops working. I don't know what I do! I just heal people when I'm alone in a room with them, without monitoring. They never seem to remember the time that passes though, there's a flash of light nobody else can see and it's over. I know some higher power has helped them through me.

Pay no attention to the unplotable wand holster on my arm. I can teleport, but It's faith, not ‘magic'.

Let there be a religious argument in the news.

****** Hehe clever, but I think you're pulling a "technically" here. I don't think the ICW is concerned whether you call it "miracles" or "magic" or nothing at all. They don't want any undue exposures of muggles to magic and what you'd be doing is shining a big bright flashlight on it. The ICW won't be concerned whether you consider your plan foolproof or not, while you are blatantly performing magic in front of muggles 24/7.

******* That's fair. I hope they're prepaired to kill me in suspicious circumstances to cover it up though. Best of luck with that. Maybe I'll wait until I'm on live international news and then tell the world the truth. I'll be on liquid lick at the time, of course. Good luck wiping billions of minds, I'd recommend against declaring that act of war on the muggle world, though.

********** Probably a good idea :). A hospital that the patients won't remember a thing will drive a lot of potential patients away.

"If I was violated in there, no one would ever know."

"Would the person that come out even be 'me' anymore? Since my mind would obviously be tampered with."

​

"If they can make me forget the treatment, what else can they erase from my memory?"

Things like that.

Besides, a rogue Healer who is willing to cause worldwide chaos and mass panic to escape capture really doesn't sound that trustworthy, lol.

I'd go a step farther and say anyone with the potential to cure cancer has an ethical obligation to do so. The Magical World is deeply immoral if they refuse to cure cancer simply because doing so might inconvenience them.

*** A big problem with that scheme is how to scale up the operation.

Since Wizarding world is small, organizations can generally be kept direct and simple. But for someone with the ambition to rule both Muggles and Magicals, there is no avoiding complex and multi level organizations.

**** I'm not certain I completely understand the point you're making, but I agree that establishing an 'organization' wouldn't be easy in any measure of the word. My thoughts were more directed towards a maverick witch or wizard going against the statute of secrecy to heal muggles as their mission in life, disregarding the law. I think I'd have fun with a lawless character seeking to do good while being on the run for illegal conduct.

***** I read a fic like this once where Hermione apprentices with Snape and figures out how to semi-automate potion making so she can start selling pepper up potion as a cure to Muggles. She definitely gets into hot water though because there is no way one person could keep up with demand for the Muggle world. Makes sense given the huge differences in numbers. She's fine at first selling to a small local shop but struggles when the media picks up on just how effective her stuff is. Realistically she would never be able to make enough products to supply national chains like Boots or Tesco.

Snape eventually finds out about what she's doing and gets super mad, pointing out that this is exactly the kind of thing through which the Statute of Secrecy could eventually be broken.

When confronted with a moral dilemma that has no good solution, what is Ron Weasley to do? He must not only decide what is morally correct, but also what is best for himself and his family.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth.

And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.

Like Spiderman, with great power is great responsibility. :)

This marks the day the Statute is entirely torn away, revealing magic to the world! :)
