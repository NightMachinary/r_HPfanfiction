I'm not even sure if it's still up but I have been looking for a while. I can't remember much about it but I do remember Harry was paired with a character names Eva and at one point he steals deaths power, it has the aspects of existence in a council if I remember correctly. Not sure if any of you guys know the fic I'm looking for as I realise the information I have provided isn't much but any help is appreciated. I remembered some more, the aspect of death split her power in half, I can't remember why, and harry steals deaths power when he is alone with her and he kisses her and sucks it out. Hope it helps

  Voldemort is in power, but the Wizarding World fights back. Harry Potter, Master of Death, is faced with a choice, move forward or change everything? Warning: This story is weird and not for everyone.
