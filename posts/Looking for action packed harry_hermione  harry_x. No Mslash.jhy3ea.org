Hey all, as the title says, I'm looking for a baddass harmony fic specifically at the moment, but any harry/x pairing that is not m-slash including harry or a multi that is larger than 3 is fine.

I'm really just wanting a nice strong, but not godlike H/X power couple slinging curses right back at the bad guys.

Light/Grey/Dark are all okay, but no evil!harry.

Pros include a harry that doesn't mind killing the evil gits that spend their time trying and plotting to kill him at every turn. Longer the better.

TT/DT are both fine as long as the plot doesn't hang on him not telling his pairing.

Thanks all, and forgive any formatting errors.

** Linkffn(A Simple Act of Vengeance)

My attempt at a realistic OP!Harry. Combat-heavy, action-packed. Nearly complete; the H/LV battle already out though.

  Harry Potter found a loving home after escaping his relatives, but the wizarding world he's dragged into turned out to be anything but magical. Power, fame, and glory may not bring happiness, but they might just be enough to right the wrongs inflicted upon him.

** Linkffn(worth of the soul) has lots of harmony in it early on, and is a pretty solid fit IMO

  As his sixth year begins, Harry is forced to take up his destiny earlier that anticipated. With Voldemort slowly taking over, everyone looks to Harry to lead them, all while Juggling school, friends, the seach for the Horcruxes, and teenage love. In the process, Harry slowly learns about not only himself, but the true worth of the soul! Harry/Susan

** In The Forest Of Dean fits the criteria if you don't mind that it's a WIP.

** Both Harry and Hermione (and Ron) are quite skilled and powerful in the second part of my story "Harry Potter and the Lady Thief". You might also like my stories "Patron" and "Divided and Entwined".
