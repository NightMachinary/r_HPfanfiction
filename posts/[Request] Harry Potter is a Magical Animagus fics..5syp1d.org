I don't care if it's a crossover or not, I just want a non slash, Magical Animagus Harry story.

I don't care if he's a phoenix, a griffon, a basilisk, a dementor, or whatever.

Hit me.

Post GoF, Harry is framed and sentenced to Azkaban story. He gets a phoenix form. Pretty good action.

linkffn(1795399)

Post OttP series. Harry gets adopted by Snape (better than it sounds, lol). Harry gets a scarlet mountain gryffilys form - like a gryffin but redder. Lots of action, school life, awkward heartfelt moments, auror training and plenty of scenes with Harry being awesome.

  With new enemies hiding in the darkness, Harry will have to use all the power he has access to keep the ones he loves safe as he heads into his 7th year. Harry will have to rely on his friends, allies, new friends and ones he didn't even know existed. Even your greatest enemies can become your greatest assets. (Unspeakable Harry. Fast paced. Super Harry at times. FYI characters ages are older.)

** I thiiiink Mythic Alliance linkffn(5961224) qualifies. According to the summary, no slash. Just don't even think about starting the "sequel", as there is slash there. (Thankfully, the story is complete as it is, no open threads that would make it nessessary to read the sequel)

  They say there's no such thing as a magical Animagus. They're wrong. Harry Potter, Severus Snape and Draco Malfoy join together in an alliance no one, especially Voldemort, is expecting. Severus/Harry mentor, Harry/Draco friends. No slash.

** linkffn(11502532) has Dragon!Harry, and we're talking a /Tolkien/ dragon, not a Rowling dragon (Tolkien's dragons are big enough to /eat/ Rowling's).

Unfortunately, it's on indefinite hiatus, but it's 104K words long as of right now.

  [HIATUS - Read Profile!] Magic is a strange and wondrous thing. It has no leaning or even understanding of good or evil. It merely is. Harry Potter fell off the grid half a decade before, after an explosion seared the earth of Privet Drive. No magic could find him. Their final hope led them to him, but what they found was...not quite what they expected. AU, Animagus, No Yaoi

** linkffn(Never Alone, Never Again by Bored Beyond Belief) is a VERY old fic; his becoming an animagus is a key plot point late in the story, and his form is crucial to the story--I'll not spoil, but it is magical.
