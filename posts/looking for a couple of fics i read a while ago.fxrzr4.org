*** I really wish there was more to that fic. It would have been cool to see how they handled a more powerful Harry taking on Voldemort.

  Harry returns to Privet Drive after 4th year and finds it...empty! What do you do when you can't go to your friends for help? Additional Story Notes FYI: a. AU Summer before Fifth Year Fic, b. Not particularly fast paced.

** I remember the second one, still trying to find it. It's a Christmas story. I think Lily is a substitute teacher? They're making ornaments and a Harry is making an angel. I think Lily ends up giving him some of her hair for the angel after Dudley ruins what he had before.
