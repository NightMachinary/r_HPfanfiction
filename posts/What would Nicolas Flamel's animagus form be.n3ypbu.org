Hi! You might've seen me post before, I'm AuroraoftheDawn and I'm writing a long hogwarts era Drarry series, essentially a rewrite of the series.

Nicolas flamel obviously plays a big part in philosophers stone (my first book titled Harry Potter and the Age of Enlightenment) but both Nicolas flamel and Perenelle play a massive part of my book 5 part one and two (named HP and Fate's draft and HP and Moirae's intervention respectively.)

I'm very very fond of my book 5 plots and so excited to write them, but first I must finish book 1 (lol) and develop Nicolas' character for book 1. So I have a question

What would Nicolas Flamel's animagus form be?

I'd like some suggestions and reasons please. It's very important, as this animagus form is a creature Harry catches glances of in book 1. I thought maybe a crow? What do you think?

**** What about a chamois? It's a mountain goat and is considered as one of the emblematic animals of the Alps.

If you are looking for a bird there is numerous options as France is rich in bird life. It could be a hoopoe, which is a colourful bird that has crown like feathers.

***** Thank you so much for the suggestions! I quite like the idea of a goat, but I will certainly be looking into the hoopoe. I think it fits Nic to have a form which has sort of a crown, as in my eyes he is sort of this old, wise man will the aura of a loved king

** Flamel is one of the few characters in the books, who also existed in real life, so there is lots of real life lore about him. Much was probably invented centuries after his death though. He supposedly wrote Le Livre de figure Hieroglyphiques and was trained by an Egyptian alchemist, so an Egyptian animal especially one associated with hieroglypics, like an Ibis, or a snake would-be appropriate. There are lots of animals used as symbols in alchemical texts, toads, pelicans, wolves, phoenixes, salamanders, etc. Isaac Newton's alchemy refers to the snakes on a Caduceus as "the dragons of Flamel" so again a snake or salamander might've appropriate ...

*** Thank you for the information! I've done a bit of research into Nicolas, but not as much into his real life existence. The idea of him being a snake would be interesting, especially since Harry could talk to Nic in snake form.

** Turritopsis nutricula

It's the only immortal organism, it's kinda a jellyfish

Edit didn't read the whole prompt that Harry needs to see it, in that case, yeah, I'd go with what the other guy said and say tortoise

** I like the idea of a crow, though I think that maybe an Augurey would also be a cool idea. From the HP wiki: The Augurey, also known as the Irish Phoenix, was a thin and mournful looking magical bird, somewhat like a small underfed vulture in appearance, with greenish black feathers and a sharp beak

I like it because Phoenixes are known to be immortal but since the Philosopher's stone only stretches the life and doesn't grant "true" immortality (or is at least more complicated to uphold with all the elexir drinking, unlike Horcruxes which seem like a more pragmatic solution in the sense that you make one horcrux and be done with it) the appearance of an underfed vulture "clinging" to life sounds cool to me.

Jellyfish are also "immortal" but I doubt that is very impressive if you don't have an aquarium at hand.

I looked up a few animals which represent immortality (symbolism) and I would pick them for that exact reason.

*Peacock*: incorruptibility of flesh, resurrection, beauty of soul, immortality

*Phoenix*: resurrection, immortality, incorruptibility

An *ouroborus* also represents eternity.

I especially like the idea of some kind of *serpent* because in the (Ripley) scroll supposedly depicting the recipy for the philosopher's stone there is a dragon depicted. Look it up. Tbh there are also snakes and toads on it and lions but the last picture representing the philosopher's stone is depicting a Dragon holding it up (known as snake from Arabia)

But a bird would also be a cool idea. Because on the Ripley Scroll there is also the "bird of hermes" depicted. There is also a poem "The bird of hermes is my name, eat my wings to make me tame..." etc (If you google it you will mostly find references to the Anime Hellsing but the original poem references the making of the philosopher's stone) So a wingless (flightless) bird would be cool as well.

The "bird of hermes" in the Ripley Scroll also often is tied to the egyptian god Thoth (whose greek equivalent is Hermes) who is tied to science and magic, judgement of the dead etc. Thoth is also sometimes depicted as an *(African sacred) Ibis* which would be - in my opinion - a great choice as well for an Animagus even if it's not that obvious

*** I love your ideas! I think an Augurey is possibly the best answer I've had so far. I like how it has greenish black feathers, as I have always pictured Nicolas Flamel with similar colouring to Harry.

I will have to do some research into the scroll as you've suggested. What you have provided me with gives me endless ideas, to the point of me considering multiple animagus forms lol. Perhaps an Augurey for animagus and an ouroborus for his patronus? Especially if Perenelle's patronus matched, representing both their seemingly eternal life and the eternity of their love.

However, the Ibis is also just as brilliant. With its ties to Thoth, it represents the Science and magic behind Alchemy, a large part of Nic's life, which is rather brilliant in itself

Again, thank you! You've helped me so much <3

** I chose the peacock considering the animal is a symbol of immortality in Christianity, and since Flamel was born during the 1400s where France was Christian I believe it would fit. The Peacock is also archaic symbol of Jesus's ressurection and Flamel is hella old.

Another suggestion is the fox as in animal alchemy symbols the fox is the cultivator of the Elixir of Life.

The Lion may also work as it is a symbol of gold in alchemy.

I got the majority of the three here from [[https://www.whats-your-sign.com/animal-alchemy-symbols.html][Animal Alchemy Symbols and Meanings on Whats-Your-Sign.com]]. I disregarded animals such as the ostrich from the list as I imagine Flamel as borderline royalty, meaning a beautiful or good looking animal. I did not put Pheonixes as they symbolize rebirth, dying and being reborn, not staying immortal.

​

If you want him to catch glimpses of it like something casual than maybe a fox in the forbidden forest would work but if you want it to be like something harry notices especially as a weird fact go with the peacock. I reccommend the Peacock most, then Fox, then Lion.

​

EDIT : I searche up what Flamel meant and this popped up.

The Flamel refers to the *mystical and alchemical symbol* depicted as a cross with a snake or serpent draped about it, as well as detached wings and a crown above it. It resembles and shares common origins with many ancient symbols (which it is often mistaken for), such as the Rod of Asclepius...

So if you find a species of snake that fits the criteria you are looking for that may work. I would disregard this since animagus form is about your soul and the characteristics in it, not your name.

** If it fits your work, always go for the funny. Flamel's Animagus form died centuries ago. It doesn't matter what it was. Whenever Nick transforms, everyone rushes from the room to avoid the stench of rotting flesh.
