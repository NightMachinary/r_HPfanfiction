  Tom Riddle's plans fall through when Ginny Weasly loses his diary shortly after starting her first year and it is found by one Luna Lovegood. A series of bizarre conversations follow. Luna? - Yes Tom? - I've been giving this a lot of thought...and I believe you may be insane. (Plot takes a few chapters to appear but it's there)

*** Ok Im not really good at book reviews but.... This story is about Tom riddle falling in love with a girl who came joined him im his hellhole.Its really good because they dont just join the other person when theyre on different sides of the war.Frankie still stays true to her values and Tom stays true to his ambition of killing all mudbloods and muggles.Not to mention the ending!!!!oh my ....Im going to die

  Tom Riddle was once a boy unlike any other in Wool's Orphanage and was content with living his life out there as a freak. However, his hopeless fate soon changed upon the arrival of Frankie Dickson, a girl who was apparently just as freakish as he was. This is a story of a friendship that was to be forgotten by time. For who would believe the future Dark Lord to ever have feelings.

  1957 A tree in Albania, she said. Straightforward enough, right? Not if someone else got there first. Tom's journey in acquiring the vessel for his fifth Horcrux just got that much trickier. An exploration of White Magic. Canon-compliant. Longshot. OC
