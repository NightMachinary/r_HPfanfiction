Hi!

I'm looking for any fics where the Horcrux link between Harry and Voldemort has more impact.

Ideally something where either LV either doesn't die or is resurrected a lot earlier than in the books, so their connection is active during Harry's childhood.

But anything along these lines would be an interesting read. Thanks! ðŸ˜Š


** I think it's a shame there's no recs for this yet, so here's one of mine that I think fits the brief. Voldemort gets his body back at the end of second year. linkffn(11031294)

  When Harry goes to Hogwarts, he finally understands that having a dÃ¦mon is normal. Only, the wizarding world never anticipated that Harry's dÃ¦mon would be an 11 year old Tom Riddle. AU Harry Potter inspired by His Dark Materials. Complete first and second year. Third year ongoing.
