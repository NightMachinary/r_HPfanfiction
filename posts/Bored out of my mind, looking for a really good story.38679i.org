** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3186836/1/Vox-Corporis][Vox Corporis]] mainly fits your criteria. Granted it does have some focus on the pairing (which is Harry/Hermione), but it's said to be one of, if not the best Harry/Hermione fic there is.

*** This is a good story, but the whole story is about the pairing. I'd still recommend it to OP though, it isn't just the standard 'oh they love each other and have lots of sex' crap that a lot of pairings are.

Take note though that the story is based on film cannon at the end of Goblet of Fire, so Harry's eyes are blue, just scream "GREEN" in your head every time like I did and you'll be fine.

--------------

The story itself changes after the 3rd task, Harry is more distraught then before and Hermione helps him through the worst of it, he stays with her family over the summer instead of going to Private Drive.

** I just got caught up on this one yesterday, and it's one of those fics that leaves you almost hurting for more:

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8045114/1/A-Marauder-s-Plan][A Marauder's Plan]]: Sirius decides to stay in England after escaping Hogwarts and makes protecting Harry his priority. AU GOF.

It hits all your criteria, enjoy!
