I found one decent (one shot, but decent) heist fic. [[http://www.patronuscharm.net/s/582/1/]] I hope you guys like it!

Does anyone have any other recs?


** I know of two OC fics that take place in Egypt, heist-like in /The Mummy/ and /Lara Croft/ way respectively--[[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=148616][Black Sands]] (which isn't yet abandoned) and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=261430][Saharan Lies]] (which probably is); and [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=294543][my fic]] which I feel silly for linking again so soon, but it's partly inspired by /Ocean's 11/ and features in-Hogwarts heists.

** Closest I could think of off the top of my head: [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2889350/1/Bungle-in-the-Jungle-A-Harry-Potter-Adventure][Bungle in the Jungle]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3401052/1/A-Black-Comedy][A Black Comedy]] both have some great heist-ish elements. Without spoiling anything too much, Bungle involves a diverse magical team on a sort of archaeological expedition running up against serious defenses. Black Comedy involves vigilante raiding of Death Eater's homes for fun and profit.

Just wondering OP, would you consider the trio going after Bellatrix's vault a heist?

*** Thanks, I've already read and loved those two! And yes I would consider that scene in DH to be a heist. It had the classical elements I felt.

A bit cracky, and I remember finding the middle to be a bit tedious.

#+begin_quote
  Response to Paladeus's challenge "Champions of Lilith". Harry, Hermione, and Luna get a chance to travel back in time and prevent the hell that England became under Voldemort's rule, and maybe line their pockets while they're at it. Lunar Harmony; plenty of innuendo, dark humor; manipulative!Dumbles; jerk!Snape; bad!Molly, Ron, Ginny
#+end_quote

This is currently a WIP but it has several heists and there are more still to come. If time travel, lunar harmony and some bashing don't get your hackles up this should be very enjoyable, as the tone is somewhat similar to A Black Comedy.
