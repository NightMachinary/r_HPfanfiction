I'd like to read a fanfic story where someone either invents or discovers a curse or similar to kill dementors (extra points if they make the curse or other magical procedure available to anyone so they can defend themselves against these enemies of all mortals).


** !linkffn(Dimensional Twin) makes it possible to kill dementors by casting a patronus down their throat.

!linkffn(A Champion's New Hope) makes is possible to kill dementors by pumping additional power into the patronus.

!linkffn(Son of Potter, Daughter of Black) has an alternate patronus that is able to destroy dementors

  After a freak magical occurrence triggered by Voldemort's defeat, twenty year old Harry finds himself transported into another world... right on top of his female counterpart, Iris Potter, aged 14. In the middle of the night. His own body is back at the same age again as well. Normal and Fem!Harry working together as siblings, and siblings only.

*** I didn't realize there were so many fics in which a Patronus can be used to destroy Dementors. I thought HPMOR was the only one.

** In linkao3(The Arithmancer by White_Squirrel) and its sequels Hermione develops a light ritual which kills them. In linkffn(The Bonds of Blood by Darth Marrs), Harry (and Ginny) are able to kill dementors with their overpowered Patronus, because they are super!heroes.

  *SERIES COMPLETE!* Book 1/7. Structured like original HP books. Albus starts at Hogwarts! The world is in tumult over a vital question: in the age of technology, should Muggles be informed of magic now before they find out anyway? But there are more problems (see long summary inside). And Albus is right in the center of them all. COMPLETE!
