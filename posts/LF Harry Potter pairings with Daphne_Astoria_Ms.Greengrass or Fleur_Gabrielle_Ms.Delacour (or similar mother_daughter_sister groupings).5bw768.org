** I vaguely remember reading a story, had to have been Porn w/o plot, where Harry was fucking Fleur and Gabby, then Ms. Delacour walked in and began eating her daughters out. Can't remember the name though. I'll be down for more of these though.

**** And once you've trawled through the base smut-for-smut's-sake junk, you go looking for a smut that's more sexy, romantic, and well-written smut, but you only get two of those.

** There's a HPFF story about Victoire being the May Queen(?) and her mother Fleur and aunt Gabrielle reminisce about their time as queen. It's explicitly only Harry/Victoire but there are some Harry/multi undertones. I think it was linked in a LF smut thread a few weeks ago.
