I mean for me it is usually a full year but then just recently Futile Facade updated after a year and the Well Groomed Mind started updating again after like 3 years. So, from people on this sub who write a lot more then I do, when do you decide that a fic is abandoned and not just in between updates?

** I generally go into all fanfics with the assumption that there will never be another update. It helps avoid disappointment.

For this reason I always set minimum wordcount 10,000 on my searches.

**** To be fair, there are some rather oustanding, fun, or oustandingly fun novellas in the 10k-50k range. I also set at 10k+.

For examples in the fun/silly category, try linkffn(Big trouble in Old England by meteoricshipyards), a Big Trouble in Little China crossover. linkffn(Inspected by no 13 by Clell65619) is also nice and cracky.

On the serious side, linkffn(A Promise from her Boy by psychocellist) is a good one imo.

Finally, high word count is not always indicative of quality. See anything by megamatt, half or more of Robst, the latest 700k word tome from Sinyk, and literally dozens of others.

** Off topic but I got excited when you mentioned Futile Facade updating and thought there had been a recent chapter. :(

As for your question, I look for updates on the author's profile and other forums. If there isn't any activity in that front, I say almost a year between an update is when I give it up for lost.

*** For Futile Facade, Violet's sister posts updates in the review section.

This is what she said in February:

#+begin_quote
  Hello, avid readers. I am beginning my millionth re-read this week. It saves me from the tedium of my 20th year of schooling. Does anyone else feel like class never ends? I digress. I wish I could tell you Violet is working on her next chapter, but I fear she's been a bit preoccupied. Some of her time might free up in the next couple months but I wouldn't bother checking for a new chapter until May at the earliest. I wouldn't even expect to hear from her until then. She's currently out of touch and doesn't have access to the fanfiction website. However, I do know she's still alive because I get regular, lengthy, fabulous emails from her about her adventures. She hasn't forgotten you. Strap in for the long-haul, if you haven't yet. Though, most of you are familiar with the wait by now. Happy Valentine's Day, everyone. If you'd rather not celebrate... Alan Rickman's birthday is in a week! You can hold out for that special day, worthy of reverence for all of time. Peace, love, Harry Potter. Sister

** I don't take anything off my Follows list solely because it's stopped updating, but as a practical matter, I'd say a year. A few might go two years, but you're lucky to see it.

That said, fanfic authors are notoriously fickle about such things. /Nightmares of Futures Past/ updated after a three-year gap not once, but twice, and seems on track to do so a third time based on Viridian's Tumblr. I've seen authors say the next chapter was nearly done, then drop off the map and finally post it over a year later. I've seen fics claim they were about 2 chapters from finishing (and look like it from the story) and just die. You never really know. My frustration with that is why I always publish a note when my update schedule changes.

  Once upon a time, there was a young boy in Britain. When he was 11 years old, he traveled on a magical journey to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he discovered the many joys of magic. Over the course of seven years, with the mentorship of a powerful wizard, he learned the Power of Love and True Friendship, and with his friends by his side, he defeated the terrible Dark Lord Voldemort and saved the Wizarding World forever.This is not quite that story.
