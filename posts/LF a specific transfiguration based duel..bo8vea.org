The duel I am looking for is very non-traditional, and hopefully that will help in finding it as I can not remember too many details.

I don't remember who participated or where it took place, or how it fit into the plot, I just remember the concept of the duel and thinking it was very interesting.

The duel to the best of my recollection worked as follows:

The two participants stand before some object to be transfigured. One will start by transfiguring the object in some way, be it into a bird, or into a vase, etc.

Then they will take turns transfiguring the object informing their transfiguration based on what their opponent had just transfigured.

It was intended to be as much a conceptual duel where ideas and magic worked together to out wit or out perform your opponent.

I think: Someone loses if they repeat a transfiguration, or if they don't settle on a transfiguration within a time period.

An example of how it might go from how I remember it being described may be something like.

The starting block is transfigured into a sword, which then may melt/unravel revealing a pen, from the pen erupts a snake which sprays poison around, the poison congeals into a lion which snaps the snake up in its jaws, etc...


** Chapter 16 of this fic has a duel similar to what you're describing. Not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, though.

  Not all of James died that night. Not all of Harry lived. The Triwizard Tournament as it should have been and a hero discovering who he really wants to be.
