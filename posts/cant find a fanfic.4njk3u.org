Read a fanfic and can't find it now. In this one, Harry is sent to azkaban quite young and meets Bella. She acts like a mother to him while he is affected extremely badly by the dementors (as much as I remember he is physically weak and pale but mentally fine). He then develops some really cool powers and I don't remember the rest. I read it quite a while ago so can't remember the major part of story except for the beginning which was a bit different from your general harry-in-azkaban stories.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

** No this is not the one. In the one I was searching for, Harry is really really young and Bella kinda raises him in azkaban.
