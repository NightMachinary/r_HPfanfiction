So this is a really old not the most amazing fic. In it Harry goes to a school that I think is for assassins he was a phoenix anamigus and I think there was someone called bear.

  Being a gay Hero hunted by a crazy Dark Lord with delusions of immortality, a barmy old Headmaster who thinks it's his job to save the world, and the odd vampire trolling through the halls at night looking for a midnight snack isn't easy. Just ask Harry.

  When Voldemort's assassins find him Harry flees seeking a place to prepare for the battle. Bloodmagic, wandlessmagic, necromancy, fae, a thunderbird, demons, vampires. Harry finds the strength & allies to win a war. Singularly unique fic.

** Was this by chance a story where he had a partner and while at the club his parents who are alive see a teen with a hoodie that says resurgam on it? This one linkffn(2725262) also this one has slash in it

Or where he gets caught by voldemort and some guy who went to the same school says Harry (who's name is different) is a assassin? this one I'm not to sure about cause the other guy was a vampire.

There is another Assassin story I know of linkffn(4881018)
