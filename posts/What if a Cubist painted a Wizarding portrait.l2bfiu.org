How would it affect the occupant? Would they be able to cross into other portraits, and if so, would they look normal or still be this Cubist nightmare-fuel in the middle of an otherwise normal image? Would their personality be impacted?

** I think it would depend on the painting. Something like Picasso's /Les Demoiselles d'Avignon/ or Duchamp's /Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2/ would actually be really cool with movement added, and in the case of the later, the clarity of its subject matter might even be enhanced.
