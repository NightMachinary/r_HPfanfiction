I am looking for recently completed fics, ones that have been finished in the last year or so. Or, perhaps just completed fics you have read recently. I would prefer action or drama over a simple slash fic, but I will take any and all you have.


** Though I never finished it, linkffn(The Merging by Shaydrall) just finished recently and is generally well regarded around here. I hope you enjoy it!

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off. But how long can he maintain the illusion that everything is under control? As hope for a normal life slips away through his fingers, will Harry bear the weight of it all... or will it crush him?

****** The end pairing is Harry/Tracey but he isn't really dating her till the end. Throughout the whole story he is basically single and there is more action than romance, but there is the occasional romance. It's basically Tracey getting a somewhat crush on Harry while Harry is just focused on training and sometimes fucking around with Tonks, but when all is said and done Harry ends up with Tracey.

*** I could do that, but I want to hear other people's suggestions. Surely, you have recently read a completed fic to suggest, right?
