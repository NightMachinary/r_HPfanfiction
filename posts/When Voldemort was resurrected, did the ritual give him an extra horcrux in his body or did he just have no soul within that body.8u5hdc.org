There's probably some reasonable explanation, but I can't figure it out. Any help?


** ????

It was his original soul (the same one Harry encountered in first year).

*** But wasn't the original soul destroyed by baby Harry? The only reason he survived that was Voldemort had the horcruxes right?

**** No.

Voldemort's "main soul", for lack of a better term, cannot die because the Horcruxes anchor him to life. So despite his body dying, his soul never left, thus "the wraith".

When he was resurrected, that was his "main soul" gaining a body.

***** Oh ok! I thought horcruxes were kind of like lives, so they're destroyed when he 'dies.' But I understand now, thanks!

**** No, his body was destroyed (likely by whatever ritual Lily used) his soul just wandered around until it possessed Quirrell a little before book 1. We know it is the original because at the graveyard he talks about Harry's protection which he learned about in book one, and we know from book 2 that the part of him that is a horcrux only has memories until it's creation.

** I was under the impression that you have one Voldemort and a number of Horcruxes. If Voldemort dies, but there is at least one active Horcrux, then his soul/spirit remains as a wraith. Quirrell served as a host for that Wraith in Book 1. Later, Wormtail (by way of another ritual, I believe) creates that weird baby thing for the wraith to inhabit.

The ritual in GoF creates a person-sized, fully magic-capable body to house that wraith.

** Think of Voldemort and the Horcruxes like this:

Voldemort's main soul is like a spider. When it creates a thread for its web and attaches it to a point, this is like a new horcrux, and keeps him from dying if something happens. With each new horcrux (new threads to the web) he secures himself more firmly to not dying (or falling in the spider metaphor).

The spider can handle injury as long as its still on the web, just like Voldemort can survive as a wraith (disembodied soul of sorts) without a body. But if you cut all the threads (or destroy all the horcruxes) if the spider falls it dies for good and cannot come back. Ditto for Voldemort.

The Resurrection Ritual technically involved two Horcruxes (Harry and Nagini), but all it really did was create a homunculus for Voldemort to inhabit which would also be immune (or he thinks) to the protection Harry's mother gave him. The horcruxes are simply soul fragments bound to a "container" of sorts. The main soul is not a horcrux: think of it as a kind of control or master soul to the other fragments. It seems to have limited control of sorts to the other Horcruxes, but the same is not necessarily true.
