  The anagram. I mean to be serious Tom. The Dark Lord is a murderous dictator who tried to take over the world, slaughtering anyone who opposed him and practically enslaving half the purebloods in Europe. He would never do something as sad and juvenile as using an anagram of his given name for a title. That's like something a bad guy in a children's storybook would do. I'm eleven and even I can see that.

But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought.

** /“In a way, Tom, but only in a way, there is no good or evil, only power, and those too weak to withstand it. You can get drunk on power like a man can get drunk on firewhiskey, to the point where the whiskey controls him, drains him and eventually ruins him. That is what happens when we give in to the pull of the darkness. But harness your own desires, and it becomes a tool that you control instead of it controlling you, and you can do great things -- great, and magnificent.”/ --- Garrick Ollivander, “Last Chance”

For context, this is what Tom got when he, in a story where Dumbledore tried to do right by him rather than just intimidate him, asked if he was evil. It's also a nice callback to the very first book. Ollivander quotes are fun, when properly used.

Chaos is not truly marked by evil, but by extremes of both sides.

Only the righteous seek justice the damned seek revenge.

When we look in the mirror and see evil, we don't want to admit its human.

** Way too many comedic/flippant quotes here. Here are a sample of my favorite serious quotes. Noted primarily for meaningfulness.

- "The demigod of time, the man in the fine suit, [Chronos], grinned at me. "No happy endings..." he said." -joe6991, Harry Potter and the Heartlands of Time (Chapter 15, The Healing Day)

- "'STAND AND FIGHT! FIGHT FOR YOUR SOULS AND THOSE OF YOUR FRIENDS! EXPECTO PATRONUM, EXPECTO PATRONUM'... ...A silvery, shimmering mongoose emerged from his wand. It was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen." -ShayneT, The many Deaths of Harry Potter (Chapter 36, Pray)

- "Pride saw me here." Harry grimaced. "And not a little stupidity." -Steelbadger, The Shadow of Angmar (Chapter 16, Then Fell Towards Distant Light)

- "'No, Harry. This war will not be won by martial might alone, no matter how much it may seem that way. The gap between you and Voldemort is too great. Perhaps even insurmountable. Tom was a prodigy among prodigies. I say that not to frighten you, but to make you understand that any sort of direct assault on the Dark Lord by yourself would be madness. The idea that a teenager, no matter how well-trained or talented, could defeat a Dark Lord with nearly a century's experience beggars the imagination.'" -Sophprosyne, The Half-Blood Romantic (Chapter IV)

- "The realization of what he'd done -- what he'd almost done -- hit him and a giggle slipped out sideways." -Swimdraconian, Circular Reasoning (Chapter One, Psychology 101)

- "'"I'm going to miss them. Always and always.'" -Deadwoodpecker (Backward with Purpose Part I: Always and Always (Prologue)

- "Terror... pure terror flooded into her heart..." -Casca, Seeking Ginny (Chapter Fourteen)

- "It will never be ten years. Just ... two weeks shy of ten years, forever." -Master Slytherin, Resurrexit (Chapter 2, The Funeral)
