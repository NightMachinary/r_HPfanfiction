I'm looking for a fic, where wizards and witches when they reach certain age "shown" changes according at who his or her life partner is... Hermione got one green eye (because her partner was Harry) but didn't tell him and hide it. Every year something happens or Dumbledore advice against telling Harry. Later she "lost" her green eye (it goes back to her natural eye color) but while on the run Harry notices that he got Hermione scar (the one from Dolohov's curse). At the end of the final battle Hermione get back the green eye.

More info: Ginny got Tonks (at first she believe it was Moody) Lavender got red hair (she believes it was for Ron, but after Fred died she realizes the true)

If i recall it was an oneshot.

Thanks in advance for any help


** I haven't read this particular fic, but on Ao3 these fics are tagged as "soul marks" fics. Hope that helps with your search!
