I see depictions of Slytherin in fanfic ranging from perfectly normal to something of a US Marine boot camp, junior Death Eaters, and even all out dystopia filled with rape, blackmail and torture. Me myself, I always figured they have a lot of inside jokes and references given their families background and social statuses. And since most Hogwarts students see them as the spawn of Satan no matter what they do, I always figure they display a strong sense of House unity when dealing with others, but other than that I always figured they are just ordinary kids. Maybe things were a bit more tense since Ootp, but not much else.

What about you, how do you think life was there, and whats your favorite depiction of Slytherin in fanfic?

Yeah, same with any of the Houses when dealing with other Houses. Gryffindors would definitely side with their own over Hufflepuffs or Ravenclaws, and those two will definitely side with their own over anyone else.

This is clear BS. This is usually written by ff authors who can't seem to get the idea that the wiz world is backwards out of their heads (in spite of numerous evidence to the contrary) and do their best to make it look even worse.

I think Slytherin was pretty much the same as any other house from book 1 upto book 4. In book 2, things might have gotten rather tense in the house, especially if the other three houses decided that the Heir of Slytherin had to be from House Slytherin and started cursing them in the hallways, but it doesn't come to that as far as we know.

After book 4, after Harry and Albus declare that Voldemort is back, things may have gotten tense in the house, or they may not have. The thing is, we're told that all Slytherins grow up to good little Dark wizards by two people who have the most bias in the series - Hagrid and Ron. That's clearly BS. What's more, the children of Death Eaters like Draco, Vincent, Gregory, Theodore are all 15 year olds. I'm going to err on the side of caution and suggest that none of their parents/relatives who were Death Eaters ever confided in their teenage sons about their business. Can't say much about Nott, but Malfoy is a complete braggart and the last thing Lucius wants is for his son to give up the secret by bragging - Voldemort was trying to remain inconspicuous about his return for as long as possible after all, and I imagine the Dark Lord would be most displeased if he were outed by a teenager's boasting of all things. The only thing the Slytherins do in book 5 is to capitalise on Umbridge and use her IS to hand out detentions and take House points like the new fashion.

At the end of Book 5, when the return is made public and acknowledged by the greater public, yes, things would have gotten quite tense. But...how much sway did Malfoy have at that point? His father, who was Malfoy's main source of power, since Lucius was close to the Minister and was a governor of the school, was arrested and thrown in Azkaban. Draco takes the Mark in book 6 (or sometime between book 5 and 6), but is tasked to kill Albus - he can't go bragging about that. In fact, Malfoy spends most of his sixth year too busy trying to repair the Cabinet to bother with his House or the school. I honestly can't remember anything about other Slytherins from book 6, other than the train scene, and even that just has just Draco, Pansy and Blaise involved. Harry was watching Malfoy like a hawk throughout book 6, and generally didn't pay the other Slytherins any attention.

In book 7, well the only thing we see is the Slytherins being told as a group to fuck off by McGonagall. They later join the battle on both sides - which means there was definitely a LOT of tension within the house, although all of it wasn't exactly based on blood purity.

There would have been roughly 4 groups of Slytherins in book 7

- Those who supported the regime wholeheartedly like Crabbe and Goyle,
- ones who did so only for the sake of appearances,
- ones who didn't care about it either way, and
- those who pretended to support the change.

The first group would have joined Voldemort's forces from the start of the battle, and the last group would have joined along with the villagers from Hogsmeade and other reinforcements.

Regarding house composition, I'd go off canon and say that there are next to no muggleborns in Slytherin house to begin with - the Sorting Hat is probably designed to avoid sorting muggleborns into Slytherin, since Salazar himself didn't want them in Hogwarts. Maybe a 70-30, or an 80-20 ratio of purebloods to halfbloods?

*** I doubt there no muggleborns in slytherin because as far as anyone knew at first, Tom Riddle was a muggleborn. No one knew his heritage and he was from a muggle orphanage

**** Tom knew his middle name, Marvolo. The Sorting Hat may have well made the connection between Tom Marvolo Riddle and Marvolo Gaunt. If Tom knew his mother's name, Merope, it would have been an easy connection to make.

There's also obviously Tom's ability with Parseltongue, which is one of Salazar Slytherin's best known traits - there's no way Tom wouldn't be considered for Slytherin.

** I don't think it was particularly different from Slytherin at any other time --- a lot of kids going around pretending to be dark and brooding and important because that's how you get status in Slytherin, orchestrating tricks of the "hanging tripwires" variety and calling themselves masters of cunning, and endlessly bouncing jokes on how they pureblood Slytherins are so much better than everyone else off of each other.

The main difference was that War-era Slytherins /meant/ it more (since a lot of their Death Eater parents were acting in the same fashion at home, except for /real/), and so they were great recruits for Voldemort, and also much more likely to bully "non-standard" Slytherins (i.e. half-bloods, blood-traitors, or just people who don't dig the whole "dress in all black and green and act like a Dark Lord of the Sith" thing) and other Houses. Due to who their parents were, a lot of the War-era Slytherins had also been taught more serious curses and jinxes than other generations, so petty feuds had a tendency to go much, much too far (example: Severus vs Sirius).

** Honestly, it would have been very, very awkward. Though the Death Eaters most likely operated in nigh-total secrecy during the war(s), anyone actually in Slytherin at the time was virtually guaranteed to have at least one acquaintance or relative who was or aspired to be a Death Eater.

And the capper was that the other houses likely knew that too. Probably thought that Slytherin was the one and only source of Death Eaters Voldemort had to draw upon, a view that most likely went unchallenged all the way up to the end of the first war.

That left the Slytherins in a precarious position. Break ranks and you were labelled a traitor. Close ranks and you virtually confirmed your status as a future terrorist. Show any signs of curiosity towards the Dark Arts or make a badly timed remark and you were ostracized by the other houses as a precautionary measure-see what happened to Snape in the end.

To top it all off, you then had to deal with the reality that at least one of your year group was related to a Death Eater, if not all of them (yourself included). If that was the case, there would have been an ever-present paranoia in your group, a fear that someone's parents would be outed as Voldemort supporters and either jailed or summarily executed for their crimes. Those kids would be left especially vulnerable to retaliation from those inside and outside Slytherin who had lost parents to the Death Eaters in the form of either pranks or bullying.

The idea that tacit support from the half-bloods and muggleborns was what enabled the marauders to get away with as much as they did is not really that far-fetched when you consider just how many grieving children would have seen them as an instrument through which to lash out against the terrorists that had destroyed their lives.

It also handily explained just how Remus's condition went un-noticed for so long-with so many willing to cover them in exchange for continuing their pranking campaigns against the Slytherins, it would have been more surprising if they had been found out as animagi before the end of their school careers.

The war would have been an incredibly stressful time to be a Slytherin. Between a hostile school, the fear, the paranoia and the risk of ending up on the Dark Lord's radar without wanting or meaning to, I severely doubt that any of the Slytherins would have been able to enjoy themselves much in those hallowed halls. In fact, I would say that Slytherin house as a whole may have ended up radicalized by the very hostility they encountered as a result of the Death Eaters' actions, driving them into the arms of the very people who were responsible for creating their tenuous childhood situation in the first place and thus starting a vicious cycle that drove the house ever deeper into isolation over the decades that preceded and followed the end of the first war.

Whether or not that situation has actually changed remains to be seen. It may have, but that largely depends on just how much goodwill Severus Snape's accidental 'sacrifice' ended up generating after the second war was over (not much, according to my own gut feeling surrounding the situation).

*** How do you envision the house after the Battle of Hogwarts?

Many Slytherins must be involved in voluntarily torturing their fellow students. Since the other three houses suffered many dead additionally in the Battle, the backlash against them must be immense.

If the Ministry doesn't cart off those torturers to Azkaban first, I expect the other three houses to organize vigilante hunting parties.

Revenge will happen if the legal authority fails.

**** Actually, I envision that the house itself doesn't suffer overly much. I mean, if there's one house that would be, somewhat ironically, put under the heaviest surveillance in such times it would be the house of ambitious, power-hungry and independent revolutionaries since hey, that's pretty much what Slytherin is by that stage.

A fair assessment would be that the Slytherins were likely the least able to rock the boat under the Death Eaters because they would have received the harshest punishments for doing so, especially given what they were being asked to do.

So, with that in mind, the following may well have happened- the senior Slytherin contingent of 5th year and up would have been pressured to give evidence on what they knew and did during the occupation. Since imprisoning a large portion of the pureblood scions would have resulted in a renewed Death Eater uprising fairly quickly, they are then given a choice-either they go into voluntary exile or they spend the rest of their lives under constant scrutiny by the DMLE. Random house inspections, vault searches, an indefinite probationary status, travel restrictions and asset seizures would have been part of a long list of things they would have to agree on to avoid Azkaban after graduation. The Slytherins, being pretty smart, would have elected a select number of their peers to remain behind while the rest left to make their fortunes elsewhere, with the objective being to get the others out as soon as their new settlements are comfortably established outside Ministry Control. This is a process expected to take years and involves a complex series of transactions taking place between the exiles and the trapped for funds and resources.

The end result is an out of sight, out of mind approach. The Slytherins stay away from public life and let the sounds heal, occasionally stepping in to help out the people they had 'been forced to' torture in the past and generally buying themselves enough goodwill to keep people from probing too deeply into their plans. Those that end up being targeted for retaliation anyway join their fellows in exile and cede their project assets to the remainders.

And in the meantime, Slytherin is steadily occupied by an ever growing stream of muggleborn and half-bloods, who often join the exodus after graduation because being a muggleborn Slytherin? Talk about a double whammy of discrimination.

It takes decades for the house's image to recover (if it ever does).

** Everyone was either sympathetic to Voldemort or at least pretending to be sympathetic to Voldemort in order to survive.

This is why Slytherin should have been disbanded at the end of the series and it made no sense why they kept it. Slytherin actively promoted bigotry ever since the time of its creation. Even the so called "good" Slytherins would have been better off in another house.

Rowling messed up by portraying Slytherin as so irredeemable and then not just disbanding it. It's actually cruel towards the kids themselves, since Slytherin will only make them even more bigoted because of all the negative influences.
