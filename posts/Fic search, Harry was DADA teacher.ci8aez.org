I remember this from ages ago. Harry was a student and taugh DADA, and everyone though Dumbledore a crackpot for hiring Harry. Also I think Harry had a girlfriend in fourth year called.. Ally?

Sorry for format, on mobile.

Edit: how do I flair on mobile?

you can't.

You'll have to use a 3rd party app. I recommend Slide for reddit.

** Is it by midnightjen? It sounds somewhat similar to Blood of the Phoenix. But Harry doesn't get hired to teach in that one, his girlfriend, Ally, does. Also it takes place Fifth Year and beyond.

*** No, maybe I'm confusing two fics. I remember his girlfriend being in Ravenclaw, and Harry definitely became DADA teacher.
