:END:
If I remember correctly, in this fanfic, Harry Potter does not join a gang. At some point Harry gets a gun. At some point Harry gets a gun shot wound, and accidentally apparates to the Burrow. There, he stays for the winter, but leaves at some point. If I remember correctly, Harry returns to the Burrow at least once a year. He becomes close to all of the Weasleys. At some point one of the Weasleys find Harry's gun. I don't believe this story was finished. If you need any more information in order to identify the story, or have any ideas on the story, please let me know. The story may not meet every part I gave, as I may have falsely remembered some information, but it should meet most. Thanks


** Hey it's been a month but I'm pretty sure it's [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/811088/183/][Not myself]] though it's been quite some time since I read it. Not 100% sure.

*** Thanks for the reply, but sadly I don't think this is it... Oh well... I don't think I have read this piece before though.
