Looking for fics with political intrigue that start when harry is preferably in at least 6th year. I can't get into a story where 11 year olds are walking around talking like 18th century British Prime Ministers


** My favorite politically focused fic is [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/5904185/1/][Emperor]], linkffn(5904185).

*** Seconding this, Emperor is pretty fantastic though if you are looking for something more specifically like politics in the Ministry of Magic or something close to cannon you won't find it here.

  Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU.

  A year has passed since the dead started returning to life. The fate of those hoping to survive and rebuild rests on the best and the worst of humanity, both wizards and Muggles, with their political ideologies and the ravenous undead in between, and it's up to Healer Harry Potter to save as many as he can in the crossfire. A Harry Potter Zombie Apocalypse Fanfiction. HP/AG.

** My fic, linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn) is building up to that. It's multiple POV, so you can see what is going on politically early on in the fic. Harry won't really get involved in politics until ~6th year though.
