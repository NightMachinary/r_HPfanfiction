I distinctly remember a scene in the burrow where Ron proposes to Hermione... or announces their engagement... and Harry has some kind of physical pain/attack because of it. Possibly, maybe, involving some kind of soul bond? I just remember that he somehow can't handle it and could die because of it or something drastic? My memory is really hazy...

Which fic was this? I don't even know whether it was good or trash... for some reason I only remember this one scene. Could have been a one-shot?!


** I recall one where Harry can't propose to Ginny for that reason...

** There is linkffn(Intended by LeQuin) which is sort of similar. Harry is secretly in love with Hermione, but she's dating Ron. To make Hermione happy, Harry helps Ron with his relationship, even buying an engagement ring for Ron to give to Hermione. During the wedding, Ron and Hermione can't put on the wedding rings because of some magic that prevents false marriages. Harry and Hermione become accidentally married and the truth comes out.

It's an okay fic. Too much Ron bashing for me and Hermione falls for Harry /way/ too quickly, but the fic does it's job, i.e. it's a light-hearted oneshot with an interesting premise.
