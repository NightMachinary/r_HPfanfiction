Daphne Greengrass was not a witch. She wasnt even human or the daughter of Greengrass family(although they didnt knew that). She was a personality eater. She was the byproduct of a failed experiment in the depatment of Mysteries. She had no form, concius and most importantly personality when she was "born". She(It? They?) wandered the world, invisible to humans and incapable of thinking she should interact with stuff.

She bumped into a tortoise by accident one day and that was the turning point that spelled doom for every concius being. She consumed the personality of the turtle. Taking its form, habits and knowledge for herself while the turtle withered away until it was literally, a caricature of its former self. One day. She was found by a young witch on the backyard of her parents home, Astoria Greengrass decided to keep her as a pet. It was incredibly easy to make greengrasses forget she was their daughters pet turtle and instead make them to think she was her older sister.

For years she fed from them until every interesting characteristic was sapped away from their souls until most people the family knew forgot they even existed. She fed and fed until she was aware of herself and made herself more and more interesting. She needed to make herself interesting she realised and she knew how to do it. She would find interesting peoples, befriend and integrate herself to them and she will take their personalities away, making them her own, leaving behind flesh puppets as interesting as moldy bread. She enjoyed doing it, getting more and more powerful herself and more interesting while everyone else got blander and turned into caricatures of their former selves with flat personalities. She made sure nobody questioned it, nobody was able to question it as she turned the wizarding world into a farm to feed herself. She was happy but everything was not meant to be...

One person, a filthy little solid, mortal human being dared to be more interesting than her. Harry fucking Potter. Nobody was allowed to be more interesting than her. She will make it right again. She would destroy this upstart and make herself the god of this world!


** But I'm guessing in some twisted sense the good old and Lily's sacrifice enhanced Potter luck managed to help Harry survive but also bag himself a tsundere eldritch human experiment for a wife.

*** Yep! This Daphne is basically a parasitic Mary Sue. She is loved by all, has every skill in existence, Her appearence, disposition and background change every minute etc... She stole all of that from other people however, leaving them as caricatures of their former selves.

Harry s immune to her due to Lily and becomes suspicious after a few months into their third year Ron become a chess obsessed idiot despite being in top ten best the previous year and Hermione becomes a rule addicted Bookworm despite her background of rulebreaking under his and rons tutelage. He realises everyone has detoriated and tries to find the culprit.

** Have you read Lily and the Art of being Sisyphus? She accidentally summons an eldritch abomination when she pulls a rabbit out of a hat. He eventually gets put into a human body under the guise of a Romanian refugee from the vampire wars. Also, I'm pretty sure he eats a day of the week when he's still a rabbit.
