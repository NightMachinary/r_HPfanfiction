I am hoping that being a werewolf actually matters in the story and is not an extra power tagged along with everything else or an excuse to go crazy about a mate.

I understand that this might be a bit niche so quality doesn't matter as long as it's readable.


** Well, there's "Were's Harry?", which includes werewolf politics. No mate, not just an additional power.

  Dark curses don't play nice- not even with each other. When nine year-old Harry is bitten by a werewolf, the horcrux fights back. The result could only happen to Harry Potter. Canon-ish for the first three years of Hogwarts - AU from that point forward.

I read this in 08 and I still think about it sometimes. Hopefully it's as good as I remember and it's not just nostalgia distorting my opinion!

  Harry Potter has spent two years carefully cultivating a persona of unremarkable mediocrity, melting seamlessly into the background. Now in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he tries to maintain that facade, and for good reason. Unfortunately, a certain bushy haired girl has taken notice and proceeds to question his every move.

** Wolf Lord is a bit longer than the third book and still ongoing. No crazy mate shit and any boost in powers usually come with a drawback. Doing my best to keep him relatable/grounded, but welcome constructive criticism and thorough feedback.

  On October 31, 1981 two pivotal events changed Harry Potter's life forever. NOTE: Some liberties have been taken with the werewolf aspect in the HP universe. I've changed it a bit to better suit the story I want to write. And, yes, I use some werewolf cliches. The sequel Unity in Diversity has begun to be posted.

  Darkrai is a popular Pokémon in real life but the nightmare-causing Pokémon is not really popular in the Pokémon world, something this certain Darkrai is well aware of. All he wants is someone to care about him. Just as he loses hope and starts to grow dreary, he meets another hated Pokémon who had come to Sinnoh by mistake. How will it change his life? And for better or worse?
