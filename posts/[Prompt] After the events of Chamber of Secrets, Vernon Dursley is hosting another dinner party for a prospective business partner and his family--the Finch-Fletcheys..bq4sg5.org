*** It's not that large a stretch to imagine that Justin's wealthy father may have some interest in dog-breeding, or perhaps hunting, so you could even add in the passive-aggressive comments about Harry's mother.

Or Marge mentioning Harry having to go to the St. Brutus' Secure Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys.

Marge: Do they use the rod at St. Brutus often boy?

Harry: Er...yeah, I've been beaten loads of times.

Mrs. Finch-Fletchy: /Gasp!/

Justin: What!?

Marge: Ah, yes, a fine boy like you wouldn't have heard it of. But Potter--the Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys, that's where he belongs.

Mister Finch-Fletchy: Madam!

Justin: What are you talking about?! He goes to my school! It's...for gifted kids.

/Harry begins smacking his head against the table/

Justin: Oh, come off it Harry. You can't act like last term didn't happen. You saved my life!

Mister Finch-Fletchy: WHAT?!

Harry: I didn't save your life--I just killed the fifty-foot snake that turned you into a statue.

Marge: WHAT?!

Mrs. Finch-Fletchy: WHAT?!

Justin: /They didn't know about that!/

*** "How do you like your tea?" asked their kind guest. Mrs Dursley poured them the tea. She took a sip. Perfection, if only on the creamier side

Her son, Justin, was fidgeting with his juice, already getting bored of the rather bland business talk going on between his father and Mr Dursley, who was, a bit on the /rounder/ side of the average Londoner, but knew what he was talking about.

Their son Dudley, on the other hand, was rather rude to her son, insisting on him playing the enemy in the impromptu game of "bang the action figures a bunch of times."

She was keenly listening to Mr Dursley when he said that the prices of the drill won't lower than 7 pound a piece, and they were at a stalemate.

In that moment of silence, Her son saw something which made his eyes go wide. He darted to the window, toys forgotten, and she could see that he was clearly tracking a bird or something.

Beyond intrigued, she too stood up and walked to the window, though her movements were more dignified.

** Ah, what the heck, I'll write it myself:

--------------

"Alright now, Marge's visit is coinciding with a business dinner I'm hosting." Vernon stared down at each family member in turn, "And we are all going to be on our /best/ behavior. This could be one of the biggest deals my business has ever made."

"Oh, Vernon, how wonderful." Petunia's bony hands clasped over Vernon's hammy ones.

"Oh, my precious Petunia..."

Dudley locked eyes briefly with Harry and then made a face before going back to his bacon.

Harry resisted the urge to groan. Bad enough Aunt Marge was coming to visit, but another dinner party? The last one had ended in catastrophe, though that had largely been Dobby's doing.

--------------

Marge's visit had been largely unpleasant, but not unbearable.

/Think of Hogsmeade,/ Harry reminded himself for the umpteenth time as he dressed in the formal wear he had had to prepare for the dinner. Like every most of his clothing, it had once been Dudley's and was far too large for him. Harry thought briefly of having to wear Goyle's robes to infiltrate Slytherin Common Room.

"Good evening, Mister Finch-Fletchy. May I take your coat, Mrs. Finch-Fletchy?" Dudley asked at the door.

Finch-Fletchy? Wait a moment....

A tall man with graying hair, neatly trimmed, and a woman with dark curls stood at the door with a curly-haired boy of about thirteen.

"Harry?"

Justin Finch-Fletchy, a Hufflepuff boy in Harry's year, stared at him in surprise.

"Boy!" Marge barked. "Where are your manners?"

Harry pressed a finger to his lips and mouthed the words "Muggle aunt."

Justin gave a brief, firm nod and shook his hand.

"It's nice to make your acquaintance," Harry said evenly.

"I believe we may have met before," Justin answered. "But if not, indeed, it is nice to meet you."

As Dudley led all the adults into the dining room, Justin caught Harry's shoulder.

"What are you playing at?" Justin hissed.

"Uncle's sister is visiting...she doesn't know."

"Oh, right then." Justin straightened. "I keep it quiet then...and I'm sorry, about last year."

"That's all done and sorted with. The thing in the Chamber, it was nothing."

"No," Justin murmured, so low Harry didn't hear. "It really wasn't."

--------------

"So...Justin, was it?" Vernon smiled. It looked unnatural on his face and his mustache seemed unhappy. "Tell me about your school."

"Oh, it's a school for gifted students." Justin said as he caught Harry's eye. "I had my name down for Eton...but things turned out a bit different."

"Eton?" Marge gulped down a brandy. "My, that's a fine school. And you say your school is for gifted students."

"Yes...It specializes in certain subjects that Eton does not offer...er, advanced biochemistry is one course. And the astronomy courses are very nice too."

"Ah, glad to hear it."

"We are very proud of our Justin," Mister Finch-Fletchy clasped a hand on his son's shoulder. "Tell me, Mister Dursley, of your boys."

"Well, Dudley attends Smeltings, as I did as a lad."

"Ah, that's quite a school in its own right. Tell me, Dudley. What are your interests? Any subjects have a certain magic for you?"

Okay, /that/ was blatant.

Harry said nothing and forced himself to keep his temper. /Hogsmeade. Hogsmeade. Hogsmeade./

"Erm.." Dudley thought. It looked like hard work. "Well, the maths are very useful. And...boxing."

Dudley set his jaw.

"I enjoy boxing very much."

"Ah, a fine sport indeed," Mister Finch-Fletchy agreed. He turned to Harry, "And you, young man. Do you enjoy Smeltings as well?"

"Oh, sorry sir," Harry said. "I don't attend Smeltings, sir."

"He attends St. Brutus' Centre for Incurably Criminal Boys."

"What?!" Justin blurted.

"Justin! Manners! You do not interrupt!"

"Now now," Marge gulped another brandy. "A fine boy like your son wouldn't have heard of it. But a bad stock like Potter, the Centre is where he belongs. Tell me boy, do they use the cane often?"

"Er, yes. I've been beaten loads of times."

"Not often enough," Marge gulped yet another brandy down in one. "If you have an attitude like that. Look Mister Finch-Fletchy in the eye, you brute."

"Sorry, ma'am," Harry fought to keep his voice even. "Mister Finch-Fletchy sir, I was sent to St. Brutus for injuring my cousin. It's a reform school for helpless cases like me, where I cannot hurt anyone else."

"Oh, bloody hell! None of that is true!" Justin shouted.

"Justin Bartholomew Thaddeus Reginald Finch-Fletchy!" His mother snapped and his father grabbed him by the ear. "You know better to use foul language!"

"Mother, I had to memorize the patron saints for Brother Leonard three years ago. Yee-oww! There is /no/ St. Brutus!"

"What?!" Marge had taken the brandy bottle. "Vernon, you /lied/ to me?!"

Oh bullocks.

"Justin, do you know this boy then?"

"I don't believe we would have ever met, Mrs. Finch-Fletchy."

"Harry! You saved my life last term--I can't act like that didn't happen!"

"What?!"

Well...there was no going back from this then.

"I didn't save his life exactly, Mister Finch-Fletchy. Madam Pomphrey and Madam Sprout produced the medicine to heal his injuries. I just...killed the snake that bit him."

"Bloody hell!" Dudley blurted. His fork still had food on it, and was half-way to his mouth. Harry couldn't remember the last time Dudley had been too surprised to eat.

"I think it's time you went to bed, Potter." Marge belched. "You're disturbing our guests."

"Oh, no. I want to hear more--" Mister Finch-Fletchy answered. "Justin, I believe you've neglected to tell us a few things. You said that a boy named Harry saved you from choking on an apple. What's this about a snake?"

Harry and Justin looked at each other.

"Er..."

--------------

Couldn't think of a better way to end it than here. I might come back to this.

Pre Hogwarts: The Dursleys visit the new Grunnings business partners, the Finch-Fletchleys. Their dentists, the Grangers, are also there. One accidental magic later, three kids are like "wait, you too?".

The Finch-Fletchleys are obviously very thankful that the Dursleys can explain what's going on and start expanding business to the magical world right away.
