Uuh you know the drill, Harry is the real BWL but everyone thinks it's his twin brother who is boring and loud and the worst type of Gryffindor while Harry is super talented and ignored, except I'm looking for a story where either:

1. /Harry/ is the BWL and everyone knows this so Harry gets all the attention while his twin is mistreated (hopefully a story where Harry doesn't just abandons his twin, because I don't want him to be the bad guy either).

OR

1. Harry has a twin who /really, seriously, is/ the BWL and no, they weren't wrong about that, and Harry is pushed aside like usual (also hopefully a story where the twin stand by Harry).

I just want something where the moral of the story isn't "oh no, we shouldn't have mistreated Harry in particular, because he was plot-relevant and useful this whole time", but rather something closer to "oh no, we shouldn't mistreat children...........because it's bad"

Anyway, Boy Who Lived, Girl Who Lived, living or dead Potters, long story, short story, complete, in-progress, AU, bashing, slash, het, gen, I don't care about any of that.


** I'd love to read some of these. There's far too many “Harry gets abandoned at the Dursley's so I can bash Dumbledore/the Potters/everyone in canon”. I wanna see Harry and Bob Potter, twins against the world! Both orphaned on Halloween ‘81, both sent to Gryffindor (or maybe Hufflepuff since they're so loyal to each other?) and supporting each other through everything. Explore how Harry's canon friendships change, how the canon plot would go off the rails. Maybe they don't like Ron at first, cause he bullies Hermione. Maybe they prank the /hell/ out of the twins for the same reason. Or maybe it's a canon rehash with minor edits and ill slog through it for the fluff, as long as it's well written.

  Harry Potter loves, and is loved by, his parents, his godfather, and his brother. He isn't mistreated, abused, or neglected. So why is he a Dark Wizard? NonBWL!Harry. Not your typical Harry's brother is the Boy Who Lived story.

** I'm looking forward to seeing if anyone can find a fic like this lol, it'd certainly be a decent change of pace and a lot more interesting to read than such black and white characters. Like even bad people have logic in their brain for why they do things and that's something that I feel this trope dismisses entirely.

I just started a fanfic that might (?) be in tune with what your looking for. Harry is the older brother of the BWL and his twin and him will develop a significant relationship. He /is/ strange from his parents, but I think it's because of reasonable causes that have nothing to do with his brother being BWL and everything about Harry himself. I leave it here just in case you're curious. Though as a warning it's horror/romance (not romance driven though) and the relationship TMR/HP is really fucked up -which is not for everybody.

He was bending over the crib, the baby wiggled and Death noted that his diaper was coming undone. Unthinkingly, he pressed one cold finger against the strip, pasting it back together, and Hadrian James Potter's entire destiny became undone. slash./

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
