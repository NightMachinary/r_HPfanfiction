Even though I think Snape is a fantastic character, I never really bought his redemption in canon. I'm looking for fics where he actually changes through the story (don't think he'd ever be "friendly", but finding out he was his students boggert should trigger some type of self reflection right?).


** I'm not a big Snape fan, but Crime and Punishment by melolcatsi does such a good job with his character!

Dudley accuses Harry of stealing and he gets arrested, which results in Harry having to stay with Snape during the summer. All characters are in character, and the only assumption is that Snape doesn't know about the Dursley abuse, which is never elaborated in the books one way or another, so it can be seen as canon. It's gradual, but is starting to have some feelgood and satisfying moments, and Harry and Snape's growing familial relationship is believable, genuine and sweet. It's ongoing, but it updated just a few days ago.

*** I'm seconding this sooooo much! Absolutely one of my favorites of all time. Also O Mine Enemy by Kirby Lane of fanfiction. Both of these two do a FANTASTIC job at gradually changing the relationship between Harry and Snape and have Snape consider his own flaws realistically without destroying his character.

  Harry finds an injured Snape on his doorstep and must hide him from the Dursleys. To complicate matters, a series of strange dreams portends a frightening future unless the two can find a way to work together. A mentor story. Alternate 6th summer: post-OotP; ignores HBP & DH.

  Harry is accused of burglary. The Dursleys leave him to rot. Dumbledore sends Snape to remedy the situation. Harry finds himself in the care of an irate Snape. Not slash, gen-fic w/ focus on Sevitus relationship. Angst galore. Warnings: coarse and suggestive language, mentions of abuse/neglect. Un-betaed and un-Britpicked.

  A letter from home? A letter from family? Well, Harry Potter knows he has neither, but all the same, it starts with a letter from Surrey. Whatever the Durleys have to say, it can't be anything good, so Harry's determined to ignore it. But then, his evil schoolmate rival spots the letter and his slimy excuse for a teacher intercepts it and forces him to read it. And that sends Harry down a path he'd never have walked on his own.It will be a year of big changes, a year of great pain, and a year of confronting worst fears. It will be a year of surprising discoveries, of finding true strength, of finding out that first impressions of a person's true colours do not always ring true. It will be a year of paradigm shifts.And from the most unexpected sources, Harry will have a chance to have that which he has never known: a home ... and a family.A sixth year fic, this story follows Order of the Phoenix and disregards any canon events that occur after Book 5.

** I'm not sure it fits your request, but I'll drop this one here anyway.

linkffn(12129370)

It's a variation of memory time travel to the Marauders era.

Snape sends his own canon memories to his teen self. As a result, he doesn't join the Death Eaters and doesn't have his massive quarrel with Lily. Lots of angst, regret and redemption included.

It is massively long, but it was a pleasure for me to read (and reread later).

  1976 and nightmare visions of the future are plaguing Severus Snape. With Lily's help, he will need to figure out what these glimpses are trying to tell him, to change their future to a better one for all of the wizarding world. Although the future is not set in stone, not everything Severus sees can be changed, sometimes the inevitable will reach them sooner than they expected
