I remember reading it a while back by can't find it anywhere. Basically, Hermione is kidnapped as a child by Death Eaters and raised as one after they kill her parents.

She eventually gets close to Harry for some reason and eventually is redeemed by helping him beat Voldemort.

I think it starts as Hermione/Draco but ends as a Harmony.

Any help?


** maybe

  Hermione is the Dark Lords' most prized death eater. But when he sends her on a mission to befriend Harry Potter, her sworn enemy, things don't go quite as planned. When she took the mission she never anticipated falling in love with her target. HHR
