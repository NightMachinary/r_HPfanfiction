Hey.. Can't seem to remember a lot of the fics that I've read.. So looking for another one. This one's pretty old though. Read it almost a year ago.

So the only thing I remember quite vividly is that Harry and Ragnok are in the midst of a duel (I think it is to retain the sword of griffindor or for the goblins help, I don't really remember). Harry refuses to use a shield stating that if ragnok is not using one why should he. They duel and harry emerges the Victor. Post this whenever harry comes across a goblin they have their first to their chest as recognition of his valour..
