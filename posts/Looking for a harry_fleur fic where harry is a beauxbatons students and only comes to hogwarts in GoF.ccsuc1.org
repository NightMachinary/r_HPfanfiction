I believe there /are/ other fics which have the same premise, but I liked this one the best.

  Calla Lily Bellmont was Beauxbatons' top student. Therefore, it was expected that she also go to Hogwarts during her 5th year for the Tri-Wizard Tournament.Granted, it makes it a little harder when your birth surname is Potter and you and your mother are currently on the run from the Dark Lord.AKA in which Calla Potter befriends everyone (including a spirit by the name of Tom Riddle)
