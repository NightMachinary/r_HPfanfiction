I used to read all my fanfic from Veritaserum.com, which died a couple years after book 7 was released. Its hayday was 2004-2008.

I specifically mean the fic that was posted directly in the forum like so:

NOT in its rudimentary archive here:

I got these images from the wayback machine.

Here is the site on the internet archive. Apparently none of the individual forum fanfic pages show up on here. Im so close I can almost taste it.

These were so near and dear to my heart. I used to get on every day and read the fanfic. I never thought it would just... pop out of existence. I know many of the writers there never reposted their material anywhere but the fanfic threads on veritaserum. It seems so ephemeral and dangerous now. Like posting your fanfic only in reddit comments.

It would mean so much to me if I could somehow access these. Its a tragedy of unreal proportions that so much of Harry Potter fandoms history has been destroyed over the years. I honestly estimate that an amount nearly equal to the archive on ffn has been lost in all the various forums/private archive crashes.

If you have ANY leads or information, I will love you forever.


** AO3 /might/ have it. I know they host stuff for other sites that are going out of commission.

Other relevant links to the internet archive. I cant ever actually get INTO these fics besides one or two for some reason.. I can just see the titles that happened to be on the front page on the few days it was scraped.
