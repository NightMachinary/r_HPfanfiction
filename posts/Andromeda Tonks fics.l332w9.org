Looking with fics about Andromeda. Would rather not be focused on shipping.


** I would like these, too. Her being adoptive aunty/mother to Harry after the war, NO RELATIONSHIP, is something I would love to read.

Day-to-day life of Harry helping Mrs. Tonks with Teddy and Andromeda teaching Harry what his parents can't. Harry doesn't want to go to Mrs. Weasley because she doesn't quite get it. Yes, she's lost a son, but he and Andromeda have lost almost everything. So, Andromeda helps heal, teach, and smother Harry with motherly love.

*** Honestly, I can imagine both. For shipping, a grand romance would just be weird. But them using each other physically to fill the holes in their hearts, and over time this coping mechanisms becomes an actual relationship.

Alternatively, her and Harry grow closer when he comes to visit Teddy and she tries to live through Harry, becoming a sort of nosy aunt who takes him under his wing. I can see Ginny included in that because her mother isn't coping well with the death of her son.

**** I just... Can't see the relationship. I feel like it could lead to sex, for sure, but once they hit that certain point they'd realize the age gap and be like 'wtf are we doing!?'

Now, the nosy aunt thing I could totally see.

***** I mean I'm not going to claim that it would be the most normal relationship, but at that point Andromeda is 42-47. And with at least 50% higher life expectancy, she still has at least another 10 years where she could still have children on her own.

There would definitely be a "wtf are we doing" moment, or even a few, but I honestly don't see Andromeda caring about social expectations (she married Edward after all), and Harry never particularly cared either.

But my perception is tinted by my headcanon and I certainly envision her a lot more bitter and vengeful than most. No happy reunion for Narcissa, but disdain because she was always very self-serving. I can easily see Andromeda having a higher opinion of Bellatrix, who never lied about her allegiances and went out fighting rather than switching sides like a ping-pong ball.

****** I totally agree with the bitterness. She would scoff and quip at Narcissa every time she saw her. I see her as the true 'Black Sister' with the sarcasm and all that jazz. Very, very dry humor and sarcastic as fuck.

I mean I could see her being the one to....pop his cherry (lol) and then maybe step into the aunty role after he found someone.

******* Hmm, that could also happen, but it would be very awkward to say the least. Especially when Harry brings his girlfriend/wife with him.

The obvious solution would be a triad, but I honestly can't see that happening since the way their relationship came to be would basically be an unhealthy codependence. Inserting a third into that would be a lot more difficult than into most others.
