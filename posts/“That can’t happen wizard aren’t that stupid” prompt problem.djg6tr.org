Yo this post is for the mods cuz I don't really know how reddit rules work, but this needs to stop, im tired of clicking on a funny, interesting,uncommon prompt, and the comments are all like this: “ but that's not canon”, “wizards aren't that dumb”, “muggles would never do THAT”. I DONT CARE. it's fan fiction you numbskulls, it's not supposed to be canon, maybe I want to read a crack one shot where Harry Potter is raised by some ludicrous character and then grows up to take over the entire world, and I'm tired of all the comments that complain about the prompt. Therefore mods if you could PLEASE add a rule that says something similar ( I'm not a smart enough person to come up with a nice sounding rule) to: don't clutter prompt posts with complaints about the prompt.

Thank you and have a nice day

Edit: This post is barely readable because I'm too sleep deprived to type properly, if you wish to understand this post I direct you to [[/u/SwiftNinja99][u/SwiftNinja99]] ‘s simplified version


** Everything you just said would be already covered by rule 9 if the word "request" was removed from the rule. However, [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/chs9l5/rule_9_adjustment_for_prompts/?depth=15][the last time]] this complaint was brought up the majority opinion seemed to be that criticism should not be banned from Prompt threads.

**** I actually refined my opinion a bit from when I posted that thread. I was also sleep deprived at the time.

Constructive criticism in prompts is great. I've refined many an idea with it. Like if you're writing a mentor fic, instead of Percy, Cedric would be a better role model. But quite a few of my prompts are more under the crack! fic label.

I don't need to hear that x situation would never happen in canon as your only comment. I know. That helps no one and just makes you pedantic.

As for that, well a politely worded response about contributing to the prompt works well.
