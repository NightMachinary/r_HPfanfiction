We see in canon that at the very least Tom Riddle and Lily Evans got some control over there magic as children and in a lot of fanfiction Harry does.but what if Hermione did?

What do you think she would have done with it ?

I think that if Hermione had gotten control of her magic as a child most of it would probably be book based. Like summoning a book that was out of reach. Or useing her magic to read a book so that she could understand books above her level or in language she couldn't read.

Mabye even developing the ability to use the knowledge in the books around her. So she could put a dictionary and thesaurus on the table next to her and as she read a book her magic would give her the knowledge in the books so she didn't have to stop reading the book she wanted to check them.

Mabye even taping into the knowledge and understanding of people who have read the book in the past to help her understand.

What sort of book based magic do you think Hermione would have developed if she had gotten control over her magic as a child?

And are there any stories were she does?


** Hermione likes knowledge, but she's motivated to make others follow her guidance. It's not just that she wants to be right about things- she craves the acknowledgment. I think her pre-Hogwarts magic would be focused into drawing the attention of others when she wishes to be heard, so that they listen to her and praise her for being correct.

*** Oh, this could be interesting... All her life, she and others around her thought that she is just a very charismatic child and a brilliant and persuasive speaker, who could always make the best possible argument for what she wanted or believed to whomever was listening. (*Edit:* Typo.)

When she gets to Hogwarts, she discovers, to her horror, that she's been accidentally casting an accidental magic equivalent of the Confundus Charm on everybody around her.
