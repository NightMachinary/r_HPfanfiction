Are there any fics out there that flip the whole sealed-Potter-will trope on its head? Like one where Dumbledore ensured the will was sealed, but not for nefarious purposes. The will actually ends up leaving everything to other people, and sealing the will was the only way for Harry to actually have an inheritance. Harry then ends up broke when the will is unsealed and executed, with Albus just being like "you-should-have-listened-Harry".


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2565609/147/Odd-Ideas][Chapter 147]] of Rorschach's Blot's "Odd Ideas" has a cracky take on that as Dumbledore explains everything to Harry.

** Or the will had stipulations for Sirius that would've given Voldemort a major advantage (say, the Cloak). After all, people thought he betrayed them at the time.
