So I can't remember what this fic is. So here's the description, basically the trio are sent back in time but there all from AU's Harry is from where I'm not sure but I think from one where the war with Voldemort ended much later, Ron is from one where wizards become intergalactic? and he's a general/comander and Heremione is a seer? and she sees that Harryâ€˜s auro not sure how it's spelled is that of Victorian London's alleyway or something and of gas bombs and Ron's is a man that hold's galaxys or plants in it's hands.
