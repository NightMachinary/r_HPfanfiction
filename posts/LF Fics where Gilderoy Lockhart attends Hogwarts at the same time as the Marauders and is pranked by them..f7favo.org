I was daydreaming about the Marauders pranking the shite out of Lockhart.


** Lockhart is actually a homonculus that was created when the Marauders were inventing the personality charms that went into Map. He has Prongs' charisma, Padfoots irreverence, Moony's inclination towards Dark Creatures, and Wormtail's tag-along-but-don't-do mentality.

Like Athena, he (literally?) sprang forth, fully formed and armed, during their 6th year, and escaped Hogwarts. He went on, of course, to very nearly have wonderful adventurers as an mysterious wanderer, and make many lifelong shallow acquaintances, before finally being drawn back to Hogwarts, to meet his Hercules--er, Harry.
