For me personally, it's Kinderaiths. The idea is very cliche and overdone but the image of a cute, innocent little child asking you to play with them until they lure you and suddenly eat you is always very chilling, no matter what. It's sort of like the veela transformation when they get angry except more terrifying. What makes it more twisted is that a wizard called Gallen Ingot invented these to kill unsuspecting people using many other creatures to breed them. If you don't have enough strength of mind then you're eaten.

Otherwise, Inferi are always sinister and unsettling, especially when a writer develops them and uses them for twisted situations to mess with the person's mind.


** The demon and ice wraith in linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane)

The Blood Inferi in linkffn(The Dark Lord Never Died)

The vampire in linkffn(The Phoenix and the Serpent), both of them

Whatever the hell the Russians did to that soldier in linkffn(The Skitterleap)

  Voldemort was defeated on Halloween 1981, but Lucius Malfoy faked his survival to take over Britain in his name. Almost 20 years later, the Dark Lord returns to a very different Britain - but Malfoy won't give up his power. And Dumbledore sees an opportunity to deal with both. Caught up in all of this are two young people on different sides.

** The Nundu in [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9863146/1/The-Accidental-Animagus][The Accidental Animagus]], linkffn(9863146). Not only could it cause massive physical destructions, its breadth could spread extremely lethal diseases such as the Ebola. One instance in 1957 Algeria caused so much panic that the responsible Ministry asked the French Muggle government to simply drop a nuke on top of it, later covered up as a atomic bomb test.

*** I've tried so hard to get into accidental animagus. It sounds like it has so many cool ideas in it, but every time I (re)start reading it I find something that rubs me the wrong way (like basically every mention of Hermione and harry knowing karate). Does the story ever have a clear upswing? Is there a point after which story has a notable increase in quality/cool and unique shit going on?

**** Although I have been recommending this story a lot, I do have my share of criticism too:

1) It's still rehashing too many canon stations, despite significantly different circumstances.

2) 11 years old doing polit-speaks, although White Squirrel actually toned it down in later years.

3) The plot often drags until the end of school year, even though there's no need to imitate canon here.

On the other hand, there are more good aspects:

1) Great world building, especially if you include its companion piece “The World of the Accidental Animagus”.

2) Harry is significantly stronger and more active than in canon. Although Hermione still beats him marginally in academics, Harry shines in his intuition and leadership skills. Yet, they do not feel overpowered at all. Their karate skills actually are not very useful.

3) Year 3 has a great, original plot, while Dumbledore is greatly distracted by the East African Campaign (where he fought that Nundu).

4) TWT tasks are original and interesting, both for readers and spectators.

5) Villains are interesting. The Carrows are providing comic relief, Barty Jr is super smart (no impersonating Moody!), and La Panterra is truly awesome. Even those diehard blood purists in the Wizengamot know Muggle world well (know thy enemies!).

6) I have great hope for its sequel “Animagus at War”, and it looks very promising so far. The plot is completely original now.

**** I have the exact same issues. That, and Harry pulling ranks in the first few chapters in Hogwarts, making political connections through kids his own age. The kids don't even act like kids. Everyone is like 'hello, Mr. Malfoy' 'my regards, Miss Brocklehurst' and they act so formal until you remember they're only eleven...

The wandless magic idea is great and all. I've also heard it has great villains and amazing worldbuilding stretching far beyond Europe. Everytime I try to come back, I end up pulling away because of Harry acting like a Politic. Another issue is how the Wizarding World is depicted as extremely backwards compared to the muggle world. I never truly got that since they're two very separate cultures and two very separate worlds. How, exactly, does wearing robes make you more 'backwards'? Or using quills for that matter? I'm not talking about the Animagus Verse now, but fanfiction in general. I mean, part of why it was so enjoyable was because of all these odd little quirks and how, you know, /magical/ it all seemed.
