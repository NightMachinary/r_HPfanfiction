#+begin_quote
  When Arthas seized the Frozen Throne, he cast aside both his humanity and the remnants of Ner'zhul. The Guardian sealed away the spirit of the former Lich King in another world, entrusting them to Albus Dumbledore. Now, however, Ner'zhul has ensnared a new host: Lord Voldemort. With two worlds threatened, heroes are brought to Azeroth to cast down both Lich Kings once and for all.
