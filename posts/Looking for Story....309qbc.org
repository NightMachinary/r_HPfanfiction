So I'm looking for a particular story, but I can't remember what it's called--obviously, haha. I think it's a Severitus-themed. The main thing I remember is Snape, Harry, Ron, and Hermione perform the Fidelius Charm on a secret--not a house, but some knowledge. It may have been that Snape is Harry's guardian, but I can't remember exactly. The main thing I do remember is that Harry's secret was him finding a gun at the Dursley's house and holding it for a few minutes. I can't remember if he almost killed himself or not, but I remember that what he wanted was to be able to control when his death would happen (I think). I also remember him mentioning that something that happened in the memory wasn't really the secret and then saying: "That's the secret." If you could help me find this, that would be awesome!
