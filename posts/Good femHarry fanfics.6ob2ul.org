The main things I'm looking for a female version of Harry, that she's Dark or Grey, completed or consistent updates, and the fic is over 50,000 words.

Bonus points if she "dislikes" the Dursleys and she has a sadistic streak about her. Oh, and she has a romantic relationship like the one in the Princess of the Blacks series...

Thanks


** I have the feeling this exact question comes up every two days or so, always with the same fanfic recommendations. Well it is a pain in the ass to find good stories in this particular niche, so I´m glad to help. linkffn(Call me Moriarty) This one got a update after a long hiatus, then we have philosophize, where fem!harry is usually a bit darker than her canon counterpart linkffn(Yule Ball Panic; The Power of Love; The Death of Natasha Romanoff; Iris Potter, Agent of SHIELD), though they might not be the kind of dark you want. Then we have Nemesis13 with about half a dozen started fanfics, that get sporadic updates linkffn(Another Day in the Life of Potter-Redux; A Black Halloween; The True Blood Princess). DylantheRabbit, admittedly generally a bit trashy but the Silent world of Cassandra might have the most entertaining babyeating evil Dumbledore and generally other entertaining fics mostly focused on fem!harry linkffn(The Silent World of Cassandra Evans; Season of the Witch). You already know silently watches, but there also is inwardtransience linkffn(The Long Game; To Reach Without). Other good fem!harry fics are linkffn(Harri Potter and the Lost Shepard; A Long Journey Home; Dahlia Evans & the Broken Bridge) of them only A Long Journey Home could be classified as dark fem!harry, but I doubt it´s in the way you mean.

  He hadn't wanted to be Harry Potter anymore. Things would be simpler, he would be happier. He had been almost positive he would be happier if he were quite literally anybody else. At the moment, he couldn't think of a better demonstration of the warning "be careful what you wish for." (fifth year, characterdevelopment!Harry, free!Sirius, competent!Ministry, much queerness)

  The letter changed it all for the orphaned, abused little runaway with the messy black hair and the green, green eyes. Cassie's life was going to change but with vengeful teachers, manipulative headmasters and an uncaring wizarding world would it be for the better. Dark but not evil or overpowered FemHarry, eventual Femslash. Pretty close to canon apart from the obvious.
