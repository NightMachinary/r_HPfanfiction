Are there any fics that show, what it's like, growing up in the Wizarding World without magic?

Facing the choice between becoming a citizen in a society, that will always view you as lacking, or trying to navigate the muggle world, where everything is strange and no one is looking out for you.

In Exile by bennybear linkffn(6432055) Draco isn't a squib, but it shows the difficulty a pureblood has, trying to adjust without magic.

  It was Mrs. Figg who suspected first. She noticed many things, sitting on her side of her fence with her cats chasing butterflies and nuzzling her ankles, Mundungus and the other watchers dropping by for tea now and then. Mrs. Figg noticed that Petunia was a nosy bit of work with insecurities hanging from her every harsh angle. She noticed when Dudley learned the word MINE-- the whole neighborhood noticed that one. She noticed that Vernon glared at owls.She noticed that when Petunia gave Harry a truly horrendous haircut one year, it grew back in at a normal rate. Harry was uneven and weird-looking for ages, hiding under beanies when he could. When Mrs. Figg had Harry over for carefully miserable afternoons of babysitting, she noticed nothing moved that shouldn't. He didn't accidentally make flowers out of fallen leaves, or levitate anything during tantrums, or turn toys funny colors. Mrs. Figg called up her mother, interrupting the wizarding bridge game she was winning against the nursing home staff, and asked her how she had known, decades back, that her youngest daughter was a squib.

  littlebastardreviews posted the collected facts from the 2014 UK Editions of Harry Potter: and this fact caught my eye. 'Only one non-magical person has ever managed to get as far as the Hogwarts Sorting Hat before being exposed as a Squib.' But, gosh it just makes me want a story where a squib did make it through. So here's a drabble about a squib with a quick mind and a hand-me-down wand, who refuses to be denied her birthright. -- when the hat drops over her eyes it asks, 'well what do we have here?' she's got a forged hogwarts letter with penmanship that's perfect down to the ink splatter; she's got a complicated string of owls, only half of them forged, from parents to administration to ministry that's so complicated her name ended up on the first year roll call anyway. she's got ten arguments, four pleas, and one smothered threat on the tip of her mental tongue for why the house that comes out of this hat's brim better not be 'squib' she's got a lighter up her sleeve and an eight and a half inch wand in her belt that will never, ever work for her. 'well,' says the hat, 'better be slytherin then'

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.

  AU. Petunia Evans might have been a squib but she was smart and stubborn. While Lily went to Hogwarts, Petunia went to a boarding school and later studied archaeology. Dr Evans ended up raiding tombs for Gringotts with the help of their Curse-Breakers and using her findings to advance her career as an archaeologist. And raising her unfortunately impressionable nephew.

*** That is not the one. She always calls herself a squib (a muggleborn squib although it is contradictio in adjecto), but I have yet to see any difference from a common Muggle in her. She actually doesn't grow up in the magical community, so she doesn't have to face all issues true squibs do.

**** Not all issues, but since she works for Gringotts and raises Harry, she basically lives in the magical world and faces a number of issues. And in story, the "muggleborn squib? Are you sure about your parentage?" point is raised.

And Petunia certainly has a chip on her shoulder about being a squib.

** Not 100% what you asked for, but if you want to see a take on Squib Life in the Wizarding World, Second String was interesting. The romance is a very small part if that bothers you.

  Everyone knows Dementors can take souls, but nothing says that they have to keep them. After the Dementor attack in Little Whinging ends disastrously, Harry must find a place for himself in a new world, fighting a different sort of war against the nascent Voldemort.
