So there was an offhand reference in a fic I read lately that I can see being the basis for some great stories, but... I don't have the creativity to do it myself. So I'm throwing this idea out there (because the fic in question is not on any major archives, so people probably won't come across it themselves):

Harry is a descendant of Gryffindor. Now we don't care about vaults of gold, or political power. But what if that meant that Hogwarts' elves were more loyal to him than any staff, even the Headmaster? What could Harry do with this information?

The story I read this in just had an elf (not Dobby) saying they owed more loyalty to Lord Gryffindor than the headmaster, and he had them do some minor favor without the Headmaster's knowledge, and it was never addressed again. And I thought, what a waste of resources!


** in the the fic [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11762850/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Accidental-Horcrux]] and its sequel [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12278649/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Chrysalis]] harry gets the hogwarts elves to be loyal to him by treating them as people and actually visits them and holds conversations with them in which he appeals to their insecurities
