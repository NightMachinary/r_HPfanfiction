I don't mean a trollfic or anything like that. I mean a fic that had a lot of plot twists and did things to your feels. The kind that sticks with you for a while, even after you've finished reading the story.

Feel free to share links, if you have any.


** Easily [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8770795/1/Harry-Dursley-and-The-Chronicles-of-the-King][Harry Dursley and the Chronicles of the King.]] Had to fucking map this shit out as I read so I could keep track of it all. 500k words of plots within other people's plots and then that time travel shit starts and then the dementor subplot and it's like I need a three dimensional pain web to make sense of this shit. It's honestly a little disturbing how much effort the author must have put into keeping everything straight. Fantastic read though. Really liked how much thought the author put into his world. Very disappointed that he doesn't seem to be working on the sequel. Would have loved to see what he would have come up with.

** The Saving Connor series is literally Mr. Bone's Wild Ride.

Long, convoluted, so many twists and turns, but I finished it!

But for some reason I started to re read it again a few months ago...

** Most epic thing I've ever read is the [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3473224/1/The-Denarian-Renegade][Denarian series]] [[http://linkffn(3473224)][]]. This really needs no further explanation. It's fucking epic. period.

[[https://jeconais.fanficauthors.net/Hope/index/][Hope]] and [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5353683/1/The-Girl-Who-Loved][The Girl Who Loved]] [[http://linkffn(5353683)][]], are also in this list for me, because both of them made me feel things I hadn't even realized I was capable of feeling up until that point, and I learned a lot about myself through them. This is probably relevant to my personal situation more than it might be to anyone else's, but if you're interested in themes of love these are for you. Girl who loved is also damn funny a lot of the time.

Then there's the first fic I ever read. I really don't know how I would react to it had I read it for the first time now that I've got tons of other fics under my belt, but as a first fic and introduction to the idea of HP fanfiction, without any idea what the cliches of the genre even are, this one was an epic ride which had me immersed for weeks.
