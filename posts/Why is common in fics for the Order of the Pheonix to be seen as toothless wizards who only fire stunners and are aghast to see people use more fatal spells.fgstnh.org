I don't know how common this question is but while reading the Deathly Hallows, I read this part that happened after the 7 Potters Plan failed and Harry revealed that he used the Expilliarmus curse

/ 'Lupin looked aghast. ‘Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!' ‘We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen he'd have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,' Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm. ' /

This then reminded me of the many fics where this same argument happened except that Harry was on the opposite side supporting the idea of more fatal spells. So, out of curiosity, why has it become somewhat fanon that the Order of the Pheonix only fight to stun and would never resort to killing?


** I believe a lot of it springs from Dumbledore's actions in the sixth book. Ron nearly died, Katie Bell was put into a magical coma, Rosmerta was under the imperius for months and Dumbledore knew Malfoy was behind it all but did nothing to stop him. Katie Bell same so close to death it's silly. Dumbledore didn't believe Draco would kill him and had asked Snape to do the deed. In doing so he seemingly prioritised Malfoy and his family's lives over the students that it should be his responsibility to protect.

What does that have to do with stunning? To some people they take Dumbledore's treatment of Malfoy as that, its not about stopping them it is about giving them a chance to redeem themselves. Dumbledore, even Harry could have stopped Draco. You could argue, Dumbledore wasn't willing 'to do what must be done' to stop the threat that Malfoy presented. If Katie Bell had died Dumbledore could be seen to have judged her life less than Malfoy's possible redemption. If we now equate the Order's views with Dumbledore, all loyal minions to him sharing the same ideals, they would potentially let criminals go, i.e stunning.

*** You've also got the Battle at the Ministry in book 5. Death Eaters we're winning when Dumbledore came in and subdued everyone sans Bellatrix. These were inner circle, and they got tied up to be released at a later date instead of taken out.

**** Of course, Dumbledore being capable of easily subduing everyone other than Voldemort without killing them, means that it can be argued that he has a responsibility to at least attempt to do so moreso than for example Remus Lupin vs Lucius Malfoy which would likely be a much more even fight. Or Harry vs much more experienced wizards.

I don't think disarming stan was a bad move though, tbh. For most wizards no wand = no magic = no longer a meaningful threat.

**** Well, Dumbledore didn't need to kill them considering how effortlessly he defeated the death eaters. He also said that he was trying to place Voldemort in a state "worse than death". Not going to lie, a powerful wizard tells me that, I'm going to be more terrified than if he had merely threatened my life.

** Goody-two-shoes comic book / cartoon tropes getting overlaid onto the Order.

I've usually used the logic of “comfortable killing in combat, not down with assassinations or killing prisoners.”

*** Yeah but in some fanfics, the order are made to look like innocent children who couldn't imagine the idea of fighting to kill.

**** I think it's largely edgelords who want to establish how gritty and hardcore their anti-hero main character is, or people who've had that impression of the Order filter into their consciousness from reading the former.

***** Yeah. I mean in canon, the Order are made up of Aurors, and trained wizards with some even being from the previous war. Why would they be so horrified to fight to kill when it means surviving?

** It might be because of the fact that even though they are willing to use lethal force in combat and Harry is not; Harry generally has a better performance than the Order in a fight where both are present which is rather unfortunate.

In DOM Harry and his friends did better than the Order. Moody got taken down by Dolohov, Bellatrix took down Kingsley, Tonks and Sirius the like. It appears that the Order could not take down a single DE while Harry and his friends clearly did. It was not till Dumbledore came that the battle turned for their favor. And Dumbledore just flicked his wand to capture most of the death eater in stroke. It just makes the Order look weak when school kids held out longer than they did.

Then there is the Battle of Astronomy tower. This is a big nail in the Order's coffin. One of the Order participants in this battle was Lupin. There were 6 DE who were let inside Hogwarts.

Harry was the only combatant from the goods guys who was reluctant to use lethal means or was not running on Felix Felicis. And he was the only one to incapacitate a Death Eater in the entire battle. Yep neither the Order who knew about the possible attack and were prepared and capable of using lethal force nor the DA who was running on Felix Felicis and had knowledge of where they were through the Marauders Map could take out a single death eater. Harry however after having a draining experience in the cave, having just suffered the loss of his mentor and being half mad with fury took out not 1 not 2 but 4 death eaters in his mad dash to get to Snape and Draco. 3 of them had initiated the fight with him and despite having surprise on their side were taken out quickly by Harry.

Just seeing this battle shows how incompetent the Order was. Harry does not go for lethal spells and does his best to take his opponents down non lethally because he is skilled enough to take out most threats using non lethal means. And the above battle demonstrates it.

** If you look at it, the Order's seeming ineffectiveness and reactive only style. They only showed up to the party AFTER a bunch of people died, or everyone is about to leave.

Throw in a dash of Dumbledore's /Forgiveness/ fetish.

- Mundungus Fletcher: whose uselessness actually impedes the order.
- Snape: who somewhat gave them interesting information (which barely helped much overall), all the while emotionally torturing school children for over a decade and singlehandedly crippling the Auror, Healer, and Potion master population.
- Draco Malfoy: he threw the entire Student population under the bus, on the off-chance Malfoy could be saved.
- Gellert Grindelwald: He threw into his own love nest.

And before people say that Dumbledore supported Harry killing Death Eaters... Didn't you ever think it was more supporting the fact that Harry was going to fight Voldemort? It was practically the first time Harry said he was going to participate in the war.

** It's a militia compromised of majority civilians and some retired government personnel. Throw in some vague better than the bad guys, never mind that shady business of Dumbledore's, and that's sort of the end result.

End:

I'm explaining the thought process that has caused these results.
