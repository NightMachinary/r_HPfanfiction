*** I liked doing that with Cedric, even though he is larger in fanon than in canon. I can only take so many fics where the author makes Cedric a Mary Sue before deciding it's time to kill him. I mean, fanon Hermione can get annoying, but at least she is depicted differently in many fics so that there's a balance. Cedric less so.

Also, Rita getting squashed is always fun to read.

**** Rita getting accidentaly squashed gets boring tho, because at this point it's the only way people can get rid of her apparently : by having her die one of the worst possible death, crushed and alone, nobody discovering the body, nobody even knowing she died until long after.

***** I don't know how you squash your bugs, but it would be a pretty quick death, and far from the worst.

I mean, just going through legal means of execution (as opposed to torture methods for the sake of it), there's breaking on the wheel, the stake, crucifixion, impaling, running the gauntlet and so on. Most of those are hours if not days of constant pain while a crowd jeers at you. And there's the Malleus Maleficarum if you are feeling particularly creative, nevermind what you'd find in the black books of modern "intelligence" services and the mob.

And it's the only way to kill of Rita, legal means will just land her in prison, if not fined.

****** The worst here isn't her being crushed, because yeah that hurts a lot but for like a second, but dying alone and forgotten.

******* Which makes the death of her like that even more ironic. Social gossip monger constantly in the light for her articles she obtains through secret hidden means.

How does she die?

An accident, alone, and forgotten.

That is divine levels of punishment.

Love it.

******** Not wrong, but the karmic retribution lost its charm the tenth time you read her dying like that.

********* True, I prefer the much more simple slowly and repeatedly drowning people in a barrel of water.

Shoving their head in over and over until they are so exhausted they can't even fight back.

To simply succumb to that siren's song of the sweet embrace of darkness.

From that initial panic of what is going to happen, the heart wrenching terror, that glorious relief as you are lifted from the barrel to breathe the first time, then comes that body clenching desperate fight as you realize you are going under again.

Over and over, until that breath of air is a curse, a desperate curse you deeply hold on to even as it causes you more pain.

If you just stopped fighting, just stopped craving that freedom of air the pain would stop.

Instead of 20 more times it would only be 1 more time.

Until that desperation turns your limbs to lead. Even as you give in your body betrays you at that last second and twitches.

A subconscious primordial part of your mind fighting at the edge.

It's to late now though.

Now only comes the heavy burning in your lungs filled with water.

The even heavier feeling of darkness tingling through your mind like millions of stars.

Then nothing.

It's over.

Fin.

.

That was an interesting creative writing experiment and I never want to do something like that again. Fuck, I need a drink now.
