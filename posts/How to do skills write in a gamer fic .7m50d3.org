Most gamer fix seems terrified of haveing any skills be maxed and every skills always maxes out at lvl 100.

My solution to this is to have five different tiers of skills

So tier 1 skills are specific recipes that max out at lvl20

A tier 2 skill can be made by merging multiple tier one skills that make out at lvl 30 example the roasting skill that is made by maxing out the roast chicken,beef,pork,pumpkin and potato tier one skills.

A tier 3 skill would be cooking that maxes out at level 100 which is created from combining multiple tier 2 skill like roasting (and the dish washing skill after all washing up is part of cooking)

Tier 4 is a cooking perk that allows you to pass all cooking skill checks as long as you have the recipe,ingredients and equipment you can cook anything.

Tier 5 would be the Danmachi Mixing skill that can be unlock by getting multiple tier 4 perks like cooking, potions, ect that would be able to be improved from ranks I- S with rank

I may add to this threw the day I mainly created it to distract myself from annoying relatives that are comeing over for lunch.

How would you change up the Leveling system in gamer fics


** Well, I dunno about gamer fics, but ages and ages ago, I came up with an idea for a rank-based skill system:

The idea was, every skill you could get, like Tortoise Martial Arts, Fire Magic, etc, would have up to 10 star ranks that you could get. Every time you raised your star rank, you'd get a new powerup related to that skill; a new technique, a significant +xx to an attribute or check, et-cetera.

Raising your star rank wouldn't just be a matter of grinding it, however; 3 or so of the ranks could be attained by basic training of the skill, but the other ranks would have to be obtained by building up synergy with related skills/attributes, getting a magic item tuned to the skill, completing a quest or discovering an artifact, and using a buff spell or potion. If you frequently used a skill, it could also become an Active Skill, which raises your star rank further, until you start using another skill frequently.

So, for example, let's take, say, a Bewitching skill.

By reading books and buying upgrades, you could get it up to Rank 3, unlocking How To Make Friends, Love Potion, and Confundus Charm.

By raising your Charisma high enough and getting 3+ ranks in Illusionist, you could get your Bewitching up to Rank 5, learning Putty In My Hands & Memory Charm.

A wand well-suited to casting charms would net you rank 6, and Would I Lie?; getting Gilderoy Lockhart infatuated with you via a Love Potion could be used to get him to teach you his tricks and send you up to rank 7, and the False Memory Charm.

Discover and drink from the legendary Sirensong Fountain, you'll get rank 8 and Convert The Crowd; keep using Bewitching-type abilities to make it an Active Skill and thus get rank 9, Amortentia.

Finally, drink a Lord's Liquor to temporarily buff your Bewitching to rank 10, and get the final power-up, Unshakable Enchantment.

...So yeah. You could use that if you wanted. Two synergy skills, two quests, equipment, a buff item, and frequent use, plus a new power every level. A lot better fic-wise than Elder-Scrolls style 'grind to 100'.
