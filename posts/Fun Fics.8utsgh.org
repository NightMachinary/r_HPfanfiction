You know, after a lot of time I realized there was a difference between being a /good/ fanfiction and being a /fun/ fanfiction. I have a pretty serious life, so I often turn to fanfiction and this subreddit (see my previous post "The Most Interesting Man in the World") for more of an enjoyable wild ride and happier moments.

I can name quite a few fics that are definitely well-written, memorable, and inspiring. But that is not to say they are /fun/.

What I mean is that its a fic that, regardless of the genre/pairing/setup/characters, it feels enjoyable. Not too surreal and cracky, but entertaining to read.

Here is an example: Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches. I do not think I can say this is a good fic (it improves and its interesting, but on balance its not to me), but it feels like the characters are having fun with the situation. Even with all the plotting and serious situations, you get the feeling that the characters are still living life as enjoyably as they can. Characters are making jokes and being sarcastic, but their is still an underlying seriousness to the plot.

So if you can, hit me with the fics that feel like the most fun to you.

Edit: I hope I was clear enough on what I am looking for. Will revise if needed.


** I found this story to be fun. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11913447/1/Amalgum-Lockhart-s-Folly]]). It's funny and original or at least it seemed that way to me. Hope you enjoy

  Death wants free of its Master and proposes sending Harry back in time to avoid the unnecessary deaths in fighting Voldemort. Harry readily accepts, thinking he'll start anew as a Firstie. Instead, Harry's soul, magic, and memories end up at the beginning of Second Year --- in GILDEROY LOCKHART!

*** I read this after your recc and I have to say it's been one of the best I've read. I similarly to OP do not like serious or dark fanfiction because it's easy for me to be affected by what I read emotionally and I dislike being so anxious because of what I read. This fic is ace. Thanks.
