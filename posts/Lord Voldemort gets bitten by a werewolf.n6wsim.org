** I feel like he just cynically did the blood purity thing because they were already a strong political bloc and with that avenue cut off he'd just make himself the champion of the underclass, uniting the muggleborns, the poor, the disenfranchised like werewolves, giants, hags against the Malfoys, Fudges, and Umbridges of the world. He'd still be only in it for the power though so expect a lot of murdering, both his enemies and his purported allies. He probably can't win over Dumbledore even with his closer political alignment for personal reasons, and similarly he might retain some of the Death Eaters in canon because they were more there for personal than political reasons and that might be enough to overcome their anti-werewolf prejudice.
