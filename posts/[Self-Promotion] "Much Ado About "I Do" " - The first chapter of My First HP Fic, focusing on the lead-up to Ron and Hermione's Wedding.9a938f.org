I hope you enjoy! And please feel free to give feedback, I need all the constructive criticism I can get!


** I totally don't understand the main premise and central conflict of this chapter (and maybe the whole fic?): That Hermione (or Harry or Ron) for that matter would realize this might be a problem so late in the game?! Of course they would have to have a muggle wedding if Hermione wants to invite her muggle family and friends. Why has no one realized this before now? I don't want to go on a whole big rant, but why is it always all about the damn Weasleys and their comforts? It's as if muggles and Hermione are barely people.

What's the big deal? Just collect everyone's wands if they can't follow one of their most important laws while drunk?! Surely everyone can refrain from casting magic for a single day. It's not that hard. (And really, it's not Hermione or Ron's responsibility to keep their guests from breaking the law)

Edit: I forgot... sometimes it's not immediately clear who's speaking. I think you're trying to be to clever. "Ron said", "Harry said", ... are just fine.

For example:

#+begin_quote
  "Of course! My family is already under the impression that I was at a special boarding school, so we just need to offer up similar explanations whenever something magical comes up!" Hermione turned to Ron excitedly. "Can you remember how many muggle-borns and half-bloods we've invited?" *Ron scrunched his eyebrows together as he wracked his memory.*

  "Erm, aside from Dean and Seamus, we've invited Dennis Creevey, Hannah Abbott, and..." he shrugged nonchalantly. "I can't think of anyone else, but aside from them, I don't think it'll be too difficult to keep discussions vague around the muggles." *Hermione nodded as she added to her notes.*

I think the bold part belongs in the next paragraph and it will be much easier to read.

I don't know how Hermione could maintain friendships with muggles as 9 months of the year she is at school, not to mention the Second Wizarding War. I'm not sure if it is canon/fanon but I don't know how many (muggle) friends she would have. The only people she was close with (enough to be worried over in DH) were her mother/father (who she obliviated) who already know about magic. If she was close enough to anyone else she didn't care enough about their safety to move them, so I would wager she didn't have much else.

​I don't see Hermione having many muggle guests at all; her mother and father would likely be the only ones.

#+end_quote

I don't think this is fair at all to say. If there is a conflict between Wizarding/Muggle custom why should muggle custom win out? Especially when Hermione is a witch, not a muggle.

You're right. I was thinking more along the lines of extended family anyway.

Then there's no problem with the Statute and they can fire all the magical fireworks they want.

Because she can't invite muggle relatives if it's a magical wedding? It's not like it's a huge imposition not to cast magic. Wizards and Witches don't stop being Wizards and Witches if they can't cast for a few hours. Not to mention that marriage is kinda a give and take, you know? "This Wedding is OFF if I can't wave my wand around!!111". LOL. Not allowing magic when there are muggles around is the only thing that makes sense. Hogwarts students can't cast for the whole summer and they survive fine, without having a mental breakdown.

I can't emphasize enough that it sounds like a joke to me that this is supposed to be a big issue. How are they even going to get married if laughable problems like these aren't even handled.

***** I agree that the conflict is a bit contrived, but I don't think it is as simple as "oh let's just have a muggle wedding".

We don't know much about wizarding customs but I think its fair to assume there are norms and practices that are different from muggle ones. *At the very least have two different weddings so that way both are observed*, I've seen this very often in fanon and is really the only fair way to do it.

#+end_quote

That's really easy to say as a muggle. Try going a few hours without using your hands. That's how it would be for a wizard; magic is an integral part of who they are. I don't think it is as simple (or as little of a detail) as you think it would be.

That's a possibility. Sure. Apparently both Ron and Hermione are retarded enough to never even have talked about how they want to have their wedding? They already have a seating plan though!!!11

What if Hermione is catholic? Ah no-one cares anyway, as long as the Weasleys get to de-gnome the garden and Molly gets to cook something.

It's like the first thing they would have to decide. Not some panicked revelation.

I don't buy that shit. We see plenty of Wizards and Witches just hanging out like normal people all the time. They use magic more as a tool (to clean the dishes or cook), it's not like they go into some kind of withdrawal if they don't touch their comfort stick every few minutes. It's like saying: "You can't bring your smart phone"

  Ron and Hermione's wedding is approaching! Planning a wedding ceremony and reception can't be any harder than planning the downfall of the Dark Lord...right? Meanwhile, Harry contemplates his future with Ginny. RonxHermione with some HarryxGinny on the side. Canon-Compliant.
