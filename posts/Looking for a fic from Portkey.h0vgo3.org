:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Hello everyone! I read it a long time ago so i remember just a few things: It's harmony Set in the 7th year 3 or 4 chapters (if i'm not mistaken one chapter is about ron and luna relationship) Harry behaves weirdly and kiss, out of nowhere hermione outside their classroom where some of their classmates are nearby.

Anyone have any ideas?

Thanks for your help!


** I'm assuming (captain obvious) it's no longer on portkey-archive.org. Do you have anything else (of the plot) to go by or even a guess at part of the author's name, (or how you initially found that author/story) as what you provided is way too general to use for a search?

*** Nope, I've a gut feeling that it was a three chapters story with one focused on the sudden change ij harry/hermione relationship (above all his odd behavior towards her and I'll take a blind guess and say is Ron pov ) and another one on ron/luna.

That's all. It really was ages ago. /sighs/

**** Again being captain obvious Did you try the search function on portkey setting relationship to Harry/Hermione and setting minimum and maximum chapter length to 3? And then scroll through the results to see if a summary tweaks your memory?

** The flair you should be using, in this case, is 'What's that fic?' and not 'Request'.
