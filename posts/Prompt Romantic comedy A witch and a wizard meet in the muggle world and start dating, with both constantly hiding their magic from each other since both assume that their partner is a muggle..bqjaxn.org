** /NSFW-ish/

“You sure have a lot of photos,” was the first thing she said.

“Yeah,” Ted replied, and then tugged at his collar. The photos had come with the frames he'd purchased in the local Supermarket when he moved to the country. He didn't actually know any of the people in them. He hoped Jill wouldn't ask.

“Who's this?” Jill asked, pointing to a photo of a smiling man.

“Oh, that's, um...that's my uncle Sam.”

Jill looked at the man---who was darker than charcoal---and then turned her eyes to her new class partner, cocking an eyebrow as she watched him pass through three shades of red, a color only emphasized by the original paleness of his skin.

“I come from a diverse background,” Ted explained lamely.

“That's strange,” Jill said, slowly tapping her finger against the frame. “I keep thinking you look familiar. We haven't met anywhere before?”

Ted shook his head and shrugged.

“Well, anyways. Let's get set up then?”

“Sure. Of course. I'm sorry, it's a little messy, I didn't expect us to meet here. I thought the library...”

“That's alright.”

“Yeah. No. I mean, of course. I'm just saying, I was a little surprised that you chose my apartment, usually girls don't...”

“Oh?” Jill turned to stare at Ted in a way that made him even more flustered. “Girls don't usually come here? Now I'm sorry.”

/She's a sadist/, thought Ted, tugging at his collar again. He cleared his throat and tried to explain. “It's just: we only met today, in class, and you don't really know me, and I don't know you, so we're basically strangers, but then you want to meet in my home...not that you should be worried, that's not what I'm trying to say here... ” Tongue-tied, he lapsed into an awkward silence.

Jill stared at him with mild amusement, milking it for a good twenty seconds. “I'm not worried,” she finally said, with a hint of a grin on her lips. “I can handle myself.”

Ted exhaled audibly. “Oh. That's good.”

“It is. So, let's get freaky?”

“...What?”

Jill rolled her eyes. “You really can't take a hint, can you?”

“Take a hint?”

Jill sighed and then crossed over to the side of the room where Ted was standing. “Don't make me say it outright,” she murmured into his ear, slidding the palms of her hands up his back. “A girl doesn't want to be blunt.”

Ted was red again and still stuttering when she pressed a finger to his lips. “Shh. Just one question. We definitely haven't been introduced before today, have we?”

“I don't...I don't think so,” he replied shakily. “I'd have remembered you.”

“Good,” she smiled widely, leading him backwards into the bedroom. “That's what I wanted to hear.”

.... ....

When Ted had haphazardly mugglified his apartment, he had forgotten to replace one single photo. Jill found it the next morning, when, with a sleepy and satisfied expression, she strode naked into the bathroom. When she walked out, there it was: Ted and his family, waving their hands at the camera, fifty feet off the ground. Jill went red, then white, then she screamed.

“I can explain!” Ted yelled, when he saw the cause of the commotion. “It's a trick! Aneemation! My friend, he ugh, works with...”

“Oh, shut up!” she snapped. “Save that for the muggles, Ted! I thought you looked familiar! What your name---your /real/ name?”

When he told her, Jill did some quick calculations in her head and then cursed. “First cousins,” was her final verdict.

Ted sat down on his bed and gripped his head.

“/Fuck!/”

....

“And that kids, is how I met your mother.”

​

“What do you do for work?” Evelyn asked.

They were cuddled on a bench by the water, a package of crisps half eaten on Rose's lap and Evelyn's ears still ringing a little from the club they'd wandered out of after several hours.

“I---er---I work with records,” Rose stammered, for the first time in the night her cool facade fading. 

“Records?” Evelyn questioned politely, “That's, er---interesting.”

“It's really not,” Rose answered, recovering. “Incredibly dull really, mostly fact-checking and tracking down books that have gone missing. What about you?”

“Oh, well, I work with the chemist,” Evelyn said, drawing from the briefing the Muggle Relations Office did with the departments earlier that year. “You know, measuring out ---er---medicines.”

“Oh,” Rose answered, confusion on her face.

Knowing her story wouldn't hold up under questioning, Evelyn chose to slip her hand into Rose's and the question disappeared from her lips as they tilted their heads towards one another. They didn't say anything for some time after that.

** I've seen this trope in actual stories. In fact, I think I've read a couple like it.

If I recall correctly, one was post-war, and involved Harry, living as a muggle under glamors to disguise himself and get some peace, becoming Ginny Weasley's roommate, who he had never met for complicated reasons*, and who was living alone in the muggle world after school to try to claim some independence for herself. They eventually figure out what is going on, of course. The story might have been hosted on SIYE but I truly can't recall; I had to have read more than five years ago, maybe even ten.

(*If I remember it right, he'd been raised apart from the wizarding world until he was brought out as heavy artillery at the last moment to off Voldemort in the last battle. But it's been so long I really can't swear to that, either.)
