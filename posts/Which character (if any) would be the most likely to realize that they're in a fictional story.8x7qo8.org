As they are in canon, preferably. I'm not sure if any actually could, but I'm curious to hear your guys' thoughts.


** I like the idea of Dumbledore realizing he's acting within a narrative and trying to turn the situation to his advantage. Sort of a new twist on a manipulative Dumbles. He sends Harry to the Dursleys specifically to set his childhood up as a sort of dark mirror to tom riddle, since he knows such a correspondence would be a powerful narrative device. Likewise, he installs Snape as potions teacher because being persecuted by an evil teacher is such a fixture of childrens lit. not for any other reason

basically, he ends up making all his decisions for the same out-of-universe reasons that rowling herself did

*** It'd be amusing to imagine various people's reactions.

*Harry*

Luna: Harry, there's something I need to tell you.

Harry: Go ahead.

Luna: We're in.a book.

Harry: What?

Luna: I mean, we're characters in a story.

Harry: Wha...

Luna: A children's story. Somebody wrote about us. Or to be more precise, somebody wrote out our adventures before they happened.

Harry: Luna....how can I say this nicely...did you hit your head on something?

*Hermione*

Luna: Hermione! We're in a story!

Hermione: What? Oh, Merlin...tell me Rita did not--

Luna: No, no! Rita's in the story too. And Dumbledore! And Harry and Ron! We're all characters in a storybook.

Hermione: Don't be ridiculous!

Luna: Hermione...

Hermione: That's completely rubbish, Luna. There's less sense in that than what Rita writes.

*Ron*

Luna: Ronald! We're in a story!

Ron: What?

Luna: Our lives, we're in a story! Somebody is writing a book about Harry's life!

Ron: Well, of course they are. He's the Boy Who Lived Chosen One Defeater of Voldemort. Whatshisname, the bloke with the vampire from Slughorn's party? Didn't he want to write some books?

Luna: Did he? I don't remember. I was talking to Sanguini. He was most interested in the Rotfang Conspiracy. But that's not quite what I meant.

*Xenophilius*

Luna: Daddy! We're in a story!

Xeno: Aren't we all in a story, or rather, part of the story of Life, or perhaps the Universe?

Luna: No, Dad--I mean we are characters in somebody's book. Someone is literally writing a book about Harry. We're all just made up.

Xeno: Oh my dear, I think you need to lie down Luna.

*Kreacher*

Luna: Mr. Kreacher, we're in a story.

Kreacher: Kreacher does not understand, Miss Luna. Master Harry said to be patient with Miss Luna but Kreacher finds it difficult.

Luna: Somebody is writing a book about us. Everything in this world is part of this book.

Kreacher: Kreacher does not understand. Kreacher is sorry.

*Ginny*

Luna: Ginny, you have to believe me! We're all just characters in a story!

Ginny: What do you mean?

Luna: I mean that somebody, somewhere, thought up us and made us.

Ginny: You mean God?

Luna: No...I don't think so. I think someone is writing a story about Harry and we're characters in the story too.

Ginny: Uh....

Luna: Please...nobody else believes me.

Ginny: I'm not sure....

Luna: /Shoulders sag/

Ginny: What does it matter one way or the other?

Ginny: /Squeezes Luna's hand/

Ginny: You're real enough to me.

*** Not Hermione, I don't think.

Remember, her whole /life/ has been run on the logic of children's stories. She's been fictional the whole time. A Hermione raised in our world and dropped into a story later on would see it, but a Hermione whose entire world and experience rested on the internal logic of her fictional world might not.

**** But that's not quite true. We hear nothing of Hermione's upbringing pre-Hogwarts, and so we are meant to assume she had a "normal" childhood as /we/ conceive of it. Thus her childhood can be assumed to be something that wouldn't be out-of-place in the real world, and thus it is equivalent to her having been raised in our world and later dropped into the Potterverse.

It's not as obviously story like as Hogwarts, but it's still a story. Her baseline for when things are weird vs when they're not is going to be very, very slightly askew.

** Tom Riddle aka Voldemort. Despite starting off as a mere orphan in war-torn London, he has powers nobody else does even when entering the wizarding world, is descended from someone legendary, rapidly becomes a superior magician with and without wand to everybody else, puts parts of his soul in several legendary artifacts that must be destroyed before he can be defeated, becomes the country's (if not the world's) most feared dark lord...and then he's blown up by deus ex machina, finds a nemesis in a boy who inexplicably refuses to die, and ultimately dies to that same boy in another deus ex machina (or so it seems to him, anyway).

At some point, I think, he might have wondered if he were the plaything of some all-powerful author.\\
Or two authors! One writing an evil power fantasy, then another who wanted to write their own OC in the same universe and decided to have Voldemort killed off, twice.

** Honestly, any of the inner circle death eaters. They all seem to be fairly thinly drawn villains who despite being savvy and skilled don't demonstrate hardly any thoughtfulness in their motivation. I could easily see Lucius, Bellatrix, or Barty figuring out their actions just don't make much sense and questioning their reality. Narcissisa or Snape would be reasonable too and that sounds like it'd make a good story.
