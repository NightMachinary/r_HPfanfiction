*** Speaking of Delphini, I tend to think she was NOT Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter, and was DECEIVED in believing that, because:

- She was part [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Augurey][Augurey]], a magical creature that required such relatively recent ancestors. But there were no known instances among Blacks and Gaunts.
- Her hairs also differed greatly from Bellatrix and Voldemort, who both had black hairs.
- Salazar Slytherin had descendent in North America. [[http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Isolt_Sayre][Isolt Sayre]] was one of them and co-founded Ilvermorny. Parselmouths were not restricted to Gaunts family alone.

My theory was that Delphini descended from Slytherin's North American branch and was abducted by Death Eaters. Because of her Parselmouth ability, she was brainwashed into believing that her parents were Bellatrix and Voldemort, and she was raised as a weapon to be used against Harry and Co.

** Before I go on to consider the content, I'll go over my thoughts about the play simply as a play.

The first thing I should note on this front is to reiterate how spectacular the play is as a performance. The magical tricks are amazing, from the time travel effect, which causes the entire room to look like it's wobbling, pillars and all, to the giant gouts of flame shot across the stage in the finale, to the transfiguration/polyjuice scenes. Some of the tricks were very cleverly done, such as the centaur Bane, who they depicted by having one person standing in front of the other, with the space between them and the person behind in shadow so that you could only see the front person and rear legs. The dementors, who were on wires floating around the theatre, including over the audience and all the way up to the balcony, were also great. But the best effect for me had to be the portraits, which were done by having the frame hanging in the air and the actor standing behind them, with their legs in shadow so you could only see the part of their body within the frame. Sounds simple, but the way they were lit somehow gave them a real appearance of two-dimensionality.

Something which has been talked about less but still impressive, I thought, were the "scene setting" montages. Basically whenever they introduce a new location, the scene is set via dance piece. Wizards dressed in costume typical of that location go through a choreographed "dance", often doubling up as stage hands setting up the props for the scene. The best of these was the opening of Part 2, in which you're introduced to the dystopian Voldemort-run world. The music in that section was great, and the wizards marching around in the dance were wearing these militaristic kind of robes that were vaguely reminiscent of (but not directly referential to) the Nazis.

The acting was also pretty good in general. The big surprise of the play on that front were Scorpius, who was genuinely hilarious, and Delphi, who was pretty charismatic. Of all the people in the play, it's Delphi whose voice has stuck in my mind.

So those are my thoughts on the play in itself. Now for thoughts about the content as it fits into the HP continuity.

*** Overall, many of the fears I had before the play were not borne out. I had read all the spoilers before the play, and had many problems with what I had read. But for a lot of them, the way they were presented redeemed them in my eyes.

For example, Albus and Scorpius' decision to save Cedric, as opposed to doing any number of other things with the time turner. That didn't make sense to me, pre-play. But the way it's done makes it work. It's clearly a knee-jerk decision Albus makes in the heat of the moment, an expression of teen rebellion. It's not about saving Cedric at all, it's about defying Harry (something Scorpius explicitly notes later on in the play).

Another gripe I had pre-play was the characterisation of Harry (in particular as a spectacularly bad father). But the play as presented rather normalises this. For a start, it's clear that a lot of Harry's apparent bad fatherhood is just Albus being a typical angsty teenager over not much. That makes Albus an annoying character, but no more so than Harry was sometimes in OotP. And it's again explicitly noted in the play. There's a scene where Scorpius and Albus have an argument which essentially revolves around Albus' level of self-absorbtion and how he's constantly moaning about how terrible it is to be Harry's son, when actually he has it pretty good compared to people who have real problems (like Scorpius, whose mother died). And the whole "here's my blanket" scene, which sounded absurd in abstract, makes sense. It's not that it's Harry's blanket, it's that it was Lily's, and thus a family heirloom, one of the few Harry owns. Finally, a lot of the problems with the Harry-Albus relationship are redeemed by the resolution.

The time travel was another problem I had with the story from the spoilers. But this is something that again works well as presented. People have in general become too hung up on the fact that the time travel device is called a time turner but it doesn't work as time turners do in PoA (closed loop time travel).

But it's made very clear in the play that it's a new design of time turner made by a different person from the originals, for a different purpose, with different mechanics. And it's a prototype. I actually quite like this because it goes against the fanon idea that the wizarding world is static. It's basically a new form of time travel magic only vaguely related to the time turners we saw before. Further, if you reread PoA, you will note that Hermione had been warned against not doing certain things while back in time, such as meeting yourself. This implies that it is possible to change the past in PoA time travel mechanics, and the "closed loop" time travel is just what happens when you time travel safely.

That said, the time travel does still have some problems, such as its selective effect on people's memories of the previous timeline (Delphi remembers the previous timeline despite not going back in time, whereas Harry does not), and with inconsistency in the time at which the effects of the time travel materialise. Sometimes when you change the past it affects the present instantly, erasing the original timeline. But other times when you change the past, people in the present have time to go back in time themselves to reverse the change. These are inconsistencies which are clearly made for the convenience of the story.

And that brings me to a very important point, which is the way in which many of the plot and setting decisions are made to suit the format of it being a play. JK Rowling has said that it's a story that could only be told in theatre, and she's completely right. A similar story could be told as a book, but many scenes would be different.

A perfect example is Harry's duel with Draco. Pre-play, I had a problem with this: Harry is by this point a seasoned Auror, the Head of Magical Law Enforcement, and not even a paper-pusher, as the story has been keen to emphasise that Harry neglects his paperwork in favour of going on missions. So by all logic, Harry should beat Draco relatively easily. They were roughly equals at school, and now Harry has a ton of extra experience and training that Draco does not. But it's a draw, with perhaps Draco coming out slightly the better.

That rankled me when I first heard of it, but once again the way the play presents it makes it clear that the outcome of the duel has been determined by the format as a play. Essentially the purpose of the duel is to be a visual spectacle for the audience, a chance for the play to show off the acting, stagecraft and clever visual effects. In a realistic duel, they would be casting/blocking/shielding simultaneously, and the first person to have been hit by a spell would have surely lost the duel. But in this, each of Harry and Draco get hit by several spells. They basically take turns to cast jinxes on each other, then pause to let the audience enjoy the effect of each spell as it hits. When Harry hits Draco with Tarantallegra (the dancing jinx), for example, he doesn't take advantage of Draco's distraction to finish the duel with a stunning spell or similar. No, he sits back, lets the audience enjoy the dancing, before Draco cancels the spell and takes his turn to hit Harry with a spell of his own.

This is just one example of a phenomenon you see throughout the play: the content of the story has been driven by a desire to take advantage of the format of a play.

That makes its canon status awkward, however. JK Rowling has said she considers Cursed Child to be the 8th Harry Potter story, a continuation of the main series, and thus canonical. How can this be reconciled with so many of its elements being unique to its format and therefore clashing with the main series? The 7 HP books are largely designed to be taken seriously. Duels are genuine fights determined by who is better at magic, in which the characters try with all their ability to win. The play is not designed to be taken nearly as seriously, with so much of it there for pure entertainment purposes. In tone, it feels like a Christmas special.

I can think of a couple of solutions. The first is to consider the play canon in overview but not specifics. So stuff like who cast which spell when would not be canon, but the fact that Harry and Draco had an inconclusive duel interrupted by Ginny would be. The problem with this is the arbitrary line between specifics and generalities. The second solution, and the one I favour, is to view this as "play canon", which is a kind of separate continuity. It's still canon, yes, but it's distinguished from pure book canon. Rather like Star Trek canon before and after the reboot. The third solution is to try to reconcile the play and the books but bearing in mind the way the format of the play has influenced it and trying to discount those elements. This is perhaps similar to how sometimes Philosopher's Stone canon is at odds with the later 6 books (no apparition, Hagrid could fly, curses needed eye contact) because JKR had yet to settle on some of the world building elements and the tone.

But in the end, there was just one element of the story that I found unforgivable, and that was making Delphi Voldemort's daughter. Delphi is actually a pretty great character. As I said above, she's charismatic and the way she manipulates Albus is fun to watch. I think the play would have been just fine if she had been Bellatrix's daughter by Rodolphus rather than Voldemort. There are just so many problems with making her Voldemort's daughter. Firstly, Voldemort believed himself immortal and was fully confident in that fact. He didn't need an heir for any pragmatic purpose. Secondly Voldemort had no sentimentality so he surely wouldn't want a child for any reason other than pragmatism. Thirdly, it ruins the Voldemort-Bellatrix dynamic of her being obsessed with him but him feeling nothing in return and using her feelings. Fourthly it gives Voldemort a sexual identity when he always seemed so inhuman and thus asexual in the books. Fifthly it undermines the idea that wizards are not determined by their birth by having Voldemort's daughter be not only evil but also extremely talented at magic like he was. It also undermines Voldemort's special status if other dark wizards quickly equal his level of threat just decades after he died. And last but not least, it's just so cliche, so predictable, for the new villain to be the heir of the old.

**** You explained everything so well and so logically. I don't know which part to compliment the most because all of your points are excellent.

I love your points about how it being a play itself gives it an awkward place within canon, because I have agree and let some things slide in the play for this reason, because the stage demands a different world logic, which I support, because I think it's cool to have a story that goes across media, and I'm prepared for thing to be different. I also love your points about how the does or doesn't contradict canon - I have also tried to defend that the time travel (though poorly writter) doesn't contradict PoA (though I do think the time travel in CC contradicts itself, like you mention about Delphi remembering things she shouldn't). Above all, I absolutey love your point here,

** Overall, no I don't.

Primarily because of the fact it was not written by JK. She may have signed off on it but it was not her work and lacked the same overall feel.

Also, the necessary retcons to the character of Cedric and the established nature of timeturners are out of bounds to me - the minute you need to say "well disregard what I said before" to make the plot work it has left the boundaries of canon for me.

I tend to accept only the 7 books as canon, Pottermore and the films (including FBs) as "canon adjacent" where details are "heavily suggested" and generally accepted by most readers as acceptable with the HP verse but can be omitted if you so desire. Beyond that, you have interviews and JK's twitter which are not canon and while you might find insight or details you like therein you don't have the same expectation of broad acceptance or even general knowledge of.

The truth is - Cursed Child was merely an "approved" fan fiction which gives it some credence but not the weight of canon (IMO of course).

If it makes you feel better, America has a tendency to come up with new words for marginalized people faster than Usain Bolt can run a mile. I'm one of the few people who doesn't dislike the word No-Maj, but as an American vaguely familiar with the history of English, regionalisms, and America's shit civil rights history, there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that by 2017, Americans would have a new word and there's a lot of credibility to your headcanon that only the East Coast used that word. For that matter, maybe just NYC used it. Hell, maybe only TriBeCa used it, since that's the neighborhood the film was designed to resemble.

Anything that wasn't written by the original author for any book series, I don't consider canon

It's like if George RR Martin died and someone else decided to finish ASOIAF in his stead-- that shit wouldn't be canon because it would likely deviate completely from what the original author intended it to be, as well as it being likely a different writing style.

Same applies here to me, regardless of if JK Rowling signed off on the production/writing of it. It's just a play that takes place in the HP universe, it is not important to the Harry Potter universe.

I know what you mean about him coming across as asexual but as it's demonstrated in HBP, he uses his charm and good looks to woo Hepzibah Smith. He uses his sexuality to get what he wants which is a sociopathic trait

(I think he'd try it on with Dumbledore if he thought it would work)

Perhaps Bella was getting a bit out of hand and he reeled her back in using sex. The only part I have trouble with is WHEN was she pregnant - it takes 10 months so she must have had Delphi during the last year

Mostly, I felt like the thing with Voldemort dragged on, he just wasn't that interesting a villain. Unsurprisingly, 3 is my favourite.

** Personally i always find it quite troubling when people say that they themselves pick what's canon and what isn't. Since it is another book from the harry potter series and at least the plot was signed off by rowling it is canon and there is no real arguing that.

BUT here's where it gets tricky, because there are A LOT of discrepancies between the original series and cc. If they were only slight mistakes, like in the first book when hermione says that curses need eye contact we could ignore them, but they are much more severe. Events not lining up with the timeline of the original series, characters acting completly ooc and previously established mechanics working differently.

(note: in general there are certain things in cc that don't fit into the universe and style of the hp series, for example the snack witch or w/e she's called. The way her backstory and the events around her are written (the train doesn't want you to leave) don't fit into the harry potter universe, but rather into somewhat “cheap“ fantasy like percy jackson.)

So what to do? I think it is best to still accept it as canon but basically as canon of a different world (or universe or timeline, whichever you want). (random note: I actually find plot holes and inconsistencies quite troubling, unless they eventually get explained/fixed, simply because i don't believe in the practice of ignoring problems, lol.) This doesn't mean that nothing in cc is true, but this way inconsistencies and such are easily explained. I know it is a bit of a lazy explanation, but i do not see a different way to come to terms with cc.

I would love to hear any opinions on this and different ways to cope with ccs problems, apart from simply ignoring parts of it.

*** The word comes from comic books that have dozens upon dozens of canon universes for the same character. It was a way to differentiate between multiple universes. Your theory not only makes sense but describes the very circumstances that led to the word being created in the first place.

edit: actually, comics took the word from Christians because the bible also needed to differentiate between multiple denominations, essentially mutliple "rulesbooks".

** I ignore it completely. There's just too many things that are wrong with it: Hermione's out-of-character line to Harry, calling him, "My old friend", the trolley witch and her "claws" or whatever they were, the use of jumping all over time like it was a bounce house, Voldemort and Bellatrix having a child together (what?!), Ron's near-absence, and James' total absence.

The only thing I generally liked about Cursed Child was the friendship between Scorpius and Albus, along with the resistance group, made up of Snape, Hermione, and Ron; the latter was quite incredible and would have preferred to read a story solely based on that than what was given to us in the packaged of Cursed Child.

** I did not like reading Cursed Child and hated how much it changed certain characters.

But, to be entirely honest, I was never going to like it once I knew the general plot (about Harry's kid, set after epilogue). I always wanted a post-battle story set closely after the events of the original series. I thought that there was a tremendously interesting story that would have focused on the characters rather than just a fantastical plot. I wanted to see Harry deal with everything that happened to him in his life but that he never had time to really process. I wanted to see how Ron and Hermione stumbled into a relationship. I wanted to see how Ginny handled everything being the person outside the trio who had her own trauma to work through.

Cursed Child was not that. It was a time travel story that only touched upon genuinely interesting character development (Harry struggling to be the dad his uncle never was; Ginny's lingering issues with being the 4th wheel to the trio, etc). Plus we got nothing from the extended Weasley family. The play thought it made more sense to revisit Goblet of Fire and introduce a bunch of original characters than give George a meaty story.

As far as if it is canon, simply put it is. I take the view that if the author/creator of a work of fiction says something is canon, that's end of story. Because if we can ignore that, we can pretty much pick and choose what's canon from the original series too.

I'm don't think your conclusion is flawed, but I think the way you get to your conclusion might be slightly flawed. Even without Cursed Child, there are things we have to pick and choose from the seven books as canon. I don't mean we can decide if Sirius really died or not, but there are slight discrepencies even within the books. Dumbledore tells Harry that he and Peter Pettigrew have a bond because he saved Peter's life, which turns out to be nothing. Things like the Trace and Secret Keeper's change just enough that we do have to choose to ignore what we had already learned, not to mention how some things could be solved with things that weren't invented yet.

From what I can tell fans are not bothered by this, but I think the fact these examples exist muddle your final point about choosing what is and isn't canon. Perhaps a stronger argument is that the creator of a work of fiction has the right to have the last say? It still prevents people from picking and choosing canon without having to account for the slight discrepencies within the books themselves.

**** But I think there is a difference between ignoring canon because it contradicts other canon, and just ignoring canon text

CC surely had a lot of instances that contradicted existing canon, and I think it is completely fair to ignore those pieces since they directly contradict what we thought we knew. You have to, because both can't be right and exist in the same universe. But where there is no conflict in canon, I don't think you can still choose to ignore it.

Yes, it would be crazy to think one can just ignore Sirius' death, but I don't see how that would be much different than ignoring any other event (unless that event contradicts a previous event). Both events did happen, even if one holds way more weight in the story than the other.

This is the point I intended to make as well. Your phrase about choosing to ignore canon was about CC, but the logic could be used in other ways that weaken your point about what canon is. I meant to suggest an alternative phrase that expresses what you want to express, but also isn't saying anything about minor plot contradictions. It's possible I have too much time on my hands, lol. I honestly don't know why I'm arguing for CC, I don't even like the play.

** Many people have stated my opinion (that since it was not written by JK, then its not canon). However the same could be said for the films which many consider canon. The difference to me is not that it was written by JK. The difference for me is that CC is a play. As Taure said, a play is radically different from a book based canon. In plays, people are exaggerated, the actions are modified, and the world is simplified.

Not only that, but CC adds very little to canon in my mind. Most characters are exaggerated versions of themselves, and if they are in character, nothing is really gained. It was probable that Albus would go to Slytherin, most likely to befriend Scorpius. Harry was never going to stop being a hero, as he has a saving people thing. Hermione was going to be in the ministry. Hermione and Ron definitely do PDA if they kiss during a war.

Then we have things that go against canon. Voldemort, in character, would NEVER have touched Bellatrix. period. end of story. Voldemort was anti-social, sociopathic, and genocidal. He cared for no one, including his followers.

That is the biggest reason I will not consider CC canon. To be blunt, I don't believe that the author's word is god. However, it is a major aspect. If the author is alive, and not washed their hands of the product, then they are the experts on the product. However, it must be realized that while yes that is a good 50 percent of "canoninity" 50 is still a failing grade. The other aspects, such as where it falls, does it keep characters in character, and does it make sense in the universe make up that other 50%. and In honesty, CC does not make the cut.

** I like the idea of Voldemort and Bellatrix having a kid, but having her be a stark raving lunatic on the fringe of society isn't what I'd like to read. I'd like to see her for to Hogwarts (she might even be in Teddy's year) and live in normal wizarding society and see how she fits there. Maybe she was raised by Narcissa after the war?
