  Hermione returns to Hogwarts after the war to earn her NEWTs and falls in love with her least favourite professor. This story is a long slow burn. If you want to skip to the action I suggest starting at chapter 37. This fic is complete. The story continues in part 2: Hermione and the Philosopher King.

  "Harry and Violet Potter were highly unusual children in many ways. For one thing, they were identical twins. For another, they hated the summer holidays more than any other time of the year. And, most strangely of all, they really wanted to do their homework. Also they happened to be wizards." * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * This is the third part of my (for the most part) canon-compliant rewrite of the Harry Potter series, told from the perspective of a character that doesn't exist. Violet Potter is Harry's twin sister. This is, as faithfully as I can make it, the story of what would happen if she were there.

** Harry has a sister in Red Sorrow and both are children who lived. [[http://fictionhunt.com/read/12201337/1]]

She is Harry's half sister that was raised by Snape and is his biological daughter (Although no one apart from a few people knows that).

  What if Harry had a twin sister, someone who grew up with him as they ventured through life together, instead of him facing the world by himself. And Malfoy has a sister as well, which makes life even more chaotic. Sequel to Battle of Wills, with AU elements. Story begins with Harry's 4th year. Harry/OC/OC/Fleur. Warning: wincest, BDSM, harem.
