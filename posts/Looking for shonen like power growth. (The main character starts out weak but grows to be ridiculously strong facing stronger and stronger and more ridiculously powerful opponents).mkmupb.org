Note that I've already read "Blindness" and "Core Threads".

I've read quite the few powerful Harry fics, but strangely I haven't really found many with the shonen's characteristic take of power levels and how they change throughout the story. I don't mind crossovers or any other tags as long as the fic is long enough for the main protagonist to actually become really strong.


** Harry is told that they are a "Sport," a Wizard with the potential for supreme magical power, and engages in intense training and secret agent-style activities to stand alongside the greats, Dumbledore and Voldemort, who wield nearly godlike power in this universe.

*** Tyvm. Sadly I've already read it (much like most of Darth Marss' other fics) but had forgotten about it
