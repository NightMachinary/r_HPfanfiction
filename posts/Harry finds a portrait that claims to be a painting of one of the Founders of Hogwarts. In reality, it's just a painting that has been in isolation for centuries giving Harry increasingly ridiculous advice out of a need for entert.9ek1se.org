** "Harry, that's not Salazar Slytherin. He doesn't look anything like him," Hermione interrupts.

"Of course I don't," the portrait intervenes before Harry can respond. "It's a family thing. Runs in my genes. Everyone looks different as they age. The appearance of Slytherins changes exceptionally so as we age," the portrait points his non-nose up into the air proudly.

"I've never read that anywhere."

"Sure you have," the portrait persists. "My heir Tom Riddle is quite famous. And he doesn't look anything like he did fifty-some-odd years ago."

"Famous? I've never even heard of this Tom Riddle," Hermione refutes.

"Exactly," the portrait nods. "And that's only after fifty years. This portrait of me was made based off of my current appearance after one-thousand something years of age."

"That's not how portraits work."

"But this is a special portrait. It's more like a portal to a secret chamber, so to speak. Like how the fat lady guards Gryffindor tower. But better, because it's Slytherin."

"That still doesn't explain why you have a basilisk-face," Hermione taps her foot impatiently.

"It's called magic!" The portrait snaps. "Something you mu-- muggleborns might be unaware of.... I'm sorry for the outburst. The wizarding world just tends to be very discriminatory towards creatures, and I've been a victim of the creature prejudices for a very long time. Even when I came across a pupil with a toad-face, she didn't understand - despite our shared grievance. So excuse me if I get a bit defensive at times..."

"That's terrible!" Hermione exclaims. Suddenly outraged at the portraits lack of support."

"Yes... yes it is," the portrait stutters out. He appears to be in shock at Hermione's flip in stance. Rolling with it, the portrait expounds: "Yes, it really is quite terrible. Sometimes I just can't get myself out of bed, it's so terrible. I've been practically asleep for a thousand years."

"Is there anything we can do to help? Do you have enough resources down there? Are those goosebumps? Are you cold? I could knit you some hats?"

"That's... sweet, but no that's quite alright. Those are just scales. But, well, actually, there is one thing you could do... Harry my boy, if you could just hiss 'open' in your best impression of a snake..."

*** And Harry comes to thank the portrait profusely each time. The portrait gets confused and frustrated as his increasingly ridiculous advice somehow ends up beings helpful, and begins to think Harry is having him on.

**** Off the top of my head advices " wear a red wig in potions , snape gets Lilly flashbacks, sing to the dragon, dragon with sensitive hearing faints" (maybe advice to whistle is misinterpreted as advice to buy a dog whistle with sonorous causes the dragon to faint) if someone is going to use these please tell me so I can read and laugh

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8829953/1/Okay-Full-Disclosure][Uh...this Merlin fanfic comes to mind?]] Nothing to do with Harry Potter, but it's got a talking dragon who's been in isolation, who gives the protagonist horrible advice. Basically mocking the show.

** "Yes Harry. It's definitely a good idea to carve runes into your entire body. Nothing could possibly go wrong. I'm a millennia old genius."- first fic I read, where slyterins had a painting in the CoS, had slytherin convince Harry to carve runes into his skin to prepare for the Goblet of Fire. But sadly nothing went wrong.

** "Oh! Finally I'm found!" The woman in the portrait was smiling manically. "Please take me with you, my hero."

Harry tried to smile back at the painting but was clearly distracted, eyes examining the pile of artefacts beneath her.

"Oh, er, sorry, I was looking for someone else." He said whilst looking for somewhere to leave her.

"Wait! I am the one you're looking for!" She cried out, reaching toward the barrier between her reality and his.

"No, really, I'm looking for Rowena Ravenclaw, it's a matter of great importance."

"I am she! I am Rowena!" The painted lady cried out. Harry looked at the portrait disbelievingly. The woman had unruly red hair and a heavily freckled face, she also wore a green dress and held a harp that took up half the frame.

"I'm sorry but you don't really look like her." Harry was still looking for somewhere to put her down. He didn't really had time for this. He needed Rowena's painting because there was a nut job that the aurors had taken in who used an ancient spell invented by the founder herself that no one knew how to undo.

Said spell had left poor Ron and a good chunk of the department trying to bury themselves in dirt because of their newfound fear of the sun. Hermione and the Unspeakables were trying to find a way to break the spell but had been unable to so far. This lead Harry to Lady Grumblebeak's treasure room as the woman claimed to have the famous portrait.

"Only the wise can see I am she. For only with wisdom and intelligence can we look past, er, the book's cover to see that its, er, contents are what they seek." She nodded as if what she said was profound.

"Look, unless you know how to break a fear of the sun spell, I can't deal with this right now." Harry gently set her on a dusty crate and moved to sort through the rest of Lady Grumblebeak's assorted treasures. He sighed as the task seemed daunting amidst the towering piles of dust and artefacts.

"But I'm so alone!" The lady cried. "I mean, I alone know how to break the spell. Take me with you and I shall reveal my knowledge."

Harry felt a tinge of genuine sympathy for the painting. She clearly had not been moved from the storage room for years and years. Her once golden frame was grungy and brown and the surface of her paint was discoloured.

He turned his back on her guiltily and continued his search.

Hours later he returned to the Ministry dusty and disgruntled. He walked into the auror department, unsure of what to expect. Instead of chaos though, all he saw were a couple of confused aurors and Hermione smiling affectionately at Ron as she wiped the dirt off his face.

"So you did it!" Harry said, exceedingly grateful for his smartest friend. Hermione turned to him and smiled proudly. Her smile, though, turned into a look of surprise at the wrapped frame under his arm.

"Did you actually find Rowena Ravenclaw's portrait?" She asked, awed. "That's amazing, I have so many questions for her." Hermione reached for the frame but Harry stepped back guiltily.

"Er, actually--"

"I'd like to ask her why the bloody hell did she invent a sun fear spell." Ron interrupted, scowling. "Made me feel like an ostrich, sticking my head in the potted plant. I ought to bury her portrait for that."

A muffled squeak came from the wrapped portrait.

"Ron, there's really no point in threatening a portrait. It's not like she literally created the spell. She just looks, sounds, and thinks like the person who did." Hermione said with more than a bit of amusement.

"Actually I didn't find Rowena." Harry broke in. They turned to him in confusion, especially as the portrait under his arm protested. "She's just, er, well, I mean she told me she was Rowena but I don't think she is and anyway, she had been in that storage room for so long and she seemed sort of sad..." He trailed off at his friends' matching expressions of disbelief.

"Don't tell me your 'rescued' a bloody portrait because you thought it was lonely." Ron rubbed at his eyes wearily, smearing more dirt on his face. Hermione only sighed and once again reached for the portrait.

"Alright, let's see who she is. I guess we'd better get to know her if she's going to become your new houseguest." She unwrapped the sheet and laid the painting on a nearby desk.

"Hello to all." The painting piped up. "I am Founder of Hogwarts, Rowena Ravenclaw." She gestured broadly as if she were greeting a group. "What advice is sought of me today?"

"Reckon she's one of my ancestors?" Ron turned to Harry with a shrug.

"Not all red heads are Weasleys Ron." Hermione rolled her eyes at him. "Hello Lady Ravenclaw. My name is Hermione Granger-Weasley."

"Good day to you Hermione Granger-Weasley. Some wisdom for your ears; a bird today will fly away tomorrow if you don't keep the cage shut." The woman nodded sagely. Hermione furrowed her eyebrows in confusion.

"... Thank you."

"Anyway, since this case is all wrapped up I think I'll just take off." Harry pulled the sheet back over the painting and picked it up again.

"Oh no you don't, you're not leaving us to do all the paperwork!" Ron grabbed Harry by the collar of his robes, almost choking him. Harry sighed once Ron let go, he had been so close to getting away with it.

When he did finally return home, he first tried to stick Lady Ravenfake (Ron's name for her) in the hallway. It lasted until he sat down in the living room with a cup of tea and Quidditch Weekly. He had just opened the magazine when he heard her sobbing in loneliness. So she now hung proudly over his fireplace. Somewhat proudly anyway, Harry thought to himself, he needed to ask Molly if she knew any portrait cleaning spells.

--------------

Okay this is getting too long, the idea would continue that she tries way too hard to be Rowena even though he wants her to be comfortable and we find out the portrait is actually Rosalind Prewett who actually is Ron's ancestor but on his mom's side. Rosalind slowly starts to behave like herself again and Harry enjoys her music, she plays the harp very well, but she still seems sad. It turns out that her real life counterpart died young and her father, in his grief, had the painting made and kept it closeby until he passed away. Harry decides to try to help and then finds out that Rosalind's sister had a portrait too. He tries to find the sister but cannot because the only portrait of them is after their transition when they ran away to marry a muggle and to be a famous author. Hermione finds the portrait is apart of a private collection, Draco Malfoy's. Harry goes to Draco and Draco gives him the portrait with an intense "Family is important." Then the portraits are hung side by side and the siblings live happily in Harry's house. The end.

I honestly meant this to be a short little piece for a comment, the idea got away from me.

** Ahah I would so see something like this happen to Mr. Black from Rorschach's Blot fic. Getting stupid advices that aren't supposed to work but somehow, it works for him (and maybe him only) and makes him even more famous.
