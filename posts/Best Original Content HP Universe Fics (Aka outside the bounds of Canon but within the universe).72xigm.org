I am curious as to peoples recommendations when it comes to fan fiction that exists within the HP universe but is at least for the most part (if not completely) original content and beyond canon.

In other words, stories that may take place in different countries or beyond canon locations, do not involve most or all of the HP canon characters and have original takes on the magical world and all its elements. This is not to say it cannot contain canon references, or maybe a main canon character within a new situation and environment, or perhaps utilize a canon element (like a foreign school) within its structure and story. However, it should not follow cannon story and be, for the most part, its own original world/story.

Romance involved is preferred. Mature+ rating preferred. No main character slash preferred. I do not care if there is lemons/smut, or darker subject matter... the main thing is a decent plot or at least decent world building. Thanks all!

--------------

*Edit:* I appreciate the suggestions so far although I will say all of them are a bit closer to cannon or containing more cannon elements than I was hoping for. Just to clarify further... In my head, I was imagining a fan fiction that takes place entirely in say... America (or insert country here), and deals with a completely new character (or maybe a canon character who fled from Britain), and is living an entirely new life (maybe with adventure and romance). It still takes place within the Wizarding world, and within the world that JK Rowling developed to a degree, but also world builds and for the most part is separate from canon. Hell, perhaps there never even was a Voldemort for Britain to deal with so the rest of the world is fully unaware of any Britain issues, and this story is completely stand alone but utilizing Rowlings wizarding world universe.


** Damn, that last paragraph almost described the Anguis series word-for-word.

For a moment I considered giving you a synopsis but it might be better if you dive in blind. All you need to know is that the story features four OC Slytherins a year older than Harry.

Also, the author is so good, she made me read the only next-gen story I've ever read (Scorpius/Rose) Which I also recommend.

  A collection of shorts covering the school years of a group of Slytherin students at Hogwarts. Voldemort might not be their primary concern, but that doesn't guarantee carefree times in the powerplays of the House of the ambitious and cunning.

  Ten years after Harry Potter defeated Voldemort, the Wizarding World seems safe: until two Hogwarts students disappear without a trace in the Forbidden Forest. Strangely linked to this incident is Severus Snape, who died in the Shrieking Shack. Or did he? When Hermione Granger is pulled into the investigation, she discovers the unimaginably dangerous truth. EWE.

*** I tried to read this series ages back, but I remember being frustrated by it and being turned away fairly quickly from it. If I remember correctly it was mainly due to how much the story was treated with kid gloves, and how silly the writing and character personalities were. I may eventually try it again and it does technically fit the guidelines of my request though ;)

** For me, a couple of my favorites are linkffn(4068153) and linkffn(2889350).

There is a bit of romance in both of them, they take place all over the world outside of Hogwarts, and don't follow canon.

Wastelands of time is like a time loop fic like Groundhog Day, but Harry has been going back so long that he's thousands of years old and pretty crazy. Doesn't behave at all like canon Harry. Has some interesting OC worldbuilding and stuff. Takes a bit to get to the romance, it's really a side plot though. The sequel is unfinished, the author became a real writer and sort of stopped writing fanfics; he says he will finish it one day but it's been several years since an update.

Bungle in the Jungle is decent, Harry gets tired of Dumbledore and co. messing with him so he leaves Britain. Has a bunch of OC characters, some of them are pretty good IMO.

  Take a deep breath, count back from ten... and above all else -- don't worry! It'll all be over soon. The world, that is. Yet for Harry Potter the end is just the beginning. Enemies close in on all sides, and Harry faces his greatest challenge of all - Time.
