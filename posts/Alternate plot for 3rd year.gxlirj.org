** Depends on what deviates.

Is Sirius on the run and in contact with Harry piror to book 3? Have the plot be a manhunt for Peter and finding out he's beelining it to Voldemort, with Harry dealing with his desire to leave school and get revenge, same as PoA. Have the seeds of paranoid and weirdness continue from CoS where the school thought he was the heir and his reputation never recovers so the Ministry badmouthing and hatred over the Triwizard tournament have plenty of buildup.

If Sirius isn't involved, explore the issues around Lupin's lycanthropy and the prejudices in the wizarding world by keeping Dobby around instead of disappearing until book 4. Have Harry confront his father's checkered past earlier, have him be confronted by Snape being both a good dude for betraying the DE but also a colossal shithead to Lupin, etc etc

Alternatively, PoA is the first Harry Trains book and he's just come off of a 2nd confrontation with Voldemort that almost killed him. Have him begin training with Dumbledore or with another mentor like Sirius. Maybe even have Harry and co suspicious about the diary and trying to investigate and it's puts them at odds with Dumbledore who has begun to look into the horcruxes again.

** Aftermath of Ginny's death; Harry preparing for a battle with TMR.

*** I am reluctant to kill Ginny, but it's worth considering. Time skips are something I don't want to do.

** Hmm....

- Lucius Malfoy is forced to go on the run because of the Diary fiasco, and eventually assumes Pettigrew's role in the events of /Goblet of Fire/, with Draco trying to get revenge on Harry for getting his dad arrested.

- The Ministry starts interfering with Hogwarts, in response to the mysterious death of Quirrel and the petrifications of students, with the near death of a pureblood at the end of that series events being the last straw. Umbridge doesn't focus on Harry specifically as much as she would have, but focuses more on making muggleborns miserable due to her own bigotry, but has to be more subtle about it, because Dumbledore has a lot more clout than he did at the beginning of Voldemort's second rise.

- The Queen of England sends representatives to visit Hogwarts, because the inspection is long overdue.

- Thanks to poor vaccination rates among muggleborns, a mutated strain of Dragon Pox breaks out, Harry Potter suffering the most due to his poor nutrition at the hands of his family, Snape and Slughorn must work together with a top healer from St. Mungos to save the future of the Wizarding World.

** Hmm, it's not a very action packed plot but I enjoy seeing an exploration of Harry and Sirius becoming a family. That relationship could also be a starting point for a more academic/inquisitive Harry, now that be has a parental figure to impress and who cares about his school performance.

Maybe Wormtail is still on the run and the Ministry think he will come after Harry, so they still have Dementors at the school.

Not sure where the time turner would come into play, seems a waste to have it be around and not use it in some way.

** Depends on the tone of the story. If they free Sirius early it could be helping him adjust to life as a free man or finding someone who keeps sending anonymous cursed mail because they dont believe hes innocent or something

** If Sirius is free and cleared, that means he can now publicly control the Black family assets. Lucius Malfoy does not approve of this, as he wanted to take those assets for his family once Sirius died in prison. So Malfoy could proceed to do one of the following:

- Hire a group of wizard mercenaries/assassins to take him out, the year is spent foiling increasingly dangerous attempts

- Orchestrate an Azkaban breakout to have them kill Harry and Sirius

- Runs a smear campaign against Sirius, Harry, and Dumbledore, trying to convince Fudge to throw one or more in Azkaban

For all options, he gets found out and has to flee the country, heading to Albania to try and find his master - acknowledging that only by Voldemort conquering Britain would reverse his fall from grace

** Becoming animagi?

Depends on the manner of Sirius release - this will be the catalyst for change, without knowing this we will struggle

** If the events of second year take place as per cannon then it should be obvious to all that Voldemort's supporters are still at large causing trouble.

How about a quest to quietly eliminate them while he hangs around as a wraith in Albania.

Also, if Sirius has been rescued then it is equally apparent that the ministry is at best criminally incompetent and at worst actively malicious.

A similar quest to eliminate troublesome elements from the magical government might make for a good story.

Speaking of Sirius, his stories of Azkaban would paint the place as pretty horrible. Maybe a quest to improve things there.
