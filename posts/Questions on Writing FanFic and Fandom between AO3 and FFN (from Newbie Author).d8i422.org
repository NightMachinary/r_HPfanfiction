Hey everyone, I'm new to this subreddit and relatively new to fanfic so this might have been discussed many times before, but I can use a most updated version of the discussion anyway.

So, I recently have just started to write a gen fic and since I got into fanfic through AO3 first, that was where I naturally posted my chapters first. Now, several chapters in, I have posted on FFN as well. I'm trying to make it so I update on both sites at the same time for my next chapter.

1) Is this a common/normal thing to do (Posting on both sites simultaneously)?

2) I am largely writing for my own pleasure and to fill a gap in the fanfic-verse. But I also love feedbacks on my writing. So which site has the most "fandom activity" and what should I expect? I have no idea what a "good" number in terms of hits, kudos, favs, bookmarks, reviews, ratios etc. are and how "well I'm doing" compared to similar fics.

It's hard to gauge if there are so few comments or reviews telling so.

3) Do gen fics generally have less attention compared to slash fics?

4) How can I encourage readers to comment? I know that's not their role (they are here to read), but it would be nice.

Please advise.


** When I wrote, I used to post on both sites but always found that I had a better response from Ao3. Others correct me if I'm wrong (!) but I think Ao3 has more of a reputation for having well written work as it's a bit more regulated. From a user perspective I've also found it easier to kudos/comment on work.

It can be hard to work out what 'good' stats are- but I would try not to worry about it too much? I know that's probably not very helpful, but if you update regularly then you should start to slowly build up subscribes and kudos. If you want feedback it might just be worth asking for it in the authors notes bit? Can't hurt to try!

Personally I haven't noticed much difference between gen and slash- I think there's a big enough audience reading HP fanfic that there will always be people for both.

** On ao3 at least, people have a tendency to sort by ships, slash or otherwise, plus ao3 is, like the best place for slash readers to be, so if there aren't any, that might be a reason for low visibility.

*** Thanks for the comment. Funnily enough, I get more kudos/ comments on AO3 while I have more follows but way less reviews and favs on FFN for the exact same content.

I get a lot of traffic/views ~1.7k views and 500 visitors per day (I think that's a lot at least) but other metrics are quite dismal on FFN. So the AO3 users are more "taken" by my writing?
