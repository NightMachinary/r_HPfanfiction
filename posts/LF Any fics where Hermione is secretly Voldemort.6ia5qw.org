I read a lot of fics where she's super duper good at magic and ruthless and stuff so I got to thinking that a Seventh Horcruxesque sort of thing might make some sense. Are there any fics like this?

*** She could be a horcrux backup of Voldemort's. See he knows that someone within a certain age range is the prophecy kid and where does everyone in that age range inevitably end up? Hogwarts. To get himself an in he has a horcrux take over some baby and it's not like anyone would ever expect an outspoken muggleborn to be Lord Voldemort, right?

  They didn't question why Hermione Granger was able to cast every spell in the first class, or why she seemed to know Hogwarts: A History by heart. They never really noticed her resourcefulness, determination or cunning. A Gryffindor meant for Ravenclaw, they called her- and yet...Who would've thought that once upon a time, her name was Salazar?

** I don't know about secretly Voldemort, but the end of linkffn(Lesser Evils by Scott Press) seems to strongly imply that Hermione is a death eater, though this has yet to be addressed in the sequel.
