So I just finished a gift of time fan fic on fan fiction.net and am severely disappointed that it was left unfinished. But I know sometimes writers will move their stories too other sites. So I'm wondering if you guys know if it has been finished on another website? The gist of this fic is that hermione goes back in time and her lily, Snape and another character use music that is tethered to nature to defeat Voldemort. Anyone heard of this? It is so good and I want to read more!


** It appears to be abandoned. I read it over on Ashwinder a couple of years ago and it wasn't complete there. According to the author's profile there, four years ago (2012) the author said they were going to finish the story but there hasn't been a story update for going on eight years now (2008). An update at this point doesn't look very likely.
