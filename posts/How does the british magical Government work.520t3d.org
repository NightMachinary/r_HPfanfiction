  How does the british magical Government work?
#+end_quote

From what I can tell, bribes.

Seriously though: It seems like the Minister has broad powers and can essentially rule through fiat (such as the Educational Decrees of OoTP). It also seems that Department Heads can create/pass laws (see Arthur Weasley and the Muggle Protection Act of CoS). Whether or not the Department Head drafts the law and it is ratified by a higher authority (Minister of Magic) is too difficult to tell.

As for the Wizengamot: There is absolutely nothing in canon that I am aware of that shows the Wizengamot to be anything other than the highest court, so no legislative nature. As to how they're chosen or appointed? Maybe it's elections (the concept of democracy and republics having existed since Ancient Greece at the latest). Part of me wishes that it has something to do with Divination, but my thoughts on divination really belong in a different conversation.

** The books basically tell us nothing. We know: the Wizengamot is a thing and sometimes carries out judicial roles, there's probably a nobility (possibly ceremonial though), the minister's elected and... that's it.

Heres what I'd say would be good guesses: Wizengamot is a primarily legislative chamber (Harry's trial was a political stunt); judiciary are appointed by commission, Commonwealth law; department heads are appointed by the minister and voted on by the Wizengamot, US-style; and Britain, Scotland and Ireland are united.

Whether the nobility has real political power (if so there would need to be a second chamber), whether the Queen and muggle PM have any authority, and how much overlap there is with muggle law is entirely up to you.

** We're obviously going into massive headcanon here, so take from the following what you want.

There is one approach which takes the word "Ministry" and really thinks that aspect through, meaning the Minister is below the Prime Minister of the Queen's government, but is just voted for separately. In theory he has to report to the PM, which we know is not what happens. My headcanon, if I follow this idea, is that the Ministry is a rogue part of the government with too little control for too much power, making the Minister just short of being a dictator as he holds high positions in all three pillars of the government (executive, legilative, judiciary - and even in the "fourth pillar", the press). With this way of government, the closest name you could give it is oligarchy - much like modern day Russia.

However, I personally have a preferred way of building the wizard government, which is even more headcanon-y, probably even AU.

In this structure (given it is free of corruption and bribery), the Ministry is the legislative as well as bureaucratic branch of the government. The Minister is responsible for the everyday workings of the wizarding society as well as the design and proposal of laws. The position of Minister is the only democratic elected position in the government and holds one spot in the Wizengamot as the Guildmaster of the Bureaucracy. It follows no schedule but is handled more like the position of Doge in Venice, who after being voted for, ruled as long as his health allowed, or he resigned. The only other way of new elections to be held is if the Wizengamot declares the Minister no longer suitable for the position. The Head of Departments are often inherited positions from Head to Junior Head of the Department. The Minister can however decide to replace Heads at a whim. There are only a few exceptions, including the Director of the DMLE, the Director of the Department of Mysteries and the Head of the Department of Finance.

The Wizengamot in this design of the Government is derived from Elder councils. Clans, or in modern day, Families with the necessary prestige and power as well as "Guildmasters" ( of the Wandmakers, Potioneers, Enchanters,... The Minister and the Director of the DMLE fall into this category.) are called to Council to judge laws, crimes or honor. Its main tasks are the "Trial of laws" which is a simulation of a new law in a made up case. Should the law be sufficient, the Wizengamot gives the ok to the Ministry. The second task is the judgement of severe crimes (in full assembly) and the ruling over small crimes and conflicts with only a few members as representatives. The third task is a self control mechanism that "judges the honor" of a member. Should an Elder continuously fail to adhere to his duties and the rules of the Wizengamot, the assembly can declare them dishonored and cast them out of the Assembly. The Chief Warlock is the voice of the assembly. His words represent the combined opinion of the assembly outwards, as well as the books of law inwards. The Chief Warlock is voted for by the Assembly. In case of his absence, the Elder with seniority temporarily takes his place, followed by the leading Guildmaster (the Minister), followed by the Director of the DMLE. Members of the Wizengamot also form the Board of Govenors for Hogwarts which was installed only a few years after the Founder's Death to take some control from the Headmaster.

The last of the three pillars it the DMLE. The Aurors derive from a mercenary group that has once been hired by the Assembly of Elders (the Wizengamot) to protect the wizarding world from the muggles and dark wizards. Over the generations, the leader of the mercenaries became the Archmage Protector and eventually the Director of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. The DMLE is responsible for all kinds of law enforcement and defense, from the testing and approval of new brooms, to the suppression of rebel activities and open warfare. Three types of wizards and witches work for them. Commissioners for the civil cases of law enforcement, Aurors for the investigation of crime and Intelligence and Hit Wizards for active combat against dark wizards as well as military protection of citizens in extreme cases of threat. The Director spot is one of seniority and respect. Much like Archmage Protector back in the days, the role of Director is given to the most accomplished officer in the DMLE which is mostly an Auror. The Director may take orders from both the Chief Warlock and the Minister, but can decide to ignore them if sufficient explanation is given. It also becomes an almost independent position, even overruling the Minister in cases of warfare and/or extreme danger to national security (which in my head and this context explains why Fudge denied even the idea of Voldemort coming back, as he feared Bones and her politics).

I get this is very out there, but given how little we actually know about all this I figured you may want some input to give you some ideas.

** I think you can do whatever you want with it. I never felt there was any sort of logical system or plan to it. I think we can safely say it's not at all democratic and is vaguely medieval.
