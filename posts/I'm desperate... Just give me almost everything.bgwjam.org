** Well, it's not what I am reading right now, but I would recommend reading Linkffn(Princess of the Blacks), it's finished(and so is the series it is a part of), however it has some...triggers...and rather disturbing things in it so...be aware of that...seriously, it has some really f'd up stuff in it...it gets less disturbing(at least on some areas) and the disturbing stuff feels somewhat acceptable based on the setting and what is happening and the fact that even in the story it is clear that it is evil, but still.

On a happier note you have Linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus), which is a fanfic where fem!Harry is death, to be honest anything by "The Carnivorous Muffin" is in my opinion really good, although if you are not into psychological dilemmas he presents it might not be for you.

​

Linkffn(Escapologist Harry) is bloody glorious. It's not serious whatsoever, but it's just gold.

Linkffn(In the Mind of a Scientist) is interesting.

Linkffn(Almost a Squib) is also good.

Linkffn(Darkly Dreaming Harry) is dark, and not finished, but I liked it(not dark as in disturbing but more in a murdery sort of way).

Linkffn(Blindness) is also good.

​

I hope at least one of those is something you can enjoy.

  First in the Black Queen series. Sirius searches for his goddaughter and finds her in one of the least expected and worst possible locations and lifestyles. How was he to know just how many problems bringing her home would cause? DARK and NOT for children. fem!Harry

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  Harry Potter is not standing up in his crib when the Killing Curse strikes him, and the cursed scar has far more terrible consequences. But some souls will not be broken by horrible circumstance. Some people won't let the world drag them down. Strong men rise from such beginnings, and powerful gifts can be gained in terrible curses. (HP/HG, Scientist!Harry)

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

  Blood...it flowed through us all, until Voldemort began to twist it, taint it, harnessing it for his own purpose. The power of the species of the magical world--werewolves, vampires, metamorphmagi-was his for the taking. Harry would know, he'd taken his girlfriend's, & that would be his last mistake.
