I just updated The Last Pureblood Malfoy, for readers who enjoy trashy marriage law fics. Here's a little excerpt:

“So, when do I get to meet your friends?” Lexie asked.

Lucius looked at her.

“You are planning to introduce me to them, right? Come on, they already know you married a muggle. You don't have to tell them I was a stripper. I won't tell them how we met, don't worry. We'll need to get our story straight about how we met. In a pub, say.”

“Concocting such a story seems like a lot of effort to go to for an audience whose opinions don't matter.”

Lexie was pleasantly surprised. “You think we should tell them the truth, then, and not care what they think?”

“I don't see why I should tell them anything, or subject my beautiful new bride to the discomforts of prison in order to visit them.”

“Oh.” She reached for his hand to comfort him. “I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking. But wouldn't you like to visit your friends in prison? You must miss them.”

Lucius shrugged. “They're in for life. They're no longer useful to me.”

“Well, I'm sure they'd be glad to see you.”

“Probably not. My testimony put many of them there, and in many cases information I provided to the Aurors led to their arrests. I knew their secret hideouts, and had their keys and passwords, as they'd invited me to shelter with them if worse came to worse.”

“Oh.” Lexie thought. “Would you like to visit them to gloat?”

A smile slowly twisted Lucius's thin lips. “You're always so focused on my pleasure, Lexie.” He thought. “While that's tempting, the dementors of Azkaban would rob me of much of my enjoyment of such a visit, so there wouldn't be much point. But thank you for thinking of me.” He lifted her hand to his lips to kiss it, and Lexie felt a thrill shoot through her. She was done with bad boys. Lucius was a real bad man.

** I like it. Scratch that, I crave it. I am sure there are at least a couple request posts in my history about a wizard interacting heavily with a muggle. Definitely going to be following it for a while.

*** Thanks! I have a couple other stories from muggle POVs, but they're tragedies, and this one is, I don't know, a dark romcom? Anyway, if you like muggle POVs, you could also check out my stories Employee of the Month book 1, Hiraeth (the complete first book of a planned series) and Prisoner (should be updated soon, as the next chapter is in the hands of my beta.)

  Here's my contribution to the ridiculously contrived, trashy, marriage law genre. This one involves Lucius Malfoy and a muggle stripper, with snarky commentary by Percy Weasley. Rated M for some sex scenes.

*** Thanks! That's generally my goal in writing. If I'm going to use an overused trope like marriage law, I'm going to do so something weird with it.
