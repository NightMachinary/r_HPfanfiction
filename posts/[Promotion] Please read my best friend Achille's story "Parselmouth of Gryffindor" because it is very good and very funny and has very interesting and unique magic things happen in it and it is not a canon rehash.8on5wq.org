Yes please see the title! :) My best friend Achille is working on a very good story right now and it has 48 chapters and he updates like every day. :) His story has a super light and fun tone but also has very cool plot stuff and also magic usage in ways I did not ever think of before! :) Also his characters are very good, and my favorite is a character who only recently appeared in the story. :) :) :) :)

** Most HarryxHermione stories, or Harry+Hermione adopted siblings stories have Daniel and Emma as the doctors' first names. I'm now going mad trying to figure out the significance of Mrs Grangers name.

It's probably just a coincidence...but I've never seen a Daniel Granger that wasn't intentionally named after Daniel Radcliffe.

**** Unsure, but she's currently finding Ron a bit cute, and possibly has the beginnings of a crush, but she's too young and socially inept to understand and seems to completely ignore it. That's no guarantee that it won't end up HarryxHermione of course.

*** I think you're being a bit rude, dude. It's a good recommendation, and they can't really explain the plot without, you know, spoiling it. What do you expect, a professional review?

**** It doesn't explain anything. With recommendations, you should be convincing the reader /why/ they should read the story. While Alma did mention the tone, she didn't really mention anything else besides "magic usage in ways I've never seen before", which they might not have seen because they haven't read fics with it previously. "He updates daily" is not a good point to start off with, end with it.

**** it was sarcasm, I thought it was clear but it wasn't so I included the /s (which generally construes sarcasm)

Either way, I don't really like Hermione as a character so I don't often read fics where she's the main character.

***** Oh okay. I don't like Hermione either very much. But I don't read Achille's story for Hermione, but for the more interesting side characters! :) Thank you for adding the /s because yes plain text does not have inflections or intonations to indicate anything at all. :) That is very helpful.

  A tiny change in the Granger family tree means Hermione is now a Parselmouth when she starts Hogwarts. Changes pile up as foes are defeated, friends are made, secrets are uncovered, and loopholes are delightfully abused.
