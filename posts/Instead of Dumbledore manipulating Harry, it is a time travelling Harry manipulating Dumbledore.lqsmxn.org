Harry travels back in time just before Hogwarts and manipulates events to paint Dumbledore in as much bad light as possible in front of the the public while avoiding his schemes but making sure to do so as innocently as possible, drawing little to no attention to himself from the press and the public.

​

First year: Harry does not meet the Weasleys, doesn't get sorted into Gryffindor, does not become friends with Ron and Hermione, ignores the 3rd floor completely, ignores the troll (Hermione is badly injured but does not die, or maybe she does?). Dumbledore takes the flak. He takes the cloak and goes to the Mirror of Erised, waits until Dumbledore leaves (he has been there waiting for Harry) and then simply takes the stone out of the mirror as it has been in it all along and hides it in the Room of Requirement. Dumbledore goes crazy but can't find it and Nicolas Flamel is outraged at Dumbledore. Near the end of the year, Harry asks the twins to do a prank on Quirrell that involves taking his turban off in front of the whole school in the great hall. Thus Voldemort is revealed to the whole school and the public crucifies Dumbledore. Harry asks other students to talk to the prophet on how terrible this whole ordeal was.

Second year: He outright lies to Dobby and tells him that he won't go back to Hogwarts, but does so anyway. Then basically everything happen as they do in the books but Harry makes sure to avoid being near the scenes of the attacks and has a solid alibi every time. His parseltongue ability is not revealed as he doesn't even attend the duelling club. He feigns ignorance and dismisses any attempts of wanting anything to do with the Chamber, claiming it's a myth and that the teachers should deal with it, does not go into it and basically Dumbledore has to deal with it himself, at which point Ginny is long dead. Maybe Dumbledore doesn't deal with it and has someone else do it? Lot's of possibilities here. Once again, the public is outraged at Dumbledore. Harry also anynomously leaks how Hagrid has been framed for the chamber opening before, how Dumbledore knew about it, and how Myrtle died before and Dumbledore did nothing. He also wipes Lockhart's memories.

Third year: Basically the same. Harry avoids the dementor on the train, does not have Lupin teach him the patronus, captures Pettigrew without being seen, and Sirius goes free. At the end of the year, he burns down Privet Drive 4 (while none of the Dursleys are home) without using magic, to make it look like a muggle accident or arson. Dumbledore does not suspect him, and has no choice but to let Harry live with Sirius. Before Pettigrew can be imprisoned, Harry breaks him out, wipes his memories of it and puts him under the imperius, telling him to go find Voldemort.

Fourth year: Harry starts spreading a rumour around the school telling everyone to simply throw the piece of parchment with their names on it into the Goblet of Fire from outside Dumbledore's age line. Chaos ensues as everyone from all schools scramble to do so. Dumbledore is seen as incompetent as many underage wizards have put their names into the goblet. Cedric is not chosen as champion, though Harry is, alongside someone else (i leave this up to you. Maybe Ron or Draco?) who is not 17 yet. Once again, Dumbledore is blamed for Hogwarts having two champions who are also underage and both schools and the Ministry are outraged. The tasks go horribly wrong for the person as Harry does not help them. He also does not rescue Gabrielle and she dies and the press has a field day. At the end, Voldemort is resurrected, fights Harry and he escapes, but does not tell anyone about Voldemort, though Dumbledore suspects/knows anyway.

Fifth year: Harry has no encounters with the dementors and takes the Locket before Mundugus finds it. Umbridge comes to Hogwarts, things go as in the books but Harry pretends to join her, while secretly undermining her plans at the same time and deny that Voldemort is back. He does not teach DADA (instead it's Ron and the Gryffindors who try) nor does he tell anyone about his vision of Arthur and he dies, and Dumbledore is blamed once again, causing a break in the OoTP. He works with Umbridge to unveil the secret DADA group, and does not go to the Ministry. Sirius lives, Voldemort is angry, and storms the ministry himself. Many people die from both sides as Fudge is forced to reveal that Voldemort is back. Harry also has Sirius retrieve the cup from Gringotts and takes Umbridge to Grawp just to get rid of her.

Sixth year: Harry does not go to Slughorn, thus he doesn't come back. Dumbledore is reinstated as Headmaster and Snape still teaches potions while an order member teaches DADA (maybe Sirius?). Harry also refuses to go to Dumbledore's "lessons", feigning ignorance and telling him he does not care, creating tension between the two. He does go with him to the cave, but destroys the vanishing cabinet before, and the Death Eaters do not attack the school when they return. Eventually Dumbledore is lying in the hospital wing, dying from his curse and Harry reveals everything to him, how he manipulated the events of the past six years. He then shows Dumbledore the philosopher's stone and asks him if he wants to live. Dumbledore says he's made peace already and Harry smashes the stone before Dumbledore dies. After that, Harry hunts down and kills Voldemort.

*** He is just fed up with it all and wanted to have a normal childhood without all the BS. The people who have died, are not his responsibility and he should not be expected to save them.

If someone dies in Hogwarts, it is on Dumbledore.

If someone dies during the Tri Wizard tournament it is on the Ministry and the schools

If someone dies on a mission for the Order of the Phoenix, it is ultimately, on Dumbledore.

​

All of this would be just him proving a point and doing a big last "fuck you" to him, to show how careless he has been and what his toying led to.

** This Harry is a vengeful adult who has the mental capacity of a child. If he really wanted to bash dumbledore, all he had to do was let him take the fall for the chamber and then save Ginny. The Harry you've outlined is more concerned about being able to enable his “revenge” than save the life of an innocent child. He's just as bad as Voldemort.

** I mean, there's a coherent plot and a character with consistent motivation. Even the morality is consistently iffy and Harry's new personality is consistently self-serving. There's nothing wrong with it. It's not my thing, personally, but put Harry in Slytherin or Ravenclaw and slap in a romance with Daphne Greengrass or Fleur Delacour and thousands of people will adore it.

It seems to hit all the notes like bashing that people like. If you want a super popular fic and you can write half-decently, go for it.

(lmao this may come off a bit salty, but I am a bit salty.)

** This is probably the most fucked up version of Harry ever. And frankly Dumbledore in this would've been ousted from Hogwarts after the chamber of secrets. Harry could achieve the same result by just going back and exposing the fact that Dumbledore kept an uncontrollable werewolf in a school and anyone could get attacked by it should they figure out the Whomping Willow or god forbid have a run in with the Marauders when the let him out of the shack

** i can see this happening, with a harry that never got proper care or help after the war. maybe the media, the ministry, and the pressure of being a celebrity from his youth finally cracks him and he goes mad trying to find a way to get back at the man he considered the one responsible for it all, dumbledore.

as it stands this is definitely harry manipulating dumbledore, though one would assume its him manipulating dumbledore the way dumbledore had (or would have) manipulated him, when really its a kid who was forced to grow up too fast, who never had a solid foundation for mental health, and just wants it to stop hurting.
