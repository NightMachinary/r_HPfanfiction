I think it starts somewhere about 4-5th year ( maybe after Sirius dies ) and they fall in love.

She might have been old? Like... immortal maybe? And i'm pretty sure there is some type of time dilation while they're doing it.

I've been on a huge kick of Harry with good training, and I can't remember what this one was called!

Any help is supremely appreciated.


** Linkffn(Blood of the Phoenix) is what you're looking for.

**** I remember a vampire who lived all summer with Harry. She regularly drunk his blood, making his body produce more magic and regain it faster. She also become a teacher at hogwarts. Harry somehow gained super senses and snape tortured him with sonarus charm shouting right behind his ear. That is all I remember of that fic. If Im remembering right, there were vampire lords and etc.
