I can't for the life of me find it in my favorites, and I've tried searching old threads here (because I know I first saw it here). Harry-- after living his own life-- has been reincarnating/being born as people starting at the beginning of history. In this story he recognizes that he's been born as the eldest child of Sirius's parents and (of course) changes the future. Can anyone please help me find it?

(Also-- I hope I was able to properly do a flair!)

  Harry had never been able to comprehend a sibling relationship before, but he always thought he'd be great at it. Until, as Master of Death, he's reborn one Turais Rigel Black, older brother to Sirius and Regulus. (Rebirth/time travel and Master of Death Harry)
