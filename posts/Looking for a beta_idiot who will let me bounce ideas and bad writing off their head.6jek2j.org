Not sure if this is an acceptable place to put this but, oh well. I am looking for someone who will put up with me bouncing ideas and the occasional badly written chapter off them for a Warhammer 40k/HP crossover that I am currently beginning to write (and will in ll likely hood never finish or even write more than 5 chapters for).

If anyone here is feeling particularly dimwitted while reading this and feels inclined to offer their services, please say so.

Basic principles of the story: 1) The Imperium finds Earth and decides that it wants it. 2) The Imperium takes Earth. 3) Magic users are more or less dug out of their little hiding holes and turned into useful servants of the Imperium. The majority of them are not fully fledged Psykers and are known as Quasi-Psykers. 4) Sometime after the invasion, Harry is born as a fully fledged Psyker.

I have a basic outline of where I am planning to go from here and I have about 1000 words of grox dung written.


** I feel up to it. Sounds like an interesting idea. How would you contact me? Email? Discord? Let me know

** I'm not going to help but I felt the need to inform you that I am indeed very much dimwitted.
