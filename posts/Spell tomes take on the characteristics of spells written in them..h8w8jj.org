Transfiguration texts transfigure themselves into different colored and shaped books every five minutes.

Most Potente Potions drips down random potions from its cover and pages.

Herbology books sprout leaves and flowers in the spring.

Books on Dark Magic can kill you if you touch or read them, or do worse things than death in cases like Secrets of The Darkest Arts.

Words in books on Occlumency are blurred and unreadable until you perform leglimency on them.


** Well I mean some books yes. But how would a potions book produce potions without the Ingredients and all the whole brewing process. And if you had a book about say the blood replenishing potion you wouldn't ever need to brew potions. Dark arts books seemed to have curses alot. Sonnets for sorcerers and all that. Over all it seems like it would cause more problems than it would be worth.

*** Maybe potions produced by the books are like leprechaun gold and vanish in 24 hours. Or they dont produce potions at all and instead ink used to write in them becomes a potion?

And about this doing more harm than good, that is the point.

**** What I meant by more harm than good is no one would write any books... At all. No one will buy a book that will potentially kill them when some one can just tell em to swish and flick.

***** That would only apply to Dark Arts books i think. I mean, there is plenty of Books in the cannon that are already like this what with Invisible book of Invisibility, Monster book of Monsters, Sonets of the Sorcerer and all that.

****** Would you want a book that levitated you? Or spontaneously burst into flame? Or flipped you upside-down? Or vanished any number of things? Imagine a 7th year student is walking along. Bursts into flame, clothes dissapear, gets levatated, then vanished over a railing, falls down the stairs well, winds up with jelly legs and then winds up being poisoned. All by the book in their bag?

******* i imagine books effects are mostly confined to the book. Book burst into flames rather than the student, sections of book disapear and reapear on random rather than enviroment, book levitates itself like a helium baloon etc... I imagine jelly legs only happen if book touches your leg and you would only get poisoned from a papercut or some such thing.

Furthermore, books might have a personality and only effect those they theem "unworthy" in bad ways. On contrast those they theem "worthy" might get "blessed" by the book. For example, if your book loves you, it will open the pages with the information you need, or might reveal secret knowledge about the subject to you that is unknown even to the books writer such as spells and potion recipes not yet invented, or knowledge about certain herbs and animals not yet disvovered.

** I'd say maybe for the most advanced and complex books of them all. Or perhaps the effect is proportional to how much knowledge the book contains? So "A beginner's guide to Tranafiguration" may have a slightly iridescent cover, while "Animagus Animato" has a cover that smoothly flows between skin, scales, fur, feathers and more.
