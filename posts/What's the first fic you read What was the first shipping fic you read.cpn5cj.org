** First story I ever read was HPMoR. First shipping story I ever read was Harry Crow. While I'm not ashamed that those two were my introduction to fanfiction, my tastes have changed a bit over the years.

*** Those were my first two also! I remember reading HPMoR and thinking oh, hmm, maybe fanfics can be interesting. It was still being written when I started getting into fiction and Harry Crow was kind of satisfying in a way. I hadn't read enough fan fiction for anything to be a trope, so I thought it was a fun ride.

** The first fic(s) I read was the Greengecko trilogy.

The first shipping fic was some terribly clichÃ© Harmony story. I read a bunch of those at the start and they all got progressively worse, but the last was definitely In This World and the Next by Robst and I've hated Harmony/Hermione ever since ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

** First fic I read was also the first pairing I've known, besides canon. And boy, what a shit fic that was. I think the names was Angry Harry and the Seven, it was a really shitty Lord Potter/Jesus/Gandhi with Goblin lovers, "Dumbles", full of bashing, Harry/Daphne, marriage contract, shit OP Harry, "snarky" Harry.

It was the most awful first experience, because not only of what I said before(which at the time, I had no idea it was bad) but the fic itself was full of errors and typos, wrong names, the pacing was horrible, the character dev was abysmal, and yet I read over 400k words before giving up. And to be honest, the only reason I kept reading fanfics was because this god-shitting-abhoring piece of "art" made me fall in love with Daphne. So I started reading Harry/Daphne fics.

** Coming straight off canon I liked the canon pairings, just because I wanted something that was canon-compliant. So I read a couple time travel ones, first the ones by Vance McGill which I really don't think I'd read anymore, then I read the sadly incomplete Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past. I miss the days when that was the most favourited fic on FFN rather than MoR and a Dramione fic.

Now I don't like Harry/Ginny at all, I just don't feel like it works well. Same thing with Harry/Hermione. My favourite is Harry/Luna because Luna's a really interesting character.

** The first HP fanfic I ever read (also the first ship fic I ever read) was a Snape/Hermione fic that I accidentally stumbled on somehow and read out of curiosity to see how anyone could want them to be together. It didn't convert me (I dislike Snape too much to ship him with anyone), but soon after that, I discovered Wolfstar, and I've been reading fanfiction regularly ever since.

** Oh boy, my first fic I read was something from Charmed back in like the 2004ish range, hung around there and LOTR for a bit

Took a 10+ year long break, I think I read some Harmony at some point in there

Recently got back into HP ffn the last two years - started with a Dramione (Isolation) - now I can't read Dramione or Harmony at all

I still read Draco centric fics, but usually with an Astoria pairing - I've been moving away from that and started on some Ginny centric fics (The Changeling, Not From Others) that I'm finding I enjoy more

I think over time I've shifted away from reading Hermione pairings (I identify with her more and perhaps viewed it as wish fulfillment) and instead toward characters like Ginny or Luna who I /want/ to identify with more, if that makes sense?

** I cannot for the life of me recall the title of my first fanfic. I do, however, remember Harry, captured by Death Eaters, and being marched along, a distended eye hanging loose on his chest.

I ran a mile!

First shipping fic... Some Harry/Bellatrix thing. I remember enjoying it. Harry was locked in Azkaban, and ended up escaping with her. It ended around Bellatrix learning she was pregnant.

These days, on the twisted side I like Harry/Greyback. On the nicer side, I prefer Harry/Luna. Or Harry/Theo, but with no actual smut at all.
