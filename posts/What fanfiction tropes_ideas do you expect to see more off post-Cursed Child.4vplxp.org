Time Travel is a given and I think Delphi will be the go to girlfriend for Dark!Harry now. Could see some interesting takes on Cedric now...


** I really want to write a fic just taking the best of HPCC: Scorpius and Albus and get rid of the time travel shit and do something with Delphi. I liked her, but not her parentage. If I run aith the story she's be an orphan, yea, with no idea of her parents but has this strange illusion that Bellamort are her parents.

*** Hear me out, but what if she was the illegitimate child of Draco and Some off screen female character or even a first wife. (I solemnly swear I am 200% Stone Cold Sober.)

**** Maybe not offscreen female OC, but what about... Draco/Bellatrix? Seems icky and taboo enough to do some crazy shit to someone's head.

** I doubt much will change, honestly. Most of the people who read the script don't like it, including myself and there are some things which will definitely stay almost unused. For example, does anyone actually like Delphi? I have yet to see a single comment by someone saying they like Delphi. Cos there's nothing to like and plenty to hate.

I do hope this inspires some great parodies though.

** Bellatrix and Voldemort banging, or Voldemort with a sex drive, will be more common since it's technically canon now.

*** There's every chance people will interpret it as him wanting an heir/wanted to make a horcrux out of his kid/needed to sacrifice his child for some ritual/etc. That's how I thought of it since I have a fairly detailed headcanon that Voldemort is asexual.

** My guess? A whole lot more stories with the next Gen kids. This story love it or hate it (mostly hate it) is the first to really show off any personality traits for the kiddos.\\
Also im guessing this big time travel thing will lead to a whole bunch of Voldemort won AUs that get abandoned 5 chapters in [[/spoiler][considering it happened in the story when they time turned after the second task]] I see a lot of fanfic writers doing it too.
