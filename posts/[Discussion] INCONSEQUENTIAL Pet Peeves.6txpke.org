I know some people are going to make fun of "the weekly Pet Peeves thread" for this, but something I've noticed going over the old ones is that they're all titled something like "what will make you abandon a fic". What I want you to talk about now is the smaller pet peeves that /don't/ make you hate the author or stop reading the story, just groan inwardly before carrying on.

As a starting point, here are two of mines:

- I cringe whenever a story includes something about the cost of going to Hogwarts. /Hogwarts is not a paying school/. I can't get mad at authors for this (personally I'm French and schools are free here, but I can understand why people from England or elsewhere might make the assumption), but /damn/ it annoys me.

- Bellatrix LeStrange. NO! It's not barbaric pseudo-French "Le Strange", it's a play on the old French equivalent for 'the strange one', namely "L'Estrange". Spelling that way makes /no sense/. Not to mention I don't know of any real family that spells its name like a wiki word, rather than using either a blank space or a hyphen. But, and here's the thing... even though this is a really stupid mistake to make, it keeps popping up in otherwise rather good fics.


** I hate when the author randomly changes a completely inconsequential fact in an otherwise canon-compliant fic. Like I've seen a lot of stories (typically set post battle) where Ginny is mentioned as dating a lot of boys in school. The point is made but has no bearing on anything and the author isn't trying to portray Ginny in a poor light, but it's just there. What's the point?

**** It showed lots of boys thought she was pretty, but in canon she only dated two before Harry. I'm fine if the author makes the change for a specific purpose, but my specific gripe is when they do it for no reason. It's like other fics that make Harry a professional quidditch star but a chaser, not seeker as in canon. The change makes no difference to the plot, it just grinds my gears a bit.

*** Using an incantation (any incantation) for Apparation is indeed really bloody stupid. It's not even really a "spell" as such. On the othe rhand... I can easily excuse "/Fiendfyre/" being its own incantation. /That/ one is clearly a powerful Dark spell that would presumably have an incantation, and perhaps it is best for an author without much imagination to use the spell-name as incantation rather than make up some unconvincing /Canis Latinicus/.

***** Specific to the Riddle-Morfin murder situation, I reasoned out that Dumbledore's explanation of the process was incorrect, even based on his assumptions!

Thankfully the simpler solution is that Riddle used the Imperius/Possession on Morfin and had him do the actual killing of the Riddles. Much easier for Morfin to remember actually killing them with his own wand instead of making up a fake memory of it, and with Tom casting the Imperius in the Gaunt's shack, his spells would be ignored.

****** They did use an age-line for example in GoF.

Also, we do not know if the trace is something put actively on a child or if it just is a big map that shows magic near minors (similar to the map in the FB movie).

Really, there is one single thing that makes trace consistent: Somehow, the ministry can tell if magic is done near a minor. It can tell which spells are cast and the location. It cannot tell which wizard triggered the trace.

That makes the story consistent: How TMR could murder Riddle Sr., how Dobby triggered the trace, how the ministry detected the patronus in OOtP and how they knew what happened in PoA.

The reason for the trace and the RDoUS is also obvious: An untrained wizard is unlikely to be able to fix damage he might do and probably is less responsible overall.

The trace doesn't open more plot-holes than time-turners, it's actually semi-consistent to some other concepts.

***** I'm on board with you, but a lot of people want their fanfiction to read like an additional book that Rowling could conceivably have written ("more of the same" to curb their disappointment that there's not more of canon). Moreover, a lot of such departures seem to be more the authors /misunderstanding/ the canon facts rather than purposefully changing them, or at least that was the case in older stories. Magical cores are an interesting idea, and some stories like linkffn(Core Threads) make their existence and their behavior part of their premise, but you'll find people who seem convinced that cores exist in the /canon books/'s continuity, and it annoys most people on this sub to no end.

** It's not really something that will /always/ make me abandon a story, but if it's bad enough I'll have to stop. For me, the issue is misspelling stuff like names, places, incantations, etc.

/THERE'S A WIKI FOR A FUCKING REASON./

People who misspell stuff that's ported over from canon have either done so for artistic reasons - like in stories such as /To Reach Without/, where the author's interest in language leads to the inclusion of symbols and accents and stuff in words (which I don't mind because it's obviously intended and kinda cool to read) - or because they aren't paying attention to detail, and the latter just makes me sigh sadly when I see it. With the wealth of resources available to ensure proper spelling of canon components, it's disappointing that people who identify as fans of HP can't even do simple stuff like spell /Dolores Umbridge./

** When authors mention Hogwart's cost they probably mention the furniture's cost (robes, books, etc...)

*** No they don't. I recall quite a few stories that explicitly talked about tuiton fees. Some people even thought this was a /plothole/ --- "How are the Weasleys paying for the presumably-expensive Hogwarts tuition?" --- before Rowling had to state officially that Hogwarts was free and supported by the Ministry.

**** I prefer the idea that Hogwarts has tuition so that Harry can go on a tirade about how he "pays a shit-ton of gold to attend the 'most prestigious school in Europe'" and he won't tolerate shit teachers like Binns, Snape, and, later, Trelawney.

***** But that just opens a can of flobberworms. If that's so, and it's specifically expensive... how are the Weasleys paying, again? What did all the poor kids do? Surely Tobias Snape had no money aside that he'd yield to give for Snape's education. Plus, where would all that gold be /going/ in the first place? Not in paying the House-Elves, obviously, and they grow the food themselves, not to mention the Professors can conjure, Transfigure or magically repair any non-edible equipment they need. The only place this money could go would be into paying the teachers and assorted human staff. But there aren't that many teachers, said teachers don't look /that/ wealthy for the most part (could Snape not have traded Spinner's End for something a little larger and comfier, if he'd had the large salary this would imply), and the idea of Filch or Hagrid having a high-paying job is laughable. What else? Taxes? Doesn't square too well with Hogwarts calling itself independant from the Ministry to the point that the Ministry had very little pressure to express on them.
