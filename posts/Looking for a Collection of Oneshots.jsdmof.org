A long time ago i had read a very well written oneshot collection but i cant find it. One of the oneshots explored what might have happened had Hermione acompanied Harry to face Voldemort. It ended with Hermione getting possesed much like Quirell and killing Dumbledore and Harry before sacrificing her life to ressurect Voldemort. They did not realise she was possesed because of her bushy hair hiding voldemorts face that have grown on the back of her head.
