** Very clever idea, though unless it's one of'em Magical Cores AUs, the idea that the Malfoys could possibly ascertain the magical power of a girl while she's just a toddler is ludicrous. The rest of which, though... excellent idea. The idea of Dumbledore as the leader of a "Light" faction opposite to the "Dark" on the one hand, and the "amoral Dumbledore" idea on the other hand, /do/ combine /perfectly/ into the story of two warring Dark Lords...

*** Not really a magical core as such, I guess I could have left it at bright muggleborn with an early bout of accidental magic, needn't have mentioned powerful/strong.

And I don't even see it as dark or light, just two power hungry and powerful self acclaimed lords of magic, both very charming. Voldemort is not snake faced here, just found out about creating a horcrux, has not been killed and never been without a body. And Dumbledore is of course the master manipulator, and the next door grandfather rolled into one.

**** Yes, yes, I understand. But the idea of Dumbledore and Voldemort as the Ã¼ber-powerful leaders of two openly opposed faction (as opposed to Dumbledore just happening to lead the small-scale resistance effort in Voldemort's war on literally everyone else) is, I believe, derived from the fanon idea of Dumbledore as the leader of a Light Side opposite Voldemort's Dark faction --- except with the /Star Wars/-esque good/evil manicheism thrown out.

  The Battle of Nurmengard ended in a stalemate. Half a century later, Harry Potter feels adrift in a world teeming with millions of fantastic folk. Armed with a talking wand, he forays single-minded into the noble art and sport of Duelling, until one book leads him on the path to discovering his ill-fated parents' efforts to conceal a most dangerous magical secret.

*** Yeah, but it's sort of the opposite of the small magical population.
