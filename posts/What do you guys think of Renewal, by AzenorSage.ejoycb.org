** I think it is rather good. It is one of few Harry Potter fanfics that I am actively looking forward to being updated. It has a lot of fascinating concepts when it comes to worldbuilding whichi s always a plus in my book. Some of the changes made just feels of to me though. Like putting Laura Madley and Mafalda Prewett in the class of 1991. To me that sends the signal of "I am too lazy to make up names for characters" because they are more or less OCs anyway because of the fact that more or less nothing is known about them in canon.

So yeah, defenitly worth a read this far even if some questionable decisions are made from time to time.
