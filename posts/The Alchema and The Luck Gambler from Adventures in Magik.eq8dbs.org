I'm not looking for a fanfic, per say, but rather a story mentioned in a fanfic. In Adventures in Magick by Pseudonymous_Entity, they talk alot about some "muggle" story with characters called the Luck Gambler, Demon lord of Knowledge, and Alchema. For the life of me, I can't figure out what book this is (or if it's entirely made up) and the author of the fic isn't saying. Does anyone know?
