Hello,

I'm very new (about a week old) to Reddit, but I love the concept. I've been a HP fanfic reader for years and have written on/off for awhile. I am recently working on a new story and would love some proper, intellectual feedback (if you have time/interest).

Title: Days Like This. Rating: Explicit/Mature/Adult. Summary: ... but what was she doing in the Headmaster's bed? Notes: I assume no responsibility for any minors who may read this fic. This work is for adults. The primary pairing is Hermione Granger/Severus Snape, but expect many other pairings, cameos, et. al.

Thank you and enjoy!


** The 'cliffhanger' is well done, it feels planned and piqued my interest without being cliched or annoying.

It reads very much like a romance novel, what with the extended descriptions of clothing and physical appearance. The mentions of magic are hit and miss; I liked the use of the cushioning charm but the mention of magical signatures didn't seem well thought-out.

My suggestion would be to proof read it for typos: "plains of his body", "PAndy" for Pansy.

*** Hi -

Thank you for reading and the constructive feedback. I'll definitely give this a review and interpret into editing the first chapter.

Thanks again!

** Hm, in the beginning it was kind of confusing and everyone was acting really out of character to the point where I felt like dropping the fic. I don't like fics where Draco, Snape and all the slytherin are all of a sudden good friends with the main trio for seemingly no reason. Snape, Pansy, Draco act nothing like their canon selves and even if they were friends with Hermione I feel like there would have been some tension present. If it's an AU which it seems like it is, maybe make it more clear that it's not canon world we are following. The descriptions are often overly flowery and the party conversations and descriptions are kind of boring. The sexual undertone of random paragraphs such as the one with the Danish and Snapes dialogue seems out of place and turns me off the fic.

This is my personal preference towards these kind of fics, but I don't like when Hermione starts all of a sudden noticing and describing how hot Snape is. It's out of character, it's ridiculous considering it's Snape we are talking about here. If they get together, I prefer relationships and friendships based on something other than how physical attractive the other person is and for things to develop gradually.

Loved the twist at the end though, definitely makes me want to read more to find out what happens.

*** Hi Dehue!

Thanks for the feedback. I will promise to explain the beginning more thoroughly in the future. Although, I'm likely going to go back and do some editing so others who dislike this sort aren't turned off.

Glad you liked the cliffhanger.

Thanks again!

** TBH I probably wouldn't have read past the first paragraph if I had found this on my own. If I were you I'd dump the first three paragraphs and start with "Wallowing, Granger?" (You missed the punctuation on this, I think.) To me it seems like it started flowing for a bit at that point and then stutters a little during Pansy and Draco's interaction.

I think you'd do better with a beta... Like this interaction:

#+begin_quote
  The corner of PAndy's lips quirked and she tossed the dark hair over her shoulder. “I believe I do,” She raised a finger and pointed it in the direction of her prey. Hermione snickered unkindly and Draco huffed loudly.
#+end_quote

To...

Pansy's lip quirked and she tossed her dark hair. “I believe I do,” She raised a finger and pointed it towards her prey. Hermione snickered unkindly as Draco huffed.
