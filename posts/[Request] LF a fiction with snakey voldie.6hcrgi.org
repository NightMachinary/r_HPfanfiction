I've seen a lot of fic with his cannon old man flour disaster appearance, but I've been hankering for some actually serpentine! snakey voldies. Scales, split tongue, eyes, heat pits, anything snakey at all. Anyone with some reqs? Can be pairing or general. Bonus points for hemip. :P (I already know about Visitor(s?) on ff net)
