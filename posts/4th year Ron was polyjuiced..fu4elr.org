So I just read a Percy Jackson/HP crossover. The story wasn't all that great, but I don't want to bash it too much since I got the sense that the author was very young. One thing that surprised me since the story wasn't that good in general was the plot twist it ended with. There was some Ron bashing going on, and at the end of the 4th year it turned out that it was Ron who had been kidnapped and replaced by Barty instead of Moody. This is the first time I've seen this happen and I honestly love it. Would have been a great twist in the real books. With the falling out between Ron and his friend turning out to be because Barty was afraid Harry and Hermione would notice him acting differently. But with Ron still feeding Harry information like the Dragons. And him acting differently after making up being explained away by the awkwardness of having been in a fight for a couple of months.

This would make more sense than Ron suddenly not believing Harry anymore after 3 years of shit happening to Harry. It would take away the storyline of Ron learning to deal with being in Harry's shadow, but it would open new doors for Ron's charachter with him being locked in a suitcase for a year and all. Like him being paranoid or claustrophobic. Giving him a new drive to get stronger so something like that can't happen again, which could have been a gateway into Dumbledore's Army. He could be overprotective of his family/friends with a year of him wondering what fake Ron was up. Being alone in a suitcase for months could have his mind stray anywhere.

Has anyone ever come across something like this?


** This is actually a really good twist. It would be interesting to read for sure.

** Not bad idea, but you get to the same problem as with the canonical HPCoS: how come that four Ginny's brothers haven't noticed that she was possessed while living next to her for whole year? How come Harry & Hermione (at least, even ignoring other Weasley siblings) didn't recognize that there is something fundamentally wrong with Ron, that he doesn't remember some things he really should?

***** You got me there. I could think of way to make other plotholes work, but thinking of a reason for this one would be a stretch. It would be the same kind of plothole as the twins not noticing Peter sleeping with Ron.

***** Since Wormtail definitely knew about the map and they were working together, yes.

Accidental Animagus iirc actually had a viable solution to that. Barty legally changed his name to match the person he was impersonating using muggle bureacracy.

Or just have him impersonate his dad since they have the same name.

and I imagine they figured it was due to it being her first year at school and not fitting in

and every time they reached out to her she blew them off

**** This is so true! Especially being the youngest and having teachers and peers knowing her brothers. Her brothers probably let her blow them off because they thought she was trying to forge her own path. Thwy most likely wanted to give her space to adjust to Hogwarts.

Orrrr maybe they just thought she was acting weird because of puberty ðŸ˜‚

**** also, with the exception of Ron and to a lesser extent Fred and George, they'd all spent the better part of her life away at school. How much is summer, really? Add that they all ahve their own interests and summer homework and that younger siblings are Universally nuisances.\\
If anyone, It would've been Ron since up until last year, they'd both been at home. But between different dorms, schedules, and whatever Harry was caught up in at the moment it can be easy to overlook.

*** linkffn(Courage and Cunning)

It's unfinished and quite possibly dead, and I seem to recall the plot being kind of eye-rolling at times, but it does feature what you're asking for.

#+begin_quote
  Salazar Slytherin has had enough of Dumbledore and Voldemort's stupidity, so on October 31, 1981 he decides to put a stop to the wizarding war. Things do not go according to plan. He loses his memories, but 10 years later he regains them when he gets a familiar letter. Bashing of some characters at first, but it gets better. A twist to the Harry is Salazar genre. More inside...

** I had always thought that fourth year Ron was quite out of character for not believing Harry.

Not sure how this twist would work, but I'd like for some fic that explains this OOC behaviour on some outside factors and not the so called "jealous streak".

** I always thought Ron DID believe Harry didn't put his own name in the goblet. The thing is A) Ron was a 14 year old boy who didn't always express his feelings clearly and B) believing Harry actually made the true source of his resentment worse. Once AGAIN Harry has had something Ron desperately wants handed to him on a platter. Harry (in Ron's view) doesn't appreciate the opportunity to go after all the things Ron wants for himself (recognition, escape from poverty when Harry already has a vault full of gold). That's what burns him up. A lack of trust in Harry was never the real problem.
