:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm trying to help a reddit-averse friend find an fanfic they read a while back. Premise is that Harry joined Hermione and her family during a break (possibly Winter break). Hermione and her mother manage to remove Harry's scarcrux via runes and they also visit Hermione's grandfather out in the countryside. Apparently there was a detailed amount on Horses and my friend remembers a scene with Harry and Hermione lying down in a clearing in the forest.


** The acrcrux removal Sounds like Derlacroix rocking the boat.

  Harry is left with the Dursleys just after his godfather had died. One thing leads to the other and Harry is fed up with being a puppet. He breaks free and finds help. And boy, does he start rocking the boat.
