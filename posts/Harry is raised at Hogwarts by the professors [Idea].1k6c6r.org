Hello,

I don't know if this is the right way to go about this, since I've never been here before. While reading HPMOR, I was struck by how important Harry's childhood environment was. It raised the question to me, where else could he be raised? Obvious answers were by Lupin, Sirius... And then I started thinking, what about Dumbledore or McGonagal?

This led me to an interesting question: what if Harry was raised at Hogwarts? I mean, I know it's unprecedented in the canon, but I can see how Dumbledore could make a persuasive argument for it; he's literally holding the key to defeating Voldemort, and Hogwarts is the next safest place after the Dursley's.

I feel like there's a lot of interesting dynamics that could happen here. What kind of relationship would have with the professors? With Snape? What sort of exciting stories would you get by literally living your entire life in a magic castle? Who would he meet earlier by growing up with classes going on?

I have no clue if this idea is novel (my attempts at googling and checking the wiki were fruitless, but that doesn't really mean anything). Does anyone know prior art on this? Obviously, I'm posting this publicly, so if anyone is interested in exploring it further, I encourage you to do so.

*TL;DR: What if Harry was raised at Hogwarts?*


** Not exactly what you are looking for, but a good fic, nonetheless.

Summary:/Professor McGonagall has watched the Dursleys all day and can see what sort of people they are. When Dumbledore leaves Harry on their doorstep and disappears, she takes him away./

** About the only one I remember of even middling quality is Blueowl's, where he uses this premise in the time travel story [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4801140/2/Mysterious-Thing-Time][Mysterious Thing, Time]]. The premise is that Harry and Dumbledore go back in time to the night of Voldemort's first fall. Harry finds his consciousness in the body of his infant self. Going by the name Harry Dumbledore, Harry is raised at Hogwarts.

#+begin_quote
  The future is lost, so to save it, both Harry and Dumbledore go back the moment it all began - that Halloween night. Of course, things do not go exactly as they had expected. Unspeakables, Wild Magic, Time Travel, Vampires, Bonds, Goblins.

** There's a boatload of Snape-adopts-Harry-and-raises-him fics, many of which take place at Hogwarts. I used to read fics on potionsandsnitches a lot, though the quality of the stories there has declined rapidly recently (or maybe my tastes have just evolved?) but you can start looking there if you're interested.

** So I realize this is really late but, have you ever read [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1963825/1/Mine][Mine]] by Gillian Middleton? Her sequel to it, [[http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1969019/1/Snape-s-Vocation][Snape's Vocation]] addresses the question.
