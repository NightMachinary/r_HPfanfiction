  Harry is a prisoner, and Bellatrix has fallen from grace. The accidental activation of Bella's treasured heirloom results in another chance for Harry. It also gives him the opportunity to make the acquaintance of the young and enigmatic Bellatrix Black as they change the course of history.

** Hermione being Minister of Magic never really made sense to me. Not because I thought she wasn't capable, but because it's not how she would achieve her goals.

Ministers of Magic seem to have 5-10 years in the spotlight, then they generally move on. If anything I'd expect her to be the anti-Umbridge, a decades long career of turning the ministry machinery to good ends and enacting legislation to end discrimination against house elves, werewolves, centaurs, and other magical beings. In the end there'd be fewer headlines with her name in them, but many more laws from her quill.

  Tom Riddle was able to use magic long before he received a wand. In this AU, Harry has the same grasp on his magic...and a hatred for Muggles... Watch the birth of evil. Smart!Dark!Evil!Harry, All 7 Years
