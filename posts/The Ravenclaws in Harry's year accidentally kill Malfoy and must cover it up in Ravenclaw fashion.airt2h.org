****** Pottermore: Introduction for Ravenclaws, so I suppose it depends on whether you concider that as canon or not? I mean, I can see why a lot of people refuse to.

It does give Luna more of a traditional aspect-of-Ravenclaw flavour, so I accepted it but I'm not going to argue if you say no.

******* Eh, I'm ambivalent on Pottermore. I didn't have a problem with the Remus Backstory and the Minerva Backstory. I also liked the story of the Squib and the Sorting Hat.

Luna's my favorite character, so I could get behind a "more traditional aspect" especially if many of her Housemates have forgotten what they are. We don't get a great glimpse of Ravenclaw in canon--after Luna and Flitwick, the most prominent named Ravenclaws are probably Cho and Marietta.

** Eh, what the heck? I'll give it a try.

--------------

The Quidditch Pitch at Hogwarts was normally a place of exhilaration and exhibition of sports. Save for the tragic events of the Triwizard Tournament, it was not normally a place of death. Unfortunately for one Draco Malfoy and one Anthony Goldstein, they were about to learn just how deadly it could be.

"What the bloody hell happened Ant?"

Anthony Goldstein clutched his temples, tearing at his hair.

"I swear to Merlin, it was an accident. I didn't mean for this to happen!"

"Didn't mean for this to happen?"

Terry Boot looked flabbergasted. "How is Draco Malfoy dead and how is that an accident?"

"I challenged him to a competition of advanced flying maneuvers...." Anthony began wringing his hands. "And then he crashed and he didn't get up...."

"I...am...not...dead...Idiot....Ravenclaws."

"He's alive?!"

"Not for long," Terry shook his head. "The way I figure, he's pierced both lungs and collapsed his stomach, punctured his liver, ruptured his appendix...It's a matter of minutes, I'm afraid."

"Idiot mudblood, what do you know?"

"You know...as scared as I am for you Anthony, I'm not actually sorry this is happening."

What little color remained in Anthony's face drained, leaving him as ashen-faced as the Grey Lady. "How can you say such a thing?"

"You've been to the meetings...you know what Harry said to /The Quibbler./"

"My father...is a...great man!"

"Pity he didn't break his jaw in the crash. Where's his broomstick anyway?"

"You see all those little twigs sticking out of his broken bones?"

"Oh...ow..."

"What are we going to do, Terry?" Anthony looked close to tears. "We have to go to the Hospital Wing!"

"And what do you think will happen to Pomphrey if Malfoy dies in the Wing? Umbridge will have her sacked, if not arrested! And then what will happen to anyone else who gets hurt or sick?"

"Well....I...."

"We're Ravenclaws, brother. We will think of something."

"Filthy....Ravenclaws...."

"Shut up, Malfoy!"

"Malfoy?"

"Malfoy?!"

"Draco?!"

"He's really gone!" Anthony wailed. "Oh, what are we going to do?"

"We need to get rid of the body! I wish Michael were here, he's good at this sort of thing!"

At that moment, Michael Corner and Ginny Weasley walked onto the pitch, each carrying a broom.

"Three times around the pitch," Ginny grinned wiggling her eyebrows in a way that she thought was flirtatious but looked more goofy than anything else. "If I win...you have to let me see the Ravenclaw Common Room"

"And if I win?"

"You won't but if you do...you can...what the bloody hell?"

"Did you know your nose wrinkles when you swear? It's cute."

"Michael! Look!"

"What the bloody hell?"

"Oh shit."

"It was an accident!"

"You killed Draco Malfoy!"

"I didn't! Anthony did!"

"He crashed his broom...Sorry?"

"Don't be sorry, Malfoy's father is a Death Eater and he wants to join--wait a broom crash? We need to tell McGonagall!"

"No we don't!"

"Michael, don't be ridiculous!"

There was a flash of blue light that hit Ginny in the face. Her legs snapped together and she fell over.

"/Locomotor Mortis?/" Ginny's face turned red as she pulled out her own wand. "/Finite Incan--/"

"/Expelliarimus!/"

Anthony hadn't even realized he had cast the Disarming Charm. Ginny's wand flew from her hand and her face grew redder in outrage.

"Does anyone else know?"

"Michael, please. You have to help us."

"Right, right, right. Okay...I'm thinking...I'm thinking...we need to hide the body, but we need to do it in a way that will not incriminate anyone innocent."

"Right. How do we hide the body?"

"We can transfigure it. It's simple enough."

"You don't learn human transfiguration until your sixth year!" Ginny snapped. "Undo the jinx, or I'll scream!"

"If Granger can do a Portean Charm," Terry reasoned, "I wager we can take care of Malfoy's body if we work together."

"So, then--shall we do a ferret? Like what Moody did?"

"That wasn't Moody!"

"We're going to have to do something about her to, you realize."

"I take you all on as soon as I get my legs free!"

There was a flash of white from three wands and then Draco Malfoy's body was gone and a small white ferret was in its place.

"We could just feed it to one of the Thestrals."

"They could trace that back to Hagrid, no good."

"We'll turn it into a little statue then."

Three wands glowed gold and the ferret's body had turned to stone. No glimpse of Draco Malfoy's sneer could be seen.

"Right then, we have ourselves a statue. We can place it in our dormitory, and then come the end of term, we can make a new plan."

"Right...right...what about Ginny?"

Ginny had managed to get up on her feet and was bunny-hopping up to the door of the pitch.

"Oy! Come back Ginny! Please?"

Not a bad start, I think.

*** Part 2

--------------

Ginny Weasley bunny-hopped as fast as she could away from the Quidditch Pitch, unsure if she was afraid or furious. Draco Malfoy was dead. The arrogant little bigot was no loss but Ginny definitely felt rather uncomfortable with the idea that other students had killed him. Terry didn't seem the type to kill--he had said it was an accident.

You accidentally killed Draco Malfoy? Lucius was going to be pissed, that was for sure.

And Michael! Her boyfriend wanted to help cover it up! And he had jinxed her legs together.

It wasn't much of an impediment. Ginny had grown up with six older brother and was well acquainted with physical competitions and the very frequent sequence of being chased all over the Burrow. Even Percy the Prat would chase her.

And so she hopped. Ginny had gotten a head start on Michael and Terry and Anthony and she didn't want them to catch her.

She was almost at the stairs. Oh crud, this would be harder than she thought.

"Ginny!"

"Please don't tell!"

"/Accio Ginny!/"

Ginny felt a tug on her robes but it wasn't enough to knock her off her feet.

"Did you really think that would work, Ant?"

"It was the first thing that I could think of," Anthony whined.

Ginny took too large a step and stumbled. She fell to the ground and scrambled back up as quickly as she could. A jet of red light flew above her head.

"A Stunner?! Michael, are you mad?"

"C'mon Ginny, please hold still?"

"No!"

Ginny realized she'd only be an easier target for them to grab her if she went back up the stairs, so she began hopping to Hagrid's hut. Hagrid would think of something, and she was surprised she hadn't thought of him sooner.

Ginny hopped again when her feet got caught on /something,/ and she stumbled again.

"Hello, Ginny."

"Luna!"

"Grab her!"

"What are you doing, Ginny?" Luna peered at her curiously, walking alongside her as Ginny tried to hop to Hagrid's. Ginny noted that Luna's feet were bare.

"Can't talk."

"Are you bouncing? Fun! Can I bounce too?" Luna began hopping alongside her, giggling.

"Luna, have---people been---taking your---things?"

"Yes---but I find---my best ideas---come when---I'm barefoot---I don't mind."

"They still--shouldn't---steal your---things."

"Ginny, you---might enjoy---the bouncing---more if---you took---your shoes---off too." Luna smiled as they hopped. "The grass---is soft---and tickles."

On any other day, Ginny might have agreed to it. Luna did look like she was having fun. She wouldn't have believed it, but the odd little Ravenclaw had become her friend.

"Hagrid! Hagrid!"

"Oh, were---you looking---for Hagrid?"

"Yes!" Ginny shouted, coming to a stop. "Where is he?"

"I don't know. If I did, I would tell you."

Suddenly, black ropes appeared out of thin air and Ginny found herself tied face-to-face with Luna, before falling onto her side.

"Ow!"

Ginny said some very bad words as the boys finally caught up to them. Her nose itched.

--------------

Meanwhile, Michael and Terry and Anthony were trying not to panic as they chased after Ginny.

"Oy, Ginny! Please don't tell!"

"C'mon! Anthony will get in trouble!"

"Ginny, if you don't tell," Michael thought for a moment. "I'll braid your hair and you can see inside our Common Room!"

"We need a plan!"

"A plan for what to do if she tells?" Anthony sobbed. "Okay, I vote we run to Hogsmeade, find a Floo, and flee for the Continent."

"We can't do that!"

"You're right Terry. We need to find a country without an extradition treaty...but I don't know any nice ones."

"Anthony! Not helping!"

"/Stupefy!/"

"A Stunner? Michael, are you mad?!"

"Bloody hell, I nearly Stunned my girlfriend. Oh, I hope she doesn't break things off with me for it."

"She's not going up the steps! She's not going up the steps!"

"Then where is she going?"

"Hagrid's?"

The boys ran faster, but Ginny had run into Loony Lovegood of all people. Loony began hopping alongside Ginny, apparently thinking they were playing a game.

"C'mon Ginny!"

"Looney, grab her!"

"Run, run!"

"If she tells on us, we're doomed! Doomed!" Anthony wailed.

"/Incarcerous!/"

Ropes appeared out of thin air and wrapped themselves around the girls, tying them together.

"Sorry Ginny..." Michael said sheepishly.

"Are you playing a new game?" Luna asked curiously. "Can I play too?"

"Buggerin' friggi' and blisterin' fookin' moog."

"Uh Ginny...I'm not sure if it helps...but you still wrinkle your nose when you say bad words. It's still cute...maybe?"

"Oh, we're all going to Azkaban. We're going to Azkaban forever and ever."

"Anthony! Your pessimism isn't helping!"

I mean, from the other houses you can get something steriotypical:\\
Gryffindor kills first and leave the body in the lake, hoping no-one notices\\
Hufflepuff all help each other cover it up, so no-one can say who the individual who actually did it was.\\
Slytherin frame up someone in a different house so no-one notices it was them.

Anyway no, seriously, they're smarts, and smarts also include being creative. Not necessarily in an artsy sense, but in a science, coming-up-with-new-plans sense. I think that'd be pretty Ravenclaw (and a bit Slytherin).

** Anthony Goldstein looked up as the door to his Study Group's (unofficially) designated classroom swung open with much cursing.

"Dammit, you're a /lot/ heavier than you look."

There was a painful-sounding crack, before Padma's head stuck through the doorway. "Hey, Anthony, can you give me a hand with this?"

She hefted what appeared to be a limp body and tried again, bumping its head against the doorframe. /hard/.

He walked over and picked up the feet. "Did you finally succeed at that homunculus experiment?"

She shook her head. "Malfoy."

He blinked. "Did Potter finally crack?"

She shook her head. "It was the ladder up to Trelawney's classroom - I was trying to get my sister to come down for at least one meal but it turned out he was directly underneath."

The two of them pushed the body up onto an unused desk before stepping back and staring at it.

Anthony shifted. "What are we gonna do with this?"

Padma tilted her head thoughtfully. "See, the thing is I don't want to go to Azkaban before I get the opportunity to become an Unspeakable."

Anthony sat down on another desk. "So what are we talking about, here? Do we want to frame someone or just dispose of the body and hope nobody notices he's gone?"

She twirled her wand idly. "The best thing to do is for him to not have died in the first place, if you catch my drift."

He groaned. "Dammit Padma, we both know that using the Time Turner for that would cause a paradox!"

She shook her head. "Polyjuice."

"You want us to kill someone else polyjuiced as Draco Malfoy?"

She shrugged. "Too much work. I'm thinking we double up our days and impersonate him for the reruns. We can set up a rotation and everything."

Anthony walked over to the wall and dismantled the wards to the Top Secret Ravenclaw Stash of Magical Goodies, pulling a golden hourglass on a thin chain out of the hidden compartment. "Is... was this all just some elaborate plot to justify doubling your study time?"

Padma smirked.

** The bullies, having had enough of that pesky Lovegood, lined up their shot. In two minutes, that dizzy blonde would come skipping around the corner, and their piercing hex would thread through the gaps in the armor and architecture and silence her mad rambling.

The moment had come. The flash of blonde. The hex spoken. In an instant screaming filled the hall. As the quartet dove into the secret passageway the words that would send chills down their spines finally registers. "Oh Merlin... Malfoy's dead!"

Their eyes grew wide as shock set in. They turned with a shock as a lyrical voice chimed in their hiding place. "Oh dearie me... Someone has been naughty."

Drawn up short by the wand idly pointed in their direction, they blanched at the sweetly smiling face of Luna Lovegood. "Now who needs an alibi?" She slowly faded from view, "Find my missing things. The more you find, the more ironclad your alibi will be. Fly, my little Ravens..." Her whispers crawled across their skin, "Fly..."
