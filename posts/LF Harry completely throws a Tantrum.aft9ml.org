Harry is a Teenager, he gets moody and depressed occasionally, but only really when he wrecks Dumbledore's office do you ever see what you'd expect emotionally for a Teenager. Are there any fics similar to Brutal Harry, where something bad happens, and Harry just flat out flips his shit and breaks things, or nearby people.

It's not how I would react, in public at least. I'd politely excuse myself, go to the Room of Requirement, ask it to create targets and disposable objects, and just flat out cast every explosive and destructive spell I know, as well as smashing things by hand, having a Room that can provide breakable things without a downside would make venting a LOT easier...


** Harry flips out pretty hard at people, especially Dumbledore, in Apprentice Potter. Set in the aftermath of the Department of Mysteries Debacle.
