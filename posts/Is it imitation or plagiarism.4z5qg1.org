Now. My title was unnecessarily inflammatory. But after a few recent hits I've been wondering at how exactly fanfiction crosses the line from imitation to plagiarism. Can fanfiction even really be plagiarism? (I think so yes.) Obviously I'm not talking about when some chumhead on FF or AO3 or (insert fic hub here) steals some popular authors work and just reposts it. I'm talking about when writers use bits and piece of more "original"(published for profit) for lack of a better term works in their own piece. A prime example (And one that irritates me to no end). You want to make your villain seem crazy evil. But you're lazy. (Yes you cheeto eater.) So you think. "The Joker is crazy evil!" ANd you crib The Dark Knight.(Though a clever thief would steal from Clockwork Orange, in my arrogant opinion) I've gone through dozens of stories that re-use that annoying "Some men just want to watch the world burn" and "I'm not crazy I'm just ahead of the curve" it just makes me want to immolate the globe. It was moderately cool sounding when Heath Ledger did it. It isn't cool sounding when your Peeves, or Crazy!Harry or Bellatrix does it.

This isn't the only example. A recent story I read draws incredibly heavy from Stephen Kings many and myriad works. Now I get that art is derivative and everyone copies from each other. But there's copying and making something your own, and Ctrl pasting it and changing one word. Part of it is I have a freak memory, so when someone steals a quote I know, or an idea from a book I read, I remember. Which makes it my fault perhaps, as it makes me somewhat jaded.

That ends the rant portion of this. For the more interesting topic. At what point does it cross the line into Plagiarism? Can a work that is entirely built on using someone else's world and ideas actually plagiarize since they're starting with someone else's concept to begin with? I'm not digging fanfiction. I love fanfiction.

For me its entirely a matter of quality. I think if they take an idea and merge it with their own interpretation and it becomes some beautiful new bastard concept then it's okay. Innovation is a wonderful thing. But to just repeat what other people have already done because you can't think of anything that sounds better is lazy and to me at least defeats the point of it in the first place.

As always I open the floor to you dear strangers. (Except for you cheeto eater.)


** It's about how you write it that matters. There are only so many character archetypes/story structures/etc available that whatever you end up creating will not only fall into a well-worn groove but will likely resemble someone else's work out of sheer chance.

Before Harry Potter came out, Neil Gaiman published Books of Magic, which features a tween with glasses and an owl going to magic school. Not plagiarism. Some asian countries though are selling books/movies/plays called "Hari Porter" or something and is basically a clear rip-off and they're getting sued though.

Prose-wise it's more clear cut. Using someone's creative turn of phrase is fine, copypasting an entire paragraph isn't.

** The only reason why plagiarism matters is because of the money one makes off of something. I posit that if someone writes something but makes no profit, it is technically not plagiarism due to the fact that it has a specific legal definition.

I've read so many books with interchangeable male characters. There are plenty of tropes that I think should die. And Stephen King makes my head hurt with how often he writes about a writer from Maine. Is that self plagiarism? Who knows...

I understand that it's silly to have characters quoting popular characters from other works, but usually that's just a symptom of underdeveloped writing ability. They need more practice and are not polished like many professional works.

I do think that it's important to write badly if you want to get better. If you just wait to write until you're perfect, you will never write at all.

** I don't think it's plagiarism legally. [[http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/fandom-guide-cassandra-clare-mortal-instruments/][Cassandra Clare was under fire]] for her stories plagiarizing several different shows, movies, and books, but this was only after she took her Ginny/Draco stories and edited them so they could be published. I assume that since it is fanfiction, and using the media to create something new(ish), it isn't legally plagiarism. Unless you start acting as if it is your own work and attempt to make money off of it, that is. Personally, I do agree that it basically is. She literally quoted other books and shows. At that point, it's just a collage of other people's work.

** A lot of original works have references in them to other works, I wonder what the line is between plagiarizing and referencing. Like you say if the plagiarism has a purpose, it becomes a bit more interesting. It's up to the authors whose work is stolen or use to decide, I think.

** Writing "in the style" of another writer/work is perfectly fine.

Memorable quotes can even be okay. These sometimes just slip into the zeitgeist and become a part of our normal speech.

But, obviously, copying actual passages, even after some editing, is not okay. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11950816/1/][This story]], for example, copies passages from HPMoR and even an entire article from Pottermore (though I see they've finally attributed the Pottermore passage correctly now).

Most fanfiction isn't "plagiarism" of JKR's works, it's just using a setting she created and owns without permission.
