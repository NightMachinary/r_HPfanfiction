I'm looking for any stories that are novel length and feature a snarky Snape who is reluctant to start a relationship with Hermione at first. I would also like it if somewhere in the plot, Severus hurts Hermione in some way, but they eventually make up. It can take place at any time in the HP universe.


** Have you read the trilogy by grangerous on FanFic? It's an excellent completed work where both characters are IC throughout the entirety of the work. It was very enjoyable if you enjoy angst and slow burn fics.
