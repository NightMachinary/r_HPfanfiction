I've seen fics that explore Ginny's interactions with Tom, eg linkffn(Identity by MarauderLover7), and fics that call out the Weasleys for not getting her professional psychiatric help afterward but don't really go into detail, eg linkffn(The Mind Arts).

Are there good stories that properly depict the aftermath, how Ginny struggles for years, or perhaps where she /does/ get help and that gets shown?


** I've read a few fics where it comes up. !linkao3(Runic War Warding) and !linkffn(Gaining Power) (the sequel to another fic) are both (non-slash) Harry/Voldemort fics. Ginny has only gotten one scene in Runic War Warding, though it was an interesting one. In Gaining Power, Ginny was made for more ruthless and cunning by the diary's influence, and even acts as a go-between for Emily and the Order of the Phoenix.

!linkffn(The Thorny Rose) also features a Ginny that was impacted heavily by the diary. The Ron bashing is annoying, but he at least gets a redemption by the end of the series.

I'm also going to second chiruochiba's recommendation of !linkffn(Black Ink, Red Rose). Bolshe is a good friend of mine and I love his work, with this one being my favourite from him.

  After losing Sirius at the Department of Mysteries Harry is left abandoned, lost and alone with her uncaring relatives for the summer. She somehow finds herself sharing dreams with Lord Voldemort who quickly discovers that she is his horcrux, changing the terms of the game between them forever. Because not only is she a part of himself that he is now determined to reclaim, but thanks to the terms outlined in a centuries old will she is also the key to him claiming his birthright and conquering Magical Britain once and for all. And nothing is as seductive to the abandoned as someone who truly wants them.

** linkffn(More Than a Mug of Hot Chocolate by keeptheotherone) (or its rewrite linkffn(Hidden Chambers and Unseen Monsters by keeptheotherone)). And I am slightly touching this in my story I am writing right now: they just didn't have enough money for it. How many psychological traumas and PTSDs are untreated because of lack of money? What do you think was the treatment Molly Weasley got after her brothers were killed? Was it more than a Mug of Hot Chocolate (or glass of firewhiskey)?

** I've recently started reading a fic which explores those ideas. The story diverges in second year on the premise that the destruction of the Diary didn't remove its compulsions from Ginny's mind. The fic shows her internal struggles and slow downward spiral as she tries to cope while the lingering compulsions prevent her from telling anyone the truth.

The fic covers some extremely disturbing events (mind the warning tags), but there's no attempt to romanticize or make Voldemort's side any less horrific than in canon. The story doesn't flinch from showing the tragic consequences for Ginny and the people around her.

** If anyone can help, I don't remember the name of the fic. An adult Harry had been sent back in time to an alt-U that didn't have a Harry and I think Neville was the BWL. Anyway, during the Chamber situation, Ginny managed the willpower to throw the diary into the Chamber as the entrance was closing, locking it inside. But 'Tom' was still in her head. Every year Ginny begs not to go back to school, but every year she gets sent back where the proximity makes Tom stronger and harder to ignore.
