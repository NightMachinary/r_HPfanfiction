Cos why not? Sounds pretty entertaining to me. The comedic potential is perfect.


** "Can I hang out with you, Viktor? Take you to the Yule Ball? Hold your broomstick?"

"Darling, I am var too out ov your league. And my broomstick is only handled after second dates"

******* Oh, I thought that you meant something along the lines of Viktor Limp, since Krumm is German for crooked/bent and you only see that curvature when it's erect.

** I'm imagining a mind curse that makes you think someone else is the opposite gender.

Viktor and Ron both think the other one is a good looking girl. Everyone else thinks they just came out as gay. The pranksters nearly die from holding back laughter when they show up to the ball.
