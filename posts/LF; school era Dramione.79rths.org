Going on a Dramione kick but noticed a lot of the newer fics at least take place after school or last year. Was wondering if anyone had any recs for school era fics? Preferably before last year so no head boy / girl. Love some secret sneaking around. Completed or on going. Please and thank you.

  Tired of Draco's arrogant claims that he can 'get any girl he wants', Daphne proposes a challenge to knock him down a peg or two. However when Draco unexpectedly accepts, the stakes are raised and neither Slytherin wants to lose. Elsewhere, Hermione has her own point to prove, but when she finds her path crossing with Draco's, will either of them succeed? 4th Year A/U *COMPLETE*
