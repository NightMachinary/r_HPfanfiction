** You just have to keep rereading fics you've already read, that way you never forget. Just give up all hope of an exterior life, and devote yourself to FanFiction...

Or you can just make those folder things on the FanFiction.Net app. Not really familiar with other ways, but maybe keep a running index in a word document or an excel sheet. Seems like a lot of work when you can just spend hours a day reading fanfiction, though...

** I am really bad at titles, but remember nearly all of the fics I've read. Whenever someone asks for something specific in my area of interest (SS-centric, bonus points for LESS where I've probably read more or less everything FFN and Ao3 has on it), I usually know enough to be able to track the fic down with a bit of searching.

I do remember the titles of the fics I like the most, and a few others that stand out, but generally have to rely on fic search to re-find things.

It doesn't always work, especially in areas of fanfiction I have little to no interest in generally. For example, a few days ago I was feeling up for some Dramione for whatever reason and wanted to read a fluff fic I've seen recommended here various times before. I know it had something to do with a Yule Ball bet of Malfoy being able to convince Granger to take him to it. After various searches in Google and FFN filters, I was ultimately unsuccessful. I ended up reading something else instead (some story of her faking being a girlfriend for 4 months for reasons). Worked well enough to sate my curiousity over the pairing.

(The reason I didn't simply just /ask/ for the fic in this subreddit is that Order/DE is usually frowned upon and I didn't expect positive responses and by the time I would have gotten any, my curiousity would probably have dimmed anyway)

Anyway I started reading tons after that.

By August I realised like... I've already read this one. I dont want repeats!

So I created a word document. It included link date i read POV fandom etc etc. And a small summary.

By the time I got to the 330s I realized a word doc wasnt good enough.

I made an excel spreadsheet.

I'm currently at like 1290 fics or something like that.

I dont forget anymore and I have keywords in a certain section so it's easy to look up recommendations ^{^} (like time travel dimension hopping fem!character adoption people living. Like the tags on AO3 lol but in my spreadsheet).

** TFW you can't find one of your favorites that you want to reread in the history of your AO3 but it turns out you couldn't find it because the author deleted it without warning and this removes the title from your history list. I love Araciel's and Reighost's writing but they really get on my nerves for this reason.

** Yeap. After reading fanfic for ~12 years, I don't even try anymore. The ones I do easily remember, are the really popular ones that you don't /really/ need to remember cuz someone else will have already read or recommended it.

** If i find a fic i like and start reading it i will always download a copy to ibooks to finish reading it. Then i always have a copy and can just look to see if i've read it before. And at the end if i really like a story i'll put it in an ibooks folder with all my other favorite stories.

** Definitely, but I make sure to make different folders for my fanfiction bookmarks. I divide them by the fanfiction (like HP) that's updating and that has been completed and then various subjects (like time travel, post-war, etc..) and then by pairing. It's a little excessive at first, but I've realized that it's the best way to compartmentalize once you've read them especially as they keep growing by the day. I'd be completely lost when wanting to recommend fanfictions to others as well as wanting to reread them. But I just started this around a year ago, so the ones I read before them - unless they were incredibly memorable or I came across them again - are a little hard to recommend.

** I Gave up trying to do that a long time ago(I never did it). My list of favourite story's on fanfiction was once over 5000 thousand before I pruned it and got rid of a lot of old storys that haven't stood the test of time.

** I don't even really remember the original story anymore. I'm afraid if I pick it up, I be disappointed.

** I've been reading fanfics for the last 12 years now. Have discarded just as many as I've written (none of them were ever put up online cause I hate discontinued fics). But I normally classify it in my head based on the pairing. Generally, even though u don't remember the title, you still remember the scenes and maybe a dialogue or two. Whenever someone want a a recommendation type whatever you remember into the search bar and google takes care of the rest.

** Shut up. I'm just so fucking angry because my phone broke and I bought a new one but I can't get back the bookmarks I had on the previous one. So many fanfiction. So many. Lost. This shit hurts.
