"Harry Potter is dead!"

Neville watched, black despair filling him, as Lord Voldemort taunted the ragged line of weary defenders, most of them children no older than Neville, which was all that was left of Hogwarts' defenders. His Death Eaters jeered as the Boy Who Lived, their hope, lay still in Hagrid's arms, the sobbing giant's despair reflecting that in every heart. Anger, however, quickly replaced fear, and then determination. They might die, but he would die on his feet, and he wouldn't grovel and beg for mercy. He started to step forward, but a firm hand restrained him. A stern voice spoke beside him.

"Not yet." Neville looked up as a man stepped past him, out onto the field between the two armies. He was tall, broad-shoulders, with a stern yet noble face and long brown hair and beard. He wore a rich cloak across his shoulders, trimmed with gold and stained with blood, and at his side hung a long sword.

"And what's your name", Voldemort jeered. "Who has come to kneel before me?"

"I do not come to kneel", the stranger said, his voice strong and clear.

"You wish to die with your savior?" The Death Eaters laughed, and Neville shook with supressed rage.

"I come to give thee battle, foul sorcerer. I am Arthur Pendragon, Lord of Camelot, captain of the Knights of the Round Table, student and friend of the wizard Merlin himself. And I have returned, as was foretold, in this land's darkest hour."

With a single swift motion the knight drew his sword, the Sun flashing blindingly on the polished blade. Harry suddenly sprang up, a cry went up from the defenders and the surged forward, Neville in the lead. Voldemort's eyes widened, then he swung his wand and a bolt of green light flashed toward his foe as the knight-no, King-sprang forward, and the battle was joined.

​

​

Yeah, so, basically, that stuff in certain stories about Arthur returning in Britain's darkest hour turns out to be true, and King Arthur himself comes to aid the defenders at the Battle of Hogwarts.

Neville subsequently becoming a Knight of the Round Table is optional.


** At the heat of the battle, no one noticed the waters of the Lake flashing blue, or the figure that emerged from it, carrying a sword brimming with power.

It was when Voldemort came to gloat, that he showed himself.

The assembled defenders were quiet, downtrodden when Voldemort made his announcement, and when just when Neville made to step up, an armored hand fell on his shoulder.

"The battle is not yet done." said a regal voice.

Neville turned in surprise, his eyes widening on seeing the man beside him, clad in golden plate armor, with a red cloak and carrying an ornamented sword with shining runes in the blade was a strong bearded blonde man with a golden crown in his head.

Voldemort looked surprised for a moment, his attention was also on the sword, "What's the meaning of this? Who dares defy Lord Voldemort?"

The man laughed, "/Lord/? Ha! You are no Lord. As for who I am, I am Arthur Pendragon, King of Britain, Leader of the Round Table, here to help Britain in its hour of need, and to help my old friend Merlin, who looks like he has been skipping meals." he indicated Harry.

Voldemort looked between the two, his mouth opening and closing, the Death Eaters just looked extremely confused(as did the defenders, though some seemed to be emboldened by the man's word).

"I don't know what kind of childish trick is this, but if you wish to die with him, then so be it!"

"There's no trick foul sorcerer, now surrender, or be destroyed!"

Voldemort's answer was a scream, followed by an Avada Kedavra, everyone started moving, only to stop in surprise when the man just swung his sword, the blade shining golden and deflected the curse in a single movement, before pointing it at Voldemort.

"Your dark magic is no match for Excalibur!"

In a beat the battle began, Harry jumped out of Hagrid's arms and blasted the nearest Death Eaters, while Arthur advanced towards a panicking Voldemort, whose spells were being batted away with ease and supernatural speed by the sword, the man flew away before he could be hit, but the nearest Death Eaters were not so fast and were cut down.

Arthur cut down a path until Harry, who was already in a group, "Ho! Merlin, you are still short I see, and you have Morgana's eyes for some reason."

"Huh?" was the intelligent response.

Arthur laughed and slapped him in the shoulder, "Ah, it hasn't come back I see, but it's good to see you old friend, I think this time things will work out for you, you will not be alone."

Harry was surprised by the emotion in the strangely familiar man's voice, so he just nodded.

"Good, now let's put down the rest of this rabble, and find the others." he then proceeded to slash the air, the sword shone and a half-moon made of golden energy came out of the blade, cutting the two nearest Death Eaters.

With a battlecry that reverberated through the courtyard, Arthur advanced, the Death Easters fleeing before him, and Harry followed, which felt natural, throwing spells here and there to cover for Arthur's quick and reckless advance, wait here had that come from.

​

Voldemort was desperate, his attack was falling apart, he was on the brink of victory, only for a legend to appear out of nowhere and rally the defenders, Potter was still alive, somehow, and now there were reports of other armored knights appearing with magic weapons and joining the fight.

He was in one of the battlements, looking down and seeing his army being defeated, two of his death eaters were guarding the entrance while he stayed here with Nagini, thinking of how to reverse the situation, or even escape.

His thoughts were interrupted by an explosion on the door, smoke engulfing his two guards, before a blue bolt emerged and went right true Nagini's cage, disintegrating the snake.

Voldemort turned to the door, wand in hand, thinking of who had the power for such a spell, a spell he did not recognize, he was surprised when a girl emerged, teenage in appearance, but it was the eyes that shocked him, piercing green like Potter's, but looking older, she had long black hair, and was dressed in black robes of a very old design, she had pale silvery wand in hand.

"So, you are what passes for a Dark Lord these days, pitiful." she glanced at the dispersing black smoke, "And using the Foul's soul anchors too, hmpf, how very original."

Voldemort was already at the end of his patience at people in medieval clothing appearing out of nowhere and mocking him. "And who are you?"

"I am the /Lady/ Morgana of Avalon, here to find my teacher and husband, though I hear you intend to do him harm."

He tried to contain the surprise in his voice, but he should've expected that.

"What? But we are on the same side, you were-are a Dark Lady."

Morgana looked disheartened for a moment, but it was quickly over, and her confident expression returned, "I see history took it's usual way of villanizing women in power, but no matter, that shall be cleared up soon, after I end you."

"I am Dark Lord Voldemort, and it won't be some teenager with delusions of grandeur who will defy me."

*** Harry looked up when he heard a big explosion coming from the battlements, and he saw a dragon made of red fire, wrestling with a serpent, also made of fire.

"Ah, it appears Morgana has found him first, pity."

"Morgana?" the name rolled off his tongue, with an inflection that wasn't his.

Arthur looked at him and /waggled his eyebrows/, making Harry, once again, extremely confused.

There was another explosion, and the fire serpent dispersed, a figure cloaked in black smoke came flying.

"Ah, about time, here, take it, just give it back to me back later, as you always do."

Harry was surprised when Artur presented him with the sword, handle first.

"What?"

"Just take it and finish this, you'll know what to do."

He reluctantly touched the blade, being surprised by the feeling of power coursing to him as he grasped the handle and lifted it.

He saw Voldemort land in the middle of the larger group, covered in soot and with his robes singed. He knew what to do.

As he turned to leave, he heard himself saying, "Golden armor, Arthur, really?"

A smile came at the older man's laugh, and Harry advanced, the Death Eaters saw him and turned to fire, and with his wand in his left hand(that he hadn't even realized was there), Harry traced and complicated patter in the air, making a transparent dome appear covering the group and himself. He saw Voldemort looking around surprised, and some Death Eaters turned on their heels, only to be shocked when nothing happened.

"Kill him! Now!"

Spells flew, and Harry batted them away with wand and sword, retaliating with stunners and other spells he wasn't sure he knew, until only Voldemort was left standing.

Voldemort was looking terrified, and mouthing 'How?' over and over again. And Harry remembered, 'Power he knows not.'

Harry turned to the side(but still kept Voldemort in his peripheral vision), and saw a group of knights, with armors of various colors, joining Arthur, blades bloody. There was even one in forest green armor and with an antlered helmet, that had a hand on the king's shoulder while they looked at the battle. It warmed Harry's heart for some reason.

He turned to Voldemort, "It's over Tom."

Voldemort said nothing and started casting.

Harry moved, and Excalibur shone golden while deflecting spells, almost faster than the eye could see, before long Harry was in front of Voldemort who was about to turn and run, but Harry was faster and slashed with the blade.

Voldemort fell, his eyes open and face in an expression of surprise on his face.

Harry looked down at him, and then around, the Death Eaters who were still on their feet either surrendered or tried to run. He received a nod from Arthur and some of the other knights.

Until he heard an extremely familiar voice that made his stomach flutter, and his face warm.

"Always overdramatic in your victories aren't you?"

He looked a saw a girl with coloring similar to his own, dressed in black, and that had a smile on her face that would be called scandalous by some.

To Harry, it was comforting.

I just merged one of my plot bunnies with this, if you want something Arthur focused I can do it too.

BONUS(because I couldn't resist):

Neville was about to step forward when a feminine voice spoke from his side.

"This battle is not over yet, mage!"

He turned and his eyes widened in surprise when he saw a blonde girl, looking to be around their age, and wearing what looked to be a heavily armored dress, while carrying a golden longsword.

"What's the meaning of this? Who are you?"

"I am Artoria Pendragon, King of Knights, here to save my Master!"

Nevile opened his mouth in shock.

What?
