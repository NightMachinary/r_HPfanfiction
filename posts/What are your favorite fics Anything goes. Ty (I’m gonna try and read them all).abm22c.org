** linkffn(6919395) The Changeling--probably the best HP fanfiction I've read. Slytherin!Ginny, mainly follows her and a group of other female Slytherins. Events mostly follow canon but very little mention of Harry/Ron/Hermoine.

linkffn(2580283) Saving Connor, part 1 of the 7 part Sacrifices Arc. An epic AU with amazing worldbuilding and magical battles--Light and Dark are sort of deities rather than metaphors for Good/Evil, plot has almost no connection to canon after 1st year.

linkffn(4068153) linkffn(6325846) Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, and the sequel, Heartlands of Time. Harry goes back in time to age 15 every time he dies, and has lived and died thousands of time fighting against Voldemort. Now he's on his last life, and has one last chance to defeat Voldemort.

** I'm loathe to recommend unfinished fics (though if you don't read unfinished fics you miss a lot of good stuff), but linkffn(Forging the Sword) is pretty awesome. It has really good characterization of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, which I think it pretty rare (usually it's Harry + Hermione, Ron left to the wayside).

Also linkffn(The One He Feared) is short, incomplete, but very good. Great action, humor, and characterization of a Harry who's received Dumbledore's memories. Also a cool, short exploration of curse breaking.

Linkffn(An Unfound Door) is a WIP by the author of Wastelands and Heartlands of time. I really like how it drops you in the middle of an AU, and you have to sort of puzzle out what's different from cannon as time goes on. It involves a 5th year Ravenclaw Harry and a Hogwarts that is very mysterious.

Tonks is thrown back to the beginning of the 5th year during the DoM battle and decides that the best bet at changing the future is joining Harry at Hogwarts.

The story captures the issues of a time-traveller quite well and Tonks tries to find a balance between rational changes and throwing the script out of the window while the outside events change as well. It has a superb depiction of the friendship between Harry, Hermione and Tonks and while it has a romantic subplot, most of the romance happens off screen or is implied afterwards, so it is definitely not one of those "let's write a story about a ship" fics.

There are also many fics which have very enjoyable parts but also have glaring issues. For example "Rune Stone Path" has an awesome "adoptive mother/mentor" arc which is second to none but also has "political" elements which really drag the story down. "Delenda Est" is a great story for the first half, but the second half is lacklustre and the sequel is supposed to be a trainwreck (never read it). "What's a little Death between friends" is a very enjoyable if cracky premise but Harry is really a perverted White Knight in that one.

  Severus Snape has his emotions in check. He knows that he experiences anger and self-loathing and a bitter yearning, and that he rarely deviates from that spectrum... Until the first-year Luna Lovegood arrives to his class wearing a wreath of baby's breath. Over the next six years, an odd friendship grows between the two, and Snape is not sure how he feels about any of it.

Ginny and Luna's friendship, and Ginny's musings therein, are chronicled here. It's not perfect by any means, and the formatting of the archive is a little rough around the edges, but it remains my favorite still. This, to me, is one of the best platonic love stories I know.

** Denial by little beloved - linkffn(8967842). It's old, originally published in 2008, and then after deleting and editing, again in 2013.

The story is about post-Hogwarts, post-master's- potions-apprentice Hermione returning to England and a marriage law after five years away. It's slow burn HG/SS at 214k+ words, but not in the way you'd think. And it's HBP compliant, but not so for the epilogue. There /is/ smut, a bit of angst, and two really good OCs.

I know that doesn't tend to be everyone's thing, but I make a point of rereading it every once in a while.

It has elements from Stargate, but you don't need to know anything about Stargate. The DA gets the Room of Requirement to open up to a spaceship. It's an OotP divergence, but don't expect a bunch of Second War stuff. The DA having fun and getting inventive in a spaceship is the point of this story.

** This is too subjective...everyone will have different answers!

I'll try to compensate by just recommending one: linkffn(Harry Potter and the Nightmares of Futures Past). This one has basically displaced canon in my head; when I try to think about Hermione's personality, or the Weasleys, especially Ginny, I find myself remembering quotes from this instead of from JKR. Unfortunately incomplete, but still worthwhile IMO.

And it's a /thought-provoking/ read. It grapples with what it really means to be a hero. It takes a hard look at how people behave in groups, and what it really means to be yourself. It debates the question of when to fight evil vs when to pick your battles, and although the protagonist has clear views on that, the story doesn't insist that he's necessarily right. He's often wrong, about a great many things, and that often has serious consequences (both for himself and people around him).

I enjoyed it for the humor and the mock battles, but it isn't my favorite story to reread. Still, I'm glad to have read it. I think it's quite reasonable for [[/u/MTheLoud][u/MTheLoud]] to recommend it.

This is...pretty clearly incorrect. He comes into conflict, of varying degrees, types, and importance, with Draco Malfoy, with Hermione, with Dumbledore, with Professor McGonagall, with Professor Quirrell, with his parents, with Lucius Malfoy, and let's not forget Lord Voldemort. And he also wants to take over and reform a good deal of the wizarding world, and abolish death. Some of these conflicts are minor, some are pretty critical. You don't have to like how they're done, of course, but the idea that he never has any opponent or any difficulty is objectively wrong.

** These are all from my rec list on ao3!

*The Meaning of Mistletoe*

The first instalment of this four part series and it is by far my favourite set of fics in this fandom. It has a very interesting take on magic, characters and goes in so many directions yet naturally flows. Percy Weasley is my fave in this one!

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/9323225/chapters/21128351]])

*The Dogfather*

A wonderful comedic tale of a What If where Harry is adopted by nice muggles and comes into contact with Sirius and Remus. I've yet to read the last chapter but I'm sure it's just as great as the rest of the fic (I just don't want it to end for me yet :P)

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/13760487/chapters/31624473]])

*The Art of Self Fashioning*

Very dark and disturbing fic that goes into the magic of transfiguration. I found Harry's perspective to be quite unnerving to read but I read on none the less. I liked it for how unique it was.

Linkao3([[https://archiveofourown.org/works/5103614/chapters/11740079]])

*Quiet Like a Fight*

Probably the least popular fic on this list with just over 670 kudos but I think it deserves more. A What If situation in which Harry becomes a Slytherin simply because he doesn't have any prejudice on the subject so when the hat suggests it he's like "sure? I guess?". No annoying cliches, no bashing. Just Harry being a kid. Part of a series that is sadly incomplete.

*Also there are two fics that are the sole reason I even have the ffn app still installed!*

  When the war takes a turn for the worse, Remus Lupin decides to fix everything by De-Aging Hermione and throwing her into the past. With Harry Potter dead, and Hermione in emotional pain, can her growing up in the Marauder's era change the outcome of the war forever? Or will everyone just have more to lose?

  To Harry Potter, Fifth Year seemed like the same as any other. Classmates, homework, new dangers, Voldemort risen in the shadows... the usual, even with a Dementor attack kicking things off.
