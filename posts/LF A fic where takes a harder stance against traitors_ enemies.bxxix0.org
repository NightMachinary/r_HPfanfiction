After learning the truth about his parents' betrayal in third year, I'd like it if Harry responded a bit harsher by all the backstabbing he receives in fourth year.

Also (sort of a secondary request) I'd like some fics where he (and in the case of sixth year his friends too) took second or third generation death eater kids more seriously.

I mean, Draco talks smack about him meeting the same sticky end a his parents early on and a lot of unacceptable stuff after that, it might not be enough to go psycho over, but he could at least kneecap him at some point. (They have spells for that right)

DEFINITELY NOT looking for some uber bashy revenge fics, I think the canon situation warrants enough bitch slapping/ rational enmity without turning everyone around him into a two dimensional cartoon villain.

*** Thanks I was aware of the genre. You wouldn't happen to have one where he specifically compares Ron to Scabbers would you? Out just seems like such an obvious insult but I haven't come across it xD

**** Not really. I gave up on indy!Harry stories a while ago. I've kind of gotten bored of all that crap. I remember reading a fic called a champions champion. Harry get's Ron to take his place in the TWT, and it shows how useless fanon Ron is(which book Ron is certainly not. They are 14 year olds, they're gonna get jealous, but it all works out fine in the end).

***** Same, they got really repetitive a long time ago.

The thing about them being 14 year olds was kind of my thought behind the post to begin with though: On the one hand, yes they are kids and in a way it makes sense, but on the other hand everything is a lot more serious then normal teenage problems. On the other hand it's a decade after a pretty hardcore racially motivated civil war, a good portion of the population and their fellow students are pretty much Nazis on steroids with the adults being war criminals, and from the descriptions people give of the last war the worst part of it was betrayal and not knowing who to trust.

So I get why in canon and most fanfictions things are written the way they are, but I would like to read some where more weight is given to those darker themes.

****** I HATE these kind of fics, especially when I see the double standards of treatment between Ron, Hermione and Harry :

- Harry is a moody teen that can spend weeks in a bad mood (being less responding to his friends) before exploding and yelling at them when they finally confront him about it? Can be extremely insulting and even violent just like when he threw a badge at Ron's face? Not a problem, perfect friend.
- Hermione is the queen of overbearing, often thinking she is right and sometimes showing a total lack of diplomatie, if not empathie. Even if she was technically right, PoA Hermione was just hatefull in all of her interactions about Divination, Scabbers and Harry's Firebolt, but she was "right" so she must be forgiven I guess.
- Ron had insecurity problems and didn't talk to Harry for about a month? Even if most of this lenght is due to Harry's response? BETRAYER, HARRY SHOULD NEVER SPEAK TO HIM AGAIN. And he betrayed again when they were camping, it's a proof he is a bad a Pettigrew, we should all have seen it.

​

Seriously though, in both case, the "betrayals" were just teen having a row. In GoF, the main reason why it lasted a month is because Harry was also angry and attacked Ron where it hurt the most in at least 2 occasions (the 1st night where he said he was an idiot just when he felt like one, and the night where Harry talked to Sirius where he threw a badge at his head). Had Harry been more calm, their disputes would probably not have lasted as long. Ron saying Sorry after the first task is not because he wanted to be best friend with the popular kid, it's because he saw how Harry almost died, and decided that compared to this, their dispute was not worth it.\\
As for DH, Ron, hurt after splinching, anxious for the fate of his family, and slowly wore down by an Horcruxe, just left to cool his head (after Harry told him to leave I remind), the only reason he didn't came back 5mn later is because he was unlucky and instantly met Snatchers. After this, he tried to find them and would have found them sooner if not for all their protections, probably even the first night if Harry had not decided they had to moove right after.

​

I hate how these 2 events are enough to make him a betrayer, even when he :

- Sacrificed himself in PS to let Harry continue
- Organised a very illegal raid to break Harry out the Dursley in CoS
- Followed Harry in the CoS, and dug an opening for Harry even knowing there was a basilisk on the other side
- Put himself between Harry and Sirius Black in PoA, with a broken leg, and told him he would have to kill himself to touch Harry
- Followed Harry in the DoM to save Sirius
- Saved his life in DH
