** The [[http://amalthia.mediawood.net/ebooks/viewseries.php?seriesid=29][Aorist Subjunctive]] by Minisinoo (Harry/Cedric) is good -- I don't know if it's a little more romance-centric than you want, I wouldn't say so but everyone's definition of romance-centric is a bit different.

*** Funny story, I've skipped over reading Whispers in Corners multiple times even though I love crossovers, and slash pairing crossovers even more. I specifically remember reading the tag "medium Harry Potter" not just once, but multiple times, and scoffing because I didn't understand why the author would tag Harry Potter's size if all things. Why medium? Why not small or large? Never even considered the option of talking to dead people. /facepalm/ Amazing story though, everybody. I am glad you recommended it because I would have hated to miss out on such a great story because of my own idiocy.

** One of my favorites is a Piers Polkiss/Theo Nott one shot, G rated, called [[http://archiveofourown.org/works/1213036][The Housewarming Party]] by dracogotgame. It has Harry/Draco as a background pairing but is NOT drarry centric and doesn't focus on them much at all save for the fact the housewarming party in question is theirs.

** [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewuser.php?showuid=190368][ad astra]] writes great stories featuring LGBTQA characters and takes a lot of care in representing a large spectrum of sexualities. [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/viewstory.php?psid=329915][The Fred Weasley Memorial Scholarship]] is a good one, the first one in that particular universe of stories.

**** They'll be marked with *Era: Next Generation*. There's no way to filter on an author's page, but the [[http://www.harrypotterfanfiction.com/storytype.php][advanced search]] on the site (scroll down) has options to filter by multiple queries.
