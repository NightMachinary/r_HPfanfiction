Hello, I've been searching for a long while for a story that ships H/Hr. I read it a long time ago on the Porkey site. I now know the site is gone and there is an unofficial archive , but still I couldn't find the story. I'm almost 100% sure the story I'm looking for is What It Costs To Save The World by the author Ahn Na Blue. If any one saved it or has it, please let me know! It really meant a lot to me!

Please help! Thanks everyone !!


** I've been trying to locate this story to no avail here for the last hour or so. I did figure out its original URL as it appeared back in its heyday on portkey, however not even archive.org seemed to have it saved. Interestingly, I do seem to be able to access her other works. The problem might be that since this was an nc17 fic, it had an extra page for warnings of adult content, and the actual fic was not saved...? Maybe? I don't know. It appears as if the story was deleted off the site sometime by 2006 december (two years after its upload)... ?

The original URL directly to the fic was: [[http://fanfiction.portkey.org/story/3418]]

Ahn Na Blue's old Portkey account: [[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327034353/http://fanfiction.portkey.org:80/profile/11486]]

I'm so sorry I really wanted to help find it. I'll leave these links here in case someone much smarter than my humble self can actually make this dream come true! :(

*** Wow! Thank you so much for trying! Just clicking the old Portkey account was an amazing flashback to my teens! So close and still so far! :(

I found an author who wrote a sequel to that story and I reached out to him, he didn't saved it either... it's really the most bizarre thing! No one has it! First it took me a long time to even find the name of the author, and when I finally found the story, it seemed as it never existed!

Thanks so much for trying! I truly appreciate it! You have no idea! This was a story that stuck with me... and every couple of years I would return and read it. Clicking the name and not be able to read it... soul crushing! :'(

And it has to be a sign that I must persevere and have hope! I just heard the Harry Potter theme song out of the blue! (Fantastic Beast and Where to Find Them started on my tv!) :) You truly are the best!
