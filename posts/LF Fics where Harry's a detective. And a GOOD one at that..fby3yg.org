I'm looking for fics where Harry is a /really/ good detective.


** Check out Northumbrian's fics, auror/detective vibe

** Harry is a magical PI in Red Amber. Reads like a hard boiled thriller.

linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12896758/1/Red-Amber]])

SeriousScribble's /Unatoned/ on ffn also reads like a noir novel. Harry plays the role of Auror there.

  The last thing Harry Potter wants is to be lumped with a trainee Auror, especially not one that idolises him. As he guides her through the realities of being an overworked Auror and tentatively settles into adult life with Ginny, a dark plot brews on the horizon...

** ZenoNoKyuubi on FFN had one where Harry is a Sherlock Homes-esque character with Neville as Dr. Watson. I think he has since deleted it though you might be able to find a copy floating around.

  I've re-uploaded The Chronicles Of Harry Holmes so other people can enjoy this story. This story was written by Zeno-no-kyuubi, and he has given me his blessing/permission to re-upload this story. If you enjoyed this story check him out i'm only a humble fan. He has great stories similar to this like In The Mind Of A Scientist with the sequels branching out to SG-1, and ME.

** [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8262940/1/Unatoned][Unatoned by SeriousScribble]] Might be what you are totally looking for. It is less a detective Harry but more a bit obsessed Harry. Summary: Secrets of the war, a murder and a fatal attraction: After his victory over Voldemort, Harry became an Auror, and realised quickly that it wasn't at all like he had imagined. In a world where the death of the Dark Lord did nothing to change the fundamental problems, he's on his own, estranged from his friends and changed by a long two-year war that has left scars. Disillusioned with the people and the Ministry, he takes on a last case, but when he starts digging deeper, his life takes a sudden turn, and he discovers a fundamental truth: Nothing is more attractive than a dangerous woman ...

** There is a story called barefoot

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11364705/1/Barefoot]]

He's still a kid but has the ability to learn the history of any object that touches his bare skin. Ends up helping Dumbledore and the Aurors

It's also hilariously funny
