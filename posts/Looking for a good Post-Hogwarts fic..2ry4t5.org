I have been trawling FF.net over the past few months in order to get new stuff that I haven't seen in a while, namely good HP fics featuring HP characters after Hogwarts. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6479080/1/Soul-Thief][Soul Thief]], [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8514243/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Thin-Blue-Line][the thin blue line]] and very few others are all that I've netted so far. As you may have guessed, I don't really care about whether or not the epilogue is actually included here or what pairings, if any, there are. A bit of a gritty side to them would be awesome though.

Anyone got any good suggestions?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4152700/1/Cauterize][Cauterize]] should always be mentioned in that category.

*** Thank you. I read it years ago, but refreshing my memory has rarely ever been a bad thing.

** I can recommend the Asp at Hogwarts. It's posted here (in an odd format - as posts on a forum). It's very funny, very well written and has a lot of great world building thrown in. [[http://www.cosforums.com/showthread.php?t=110679]]

** Little0bird is honestly the best, though I'm not sure I would call it gritty.
