I've been writing bits and pieces of this plot bunny in the back of my head for about a year now, and I actually put words together and published a chapter. It's a short introduction to the story, and I'm going to be putting more of it together soon.

** Bunnies do not bite people! :( They are cute and have whiskers and hop and also do not even growl or anything!

**** Well, that was no ordinary rabbit! It was the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on. It had a vicious streak a mile wide. It was a killer! He'd do you up a treat, mate.
