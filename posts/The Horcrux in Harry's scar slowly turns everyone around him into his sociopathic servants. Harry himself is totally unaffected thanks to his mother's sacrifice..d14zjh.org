** Then the people who are more aware of their mental state might start to notice how Harry negatively affects them. The Harry starts wondering why certain people avoid him for "no reason" since he isn't actively doing anything bad.

Could be a very interesting story. Great idea! :)

*** Just finished reading this. Poignant and slightly chilling, a very well written one-shot. I'm interested to see if the author's written anything longer.

** Not Horcrux related, but this one takes a darker look and soul-bonds and how Harry might react to unintentionally changing the personalities of people around him.

*** Wow, looking at the summary and tags, I feel like I might need something light and fluffy to read afterwards, especially after looking up what the summary meant by "Stepfordizing sex". I don't normally like stories that take that route...

  Harry has low self-esteem and a penchant for sacrificing himself for others. How do you think it would really play out for him if he had instant soul-bond/ stepfordizing sex? Probably not too well.

** Not quite the same, but I think /Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin/ has the Horcrux turning Muggles into sociopaths around him. This is then why the Dursleys so strongly detest him and abuse him.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).
