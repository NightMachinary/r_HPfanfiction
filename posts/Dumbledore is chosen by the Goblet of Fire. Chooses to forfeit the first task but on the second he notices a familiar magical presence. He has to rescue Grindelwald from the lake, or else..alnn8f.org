** But wouldn't he be in breach of the magical contract if he forfeited the first task and lose his magic? (or die, I forget what is canon and what is fanon sometimes)

*** Like many things in HP (most things? everything?), the details and mechanics are somewhere between fuzzy and non-existent. I usually try to give the author the benefit of the doubt, or just assume it's an AU wherein "that's just how it works." Dumbles would certainly know how to participate in some minimally acceptable way.

**** I like to use 92% for most things. Not because it actually is, but it implies its a shitload and the fact that isn't a rounded up or down number gives credibility to the sauce. Use 92%. I guarantee that 92% of the people who uses 92% wins in life.
