Whilst i'm a huuggee fan of Fluffy HP/HG fics and there are loads of them. I'm wondering if there are any with a badass harry who does things his own way, or is at least given the devices too.

The only story i can think of is Unsung Hero. Which is in my opinion a fantastic story, are there are more?


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3951749/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Quantum-Leap][Harry Potter and the Quantum Leap]]. Can't remember quite how much H/Hr is involved but Harry is massively independent.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5721324/1/Rocking-the-Boat][Rocking the Boat]]. This one is complete and I think it has a sequel but its not complete and not been updated recently.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1594791/1/Backwards-Compatible][Backwards Compatible]]. To be honest, I can't even remember what this one is about exactly. I think its got what you are looking for.

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5786099/1/Cold-blood][Cold Blood]]. Another story that I can't remember what it's about but recall Harry being independent.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6517567/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Temporal-Beacon][Harry Potter and the Temporal Beacon]]. Likely abandoned, but one of the most unusually-executed time-loop fics I've seen, with much more long-term focus on single loops than is the norm in the genre. Harry and Hermione start out somewhat independent just by virtue of the premise, and grow moreso as the loop brings them closer together while increasingly pushing them apart from the non-loopers. Very good character development, lots of cool stuff happening, generally worth reading if you can stand some Ron- and Dumbledore-bashing.
