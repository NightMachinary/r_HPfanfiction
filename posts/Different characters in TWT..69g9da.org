Does anyone have any stories where non HP characters are either taking harrys place in the TWT or competing against him.

By other characters i'm talking from other movie/tv/anime/comic series. Like how would Superman deal with it (maybe dragons give him trouble due to inherent magical nature) or Ben Tennyson(from Ben 10) or Light Yagami (from Death Note) or maybe even Sabrina (From Sabrina) etc... How would such interesting characters with unique skills handle such challenges.
