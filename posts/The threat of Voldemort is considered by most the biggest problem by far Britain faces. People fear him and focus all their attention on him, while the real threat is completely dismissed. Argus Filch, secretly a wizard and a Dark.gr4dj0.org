** Voldemort fell to the ground dead, everyone at hogwarts was relived harry had done it.

a cackling sound was heard everyone looked to find argus filch was cackling 'Argus, why are you laughing' McGonagall asked confused. 'Tom Riddle had a great run, but now the real show is about to begin' Argus filch replied laughing louder and louder 'Mate, I think filch has lost it' ron whispered to nevile who was standing beside him everyone watched in horror as filch started coughing and transforming before a smiling younger version of filch appeared 'you have no idea how complicated aging magic is to perfect' filch responded to the confused Crowd. 'George Wesley you and your brother annoyed me the most, I would kill you but I feel your already suffering enough knowing your twin is dead' filch then smiled and flicked his arm reveling a wand 'cruico' he said pointing at george 'But, I would be remiss if I didnt give you a litle parting gift' he said before waving his wand and disapearing in a puff of smoke
