Looking for a fic with Harry as a werewolf. I don't want it to be all angsty, woe is me style. A bit of that at the start is okay. No I can choose when I transform through the power of self control bullshit.

I want him to face active fear and hatred because of his lycanthropy. Just a well written fic with werewolf Harry. Cheers.


** Hm. I'd have recommended "Were's Harry", but he can control his transformation there, if not because of self-control.

*** Oh well, I'll cope, chuck us a link. As long as there's an explanation I can accept I'm not too bothered by most plot points.

** Well, I'm writing one. Slowly. linkffn([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10641925/1/Lessons-With-The-Lycanthrope]])

Haven't updated in a while because I failed to plan ahead appropriately and ran head first into a brick wall, but I /will/ finish it.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter has spent two years carefully cultivating a persona of unremarkable mediocrity, melting seamlessly into the background. Now in his third year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he tries to maintain that facade, and for good reason. Unfortunately, a certain bushy haired girl has taken notice and proceeds to question his every move.

** This appears as a plot point in the very old story [[/spoiler][The Basement by Marz1]]. [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/1625069/1/The-Basement][Link]].

*** Why the fuck is everything in bold?

What the hell?

I would love to read it but I'm too busy not clawing my eyes out at the formatting.

**** It is only in bold for the first eight chapters. And the [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1625069/1/The-Basement][mobile version]] looks fine.

**** Make a bookmark with the URL being =javascript:= followed by:

#+begin_example
  x=document.getElementsByTagName("b");
  for(i=0;i<x.length;i++){x[i].style["fontWeight"]="normal";}
  undefined;
#+end_example

Your browser won't let you copy-paste the =javascript:= part in order to protect against malicious JavaScript execution, so you'll have to type that yourself. After that, clicking that bookmark should fix the page you're on.

** This one has got werewolf Harry: (Spoiler for first 4 chapters) [[/spoiler][The Song of the Trees]]([[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2859327/1/The-Song-of-the-Trees][Link]]) And it's definitely well-written.

** There's also the snippet series from Darklooshkin, where Harry and Hermione become werewolves. The plot twist might not be to your taste though:

*** Er, i would argue that the twist disqualifies these one shots from qualifying as werewolve fics. Though certainly they lose control.

**** True. Though they go through the worrying phase, and have to deal with the hostility from others, and the laws of the Ministry.
