I haven't read one in ages. I stopped reading because people write Hermione as overbearing. And I can't stand that.

No overbearing Hermione please. No know it all hermione please.

I prefer timetravel or dimension travel.

if Harry is over powered. Great. If he isn't that's fine too.

The pairings not my cup of tea but there's bound to be gems out there.

Thanks.


** I second this request, because I agree wholeheartedly with what you are saying:

It's either Hermione being dominant (not in the BDSM sense!) in a Harry/Hermione relationship (she treats Harry quite badly for a girlfriend and implies things like he wouldn't make it without her or that he's stupid etc. etc.) or it ends up bashing her (without ever stopping...)

I mean don't get me wrong I think both would need to change a little to make them really work as a couple, but they can do it and they of course share a rather strong bond already (Harry thought talking to her was more important than his date with Cho for example!)

** Well, canon Hermione is not a nice person. She is well-intentioned and compulsively helpful, but she is not nice or particularly inclined to keep quiet and keep her opinions to herself to spare anybody's feelings; and she does know a lot and likes to show it. So, yes, she's going to be at least somewhat overbearing and a bit of a know-it-all, especially if you want a Hogwarts-era fic. Otherwise, it wouldn't be Hermione.

The good news for you is that there is no shortage of fics featuring an OverPowered!Harry where Hermione is stripped of personality and agency and alternates between acting as arm candy, a cheerleader, a research assistant, and a damsel in distress.

*** I had fun reading that. For my sake, let's take another look at what over-bearing means. After a quick Google search: 'unpleasantly or arrogantly domineering'

You are not completely wrong though, in canon Hermione is a little over bearing and also a know-it-all. But what writers do is that they focus on these traits and amplify them unreasonably.

But what I do disagree on is the following. That for Hermione to have a personality she needs to be overbearing and know-it-all?

This is fanfiction. I am sure Hermione can still have a personality without those traits amplified unreasonably or say, even without those traits. And she could still be an amazing person. She could be intelligent without shoving it into people's faces every two minutes. Trying to 'tell' people how intelligent she is.

I came here for something different rather then the generic Hermione in the lamp. Rub it and all your problems are solved. I want to see Harry going about solving his own problems with Hermione's 'help'. I'd define what I mean by help but everyone here is smart enough.

Thank you for your reply. I tried to be as polite as I could be although this did rile me up a bit.

**** I am honestly sorry that I wrote my post in the way I had. I don't want to edit it, since it's now anchoring a discussion, but [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/523vr7/harryhermione_cant_believe_im_asking/d7hzo5e][I've clarified (I hope) my view of such fics in the reply to your sibling post.]] I don't have any excuse except frustration with the "nicified" portrayal of Hermione in the myriad Harmony, Heron^{1} , and Dramione fic.

Thank you for your politeness.

**** Hermione's part of the trio. They solve things together, so waiting for Harry to solve problems on his own requires problems that are out of Hermione's problem-solving range---problems that require strong character---or out of her view, when Harry's alone or isolated or refusing to share the problem. Hermione generally solves the intellectual problems (though for example, she solved the Basilisk too late, allowing Harry to discover it on his own).

Taking away Hermione's character flaws tends to make her a Mary Sue---it makes her a flat character. Too many fictions make her amazing, awesome, intelligent, etc. without flaws to complete her personality. She's resourceful to the point of exhaustion, principled to the point of irritation, and brilliant to the point of unintentional arrogance.

***** You are correct. It's up to the writer how he portrays her faults. Writers tend to overwhelm the readers with her faults.

In so many fanfictions she comes across as 'annoying'.

Anyways, I'm done. I just want a good fanfiction to read. She can have any qualities or flaws as long as the author doesn't make us despise her.

*** u/Ember_Rising:
#+begin_quote
  Well, canon Hermione is not a nice person.
#+end_quote

Yes in every-day cases, mostly in the first few books.

But what about her lying to help her brand-new friends after the troll incident? Or encouraging Harry before he faces Quirrelmort at the end of PS? Or befriending Luna despite their polar opposite personalities? Or conjuring a wreath on the Potters' grave in Godric's Hollow?

She's initially a child like the rest of the main characters; children are still learning societal norms and filters. That being said, I'm glad she's like this instead of the perfect angel like the parent comment bemoans.

Edit: I'm not disagreeing with the statement from an /in-universe/ perspective. If I hadn't read the books and instead went to school with a girl like Hermione, then yeah I would say she isn't very nice. But as a reader, I'm privy to uncommon circumstances (troll, third floor corridor, dumbledore's army, 2^{nd} wizarding war) where we see more of her personality and get a different, out-of-universe perspective on her character.

Edit 2: As I reconsider the statement, I'm realizing my initial reaction was defensive and I suspect others will downvote the parent comment for the same reason. Book-Hermione's complex, dynamic character is a tad overshadowed by Emma Watson movie-Hermione, I think.

**** Do you see me complaining about canon? I am talking about Harry Potter fanfictions.

Honestly I didn't know this was such an issue. Yes, I don't like overbearing Hermione. That is largely due to how writers choose to use it excessively in Hermione bashing. But I am willing to give it a chance as long as it's not unreasonable.

***** Well, if it helps, I can't think of a single fic that 'ships Harry and Hermione that bashes Hermione. Plenty bash pretty much everyone else, but not the OTP...

I mean, a Ron-centric fic that 'ships Harry and Hermione and bashes them could actually be pretty novel. ;)

I guess there's a more subtle form of bashing that involves Independent!Powerful!Harry condescendingly schooling AuthorityWorshiping!Hermione about Not Believing Everything She Reads or Questioning Authority (but not Harry's authority); I would view that as a form of bashing, even though it usually culminates in the best, most Harmonious marriage ever.

**** Perhaps I should have been more clear about the intent behind my post: I actually think that Hermione with her canon flaws is an interesting character to read about, and I think that people underestimate the importance of her flaws.

Hermione's social flaws are a part of a package, one which also contains the associated virtues, particularly her drive and outspokenness. Many writers remove that whole package before 'shipping her with Harry (or Draco), leaving behind the above-mentioned personality-free arm candy / cheerleader / research assistant / damsel in distress.

Other writers remove the social flaws and their consequences, but keep the virtues, ending up in Mary Sue territory, almost as bad.

Very few manage to thread the needle, having her organically grow out of her flaws, while maintaining her virtues.

--------------

On the specific canon examples, did I not say that she was helpful? And, you're right, she does develop more empathy later in canon. However, consider that when befriending Luna, she did not withhold her opinions about Luna's zoological musings; or that lying about a troll is not an act of "niceness" at all, but rather one of ruthlessness --- the premeditated sort, of which Hermione has more than Harry, Ron, and Draco combined.

  At the end of 3rd year, Hermione asks Harry for some help with starting an interesting project. If a dark lord's got a 50-year head start on you, maybe what you need is a little more time to even the playing field. AU, Timetravel, HHr, mild Ron bashing. Minimizing new powers, just making good use of existing ones.
