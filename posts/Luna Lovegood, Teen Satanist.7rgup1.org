Now I'm not taking this theory too seriously, because it's just something my friend and I were joking around about tonight while slightly drunk, but... what if (as JKR's subtle way of mocking the religious fundamentalists protesting her work) Luna Lovegood was actually a Satanist speaking in code? I mean, how hilarious would /that/ be, right? For the sweetest, most eccentric, and ostensibly /least/ threatening character in the series to actually be the one character who sees and talks with demons?

As I said, it's a joke theory, but there could actually be enough there to give it some slight weight. What if Nargles, Wrackspurts, Blibbering Humdingers, etc. (oh, and /especially/ Heliopaths) were all just her code names for various demons, while the Crumple-Horned Snorkack was code for Satan himself? What if the trips she and her dad took to Scandinavia (the home of black metal, mind you - in case you were looking for an excuse to see Luna and Xeno in corpse paint) weren't actually trips to go find animals but instead to commune with other Satanists as part of a Black Mass? And then, of course, we have her close relationship with the Thestrals - could they be considered the Horses of the Apocalypse?

So, at any rate, I'd like to invite people to take this idea and run with it, and I'd like to ask them if they've ever seen anyone write a fic playing around with this basic concept. (Also, I'm not a Satanist and mean no offense to the more religious members of this sub - I just think it's a really amusing notion to imagine Luna, of all people, engaging in devil worship. Just the sheer bizarreness of it...)

Also, since I've been called out by a couple people, let me clarify that by "Satanism", I didn't mean any of the atheistic organizations out there that call themselves Satanist. I'm referring to Theistic Satanism: the belief in and worship of an actual Devil. (Although I am not necessarily implying that those beliefs are real, or that such a being exists.)


** linkffn(Something Wicked This Way Comes) has Luna's family as a demon summoning one. Not exactly what you requested, but a fun one I reread on occasion.

*** Close enough to what I was asking for; Thanks!

...Although there appear to be multiple fics with that title (not surprising, perhaps, given its prominence in the PoA film). This looks like the one you were referring to:

  "Ah," replied Sirius. "That's a hellhound, isn't it."

  "Nah. Hellhounds have eight eyes, look more like overgrown welsh corgis. This is a bloodwolf. Entirely magical. Well, you going to try?"

** Have you checked out Hermione Granger, Demonologist? fflink(12614436)

Sounds like Luna would be a similar but even more hilarious focus character.

It would even give an explanation to Luna's mother dieing when she was experimenting with a spell and it 'went horribly wrong.'

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.

** I've seen a few where she has some sort of link with Lovecraftian stuffs. One where her family were from Innsmouth and had changed their name from Lovecraft to Lovegood to protect themselves~ I can't remember what it's called though.

*** No, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about her being an actual Theistic Satanist who believes in an actual existing Devil (which doesn't necessarily mean her belief is /true/, mind you). I have edited my original post accordingly.

I can't imagine Luna being involved in /any/ sort of organized religion. I wasn't talking about any sort of "Church of Satan", and I didn't have the LaVeyan style of Satanism in mind at all.
