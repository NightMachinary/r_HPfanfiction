I read against my nature and have re-read it multiple times and would love more in its style and depth.

And overall it's one of my favourites ever.

** I saw linkffn(12243730) recommended on another "similar to Against My Nature" thread on Facebook, more specifically on dealing with stopping poachers and magical black markets. I haven't read it personally, so I don't know how true that is or how well written it is.

  Charlie Weasley and Hermione Granger carry on an unsuspecting love affair in the aftermath of the second wizarding war. With the opening of a new dragon reserve on the horizon, a spin of corruption and malice is revealed, unearthing a vile ruse that threatens to tear apart wizarding Britain.
