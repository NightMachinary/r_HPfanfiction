Hi, im looking for fic I read few years ago buz cant find it now.

I remember snape was injured and harry took care of him some cottage, it was longish. He was also...blind for some time? Also it mixes to me with another fanfic which was quite Similar but I think harry had a lot of injuries on his body and a salve had to be applied quite often and it hurt as hell.

This is really vague and unsure description. Any ideas would be appriciated.


** The fic in which Harry was injured and Snape applied a salve might be either [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/1007156/chapters/1996974][No Good Deed]] by Maeglin_Yedi or [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/117380][The Same Coin]] by Meri, although I don't think they're what you're looking for.

There's also a fic in which Harry is captured and tortured by Bellatrix, and he's blind because she removed his eyes. Snape finds him and takes care of him, but there's no focus on healing anything except his eyes. [[http://drachenmina.insanejournal.com/112823.html][Her Eyes]] by drachenmina

** I could be wrong but this heavily reminds me of Emynn's [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/519404][The Interrupted Kiss]] Could that be maybe part of it?
