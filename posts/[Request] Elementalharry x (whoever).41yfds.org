Any fics where Harry has 1 or maybe 2 power of whatever elements (not a whole bunch) and preferably not godlike!harry and no H/Hr (IMO worst pairing)


** An oldie but goodie that I really enjoyed is linkffn(Elemental Genesis by Raven Dragonclaw).

It's AU, and doesn't involve the usual crew (just harry), but it's a great read. It is the first in a series that was unfortunately never finished, but still worth a read.

  Who is Harry Potter? A son, a brother, a good guy? No. A nephew, a friend, a hero ? Somewhat. Destined for greatness? Yes. A prick? Oh, absolutely. (Updated less often than once per month. Read at own risk. Author already aware of the problems of first year(s). Questions in disclaimers and ANs of chapters 1-40 do not need to be answered anymore.)

  A story about Harry in Slytherin house wielding the elder wand and the powers of an elemental. Features annoying Weasley's, an OFC, a flawed but good Dumbledore, an indifferent Snape and lots and lots of twists.

**** The second has horrific spelling and grammar for a good 20 chapters, just to warn you. It gets much better later on, though.
