*** Ah so you were the one that almost got Ron Weasley killed last week! If I were you, I wouldn't tell a soul, because apparently Potter's friend Granger is on a war path to find the guilty party as she calls it! Apparently Dumbledore should be giving Weasley 500 points for drinking the poison that was meant for him!

** Dear Goddesses,

I wish to remain anonymous.. but I am going through a lot this year. A LOT!!!! Let me unpack:

1. The whole school hates me!! Everyone, except two friends and some redheads, HATES ME!
2. I think a ghost has a crush on me.
3. I think I am going Cuckoo, because I keep hearing bloodthirsty sounds from the wall sometimes.
4. Malfoy is a (four lettered word)

Sincerely,

Sir Troubled a Lot

​

Dear 'Sir Troubled a Lot',

Sure you can remain 'anonymous'. Okay, lets go through each problem individually:

1. Everyone doesn't hate you! I assure you in +our Gryff+ your house tower you will have more sympathizers than +the Weasl+ the redheads and your friends.
2. Oh C'mon! Moaning Myrtle has a crush on everybody. I think it's narcissistic of you to think she only has the hots for you.
3. You should tell the teachers about this problem, this could be the solution to what is plaguing our school. I know they may not have listened to you +last year when you told them about the phil+ previously, but they will this year.
4. No one can do anything about that. You better beat the little shit in the next quidditch match +and catch the snitch+ i.e. if you play the game for your house team at all.

Lot of Love (see everyone doesn't hate you),

Goddesses..

​

PS: To the readers: Show 'ANONYMOUS' some love, tell him he/she is not hated HOGWARTS!

** "Dear Ask Hogwarts,

I am a double agent for two unnamed opposing powers (OP and DE), and I find my life to be very stressful. Not only am I expected to deliver correct information to my two demanding bosses, but I also need to activly bully the son of my first crush and childhood bully. The worst part is that I owe the kid a life debt, and I am activley leading him twards his death!

How do I tell my bosses to back off and also communicate support for the son of my childhood friend?

Hopefully yours,

Trouble Brewing"

** Dear Ask Hogwarts,

The Twins somehow used a Switching spell to put a sleeping fairy in my stomach. It'll wake up if I move or yell for help. I'm in the broom closet in the corridor outside the kitchens. Please send help.

Fairy Sure This Isn't Good
