Harry is somehow a peer to the others. Voldemort, perhaps feeling threatened by Harry & Dumbledore working together, breaks Grindelwald out of Nurmengard and the Dark Lords join forces. Or something.

Are there any good fics like this?

  Memories are tricky things. Sometimes, they cause us to lose nights of sleep. Sometimes, they bring light to darkness. Sometimes, they change the course of destiny. Set after the events of Fourth year. Follow Harry Potter as he finds his way across his strange problems, his notoriety and of course, the resurrected dark lord trying to kill him. AU. Powerful! Harry, Harry/Daphne.

** I had a writing challenge like this (crossover with Percy Jackson). No one took the challenge :(. Oh well, I might try writing it myself someday.

** Not quite what you're looking for, but in The Accidental Animagus, Voldemort teams up with an OC Dark Lady and Dark Lord, and Dumbledore allies with a powerful Light wizard from Australia to help in the war.

  Harry escapes the Dursleys with a unique bout of accidental magic and eventually winds up at the Grangers' house. Now, he has what he always wanted: a loving family, and he'll need their help to take on the magical world and vanquish the dark lord who has pursued him from birth. Years 1-4. Sequel posted.
