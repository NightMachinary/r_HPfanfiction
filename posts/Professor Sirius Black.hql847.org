After escaping from Askaban, Sirius needed to get into Hogwarts. He considered simply sneaking in, but then he remembered his old History Professor was a ghost. So, using his incredible talents of transfiguration, he disguised himself and entered Hogwarts.

When Dumbledore interviewed him, he used his other name. Thank goodness he and James legally created dual-citizenships under alternate names. As of that moment he was officially Professor Robert Adams, an American transfer.

** I'm not sure if Sirius can pull an American accent that doesn't sound too overly-exaggerated.

**** And supposing there suddenly are some American accent charms there... why would he like to pass as an anonymous American professor instead of an anonymous British professor?

****** Dude could have been homeschooled. Or he could say he was raised in [insert European country] by a muggle British father and a European witch. Attending Beauxbatons or whatever...

If Dumbledore can investigate Beauxbatons, he can investigate the American school as well.

The American thing seems like an over-complication, it the intention is only putting Sirius as teacher.

**** Dude was likely all involved in Black family inner affairs in youth, getting to know family business and history... IN uk

​

Got send to UK boarding school at 11

Spent like 3 years after fighting a war in UK

Then like 13 years in UK prison

​

It is highly likely he hasn't been to America like at all.

****** Well, yeah, but I'm just giving my opinion. If you are going to reinvent Sirius past to have spend some time in America... you can pull it off... If you just going to stay with canon background... it seems a bit off.

See it as an advice... as a write if I came up with this idea I would ask myself "Why American? Does it add anything to the story? Am I going to do flashbacks or give backstory about Sirius relation to America?" If it seems as an over complications I might as well leave it out.

​

As a reader... I would also ask myself the same question. And unless the AU stuff and background of it is established well before Sirius starts the American impersonation... I might feel that he was made American just for the sake of it... and might be pulled away from it.

***** True, although there are people who can easily imitate accents without meeting others, just hearing it and catching the differences can make them sound convincing. Besides, magic! Mr Crouch could speak over 200 languages, I'm sure he had /some/ help.

Besides, you've forgotten the American exchange student he was wound up with in his seventh year, Kaeleigh Mackenzie
