Re: flair... I guess this is sort of a prompt, but it's also kind of a discussion. I guess it's more like a prompt?

This seems like the kind of AU that can go all sorts of directions. Just off the top of my head...

- James was always Wormtail; he sells his wife and kid out to Voldemort; Peter and Sirius track him down for revenge; Peter really does get blown up because he's closer to James than Sirius; and then it's the stations of canon (so, Dumbledore /doesn't/ know that James is a Death Eater)
- Peter is a strange kind of Snape-type character but instead of Lily, it's James so he lures James away and turns him into a rat the night of Voldemort's attack; Sirius catches up with Peter but this time two rats run off; James kills Peter in rat form; decides to join up with the Weasleys in the hopes of eventually being discovered to be James and, failing that, eventually being taken to Hogwarts when Ron goes... I guess Sirius never breaks out in this version, but Harry might see James Potter on the map?
- Basically the first version... except somehow Sirius doesn't know Scabbers is James not Peter (the Fidelius is a further complication here)... maybe they (James and Peter) are both Death Eaters?

Actually, those were the only two/three versions that popped into my head quickly. Anyway, I guess my question with the first one is... how would Harry and Sirius do things differently, with the change? I think Sirius would be about the same behaviour wise as in canon but since no-one else knows James is evil (well, technically Snape and Vernon do), Harry would still have all these idealised views of James /and/ what I'll call an orphan complex viz his father.

The second one actually seems kind of intriguing... from James, Fred, George and/or Ron's' POVs anyway.


** you could have voldemort being more pissed at James due to James putting up a fight when voldemort shows up

Instead of killing him James gets the honour of being changed into a rat where he gets to witness voldemort killing his wife and son and then spent the rest of his life as a helpless vermin.

voldemort ended up geting blown up and Rat James watched as sirius handed Harry over to hagrid to chase down Peter. and decided he needed to get to sirius apartment so he could get sirius's help after sirius brings peter to Justice. on the way to sirius's apartment, he over hears a conversation about how sirius is in azakaban and decides to wait at the ministry and sneak him with a ministry employe so he can stay close to the news.

years pass and James slowly loses his sense of purpose and why he went to the weasleys in the first place.

he gets adopted into the weasley family as a rat and he is soon joined by another rat 'peter in disguise' -peter stays as percy's pet- James becomes rons pet, and ron is very fond of his cunning pet who always seems to know when he is sad, and some how manages to make most of the twins pranks on ron backfire James loses his sense of purpose and identity slowly falling into his role as a rat Until Ron heads to hogwarts and sits next to young harry seeing his own son reminds James of who he really is and it reawakens his spirit. while still stuck as a Rat James does his best to watch over Harry and Ron. Harry thinks ron's magic rat is great, as the rat seems to know all the hogwarts short cuts and secret tunnels.

Percy seeing how much harry loves rons rat decides to gift harry his rat when he gets an owl.

Year 3 happens the same, until Remus gets the marauders map and he noticed an extra name on it James fleamont potter.

the events happen the same until remus mentions there was one extra name on the map to sirius.

Peter and James revert to human. James who was forcibly changed into a rat is far more disoriented by being human again then Peter

James does want to kill peter with Remus and sirius But harry tells them, they need peter to go to azakaban so that sirius can be free.

as they go to leave the shrieking shack, James weakly tells remus to stay behind as its a full moon.

Ron helps carry a weakened James out while sirius brings peter. they go to dumbledore who gets quite the shock when he learns that not only is Sirius black innocent but James potter is alive.

Sirius black gets his freedom as peter goes on trial Peter escapes during the transfer to azakaban.

James wants to take harry away from the dursleys but he is too weak from his ordeal as rat which leaves him bed ridden for long periods of time, and dumbledore explains the blood protection Sirius says fuck that, the dursleys treat harry badly.

Dumbledore agrees that harry should live with his father and suggests grimauld palace due to sirius owning it and its already strong protections which dumbledore will strenghten.

James,sirius and harry move into grimauld palace once its set up with remus moving in a few weeks later when he realises that James and sirius need the help and support after the ordeals they went through

Ron and Harry grow way closer during these months as James who spent years as rons pet is very fond of Ron invites ron over almost every other day.

James is very aware of all rons personal issues, and takes him aside to have long conversations about them and ends up giving advice and tells ron he that its okay to open up about your friends about your worries and that he shouldnt bottle it up all the time.

Sirius and Remus end up teaching harry and Ron some spells James watchs from the couch and cheers them on and gives pointers

Harry does feel a tad Jealous of how well his father seems to know Ron. Sirius takes harry aside and mentions that James spent over half a decade as Ron's pet and that harry should talk to James about his feelings.

James recovery goes well and he is able to stay awake for most of the day now harry gets an invite to the quidditch world cup. James takes harry aside and tells him, he has no problem with harry going to the world cup with the weasleys but if harry wanted harry and James could go trip just the two of them.

Harry accepts the trip, and writes an owl to run thanking for the offer but that he is going on a trip with his father. Ron replies with a letter of encouragement and tells harry that he is happy for him.

James and harry go camping and connect James tells harry about his mother, his time as a rat and his pranks and time at school. James and Harry return from the camping trip with fondness.

at the start of the school year, Harry declares to ron and hermione that its time for the twins time as hogwarts reigning pranksters to end and that the golden trio will replace them as the premier pranksters. Ron tells harry to think of a less pretentious name and hermione mentions all the trouble they would be if caught Harry replies 'well we wont get caught'

a shadow war against the twins begins

the events of the triwizard tournement selection happen , only Ron who is far closer to harry due to James advice about opening up to your friends, sticks by harry with intense loyality and with a new found confidence in himself pushes him self harder in his studies and learning dueling.

Ron asks fleur out to the ball like he does in canon only this time he does not shout it, and is perfectly charming

fleur actually accepts his offer his stuns ron and he rushes to send James an owl asking for advice

Harry sends an owl to his father and sirius asking for advice on the ball. James sends him back an enchanted mirror. harry ends up taking luna who he accidently ran into and then accidently invited to the ball due to poor wording of his apology .

voldemort returns. the ministry denies his return

Dolores umbridge still goes to hogwarts but not as defense teacher as Sirius black takes the Job

sirius explains privately to ron,harry and hermione that while James can walk about normally now, he wouldnt be able to handle the stressors of being a full time professor but that he might show up for a surprize lesson in the future.
