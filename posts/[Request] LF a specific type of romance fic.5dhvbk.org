I'm looking for romance fics with a female protagonist who has a mentor-like relationship with an older man and then eventually there's romance.

Some examples: linkffn(The Never-Ending Road), many HG/SS fics, I can't think of a good example right now, and stuff like linkffn(Lily and the Art of Being Sisyphus) where Lenin is basically her mentor and at some point there will be romance.

I'm more specifically looking for a female protagonist (although thinking about it, anyone's POV is fine), but if you have a really good one you like with a male protagonist (so, slash), I'll read that too. I'm flexible. Also it doesn't have to have a lot of romance, like the examples I linked, as long as there's the intention of a romantic pairing.

For non-FF examples, something like the Immortals Quartet by Tamora Pierce, or the Poison Study series (at least the first book).

Thanks!

  As the unwitting personification of Death, reality exists to Lily through the veil of a backstage curtain, a transient stage show performed by actors who take their roles only too seriously. But as the Girl-Who-Lived, Lily's role to play is the most important of all, and come hell or high water play it she will, regardless of how awful Wizard Lenin seems to think she is at her job.

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. OotP - DH will continue in a separate installment. Future Snape/Harriet.
