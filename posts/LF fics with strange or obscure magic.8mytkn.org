Stuff along the lines of linkffn(The Life he Leads) or linkffn(Magicks of the Arcane)

Fics where Harry goes off and discovers new magic or gets really involved in study.


** This fic always gets linked on questions like these. I really enjoyed it in a gritty, didn't quite get off the ground sort of way.

  Falling through puddles and magic gone haywire are just a few of Harry's newest problems. With the Ministry falling apart and Voldemort unearthing ancient secrets, will Harry uncover the truth in time? Post-OotP.

** If you don't mind AUs linkffn(By the Divining Light; Conlaodh's Song) these have an interesting expansion into Old Magic. Try to pay attention to the explanations early on.

As I recall, some detail is involved in studying true Divination (not the canonical wishy-washy style) in linkffn(Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches - Revenge is Best Served Raw). Its certainly depicted in a more interesting manner than in canon, though it takes the the definition of "divine" in a broader sense. A bonus is that they have a very interesting teacher which better fits the "old magic" idea. Also, studying necromancy is also given a lot of detail, particularly regarding the relation to "death" and possibilities with Inferi.

And of course, there is the infamous linkffn(Harry Potter and the Boy Who Lived). Studying magic is THE story here, really, but the more obscure magic study does not come until year 3 and 4.

** The two you mentioned are two of my favourite stories! I like the approach to obscure magics in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin), although it isn't the primary focus. I know a lot of people don't like the First Year of that story, thinking it an info-dump, but I personally quite enjoyed it.
