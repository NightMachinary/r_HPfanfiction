We all know that they were the best of friends in Hogwarts and that they were very loyal and dedicated to one another but I do definitely wonder how they really acted with one another. Sirius strikes me as a hard person to get along with in a deep intimate way because he seemed so aloof in his young age and Remus? How on earth did they get him to open up to them the way he did? Then there's Pettigrew and Remus whom it's said the latter is responsible for befriending Peter and letting him into the group but it seems like Sirius may have treated Peter like crap and James just enjoyed having someone to be his cheerleader but that just can't be. I believe they had to have had meaningful connections but I can't think of what they would do to grow their bond together.


** I think the relationship between them were never so easy.

Sirius was actual very messed up and in a way James had to act as his moral compass, I know people often cast Remus for that, but Sirius didn't seem to care that much when Remus said thing, but if James told him he went to far or anything that would be a reason for Sirius to reconsider. A lot of responsibility for a boy that is just searching for his own.

I do think that they liked Peter in a genuine way as a best friend and tried to celebrate his victories with him, but probably never saw how it probably felt patronizing to him, because they were just always a bit more talented them him. I don't think Peter was stupid or talentless, but just always a bit outshone by his friends. And if they say stuff like grades and all that didn't matter, doesn't really help either.

*** Yes! Peter must've also shared their love for mischief much like how Remus subtly did. Peter seems like the friend who it's fun to make fun off and everyone laughs including Peter because he doesn't want to make things awkward. And I've always thought Sirius sort of worked on a hierarchy where James was at the level where he felt absolute respect but unintentionally put others on different levels of it. I don't think Sirius meant to be condescending but much like James it's undeniable that he grew up in a very wealthy family and they held themselves a certain way.

** In my interpretation of this, Remus liked to think of himself as just a sidekick to James and Sirius, sort of like Crabbe and Goyle were Draco's sidekicks. This was the role he wanted, but James and Sirius thought he was totally awesome in his own right and a full-fledged member of the group.

James and Sirius were happy to consider Peter a sidekick, although that wasn't the role Peter wanted. He kept his resentment bottled up for a long time. When the others drifted away from Peter after they graduated, that resentment came out.

*** Interesting do you think that Peter maybe thought of their ambitions to fight against Voldemort and the death eaters against what he was feeling and then as such they all grew distant? Or was it something else?

**** I liked the interpretation in The Shoebox Project, in which the Death Eaters recruited Peter by giving him the feeling of being included that he wasn't getting from his school friends.

***** Ooo!! That makes a lot of sense! It seemed as though there was a severe lack of communication of how he felt but Peter does seem like the type to bottle up his emotions.
