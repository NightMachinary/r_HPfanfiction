Are there any good Dark!Harry fics where Harry is a normal (albeit talented) student and Voldemort doesn't exist? No horcruxes, no boy who lived, just a curious boy dabbling in the Dark Arts and going on to become a dark lord.

  Sequel to "Souls Touch, and the Future Changes", authored by now-deleted account sunmoonandstars, which used to be me. Harry continues to struggle with adapting to and understanding the wizarding world, which increasingly seems to have backed itself into a corner by allowing rampant anti-Muggle belief to coexist with rampant ignorance of the Muggle world. Of course, there is also the problem of being a "Light" icon in Slytherin, not to mention the fact that someone seems determined to hamstring Harry's independence.

** Sorry; I know a few fics where Harry is an ordinary student and Voldemort is either nonexistent, dramatically less important, or has very different goals, but they're not Dark!Harry.

linkffn(Hermione Granger, Demonologist) sort of counts, I suppose, if you're okay with Hermione instead of Harry.

*** Thanks, but I'm not really into Hermione centric stories or any character other than HP for that matter (unless they're really good).

  Hermione was eight when she summoned her first demon. She was lonely. He asked what she wanted, and she said a friend to have tea parties with. It confused him a lot. But that wasn't going to stop him from striking a promising deal with the young witch. Dark!Hermione, Slytherin!Hermione, occult theme. Complete.
