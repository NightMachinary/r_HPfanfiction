[[http://www.reddit.com/r/harrypotter/comments/1s978g/what_is_your_unpopular_harry_potter_opinion/cdv8qhu][This thread]] (about unpopular opinions on HP) made me want to read an AU story where Ron dies in HBP after being poisoned. Or something similar, where a relatively major character dies at a believable point, such as [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3557725/13/Forging-the-Sword][Forging the Sword]], where Ginny dies at the end of CoS.

I'd prefer it to be something that drives the characters to be better, rather than an excuse for angst and wallowing and therapy.

The backstory is canon up to DH, then "faithful to canon but darker" after that. Then Harry, Hermione, Luna and Neville suddenly find themselves in an AU, which is where this story starts.

The characters (especially Harry and Hermione, and especially especially Harry) are incredibly broken, but in a very well-done way. It turns out there's a very good explanation -- over and above sheer angst at their losses and the responsibility on their shoulders -- for this, which I won't spoil for you.

** [Knowing that most people who vote on threads don't read their contents,] It amuses me that ~seven people upvoted this purely because they want Ron to die.

** I thought the same thing as soon as I read that comment! If I ever find time, I may write something myself, because I've got a bunch of scenes floating around in my head. And in the meantime, if you find anything yourself, OP, please share! :)

**** The Depths of Winter [[https://m.fanfiction.net/s/1728364/1/]]

Let me know how you like it. I'm not sure if it's exactly what you're looking for, but it's the only one I know where Ron is dead. He's already passed at the start... I just saw there was no recs and I figured something is better than nothing.

OMG I just realized you recommended sacrifices arc to someone a few days ago!! I love that series too!!! You didn't post the link so I posted it under you. Sorry that was off topic, but I love that series I always recommend it. So kudos on your good taste.

****** Yay! I hope you like the recommendation. It's no sacrifices arc, but it's still good. I feel like nothing really measures up with sacrifices arc though. I swear that author must be a genius.
