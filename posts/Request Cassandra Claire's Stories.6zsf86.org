Looking for any copies of any of Cassandra Claire's stories if anyone has any copies of them, please let me know! (Harry Potter related stories).


** Full disclosure that I never actually read Cassie Claire's stuff back in the day, so someone else will have to confirm if these are legit. But my brain latched onto this as my mission for the evening so here's everything I could track down:

Draco Trilogy: [[http://broomcupboard.net/fanfiction/DracoDormiens.pdf][Draco Dormiens]], [[http://broomcupboard.net/fanfiction/DracoSinister.pdf][Draco Sinister]], [[http://broomcupboard.net/fanfiction/DracoVeritas.pdf][Draco Veritas]], [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Cassandra_Claire/Fanworks][a couple oneshot AUs for the Draco Trilogy seem to have working links here]]

For the life of me I can't seem to find archived copies of A Season in Hell, After the Flood, Written, or Mortal Instruments.

*** Given that "Mortal Instruments" was a Ron/Ginny story (whose title she later re-purposed for her book series), I don't blame her for removing it from the internet, but I'm a little surprised that she didn't deny writing it. I guess it was too well-known for her to distance herself from it, though.

At any rate, somebody remembered enough about it to write up a plot summary on Fanlore. The other three stories don't even seem to have plot summaries available anywhere, but [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Cassandra_Claire/Fanworks][their original descriptions]] are also available on Fanlore. Apparently, "A Season in Hell" lived up to its name, because it featured a Ron/Squid pairing.

**** Yeah, considering there was enough drama surrounding her that she had to change Claire to Clare in the hopes of even slightly distancing herself from it, I can see total denial of "Mortal Instruments" doing more harm than good.

"A Season in Hell" is actually the one I'm most disappointed I couldn't find, because I remember people making Ron/Squid jokes and now I'm wondering if that was the fic that started them.

*** Thank you appreciate it! I'm not entirely sure how many fics she wrote in the Harry Potter universe, but if anyone knows any more let me know! I've heard about her constantly but never read any of her stuff either. (Wanted to give it a try).

**** The [[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Cassandra_Claire][fanlore article]] on her is a pretty good breakdown of everything she wrote and some background on its significance within fandom.
