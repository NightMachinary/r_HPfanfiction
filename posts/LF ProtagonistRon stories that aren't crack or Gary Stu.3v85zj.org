I'm looking for stories that are Ron-centric and that aren't just 'here's how Ron helps Harry deal with Harry's problems' - basically, it's not just a Harry-centric story written from sidekick POV. I'm not too bothered by when it's set (during or post-Hogwarts) but I'd prefer for it to not be a pure romance story, or to have any slash.

** "Speed". While Ron does help Harry, the story focuses on him, and his family - including his relatives in the USA.

** One of the best longer stories that comes to mind is linkffn(Choices by random-fruitcake04).

Another good Ron-centric story is linkffn(Number Games by jbern).

A very nice start to a story (pity it's abandoned) is linkffn(Through a Dark Mirror by deadwoodpecker).

I wrote a sympathetic, AU one-shot [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4038774/12/Adventures-in-Child-Care-and-Other-One-Shots][Ickle Ronnikins]] about Ron's childhood (penned after having received one too many bits of hate-mail over /Hallows and Pathos/ from H/Hr shippers who hated on my portrayal of "moRon"):

  Ron has the ability to see the future and he has the choice to either let it happen or change it for the better. Not Powerful!Ron. Pairings undecided as of the moment. Last chapter of 4th year now uploaded! Thanks for reading! Will continue until 7th year.

  Ron Weasley, an aging quidditch player in the middle of possibly the biggest game of his life, looks back at the places where his life changed for the better and the worse. Book 7 compliant but not epilogue compliant.
