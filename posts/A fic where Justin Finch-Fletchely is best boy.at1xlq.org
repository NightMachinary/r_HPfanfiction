** Best boy and best girl is also an anime thing. Basically a character who you like the most in show and think is the superior character over all. Example: Rock Lee is the best boy in Naruto

** I definitely read that as "good boy". Now I want a story about Finch-Fletchely, the lovable gryffindor pup who follows our hero's through their adventures.
