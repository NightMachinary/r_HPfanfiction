Honestly, when I filtered FFnet with her, almost all story I've found is mostly themed around romance (well, I usually only search for time travel story though). I want her with other role, like parent figure, rival, revolutionary or something else, just not a story centered around Hermione x Snape/sirius/remus/tom/voldemort/ron etc.

Well... I don't need her to be the main character, but a major character in the story is a must.


** linkffn(The Arithmancer by White Squirrel) -- Hermione is a maths whiz instead of a bookworm and ends up an Arithmancy prodigy. Later, she substantially contributes to the war effort.

linkffn(Applied Cultural Anthology, or by jacobk) -- arguably the best Slytherin Hermione fic

linkffn(Mudsnake by Flye Autumne) -- another Slytherin Hermione fic

linkffn(Family by Necessity by ArithmancerProof) -- Harry is de-aged and adopted by Snape to throw Voldemort off his trail. Hermione accompanies him.

linkffn(The Chessmaster: Black Pawn by Flye Autumne) -- the first in a series with lots of politics and the entire Trio in Slytherin

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] -- a Muggle AU where Hogwarts is a school for spies in training

Hopefully there's something here that you'll like!

  ... How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Cruciatus. Albus Dumbledore always worried about the parallels between Harry Potter and Tom Riddle. But let's be honest, Harry never really had the drive to be the next dark lord. Of course, things may have turned out quite differently if one of the other muggle-raised Gryffindors wound up in Slytherin instead.

  "Whatever you decide to say, make it believable." Hermione Granger learned to avoid the hard questions years ago. To her, Hogwarts is a relief: a new school with new people who have no knowledge of her past...only, they keep asking the hard questions. And it's getting harder for Hermione to maintain the lies. Featuring: Mentor!Snape and Slytherin!Hermione. Over 140k hits!

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9783012/1/Reign-of-the-Serpent][Reign of the Serpent]] is a massively AU fic. Salazar Slytherin is the immortal emperor of the wizarding world, there's an endless war between him and his former apprentice Grindelwald, and muggleborns are kidnapped and raised in the wizarding world as second class citizens at the first sign of accidental magic.

This, understandably, pisses off a young Hermione Granger.

(Sadly, this fic is just at the beginning of year 2, but frankly I love the world building and character changes so much that I forgive it for that.)

** Here are some that haven't been linked already, in no particular order. (*Edit:* Formatting fixed.)

- linkffn(Hermione Granger and the Perfectly Reasonable Explanation by Robin.Drew): Hermione as Rational!Protagonist; is what HPMOR /should/ have been.
- linkffn(Mudblood Mistress I & II by JoseHood) and sequels is another Slytherin!Hermione fic that isn't romance-focused. Not as good as /Applied Cultural Anthropology/, IMO.
- linkffn(Kick in the Arse of the Wizarding World by Alrissa): Future!Hermione sends herself a care package back in time.
- linkffn(Palimpsest by Larry Huss): Future!Hermione sends herself a telegram back in time.
- linkffn(Amends, or Truth and Reconciliation by Vera Rozalsky): Post war, Hermione dealing with wizarding politics. It has a number of romantic subplots, but they are not the focus of the fic.
- [[/u/Starfox5]]'s fics tend to have an ensemble cast, but Hermione often gets the plurality of the action.
- [[https://www.portkey-archive.org/story/7700][/Hermione Granger and the Goblet of Fire/ by Couldson Eagle]]: Hermione's name comes out of the Goblet in place of Harry's. Could be edited down by about a third without losing anything, and the ending is a bit fixfic, but I think it's an excellent exploration of how someone not as brave or as athletic as Harry but more diligent and better at magic would handle TWT.
- linkffn(A Pound of Flesh by Thomas M Riddle) and sequel: Hermione resurrects Diary!Riddle. Contrary to what one might think, this is /not/ a romance fic at all.

** I'm writing one; linkffn(The Parselmouth of Gryffindor). A light-hearted, hopefully-clever, oft-preposterous romp starting in First Year and currently in the middle of Fourth, with the point of departure that Hermione was born a Parselmouth too. No shipping and practically no Stations of Canon past First-Year.

  Hermione Granger was born a Parselmouth. She arrives at Hogwarts with less trust in authority (after all, muggle science somehow missed snake sentience), and a mission to prove snakes are people too. And Goblins. And Acromantulas. And... oh Merlin. Hogwarts isn't prepared for this, the Wizarding World isn't prepared for this, and Voldemort is *especially* not prepared for this.
