Does anyone know if there are audiobooks of HP fanfiction? I know that the app can read it to you but it is the computer reading and is not so easy to listen to.


** search for 'podfics'. this is when people do readings of fanfics, like audiobooks!

** I use an app called Castbox. It's has a ton of podcasts including fanfictions! There's one for Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality!

Here's the link: [[https://castbox.fm/va/412879]]

** If you have an Android you can get @voice for free. If you have an iPhone I use VoiceDream reader. I use these toread all my fics to me via robots. You can import ebooks you download from ficsave.xyz and it reads it to you.

You need to spell out a few words to correct pronounciation. IE: Slytherin being pronounced with a hard Y. However, it gets most words right straight off the bat. Even the spells are almost always right.

Sounds a bit robotic but a lot better than I thought it would. It let's you adjust the WPM to read way faster than audiobooks as well.

** If the story is on fanfiction.net, you can use the FFN.net app which has a text-to-speech function. It's not perfect but it gets the job done pretty well.

Sometimes the AI will speak out the author's pagebreaks, and that gets sort of annoying (like one story had hphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphphp between every scene)
