Maybe they were too curious about magic so they started getting into it until they're trapped. Maybe it's like drugs or something but I'd like to see a story where they try to stop, not quickly but slowly and with progress


** I seem to remember a story where Hermione was using dark arts while trying not to get corrupted but was anyway. Slowly and always thinking a little more would be ok. I think she was even "motivated" by someone to continue on her dark path for nefarious purpose.

*** linkffn(Cloak of Courage by WendyNat) follows this kind of story, with Hermione trying to resist the pull of the dark arts, but there are various plots to get her to succumb anyway. She has recurring, addiction-like thoughts about giving in to it.

  AU. Harry is shunned not only Ron, but Hermione as well after the Goblet of Fire incident. Ginny befriends Harry and history changes. Future Dark!Harry Dark!Ginny pairing, extended summary inside. Note from 2012: I'm not a huge fan of this story now, but leaving it up for historical purposes for those who do enjoy it.

**** I would say so, I rather liked it. It kind of reminded me of Duality if you've read that one at all. The characterization isn't great but the plot is pretty decent and the writing is tolerable. It is one of the better Harry/Daphne's out there. It is abandoned however, but what is there is worth the read.

  It is a man's own mind, not his enemy or foe, that lures him to evil ways. Harry is prepared to do anything to protect those he still has left, even use the Dark Arts extensively if he has to. The question is; will he be the same person in the end as events, and a shadowy figure risk to change him? And how does the eccentric Daphne Greengrass fit in? Sixth year. HP/DG

** The Stormseeker Saga by Keolah contains a story like this, though it is only somewhat Harry-Potter-related. It is linkffn(8182465) /Stormseeker: Legacy of the Shapers/, which is set after the story in which the time-travelling main character Lexen went to the world of Harry Potter and took on the role of Harry (who was dead). That time, he gained a normal drug addiction to magical Dream Sweets.

In /Stormseeker: Legacy of the Shapers/, Lexen pops into the world of Harry Potter to rescue Sirius Black, then travels with him to the world of Geneforge (from an RPG video game). Eventually, due to absorbing the canisters around the place that boost his Shaping powers, Lexen gains a mad lust for power similar to a dark magic addiction. At one point, Lexen even turns on his allies, who are forced to fight him.
