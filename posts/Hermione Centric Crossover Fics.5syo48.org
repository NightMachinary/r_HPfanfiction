I havent read a HP fic in quite some time but i gotten rather in the mood for HP crossovers that center Hermione. I do not care what other fandom as long has it centers Hermione. I'm particularly in the mood for some confident, and powerful Hermione. No rapes, no clingyness, no Hermione being there for the sake of romance. No Harry/Hermione, or Ron/Hermione please.

Dramione is accepted but not really in the mood for it. If Hermione is paired with a character from the other fandom that is fine too.


** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6055799/Katie-Macpherson][Katie Macpherson]] is a new author who likes to write HP crossovers. Her stories are generally good, but she has to yet finish one novel-length fic.

Hermione is the main character in "Child of Light", linkffn(11052921), a HP/Avenger crossover, and "Wild Flower", linkffn(12229585), a HP/GoT crossover.

[[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-26436/DianeCastle+The+League+of+Extraordinary+Women.htm][The League of Extraordinary Women]] is a multiple-crossover with an almost canon Hermione. The story itself is great, but has canon pairings. The author [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/AuthorStories-22082/DianeCastle.htm][DianeCastle]] is one of my top five, as she specializes in crossovers and excellent world-buildings. Many have recommended her [[https://www.tthfanfic.org/Story-30822/DianeCastle+Hermione+Granger+and+the+Boy+Who+Lived.htm][Hermione Granger and the Boy Who Lived]] on this sub.

  Kicking ass and taking names, that's what Natasha Romanov did for a living. She doesn't trust and she doesn't look back. Until one night when a blonde man with a sharp wit catches her attention. Little does she know that he will provide her with a completely unexpected surprise...a beautiful baby girl named Hermione. Life as the Black Widow just got a lot more complicated.

*** Seconding HG:BWL.

McPherson... Well, I've just given /Child of Light/ a try. While not quite /bad/, it feels a bit unfocused and has pacing issues. The author inserted a large number of other divergences and too many extraneous characters to no clear purpose. (What are Regulus and Sirius doing there?) It took 23 chapters, and Hermione's cohort are finally getting to Hogwarts. Take this comment as you will.

** linkffn(Hermione Granger: Agent of SHIELD) and sequels; it's been a while, so I don't remember how much I liked it, but it's in my collection.

linkffn(The Stark Effect by NexusNebulous): quite amusing, but it's not clear where it's going.

  In which the girl who might have been Hermione Granger is raised as Tony Stark's daughter, and the world is that much closer to imploding spontaneously. One know-it-all Stark was enough, thank you. Expect chaos.

Most are complete, only one or two Sherlock fics are not (but they're pretty recent, I hope they get updated eventually). These are the one I read and liked, I might have one or two more, but I can't remember them. I like the magic side with Hermione/Loki, and the intelligence/mind side in Hermione/Sherlock. In some of the Hermione is a bit OOC, but it's a crossover, who cares.

Oh, and EDIT : [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11172605/1/Sum-of-Us]] Hermione/Sherlock, crime case, very good.

** These are crossovers with Supernatural. The first one linkffn(10076491) is a oneshot that leads to a longer story that unfortunately isn't finished yet, but I'm really hoping it will be, She hasn't updated in about a year, but the last update took about that long too, so I'm hopeful. Anyway, this is the longer story linkffn(10638344)

  Continuation to Hermione's Angel. Hermione finds herself dragged into a new world, with a new conflict and new enemies. But hopefully, new friends and family too.

  You can't expect someone whose been tortured by Bellatrix to be completely sane. Even if her hallucination wears a trench coat. Sequel "The Family Business" now up.
