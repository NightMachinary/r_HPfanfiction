I've never written a multi-chapter fic before so I'm giving it a bash (because if you can't write in lockdown then when will you ever have the time?)

It's a very fluffy tropey Jily fic that's just focusing on the summer between 6th and 7th year. If you fancy giving it a read, it's called Lily Evans Definitely Has a Boyfriend on AO3!

I hope that link works! Cheers :)


** The first part (the icicle bit) has a weird flow to it. Too many short sentences with changing speakers. The balance between dialogue and narrative seems off and is better later on.

As for the plot, it is difficult to judge where things will go from here on (or rather the way it will lead to Jily), so I can't really say much about that (yet).

  Lily really wished she understood what possessed her to say what she said on Monday 25th July, 1977. She wished she could find any way of justifying why she opened her mouth and said a sentence that would change the course of not only her summer, but her entire life. She wracked her brains in the following months, running the conversation over in her mind, trying to find a logical explanation for why her brain led her right to those words that she couldn't take back. But time after time, it was no use. She just said it. And that's how it all began.Canon compliant (mostly), cliche and fluffy, fake relationship. Jily above all else.
