Ideally, this takes place in a mild au where Barty Crouch Jr escaped from prison through other means or he's still at large and Neville is better friends with the trio.

Fake Moody(who Harry recognized on the map) idiotically decides to get the fourth year class to attempt to use the Killing Curse, at once on him. When it came to the Dark Arts, Barty Crouch Jr believed in a practical approach. After all, a bunch of fourth years wouldn't even give him a nosebleed. You have to mean it after all.

But, Neville Longbottom, has always meant to see his parents torturers brought to justice. He definitely wants them dead. Including Barty Crouch Junior.

Ron Weasley almost lost his sister, once, and his uncles. He knows that as the best friend of the boy who lived, he'll probably need to mean to kill someone. He's been told from Bill and Charlie who killed their uncle's, and Barty Crouch Jr is at the top of his list.

Hermione Granger, confident in her intelligence as the brightest witch of her age, and harboring deep resentment for the years of bullying she had to put up with because of her knowledge (and perhaps her heritage if we're following cursed child). She has definitely has enough hate and anger built up to want someone dead, especially towards a certain death eater who was particularly violent towards muggleborns.

Harry Potter, the boy who lived. The boy who's first memory is green fire and a woman's screams for mercy. A boy who wants nothing more than Voldemort gone, and his followers along with him.

"Moody" dies, and the fallout from this sends the entire tournament into a tailspin.


** Alternative take: Moody is forced by Dumbledore to do the same lessons for all four houses, so he has to offer the AK lesson to the Slytherins. No big deal, they're still just kids and won't really be able to harm him, right? But one of them, thinking of getting a reward from their parents for taking down the infamous Mad Eye Moody, decides to throw in a Blasting Curse, figuring he wouldn't notice it amongst all the failed Killing Curses. Of course, the real Moody would be paranoid enough to pick it out and avoid it, but Crouch is overconfident and gets hit by it.

*** Right? It's so outrageous from the first work, it's like an instant "hah! That would never work". But the more you think about it, the more it makes sense.

**** I mean it would be in line with what Crouch had already taught, experiencing what it feels like to be under the imperious curse, it just seems a little silly that they would be allowed to cast it on the teacher. Maybe as part of a challenge that Moody thinks up?

** Also Parvati and Lavender want to kill him because they are pissed by the fact that he called them out while reading the horoscope under the desk.

Dean wants to kill him for being a Chelsea fan.

Seamus thinks he is an OK guy.

** The sequel involves the entire Gryffindor fourth year class being thrown into Azkaban for casting an Unforgivable, so Dumbledore and the real Moody have to go through wacky shenanigans to break them out.

*** I need to know what kind of shenanigans Dumbledore and Moody get into to break them out. Like do they try wearing long black cloaks pretending to be dementors? Sneaking a key or something in a cake? Do they shrink themselves and have to climb up a large tower as mouse sized humans? Do they enlist Remus, Sirius and McGonagall? Do they enchant a car to fly and do a Weasley styled rescue? Are there fake mustaches involved?

DO THEY TRY A GIANT SLIDE AND TRAMPOLINE?!?!

Damn I kinda want to write this now.

** Or.....

Have Fake Moody challenge the whole class to kill him before the end of the school year to get a good grade, kinda like Assassination Classroom but instead do the world blowing up Voldemort returns

** After that particular class, Harry gets suspicious and checks the map. Barty x crouch. Tells Hermione and Ron, get overheard by Neville who recognizes exactly who it is. Next practical dada class, "Moody" gets hit by four different AKs.

This is assuming Hermione does not get overheard when she looks up the name in the Library.
