The wizarding world seems to have a certain culture and architecture seems to be one of them. For one, the Weasleys basically have an almost rundown and broken house held up by enchantments, and is literally called 'the burrow'. The Lovegoods house is a long black cylinder, basically. The Blacks have elves mounted on their heads and for a family with so much bravado and pride in their blood status, it's a bit suspicious why they're in a Muggle compound. The Malfoys live in a grandiose manor and they're so caught up in pride and grandeur, they have peacocks in the courtyards. An odd laugh out loud moment for me. The Potters seemed to be a pretty normal family, though. The MacFusties live on the Hebridean Islands and guard some dragons. Pretty cool scenery if you ask me.

I can see houses that make Lewis-Carroll levels of nonsense. You might enter the house through the main door and wind up on the ceiling unless you do a sequence much like going into Diagon Alley, also a handy safety precaution. Or there's castles (the Weasley twins mention some families living in castles in COS) and that's a very grandiose thing. Or you might just about start living in a series of connected caves and call it a house, maybe some goblins are the neighbors and you are at constant odds with them. A house that can only get you access whhe you pass through twin trees and anything else doesn't work.

What are the best wizarding homes (please, aside from Harry living in his trunk), you've seen?


** Don't forget that they have "camping tents" that are complete homes, with multiple bedrooms and running water. There seems to be very little limit to what can be done to personal space with magic.

Headcanon is that there was a house once with a room dedicated to potion making and a fantastic garden full of magical plants.

** There's thousands of shrunken and abandoned medieval villages throughout the British Isles. These erstwhile population centers became abandoned for a variety of reasons.

Certain methods of agriculture have become obsolete over the millennia as soil conditions have changed. Sometimes a village would discover that they were no longer able to grow the crops they needed, and the villagers would set out for more suitable farming lands.

Coastlines have shifted over the millennia, causing some seaside villages to be lost under the waves.

Population centers tend to gravitate towards trade routes and trade hubs. The advent of railroads presented a change in some of these trade routes, causing some villages that had been built around canals to shrink as the population moved towards the railroads.

The bubonic plague exerted immense pressure on the society of the day, wiping out entire villages and causing survivors to flee.

Wizards wouldn't be as susceptible to these issues as muggles. Apparation, brooms, and the floo network render the issue of distance moot. A wizard could easily live hundreds of miles from his place of work, or sell things door-to-door, or perhaps, grate-to-grate. A wizarding ancestor living through an epidemic would have access to a variety of medicinal herbs and potions that his muggle neighbors would not. Herbology can probably wrest productivity out of even the most inhospitable soils. A few well-placed charms could probably save the ground that a house is standing on in an eroding coastal village.

I like to picture the average wizard living in a remote local that was abandoned by muggles centuries ago.

Wizarding society strikes me as generally conservative. They seem to look backwards at an idealized past. They wear robes, they fly on brooms, they write with quills. I imagine that the average wizard will want to pay homage to the eras of legends and heroes. There are two eras that come to mind, the time of the ratifying of the Statute of Secrecy, roughly the Tudor/Elizabethan period, and the time of Merlin/the Hogwarts founders, roughly the Anglo-Saxon period. So the average wizard probably lives in a house that has this neo Beowulf/Tudor thing going on.

*** It'd be quite neat to have a few wizarding homes out in the ocean, that used to be coastal homes, and are now on a little wizarding island. Or magical lighthouses.

** I like the idea of houses like in the Fable Series, specifically the one you find the Hammerthyst in at Oakfield. Beautiful, idyllic, and hidden behind something that needed to be appeased in order to gain entry. Or perhaps like the one in Bloodstone, equally beautiful, idyllic, and hard to enter, but the moment you betray the trust of the house/its inhabitants it turns into a nightmare.

********** No sweat. I have a sneaking feeling JKR went particularly cliche on Scot names, it's no wonder they all kinda blend.

Also, there's a sad lack of Hebridean Blacks in canon and really we could use more dragonskin and dragons in general.

** In my fic, Barty Crouch's ancestral home was reduced to a crater in the first war, and so he created Crouch House, situated at the bottom of that crater out of sheer spite. It even looks spiteful, this squat little black building like a bunker with a fringe like an emo teen. Upside down crennelations with reversed gravity allow defenders to fight off attackers as though it was at the top of a hill.

** One of the more recent fics has Harry adopted by an OC who used to be part of the Order. He lives with her in a mansion that's like Grimmaund Place; on a normal street but massive inside.

It has numerous rooms and a living forest.
