I'm reading Nocturnus by In_Dreams and it's so good. I really like the bond between Hermoine and Draco and I am interested in how it develops. But also I'm impatient and bored with the corona stay home stuff, soooo, does anyone have any good recs for a long, complete story where they're “bound” by magic and have to grow into their feelings for one another and what their bond means. They don't have to have any animosity towards each other or anything (there's not any in Nocturnus), willingly bonded is okay. I'll link Nocturnus in the comments for anyone interested. Thanks all!

** I've been reading Dramione for a longish time (4? 5? years-ish) so here is my master list!

- Isolation by Bex-Chan, Rated M, Complete. FFN (This is a Dramione CLASSIC and a must-read!)
- What the Room Requires by Alydia Rackham, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- Bathroom Scene Redux by logicallylivid, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- I Spy by gnrkrystle, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Silencio by Akashathekitty, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Five Days by RavieSnake, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- And We All Fall Down by Rumaan, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- The Fallout by everythursday, Rated M (?), Complete, I will attach below a link to a google drive folder of all of her amazing works (Check out Parade of the Sun as well) because it is not currently on any sites!
- Eight and Eighth by Marmalade Fever, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- The Eagle's Nest by HeartofAspen, Rated T, Complete, FFN
- Covered in Crimson by cklls, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Only a Pretense by galfoy (Now WickedlyAwesomeMe on FFN, I guess she changed her username) , Rated T, Complete, FFN
- The Boy in the Hammock by galfoy (This one is by galfoy? I'm not quite sure about the whole username thing...), Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Static by galfoy, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- Turncoat by elizaye, Rated M, Complete, FFN
- We Learned the Sea by luckei1, Rated T, Complete, FFN

- Abyss by zarah joyce, K, Complete, FFN
- After the Battle by WaitTilMyFatherHearsAboutThis, M, Complete, FFN
- Amortentia by oliviebleak, Rating depends on Chapter, FFN (This is a collection of one-shots and multi chapters, you have to go chapter by chapter to choose which chapter you want because not all are dramione. I would recommend The Real World:Hogwarts (Series) and Epilogue:Drunk Rewrite (Oneshot) because both of these are hilarious!)

- The Quidditch Bet by rumaan, T, Oneshot, Complete, FFN

Anyways, this was very long but I didn't even begin to cover the beauty that is Dramione fanfics. These are just some of my favorites. If none of these seem to be what you're looking for, I would suggest heading over to dramioneasks on Tumblr or dramioneficindex on Tumblr (you don't need an account) and either asking or searching through tags or on dramioneficindex, hitting ctrl F and plugging in a key phrase! Hope this helped :D

** Hunted by Bex-Chan is also good! It's a bit dark at times but I liked it. Read it after Isolation, which is my fav, but Hunted is also worth your time. :)

** The Eagle's Nest by HeartOfAspen on fanfiction.net is like that. After the war, everyone returns to Hogwarts to redo the year they lost. They all get resorted into different houses. It's a Dramione story, long, and as a warning, it is rated M. I enjoyed it though.

**** I probably will too after I'm through with the one I'm on now. Isolation is my absolute favorite Dramione fic. They aren't bonded by magic, but they are forced to live with each other. Highly recommend it if you haven't read it.

****** I feel that. I like the really long ones too and the Dramione story lines are my favorite. When I get really bored, I write my own and get lost in my own story ha ha. I don't have plans to put them up on any sites, but it's a fun way to kill time.
