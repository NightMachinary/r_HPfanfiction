** It was a few years back, maybe 2011? It was a bit before I started reading fanfiction, so I don't know the exact time. It was pretty much ff.net saying that anything MA, so basically lemons, was not allowed on the site. Lots of people were pissed off about that as it is, but what made it worse was that stories would be deleted with no notice to the author. Some people completely lost their stories because they didn't have any backups. It didn't last very long, was a horrible failure as shown by the shitload of easily found and popular stories written before or during this time period that contain lemons, and is now ignored almost completely by the site. Unfortunately, some authors still fear the .001% chance of their fics being deleted enough to butcher their stories and post non-altered editions elsewhere.

*** I think this move made a lot of authors lose faith in the ffnet admins, which is why websites like Ao3 and other archives grew in popularity in the aftermath.

*** Goes back way further than 2011. I've been reading since 2002~ish, and there was an initial purge in 2003~ if I'm remembering correctly. I took a break from FF around 2008, and up until that point any kind of explicit sexual content was removed from the site regularly.

I came back to FF in 2013, and was completely /shocked/ to find sexual content on FFN. Their old policy practically required authors to maintain two version of their fics, one on FFN for the publicity (best place to find readers), and one on personal sites/other archives so they could actually write what they wanted to write.

** There is also the possibility of [[https://archiveofourown.org/][AO3]]. I'm not sure how much adult content is found there, but with more than 66k fanfictions it should be possible to find a few gems there. ;)

(And there is a search function)

*** AO3 is near useless because it has the least reliable search system out of all the big fanfic sites. Filter for F/M pairings? You'll have Luna/Neville as side characters mentioned once where Harry is paired with Draco, Lucius and Voldemort (or something like that) for the actual story in 99% of the results. Looking for a story staring Severus Snape? Select him, and you'll get 10000 stories where he's a side character and Harry is the main one. Add "-Harry" to your search terms? You just removed all stories in the Harry Potter fandom.

FFnet may have its problems, but at least the search isn't pants.

**** I had never run into this problem since I only ever read Harry/Draco fics and the search works great for that. It's why I love AO3 actually. But I can see what you're saying. Makes me think they should add a primary/secondary relationships and characters options and allow people to search those. I imagine it would be very useful for other people for sure

Waaaaah?

The Ao3 search is the most useless pos I've ever had the displeasure of using. Finding a specific pairing is practically impossible when /everyone/ tags their stories with every character tag they can think of, in order to increase views.

****** I guess it depends how you search. I tend to search for themes or the like more often over specific pairings all the time. And I've found that on FF.net people don't always tag their stories with pairings at all (at least in some of the fandoms I'm a part of).

I also like the sort by comments/kudos feature as that way I can be more sure to read the best few stories as opposed to having to read ten mediocre fics before getting to one I really enjoy.

It's not great though, you can only search the titles/description and it doesn't give you any usefull information about the fics.

*** I think you're mistaking a service that is privately-owned yet very popular with a public resource. They aren't suppressing free speech by deciding to enforce the standards that they posted. Those who have used their service can also post the same material to similar services without fear of arguments about exclusive rights; in this way they're more libertarian than any publishing house.

It is a knock to their reputation with the users for them to bring down the hammer after being lax in enforcement for so long. People were assuming that what they'd posted was acceptable since it had been left unchallenged.

It's a dick move, but they're fully within their rights. This is why I started posting my stories to multiple sites.
