Neither do the Death Eaters for that matter. Maybe its because I'm someone who's lived a much worse life than some of the characters, prior to the war, but Voldemort as a villain never felt threatening to me.

Sometimes the story also didn't make sense as well.


** Voldemort was scary when I was a kid. I will never forget how scared I was when I read "Flesh, bone and blood" for the first time, and how exciting it felt to finally have Voldemort back in the story (for real this time). But as I grew older, he became a sort of cartoonish villain? And the fact that the Order was, literally, useless doesn't help to build him up as a real threat.

** I think the trouble is a lack of scale, in the second war anyway. Sirius told Harry that in the first war Voldemort had vast armies at his command which would be scary, but second time round it feels like it's just him and a couple of dozen Death Eaters. Even though he wins the recruiting war with the giants, as far as I can recall we don't see them in battle either.

*** There's a few at the battle of Hogwarts, but just like everyone else they don't actually influence it.

** I agree. There's nothing compelling about him as a villain, he is like a cardboard cut out "generic evil do-er".

Yawn.

*** The thing is, half of what Voldemort does is outright copied from the Thrid Reich. Umbridge's committee, the Snatchers who actually kill, Azkaban as concentration camp for a racial minority arbitrarily blamed, the Order playing "BBC Radio for free Europe" and so on. It is neither cartoonish nor very generic.

The narrative however completely ignores those parts in favour of Horcruxes.

** Its hard to make Voldemort feel like a threat when he did nothing wrong.

***** Ah, thats disappointing. I thought you mightve had a really unique perspective on Voldemort, possibly along the lines of not getting the help he needed or the hugs he truly wanted.

****** That perspective is pretty common nowadays. Traditionally, societies judged trangressions on the eye for an eye principle. Nowadays we deal justice through more the idea of "making the victim whole, rehabilitation, safety to society as well.

An idea gaining transaction, but has really always existed is punishment according to identity group. For example. A women being more or less responsible and deserving of punishment for sexual abuse allegations or more or less depending on socioeconomic status or race.

Circling back to Voldemort. You could claim that due to his circumstances that he has the moral culptability of a savage beast.

but Even if this is true, it is still in societies best interest to put him down quickly and humanely to prevent more damage. We can agree that his actions are wrong, and we do not want them to continue. So a punishment may need to be in order to discourage others from taking the same course of actions even if Voldemort does not personally deserve them but for the good of society as a whole.

ergo, Voldemort did nothing wrong because society failed him.

Was that what you were looking for?

**** Not OP, but he's largely undone by luck and Deus ex machina, rather than actual error on his part.

He conquered the national in a matter of months once Dumbledore was gone and would have won the Battle of Hogwarts if Harry wasn't somehow master of the elder wand, which is especially weird since it's known for happily obeying whoever can take it.
