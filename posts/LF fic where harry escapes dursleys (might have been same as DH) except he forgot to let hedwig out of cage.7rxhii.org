forgetting to let hedwig out of cage, she dies (maybe privet drive got blown up?) and it had a big feels moment a few chapters later when he remembers and imagines her last moments - i think this might have been a big long 100k plus story

  Post-HBP, DH divergence. Albus Dumbledore left Harry more than just a snitch. Armed with 63 years of memories, can Harry take charge of the war? No bashing, canon compliant tone.

**** hmm, no, it wasn't this one. in the one im thinking of, Harry had a nightmare of two about how he'd left hedwig in her cage when death eaters blew up privet driver and how terrified alone and incapable hedwig would have felt in her last moments. its probably the most moving HP fanfic scene i've read
