Just looking for any general tropes/cliches/pet-peeves/common misunderstandings about the characters that I can avoid! I don't read a lot of HP fanfiction and am approaching this project coming straight from a reread of the series.

EDIT: Though I might not reply to everyone, I'm reading every response I get, the in-depth discussion is awesome and just what I was looking for!


** Just my two cents but, technically speaking, trying to avoid cliches IS cliche.

Don't worry about avoiding certain tropes, instead work to ensure story elements fit thematically. Some might tell you to avoid say... the angsty Snape; the "my life is the worst and it's all your fault and I'm going to pass my misery on to everyone around me and monologue about my angst like the teenager I never stopped being" sort of nonsense. But even with that it only sounds painful if you can't JUSTIFY it. Why is he that way? Did his trauma cause him to regress 20 years? Does he have a psychosis of some kind? Was he just having a maudlin night and will now castigate himself for sounding like a gryffindor dunderhead? Any of those could make such normally painful writing acceptable and/or move the plot forward.

TLDR: don't worry about what cliches/tropes you might have, worry about WHY you have them and make sure they fit within your story and aren't shoehorned in.

*** What an in-depth reply! I appreciate your response. I suppose I was thinking more along the lines of minor 'fanon-assumed-canon' factoids or reasonings I could hope to avoid, such as Lupin being obsessed with chocolate, or other little oversights authors tend to get wrong.

All very good points, though. I'm confident I can pull this off!

**** Remember that Snape is a war criminal and a traitor who only avoided Azkaban because Dumbledore threw around his weight. He had no issues with signing some family's death warrant. And he wasn't just some unimportant underling, he was in the inner circle and had Voldemort's trust. That has to come from somewhere.

Edit: And let's not forget that he bullied his students for no apparent reason.

***** All legitimate points. As I mentioned, I don't read a lot of HP fic whatsoever and I'm entering this project from a fresh reread of the books. It's a little beyond me how people try to redeem/justify Snape's character when his entire existence being so delightfully grey is what made him interesting in the first place.

****** ...also remember that snape regrets and has reformed from his DE past and actively tries to atone from it and is committed to saving lives

the way to make his character shine is make him essential to the plot and his heroism and self-sacrifice impressive and stark in contrast to his casual cruelty to whoever he feels like. emphasize his skills, courage and abilities. he also works well when pitting him against other, and worse bad guys

also, wrt his interactions with remus, sirius and harry, but mostly remus and sirius, he's willing to believe, and will believe, the worst possible interpretation of their behaviour and actions. if it /can/ be cast in a negative light, he will cast it a negative light. or even just if it can plausibly be contrived in a negative light. the obvious example of this is at the of POA: he believes lupin is complicit in sirius' plans, he thinks he's untrustworthy because he's weak and will support his friends, that he's a danger to the students because he forgot his potion, that sirius is capable of murder because of his disregard for the werewolf incident with snape, that sirius is guilty because he's a convicted DE and his only defenders are three children he's manipulated, etc. he isn't willing to afford any nuance to their actions or behaviour

No, that stuff is fanon, cooked up by people who think that Snape is an angel. James is known for hexing Snape, the same Snape who thought that using dark magic on fellow students was funny. The same Snape who had no moral qualms about joining the Death Eaters at age 17, and was best friends with Avery and Mulciber, two who would eventually become inner circle members.

#+end_quote

There's a difference between bullying and fighting. Snape fought back with much worse than anything James and Sirius did to him - he developed Sectumsempra before he was 16. Go have another read at the part of book 5. When Snape is released from James' spell, he uses a curse which causes James' side to bleed - clearly it was practice for Sectumsempra.

In the same passage, they also said that Snape continued hexing James even though James tried to put a stop to it. Furthermore, the first time they ever meet, Snape 1) reveals himself as racist and 2) insults James. Snape was the one who started it all, /not/ James.

** Don't fall for the "Snape is just a misunderstood guy" cliche. He's miserable excuse for a human being who was fascinated with the Dark Arts and joined the Death Eaters willingly, only changing sides because of Lily getting targetted - he didn't care at all about her family. He bullies and torments kids who never did anything to him - see Neville and Hermione - and lacks the self-control to behave as a mature individual.

I usually treat Snape as hating everyone, including himself, but hating Voldemort most.

Edit: McGonagall's biggest trap is to treat her "adults are useless because kids need to be the heroes" moments as serious characterisation. Decide on her character, then have her act like it, and forget canon. If she cares for kids, she won't send them into the Forbidden Forest at night. If she is stern but fair, she'll defend Harry and Co. against Snape. And so on.

Lupin is in canon a whining mess of a wizard who can't even be bothered to tell Dumbledore that the mass-murderer targetting Harry is an animagus - another victim of the "adults are useless" trope. Forget that and have him act as the smart wizard he is, at least.

I'm finding the biggest obstacle to keep the adults in-character while trying to juggle the mild inconsistency of their characterizations in canon. The story I'm writing is from a non-Trio POV from a regular student, as I less wanted to interfere with canon so much as I wanted to play around with characters I'd find super fun and challenging to write in different scenarios.

**** Lupin hates himself only just a little less than Snape, in that he bothers to try and put on a good outward appearance and stay calm. He also doesn't actually whine, at least not to anyone who isn't Harry (his breakdown in book 7, when Tonks is pregnant). I think in that instance he makes the same mistake that Sirius did, thinking of Harry as James. But other than that he keeps everything locked inside. He tries to keep a stoic, professional, unconcerned exterior. He even seems pretty cool if you don't know him well. His actions, though, wow. There are people who absolutely despise Lupin for everything he didn't do. I don't. Lupin doesn't truly trust anyone and he does truly believe he's bad luck for anyone to be around. He might even be right- everyone around him did end up with a bad fate. From the other marauders, to Sirius again, to Tonks and Lupin himself in the final battle.

*** Or alternatively, portray McGonagall and Lupin as incompetent and useless as they are in canon (Lupin was a shitty husband as well) but try to explain why.

For example, McGonagall might be drowning in administrative work while Dumbledore is off playing politics. Therefore she can't focus on Black or protecting Harry because she has a school to run and she can't sack Snape because Dumbledore is covering his arse. Show her frustration with the status quo and her repeated attempts at changing things.

I agree with Starfox that Snape is scum who presumably committed enough war crimes to earn himself a life in Azkaban.

As for Lupin, his behaviour in the Black situation, towards Harry (ignoring him) and Tonks is inexcusable and trying to fix his character usually just drags a story down because it feels like cheap, unconvincing excuses. I understand why he did those things, but a shitty hand is no excuse for acting like a dick.

Because the story I'm writing is set only in the events of PoA, would you mind going into more detail about Lupin's missteps in handling 'the Black situation'? Was it just him not telling Dumbledore that Sirius was an Animagus (as mentioned by the previous commenter), or was there more to it than that? His post-PoA behaviour is much more clearly selfish and shitty, but I'm mostly interested in examining his characterization in PoA specifically.

***** Well, he did not contact Harry at all before meeting him in class. He had no legal obligation to do so, but if your best friend is brutally murdered maybe check up on their only child once or twice and tell him about the friends you loved dearly. Tell a few stories, share some dear memories, stuff like that. Lupin never did ths.

He also did not tell Harry much after they met at Hogwarts. Clearly, Harry was in a bad environment (shabby clothes, odd behavior) but Lupin did not care. Again, he had no legal obligation (at least from the magical side), but certainly a moral one as both, a teacher and his parents' friend. (If you want an adult to shit on, Pomfrey would be the "victim" of choice for not recognizing clear signs of child abuse despite having Harry under her care for quite some time. And while maybe not part of a teacher's obligations, a healer should definitely make sure that her patients are actually healthy and not obviously underfed.)

Lupin's line about the dementors (you fear fear itself) is utter bullshit. Dementors are probably the worst magical creature in existence, Harry witnesses his parents' murder and they seem to be able to bar someone from the magical afterlife. If anything, the go-to spell for dementor defense should be Fiendfyre to purge them from this plane of existence, or cleaving them in two with Gryffindor's sword, but that's another debate all together. Point is, everyone should fear those bloody demons, Harry isn't special for doing so. I mean, you can kill most of the other "worst fears" with a good ol'.50 cal, but Dementors...

You could make an argument that his explanation behind the Patronus Charm were wrong (not the instructions), but that's a debate about magical theory.

But perhaps the biggest moment which makes Lupin an arsehole (even before he ran away from his pregnant wife) is the time he tries to guilt Harry with his parents' sacrifice despite never telling anyone about the map or Sirius' animagus form. Not telling anyone was already shitty, but he had the nerve to bring up Lily's sacrifice despite of this.

As for McGonagall, how about a "running gag" where she vows to spend some time with her Gryffindors or check up on Harry but then Dumbledore comes at her with "Oh Minerva, just who I was looking for" and dumps another list of tasks on her and by the time she is done it's two in the morning.

Feel free to use any of this, I'm happy to debate anything further or be a sounding board for ideas. PM me if you want to.

I personally /don't/ think it's because it's /not/ in the adults' nature, but rather the non-existence of consistently competent adults were necessary oversights to keep Harry in a compromised state and to keep the plot chugging along. It could also have to do with Rowling not creating some of these characters until later down the line.

I choose to blame this same phenomenon for neither Snape nor Lupin going to Dumbledore about /any/ of the endgame events of PoA. Everything could have been avoided if either or both of them just went to Dumbledore and told him what they knew or suspected. Pettigrew would've been captured right off the bat and Harry would have had Sirius. But we couldn't have that, because that's not the plot Rowling wanted to pursue.

I would LOVE to add you on Discord or something to discuss this further / on a more regular basis, but the story I'm writing is very much pro-Lupin and I fear it might not be up your alley, LOL.

******* But Snape went to the Minister and tried to get a big, fat award for his actions and then told everyone about Lupin being a werewolf. Dumbledore was Chief Justice and/or Head of Parliament, he could have gotten Black a trial if he had wanted to (but instead asked a bunch of kids to break the laws of time travel to save Sirius).

Then apply Hanlon's razor (/Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity/). Magical teachers get no training to spot child abuse, Dumbledore is too overworked to look into Harry's living situation. They are incompetent, but not evil. Or they simply don't care (eg Sprout, Sinistra, Trelawney).

Then fuck the canon plot and make your own. Sirius comes to Hogwarts and confronts Harry and Pettigrew, Pettigrew swears revenge, escapes and now Sirius has to keep Harry safe while staying undetected. Sirius wants to get Lupin aboard but after hearing how he pretty much ignores Harry decides against it. McGonagall catches him and there is another round of explanations (maybe some Veritasserum or an unbreakable vow). McG adds it to her already gigantic workload and eventually convinces the other two to trust Lupin. Pettigrew tries to murder Harry a couple of times but fails, while everyone believes that Sirius is breaking into Gryffindor tower/attempting murder.

You can have competent adults and still keep Harry fucked, that's what I do in my stories. You just have to keep the competent adults away from positions of power (McG could not push her agenda in the Wizengamot for example, Flitwick cannot fire Snape, stuff like that) and have them come up with workarounds (eg frame Snape for something and get him sacked, plant a ton of cocain at Privet Drive and get the Dursleys arrested for drug trafficking).

***** As you said, didn't go to Dumbledore with the Animagus info.

Didn't tell Dumbledore that Black knew about the secret passages.

After taking the map from Harry, he didn't give it to Dumbledore but just kind of sat on it.

This is more sketchy, but if you take Snape at his word in the shack its implied that Lupin FORGOT TO GO TO SNAPE FOR THE GODDAMN POTION.

Related, when he saw Pettigrew on the Marauders Map he didn't go to Dumbledore with that info but instead decided to go off and play the hero himself.

****** I think people forget way too often that Harry Potter 1-3 are essentially kids books build largely around classic fairytale tropes in a world where little kids can go on awesome adventures without any lasting negative consequences.

It's only by book 4 that the story turns towards YA territory and gradually becomes much darker and more mature.

If you judge the actions of characters in the early books by the standards of the crappy corrupt wizarding world as it is presented in the later books it's easy to present them as incompetent, careless or even downright evil, but in the end they needed to be that way because adults in a children's adventure generally act more as plot devices than as 100% consistent characters.

I feel like judging them too harshly for their actions in the early books kind of goes against the spirit of things. Remus didn't not tell Dumbledore about Black being an Animagus because it makes sense for him in-character, but because if he did that would have ruined the plot twist.

****** But then again.

Snape only knew about Lupin not having his potion and the only thing he saw on the map was the werewolf leaving the castle for the one place he changed in for years. (because everybody else was already in the Shrake by the time Snape was in Lupin's office)

And Snape's conclusion was, that he was working together with Sirus (who he didn't see on the map). and decided to follow him, without the potion, he apparently had with him at that time.

Snape did not bring the potion along despite his theory on what was about to go down. He basically tried to get someone bitten. He also tried to get an innocent man executed even though he should have known that Sirius was not Voldemort's right-hand man given his previous, voluntary membership with the magical Nazis.

** Don't try to write a mystery that centers around Sirius and whether he's guilty or not. It never works. All of your readers are aware of canon and won't be able to leave it behind.

You can totally do character development in that direction, like Lupin being troubled by his ex-friend trying to break into Hogwarts, etc... just don't write a mystery story about it like canon.
