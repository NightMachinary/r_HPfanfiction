Title says it all really - I'm looking for other works that have a similar scope and quality as flamethrower's 'Of a Linear Circle'. I don't have any objections to bashing as long as it's well reasoned.


** I've got two for you, sadly both not yet finished, but both authors have a long-established habit of regularly updating and neither have been abandoned. I apologise in advance for poor formatting as this is the first time I've rec'd on reddit. = )

First is [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10727911/1/Black-Sky]] which is a HP Katekyo Hitman Reborn crossover, but you don't need to know anything about the latter, as the author builds up the entire world to have it make sense. I would also recommend her other fics, particularly the other KHR ones and Naruto (strangely enough, as that is a world I am entirely disinterested in, and yet I read her because she is Amazing)

The second is the link to the first fic in the series The Road Not Taken: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/10454145]] This and Linear Circle are the two series that have become what I mentally measure all other fanfic against (that are then always found wanting, sadly)

Oh! Looking through my favorites on ao3:

[[https://archiveofourown.org/works/6334630]] Actually finished, bookmarked as "holy shit", so this might just scratch an itch. Definitely not as epic as Linear Circle but the character development is pretty fab whilst also remaining exactly in-character from the books.
