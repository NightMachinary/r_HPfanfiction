The tri-wizard tournament is basically the wizarding world version of obstacle racing shows like American ninja warrior or Wipeout.

Obstacle races with dragons throwing fire at the participants. A race over the black lake, where, if you fall, you can come back up and continue, if pass the Merpeople. Duels between the competitors where almost everything is allowed except the unforgivable curses. Fight against sphinxes or acromantulas, pass through obstacles while chased by Dementors, broom races while escaping hungry dragons or hippogriffs, physical tests where magic is not allowed.

Basically a triwizard tournament that challenges the competitors as much as possible, even deadlier than the original


** So basically a HP version of the Chunin exams? Linkao3(The Green Games) Hunger Games style AU with death matches has something similar.

  Harry was 13, and the rebellion had to come before its time. When he failed, Voldemort had the children fight to the death. Now, it's a sick game for the Purebloods who sacrifice students each year to see who will win and keep their magic past the age of maturity. The others will perish. Only one can win, yet Hermione is going to try to save them all. Even the Slytherins.
