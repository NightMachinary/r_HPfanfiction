He had some ability where he could talk to any magic creature, and emulate their abilities to an extent. Grew up on a dragon reserve, and I think his guardian was a hit wizard.

At any rate, Harry wound up in a betrothal contract to a troll chieftain's daughter. Vaguely remember girl trolls sounding like She-Hulk so he wasn't as upset as most people would expect.

The bathroom troll was her previous betrothed and really wanted to kill Harry.

*** Goddamn, all of that other shit sounds dumb, but the OP's troll romance stuff sounds neat. Why couldn't it just be that? Why's it buried in shit?

  What if Harry had a twin and was named a squib after the attack on Halloween, What if Harry's sister was the Girl-Who-Lived, What if Harry did have magic, a magic so powerful and unique even the Ministry didn't know about it...He is Harry Potter, Lord of all Creatures.
