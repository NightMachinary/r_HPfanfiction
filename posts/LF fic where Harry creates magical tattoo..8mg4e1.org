I am looking for a story where Harry creates a magical tattoo all over his body that doesn't allow others to touch him (especially men). The only people who can automatically touch him are Hermione, Ron, and Poppy. He gets sent back to Hogwarts over the summer when Vernon Dursley is affected. Harry realizes that Dumbldore knew about the abuse and that Snape was his father when Snape and Harry are shown a memory of when Lilly confessed to Dumbldore that she was pregnant with Snape's child. Harry changes his name (Tali or something like that) and pretends to be a couple years older so he can go back to Hogwarts as Snape's apprentice son. I don't remember much else from the story except that: Ron was a dog animagus, Harry was a an ocelot animagus, he was dating Bill Weasley, and he was really smart.

**** No problem.

If you ever see more tattoo prominent fanfiction though, I'm super interested. (;

***** Harry uses runic tattoos in 'Harry Potter and the Rune Stone Path'. Although, the tattoos are not as extensively used in this fic. In fact, the tattoos don't come into the story until nearly halfway through, at chapter 24 of 50. I just reread it recently and it made me think of Skin Deep.

*** It's a good read. However, it does deal with the after effects of abuse of a nature I don't even want to be more specific about. I don't think there is any scenes with it as the story takes place once Harry and Snape know they're related, but I'm not one hundred percent sure. Thankfully, Terra1fan knew which story it was as indicated in a following post.

** HP/SS always disturbs me. I have no problem with slash or SS but him together with Harry? It just feels wrong. I don't know why
