:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
Dear all, I am searching for a fic I read some years ago, it is a severitus story. Harry is in his first year, sorted to Slytherin, somehow he ends up in detention with Snape. Snape tries to put him in the corner but because of the abuse by the Dursleys Harry can´t put his back to another adult in the room and not see what he is about to do. He gets in some kind of panic attack and Snape slowly finds out the extend of Dursley´s abuse. Throughout the year the two get close and Snape decides to adopt Harry only Harry is still sceptical, fears abandonment, so he sets Snapes books/library/office on fire to test him or force him to cast Harry of. Snape just takes care of Harrys  burns... I  am searching long time for this great story with no success.  Your help is very much appreciated.

  One lonely little boy. One snarky, grumpy git. When the safety of one was entrusted to the other, everyone knew this was not going to turn out well... Or was it? AU, sequel to "Harry's First Detention". OVER FIVE MILLION HITS!

** This isn't the one you're looking for (it's set the summer before Hogwarts and just published this year) but it has similar scenes to what you're describing so I thought I'd recommend it: [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/28613241/chapters/70129140]]

***** Yes, it stuck with me all these years through many other stories read. I don´t know why I haven´t saved it amongst my other favourites already read (stored to come back to it again and again...), but it is rectified now!
