The story started with Daphne walking up to Harry and basically ordering him to take her to the Yule Ball. I think it was because Draco was trying to pressure her into going with him but I am not positive.

*** It's not terrible but the author can't even spell some characters names. Viktor spelled as Victor, Tracey spelled as Tracy. I mean just look at the spelling mistake in the description. Also, there's some pretty stupid Ron bashing.
