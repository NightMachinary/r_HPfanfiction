What I remember of it Hermione finds an old journal of Dumbledores from his time with Grindelwald about how to wipe out muggles. Snape takes it and sends it to a friend in the department of mysteries. They both have their memories wiped and have lives set up as muggles. Snape is a chemist and Hermione is a waitress and student when they meet and start dating. They get their memories back at a ren faire when they find a spell book and jokingly cast a finite. That's where I lost the story but I know it goes on after that.

Edit: Found it! It's called Double Memory by worrywort on ffnet. Looks like it might have been deleted but I'm on mobile so might be missing it.


** This fic sounds amazing, I hope you find it!!
