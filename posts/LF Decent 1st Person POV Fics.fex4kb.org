I like the idea of 1st Person POV fics, because seeing the internal monologues of a character and their opinions of how things really are rather than a generalised view is kind of cool, but I've never seen a good one.

1st Person fics are also the only way you can get away with Bashing, as it's that character's opinion of events, rather than the actual events. If there was a Snape POV Fic you could guarantee it'd contain Potter bashing.

Please no Slash or Redeemed Death Eaters/Mentor Snape crap. Snape is not friendly and caring, he's a prick with his own agenda and that's what makes him a good character.


** Ingenio ab Artifex is a pretty good Harry-Fleur one, if you've got tolerance/are into the kind of the kind of tortured artist/beat poets mindset that Harry has. Can't link because it technically has underage sex (Harry is fourteen when he and Fleur bang, though it's completely non-explicit and literally nothing more than "We went back to my room and had a great thirty minutes together" level - I wouldn't read it otherwise).

There's also the ever-classic Seventh Horcrux where Harry-Voldemort has some identity issues and thinks Hermione is the greatest minion/aspiring Dark Lady to ever have lived beside himself.

I still have no idea what I think of Wastelands of Time. On one hand, it's a pretty great Epic Tale, but on the other hand it's really, really not Harry Potter. Basically, Harry is looping time while racing Voldemort to Atlantis (which is a semi-Lovecraftian City-on-the-edge-of-Reality kind of place) and says some vaguely smitten Kerouackian lines about Tonks and Fleur. (Think that kind of "She was doin' nothing but standing there, leaning on the railing, holding the universe together" sort of stuff).

Northumbrian's Strangers at Drakeshaugh is fun.

Same with Midnight Blues. I didn't expect to enjoy it, but I actually did.

The Lie I've Lived is probably one of the more well-known first-person fics aside from Seventh Horcrux, though it's an acquired taste.

I haven't read By That Last Candle's Light, but it's on my to-read list so I've poked through the first two or three chapters and thought it was interesting enough to bookmark.

I'm sure there are more I'm missing, but that's a nice enough selection for now. :)

#+begin_quote
  Tom Riddle escapes at the end of Chamber of Secrets, and is quite surprised to find that nothing about the future is as he ever thought it would be. Soon, Tom finds himself on a globe-spanning quest to follow the path his forebear blazed and perhaps, at the end, to put a stop to him once and for all.

** linkffn(Jamie Evans and Fate's Fool) is pretty good as a 1st person story - it's got a F/F pairing, though... Sorta...

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!
