i'm looking for a story where harry realizes what he's facing either right when he learns voldemort isn't dead in book one or when he revived in book 4, or anywhere in between. maybe trains his ass off for the tournament and doesn't try to rely on dumb luck. basically something where an event is a wake up call saying “hey this dude wants me dead and he's feared across the country, i should probably stop playing chess and go train my ass off”, something like that. basically he becomes atleast powerful to handle himself against a inner circle death eater and he doesn't have to rely on obscene amounts of plot armor.

Harry gets trained by a OC bodyguard in his age. It is a good story in my opinion.

  Beginning in the graveyard, Harry fails to reach the cup to escape but is saved by an unexpected person thought long dead. Harry learns what it is to be a Potter and starts his journey to finish Voldemort once and for all. NO SLASH. Rated M for language, gore etch. A story of realism and Harry coming into his own.
