I remember it was Hermione and Severus. Hermione and him got drunk and she got pregnant but she didn't tell him because she was afraid he wouldn't want to be a dad. They end up trying to be together and trying to work things through. She also works at the ministry and I know Ron is all upset she had a kid with Severus and not him and he tried to get Hermione to leave Severus and Ron would help raise the kid instead. I know it also has pretty graphic sex scenes in it, but it's an amazing story all tied together.

Also, Hermione works at the ministry and she also tells her mom and her and her mom bickered and hermione had to go the hospital because she was heavily bleeding and she wiped the memory of the doctor so no one would find out she went to a muggle doctor.
