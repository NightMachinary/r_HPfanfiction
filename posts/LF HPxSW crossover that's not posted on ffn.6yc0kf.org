I pretty much read everything there is on ffn and am looking for stuff that's either deleted of ffn in that big archive of theirs or other sites. No slash, no Hermione or Ginny pairing. Bonus points for harem. Not looking for Evil Harry or where he doesn't have a pairing.

The last savior by plums is the best example I'm looking for.
