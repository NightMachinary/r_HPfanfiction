Struggling to figure out a justification for why Voldemort would have Quirell hunt an item he wasn't even planning on using in the long term rather than having Quirell build him a rudimentary body and then catching Harry in the open (his trip to King's Cross or in the Forest) and getting his blood. This makes even less sense when you think that Voldemort's initial plan with Wormtail was to possess him as well and the only reason he didn't do it was because he would arise suspicion.

Some of my thoughts are that he didn't fully understand how Lily's sacrifice worked so he hoped to capture Harry at Hogwarts. Or maybe that Quirell didn't really see himself as a servant of Voldemort (his entry on Pottermore says that his initial plan was to capture Voldemort) and thought of their relationship as symbiotic instead. Thus he couldn't provide the flesh.

What are your thoughts?

*** Well he claims that the ritual was his creation so he either had some clue how that worked before or he dreamed it one night because I doubt he could do much research in his wraith form.

** In my head, the possession prevents the same method from working.

In the book, Quirrell died because Voldemort un-possessed him - so how's he going to put himself in a homunculus without then losing his only servant at that point, thus leaving him unable to complete step 2?

The Philosopher's Stone would have been a way around that problem, either making Voldemort a full body instead of a mere homunculus (and making Quirrell's sacrifice not matter to Voldemort) or allowing Quirrell to be strong enough to survive having Voldemort un-possess him so he could actually do the thing properly.

** I agree with the other comments but part of Voldemort's characterization is he favours elaborate plots which demonstrate his own cleverness and make Dumbledore look stupid.

Disguising himself as the DADA professor, fooling Dumbledore for a whole year, evading Dumbledore's traps and stealing from his mentor would definitely appeal.

** 1. He didn't know he had to bypass Lily's protection until he Harry touched Quirrel

2. The stone was not to be used to produce elixir, just as ingredient in producing a body. Which didn't made Voldemort depended on the elixir and was a sound plan at the beginning.

** The only story in which I've seen that is in linkffn(Harry Potter and the Homecoming), and he only did it after he realized Harry was his horcrux

** I'm pretty sure the reason is that he didn't have a form yet. In Goblet of Fire, Voldemort has a body at the end. It is described as barely so, but he had his own form. I think this was key, because I remember hearing a little while back that JK Rowling (who I don't support btw) originally had a description of how he got his soul into the half-body he had in the end of Goblet of Fire, but it was cut out. I hope this helps !

*** According to his tale to the death eaters, he was a wraith when Wormtail found him as well. Wormtail helped him get the rudimentary body. JK said that it was a disgusting process. She said the same about Horcruxes. Not sure if we will ever find out but one theory, which also became my headcanon, was that Wormtail raped Bertha, and impregnated her and then he possessed the fetus before it had a soul of its own. If he could get Wormtail who spent more than a third of his life as a rat and was considered dead by the ministry to do this, why couldn't he get a relatively normal wizard to do it?

**** Thank you! this is a super cool theory, and that would make sense.

By best guess as to why Wormtail had to do it would be the timing. They say that while Quirrel was on his trip for idk what he found Voldemort's spiring and let it posses him so my guess is that Voldemort thought he could get to a human for faster by using the Sorcerer's Stone. I bet he had a different plans, and when the stone was destroyed and Quirrel was killed he came up with the one we see actually working.
