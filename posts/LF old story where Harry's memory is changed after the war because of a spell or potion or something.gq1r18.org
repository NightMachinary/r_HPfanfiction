It was an older one, maybe 2015, or even older I can't remember exactly. I don't think it was finished when I was reading it, but it might be now, if it's not deleted. I tried finding it on here before and got no takers. It's not Owned by JordanGrant, someone might suggest it, but it's not it.

Everyone was worried for Harry and why his personality was changing, there was some sort of spell/curse or potion on it. I can't remember but I think either Hermione or Madam Pomfrey was able to free him?

Draco Malfoy was chained at Grimmauld Place from my memory, and Harry had to help him recover.

The usual characters were in the story, can't remember the title or the author or any other little hints. Even if it's not, I'd appreciate any suggestions that sound similar.

I can't remember anything else unfortunately, or even what site it's on, and I have no idea the title or author.

I've searched for years, no idea it might be deleted. (Who knows, I might have thought it up myself, but I don't think so, I think it was an actual fic).
