  Harry never used a wand. Funny little things for funny little people. Nargles, don't you know. But he never really saw a need for them anyway. They were just so much work to make. He just used whatever was to hand. A twig from that holly bush, a little cheese from dinner, some thread from his robe, and he could turn a Raven into a Writing Desk. Add in the sharp bit from a bottle opener and he could breathe underwater. A bit of Ron's earwax and he could turn the Raven back.

Just had this idea where Harry could basically get or do whatever he wanted just by doing a ritual with whatever he had to hand. The kind of person who'd save the day with chewing gum, three sticks, and a slightly scratched copy of a Spice Girls album, and still get the correct answer in whatever practical test he'd had in lessons that day. Like the title says, the MacGyver of Magical Rituals.

If there are any fics like this - as always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

*** Thanks! The only issue I can see is that it'd have to be kept really, really consistent to keep any dramatic tension whatsoever. If he needed three sticks, but could only find two, then he'd have to go looking for more, or improvise something to replace it, for example.

**** I'd say the ritual requirements are more thematic then anything. If normal magic is about Intent and Focus then why not have Harry's ritual magic have multiple ways to do things that other wizards require complex spells and fancy wand waving.

***** Sure, but thematic to a point. If you go through a story knowing Harry is literally able to solve any problem with any resources with little bother or effort or thought, then it's not going to be a terrible engaging story for most people in this fandom.

There has to be set limits to a magic system or you end up with shit like this fandom where you get people going "Ah, but why didn't he use this spell in this way, because if you look at page whatever, he clearly had this use in mind and then forgot about it later" or open contradictions like everything to do with the Fidelius. Consistency, no matter the system qualities, is usually the best way to go.

******* In fanon, sure. Canonically, Wizard Baruffio and the Wingardium Leviosa meme would argue differently, given his mispronouncing a spell got him a completely different effect and Hermione's emphasis on proper pronunciation implies it's at least the textbook-correct version of magic. It's whatever version you want to go with, really.

******** Sry, I intended it as sarcasm, I consider the trope pretty stupid and usually facepalm when I find it in a fic, they are almost always in Indy!Harry. In fact, I have my own headcanon in wich intent is only 1 of the 7 elements a wizard need to manifest magic

**** A really simple limit on rituals is making them take time and require an interruption free environment. In other words, when the spells start flying Macguy-Harry can't chalk out a circle or face due North and chant. He has to stay out of the way and rely on wand wizards like Ron and Hermione.

But if things are even a little bit quieter he can start to perform Workings. Disarm Macguy-Harry and bind him with chains or magic and he's probably slipped free before you could even start monologuing. Give him supplies, time and a clear goal and he is more dangerous than a whole squad of aurors.

What emerges, rather organically, is a Harry with inverse strengths to cannon Harry. Struggling in a tense fight but readily holding his own if given a chance to prepare.

If he is told he has to get to the bottom of the school lake and back within an hour or Umbridge gives him a blood quill and tells him to start writing he probably has a hundred ways to resolve things.

Big fight with wands? He's stuck hiding behind his friends because they are much better at that sort of thing.

***** Hmm. It'd be interesting to see him having to dance about and really work to keep the 'Ritual Script' throughout the fight, too. Sort of a Captain-Jack-Sparrow-esque drunken stumble as he dances around spellfire and keeps chanting while the wand-wielders deal with the trouble. I do like the idea of him being useless without a little time to prepare/peace and quiet to work and having to rely on the wand-wielders though. That's a really good obstacle to put in place.

  Instead of attending Hogwarts, Harry Potter was taken as an apprentice by a druid who taught him a more archaic form of magic. Now fully trained in the mystic arts of water and wood, he comes out of isolation to rejoin magical society and wage guerrilla warfare against Voldemort through ritual magic and alliances with the fae creatures of ancient Britain.
