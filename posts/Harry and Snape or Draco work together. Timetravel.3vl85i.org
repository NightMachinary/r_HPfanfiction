A the title says I'm trying to find a fic where Harry goes back in time with a Snape or Draco from the future and they work together. Preferably not a slash fic. Thanks


** linkffn(I'm Still Here) Fits the bill, though Harry isn't aware of Draco until half way though the story. Still unfinished, but not quite abandoned. Quite good, easy to tell how it's been inspired by linkffn(C'est la Vie)

  A year after the war ends, Fate takes the opportunity to toss her favourite hero into a different dimension to repay her debt. A new life in exchange for having fulfilled her prophecy. Harry just wants to know why he has no say in the matter. And why Fate thinks that his hero complex won't eventually kick in. Then again, that might be exactly why Fate dumped him there.

  The second war with Voldemort never really ended, and there were no winners, certainly not Harry Potter who has lost everything. What will Harry do when a ritual from Voldemort sends him to another world? How will he manage in this new world in which he never existed, especially as he sees familiar events unfolding? Harry/Multi eventually.

*** I got super into that one and its not finished. I was so torn.

Edit: to clear things up, this is a great story and I was torn when I came to the end and it wasn't finished. That doesn't mean I'm mad at the person, I was just upset that such a fine story hasn't been finished yet.

** I'm still here. Draco comes back the same way as harry, some portal or whatever, and changes sides because he comes back as a ghost, having been killed at voldemorts whim and deciding that regardless of light or dark he's going to follow a leader who isn't a total dick.

** [[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2538955/1/Time-to-Spare][Time to Spare]] is mostly pretty good. Harry gets caught with a spell to send him back 200 years into the past to get rid of that whole silly prophecy thing once and for all. The ending to this is kinda shit though.

*** I love this fic. I don't remember how the ending goes so I can't comment on that. But it's pretty much exactly what OP is looking for, since Harry and Draco go back in time and they do in fact work together. Also Snape is in it pretty heavily.

  HBPcompliant rewrite of Time For Me. Voldemort has a sinister plot to catch Harry out of bounds and cast a spell to send him back two hundred years, but all does not go as planned and Harry isn't as gone as he'd thought...
