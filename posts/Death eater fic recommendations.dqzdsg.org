I'm looking for fanfics with a death eater protagonist that doesn't turn them into the "good guys". Any recommendations?

  A genre savvy but ignorant of canon OC insert into Voldemort right after the murder of James Potter. Greed replacing pride at the helm of a terrorist group just might change the course of history. After all, the magical world is full of potential waiting to be exploited. (Inspired by The Evil Overlord List and 48 Laws of Power.)

That's a misleading description. Her problems were caused by the lingering compulsions left by the Diary's influence.

***** I've enjoyed it, though the plot gets very depressing after chapter 22. Events keep spiraling downward with no hope in sight. Also, the relationship with Bellatrix has been particularly disturbing so far.

****** Personally, I think that the story drags in the beginning, but picks up when barty stars teaching ginny. As for the ginnytrix relationship it's disturbing, but I like the idea of ginny and bellatrix being reflections of each other. And that this is a ginny that's embraced the side of herself that's like bella.

** In linkffn(Darkness Visible), the Wizarding World's morality is explored further. It's Snape-centric (so technically a death eater, although maybe not quite what you're looking for) and has great plotting. Snape is by no means good.

  AU after GoF. Trelawney makes a new prophecy about a mysterious Half-Blood Prince, and Dumbledore struggles to find out who it's about. Already walking a tightrope between two masters, Severus Snape feigns ignorance while making his own plans.
