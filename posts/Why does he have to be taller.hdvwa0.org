Fanfictions always make Harry taller. Either by nutrient potions or whatever else. Why can't the man just be short?


** He's not short in the books. However, most of them are trying to make Daniel taller.

*** I'm guilty of making Harry taller in fics, not abnormally though. And he musculature isn't upgraded either. I just feel that FanFiction fanon has turned Harry into a severe abuse victim and made him severely malnourished. Or they look towards Radcliffe as their ideal Harry. But as you say, Harry had a growth spurt before sixth year in the books...

** Many people who go with the "starved by the Dursleys" trope (hinted at but not definitive in canon) believe his height is stunted by early childhood malnutrition.

This has been proved untrue in canon in OOtP Chapter 28: /Snape's Worst Memory/.

  Harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteen-year-old father.

  Excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach: it was as though he was looking at himself but with deliberate mistakes. James's eyes were hazel, his nose was slightly longer than Harry's and there was no scar on his forehead, but they had the same thin face, same mouth, same eyebrows; James's hair stuck up at the back exactly as Harry's did, his hands could have been Harry's and Harry could tell that, when James stood up, they would be within an inch of each other in height.

So, when both were 15, they were almost exactly the same height.

  "... unfortunately, polygamy has directly lead to terrorism in both magical and muggle societies. When considering polygamy, the focus is often on the small percentage of males with multiple wives, or on females in polygamous marriages - but the larger and more important effect is upon the majority of males that are unable to secure a relationship."

  "In monogamous societies, the top 10% of the male population in terms of desirability still only marries 10% of the female population. This leaves a roughly-equal number of males and females remaining to be coupled together. But in polygamous societies, the top 10% of the male population marries a much larger percentage of the women - sometimes as much as 70%. This leaves the remaining 90% of males pursuing only 30% of the remaining females - and males in the lower half of desirability will often have no hope of securing a relationship."

  "This population of futureless males is often shunted to terrorism. Muggle terrorism almost exclusively originates from countries with significant levels of polygamy, such as Saudi Arabia and northern Africa. Likewise, most magical terrorist organizations spring from polygamous countries; their membership is almost exclusively male. This leads many to believe that harems are inherently evil (regardless if every participant is willing) and that their existence is the entire reason dark lords have numerous devoted followers - overwhelmingly male, of course."

  Harry's mouth fell. "Holy shit," he whispered to Ron. "Does that mean that authors who write Harem stories are endorsing terrorism?"

  "Sure sounds like it to me!" Ron replied.

** If it's done through nutrient potions I don't think of it as if they're making him taller. They're making him shorter than canon through malnourishment and then catching him up to his normal height.

** Short height in men is, unfortunately, low-status. Most fanfiction is largely wish-fulfillment, so it's not a surprise that most authors will search for an angle to leverage to make a protagonist more attractive (physically, mentally, or socially), consciously or not. Pretty much it --- you might as well ask why most fanfiction makes the main characters more intelligent, more powerful, more wealthy, more whatever... you get the idea.

** Canonically he is tall given that Hermione comments on his growth in HBP.

Then again its fanfiction, so do people do what they want with the character. Harry is always going to be super jacked, tall, attractive etc. A lot of protagonists in fiction usually are described as attractive anyways. Only notable exceptions off the top of my head is George Smiley in Le Carre's novels where he's described as an anti-Bond(short, overweight, not attractive) and Jason Bourne who's had plastic surgey to mellow out his facial features so he doesn't stand out.

*** Nah, they have to be agile. Krum is described as quite clumsy and heavy on the ground, but super agile in the air. Agility isn't linked to height or strength - male ballet dancers, for example, are agile AF but are also usually quite big and strong because they have to lift people up a lot and stuff.

** Because people want/like to ascribe all positive traits to those they like and height is seen as a positive trait. IIRC there was some polls asking people to ascribe traits to political candidates before election (Not in US, don't get your panties in a twist) and since one candidate was far more popular than another, he was described as, amongst other things, 'tall' whereas his opponent was described as 'short'. Problem being, exhibit number one was about 1.7m, whereas the latter was almost 2 meters tall.

** I can't remember the title, but I remember reading one story in which Adult Harry laments that if anyone had cared during his childhood, perhaps he wouldn't have suffered the malnutrition that caused him to up shorter than everyone else and with brittle bones.
