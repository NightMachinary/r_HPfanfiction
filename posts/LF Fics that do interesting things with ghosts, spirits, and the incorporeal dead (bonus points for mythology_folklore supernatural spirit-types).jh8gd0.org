So, yeah. I haven't read all that many fics that do interesting things with supernatural spiritual entities or the incorporeal undead, so I'm hoping the sub can provide! It can be a big or small portion of the fic.

For clarity, I'm including the old 'Demonic Apparitions' and 'Will of the Wisp' type entities that always were spirits too, as well as the actual once-living-and-now-returned style undead type ghosts. Just anything that isn't generic zombies and vampires, y'know?

As always, all relationships/pairings okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, any protagonist/POV, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. Crossovers, SIs, and self-promotion also completely fine. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.

Please also let me know if the fic has smut and if I can skip it without losing plot/character development. Feel free to rec it even if it has smut I can't skip though, maybe someone else reading the thread will enjoy it (and if it's particularly interesting in building character/plot, maybe I'll even be convinced to give it a try - it has happened! :D).

*** I have read it and thank you for the link, but I'd very much recommend removing it. Technically violates rule 8, as the suggestiveness does semi-involve minors. Could get you banned.

** In my story "Harry Potter and the Secret of Atlantis", the Curse-Breaking Trio has to deal with various ghosts to find the location of the lost city - ghosts who don't speak their language, ghosts who are bound to certain objects, ghosts with an agenda of their own, and very young ghosts of people they know.

  AU. Having been raised by his tomb raiding aunt, Harry Potter had known early on that he'd follow in her footsteps and become a Curse-Breaker, discovering and exploring old tombs full of lost knowledge and treasure. But he and his two best friends might have underestimated just how dangerous the wrong sort of knowledge and treasure could be. Sequel to "Petunia Evans, Tomb Raider".

** I'm trying real hard to remember the name, but I can think of a fic that sort of meets what you are looking for. It starts out as a dark abused harry kind of thing but moves past that after an event with some ghosts and other undead type characters. There is lots of mythology and history (I think most of it is made up, author did some real planning here) and dogma sort of things. The specific diety I remember being used is Hades. It's not a crossover and it's mostly AU and I don't think there are any pairings. The chapters are really long which can be a turnoff and isn't complete but I don't think it's abandoned.
