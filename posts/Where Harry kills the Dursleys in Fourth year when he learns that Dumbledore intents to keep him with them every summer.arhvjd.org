I never read this fic, but I heard it mentioned in an old thread and sounded interestingly dark. Here's the text from the post:

  There's another HP/NT (ish?) fic the name of which eludes me at the moment where he's in his fourth year when he flat out murders the Dursleys the instant he realizes the Dumbledore intends to keep him there every summer. IIRC: Harry only gets out of azkaban because... I think his name comes out of the GoF?

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

*** Certainly looks probable. Thanks! I'll have to read a bit to be sure, the user who first wrote it is not very active so I didn't think I'd get a response.
