I cant remember much of the fic, what I don remember was that Daphne was originally betrothed to someone who verbally abused her. Later on Harry is betrothed to her (voluntarily I think?) and she acts like a stuck up pureblood because the previous verbal abuse made her think that Harry would yell at her if she wasn't the perfect Pureblood lady.

Thanks for the help!


** The "In the Claw of the Raven" series. Specifically the last part.
