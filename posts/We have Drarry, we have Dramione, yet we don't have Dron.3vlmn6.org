C'mon people, why not complete the little DracoXTrio circle? Ya can't just put him with 2 out of 3 main characters and not include the third. Maybe it goes back to the argument that Dramione is just Drarry for those who don't like slash and vice versa, otherwise you people have no excuse.

Basically, I'd like some RonXDraco fics. That's what I'm tryin to say.


** Yeah, okay, I can get behind this request. The justifications for Harry/Draco can work for Ron/Draco. Not much difference.

Now I'm wondering why there aren't many Harry/Ron? I guess there isn't that hatred that /really/ signals attraction.

  Hermione has a chance to do what Lily failed to do. Will she accept her destiny? More importantly, will the men in her life accept theirs?

      This is a bedtime story/gift written for TarnishedAngel\. Be warned: It is rather \(too\) lengthy \- approximately 426K words \(Part I: Reconciling the Past \(Chapters 1\-20\), Part II: 6 Days To Eternity \(Chapters 21\-31\), Part III: Her Dark's Own Light \(Chapters 32\-50\)\. This fic was written over a 4 year period from 2008\-2012\.  I was fortunate to find many great friends through the writing of this story\. Many of them offered great feedback and a critical eye as betas\. The betas for this story are:  Lady of Clunn \(1\-50\); WeasleyWench \(Ch\. 2\-35\); DynoNugget \(Chapters 20\-34\); Wildcatcdc \(Chapters 35\-40\); LiterarySpell \(Chapters 35\-49\); Dee Michelle \(Chapters 35\-43\); and Kerri240879 \(Chapter 50\)\. Plot Beta: Emily Waters \(from Chapters 18\-50\); Brit Picker: Lady of Clunn Other Contributors: Tarnished Angel for the very detailed challenge; Julian Venere for the concrit and feedback; Sara D\. a\.k\.a\. ForgetfulLove for the wonderful donated artwork \(Ch\.39\), Del Borovic for the amazing commissioned piece \(Ch\. 14\); and TriosPleasure for the awesome banner\.This story is AU in that it ignores some of Book 5 and all of books 6 & 7, unless I thought it served as a nifty plot device\.  And finally, please note that while this story contains BDSM elements, it is a fantasy, and should not be taken as an effort to portray "proper" BDSM relationships :::rolls eyes::: :DDisclaimer: The characters and canon situations in the following story belong solely to JK Rowling\. I am not making any money from the publishing or writing of this story\.
