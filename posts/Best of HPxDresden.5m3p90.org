** I actually mentioned this series in another topic earlier today:

'The Denarian Renegade' Trilogy by Shezza

It's a nice, long series, and I found it to be very entertaining, though it doesn't hold up as well with a second read-through. All the characters are (fairly) well-developed (including Dumbledore) and go through some sort of character-development (excluding Harry)

linkffn(The Denarian Renegade)

linkffn(The Denarian Knight)

linkffn(The Denarian Lord)

There is an additional oneshot linkffn(The Denarian Variation) and technically a fourth book linkffn(The Denarian Apocalypse), but it only received two chapters before it was abandoned.

To each their own. For me at least, it was an entertaining read the first time, though I will admit that Harry's lack of character development made it a painful read-through the second time.

It's incomplete, and the plot is actually quite interesting. The author does an interesting job of marrying the two universes. Sadly, the updates are quite sporadic.
