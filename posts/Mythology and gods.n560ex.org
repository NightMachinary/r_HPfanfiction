I'd like to read fanfics where Harry is heavily involved in a mythology (dosent matter if it's norse, greek, Egyptian or any other).


** linkffn(Harry Potter: Minor God by TheWriterOfVoid) is more about Harry dealing with being a god, but actual mythological gods do show up regularly, albeit mostly in minor roles.

  When the post for a minor Godhood fell vacant, it was decided by the council of Gods to hold a lottery to fill the post. As luck would have it, the God of Lottery pronounced the victor to be Harry Potter, an eleven year old wizard. So begins the story of Harry Potter, God of... Glue?

** I don't know how linkffn(Child of the Storm by Nimbus Llewelyn) and its sequel linkffn(Ghosts of the Past by Nimbus Llewelyn) haven't been mentioned yet. They are, in my opinion, the single best crossover fics ever to be written.

  Once, Thor was James Potter, New Mexico being a refinement of Odin's technique (being murdered didn't do Thor's sanity any favours). After a decade, a mostly reformed Loki restores his memories, introducing Thor's son, Harry, to new family and friends. But soon, ancient secrets emerge along with enemies both old and new as darkness rises. Harry is left with a choice: Fight or Die.

  Sequel to Child of the Storm. Harry's life has changed a lot over the past year, what with the return of his father, Thor, murder attempts by everything from HYDRA assassins to Elder Gods keeping him on his toes and making a few new friends. But while Chthon and HYDRA are gone, all sorts of dark things have been stirred up, things thought long gone. And guess who they're after...
