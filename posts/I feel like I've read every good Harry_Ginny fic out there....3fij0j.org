So, I've read most of the major novel length Harry/Ginny fics. Backwards With Purpose/Sword of the Hero, ect. So if any of you guys could recommend me any, I'd be grateful. They don't have to focus completely on romance. I don't mind at all if the romance is a subplot or minorly focused. I just prefer having Ginny be romantic focus, rather than Hermione or anyone else. Thanks!


** You haven't. I have been reading fanfics for years now and I still find one that captures my interests every couple of weeks. There are thousands of them, and many of the obscure ones are the best (I am not really a fan of the stereotypical soulbond!Harry/Ginny).

I am planning to make a masterlist of Harry/Ginny stories soon (I've already got about 45 really good ones, there are still a few on my reading list yet), but till then here are three relatively obscure ones that you might not have come across:

[[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=12260][Curse Breakers: The Maya]] : /Thirty year old Ginny Weasley is the preeminent curse breaker in Central America. Her job allows her to ignore the aftermath of the Second War, but when she is given a new assignment, she finds that the Mayan tombs hold not only the keys to the ancient civilization, but the key to the ghosts that still haunt her and Harry Potter/

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4130255/1/Phantom-Limb][Phantom Limb]] : /A young man realizes he's been the victim of a prophecy. He struggles to make sense of his place in an unfamiliar world. Sound familiar? Nothing's familiar to this young man. Nothing except his aunt Arthur. New readers: give this one some time./

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/637123/1/The-Phoenix-and-the-Serpent][The Phoenix and the Serpent]]: /The Dark Lord has conquered death, but Dumbledore's plan may yet gain a bloodless victory. Joined by a pair of unlikely bodyguards, an aging Auror and a brash Duomancer, Harry must leave behind everything--his friends, his school, even the girl he loves--to find the one thing that may defeat Voldemort. But can even the Boy Who Lived succeed if the journey should take him to the darkest part of his heart?/

** You say you've read most of the major novel length fics so I'm not going to recommend the obvious. However, have you read [[http://www.sugarquill.net/read.php?storyid=619][After the End]]? It's very AU as it was written before OotP but it's probably one of the best fics about the pairing and one of the classics in the HP fandom.

I loved it when I read it because of the excellent writing and adventure/Drama elements, not to mention the wonderful characterization of Draco Malfoy, but I wasn't a fan of the Harry/Ginny romance. Ginny was too OOC. Unavoidable, given that it was a story written pre-OoTP, but it jarred at the worst possible moments.

**** Yeah, that is its main problem. It basically had to invent Ginny considering how much of a non-character she was before the 5th book. It's a fantastic fic though.

** Have you read [[http://www.siye.co.uk/viewstory.php?sid=129747][The Thorny Rose Trilogy]] by Brennus? It's a H/G fic with viewpoint from Ginny. One of the more upbeat stories out there, reads like a train and I'm still not bored of it after reading it thrice. I looked over it because of I didn't know it had multiple stories at first.

*** If you haven't read any of Brennus' stuff give them all a look, he enjoys tackling overdone cliches and giving them a bit of a spin. Slytherin Harry, Never went to Hogwarts adult Harry, Marriage contract, and I believe he's currently working on a super powered Harry story. All his stories are H/G and he doesn't publish stories until he's finished writing them so you don't have to worry about abandoned fics.

Fair warning: It's been awhile since I've read these. I do remember liking them, though. Also, three of them are on Livejournal, which is not the best site for reading fic.
