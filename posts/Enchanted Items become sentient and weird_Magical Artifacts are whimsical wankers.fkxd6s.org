So, we saw in canon that some enchanted items can get weird (Arthur's car) and I saw a fic once that talked about how an enchanted carpet kept scurrying out of the way of children and trying to trip them up because they'd pissed on it too much.

I'd like to see more fics like that, where enchantments and magic make items pseudo-sentient and they have a lot of whimsical qualities. If you've got any fics with just actual sentient items (D&D style - think Lilarcor the talking sword), those'd be cool too please.

As always, all relationships okay, slash or het or femslash or gen, weird stuff accepted, all tropes and cliches welcome. I might ask clarifying questions though, and they might sound critical, but I promise they probably aren't and I really just want to know whatever I'm asking.
