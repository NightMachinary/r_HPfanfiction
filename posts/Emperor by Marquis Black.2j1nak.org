** I'm in the middle of reading this at the moment and I'm really enjoying it. However, it doesn't really feel like a Harry Potter fanfiction. Harry conquering Europe while all the Ministry of Magic, Deatheaters and the OOTP are sidelined in Albion (so far) makes it so completely different from anything I've ever read in the fandom. /Rise of the Wizards/ is the closest, but /Emperor/ beats it hands down.

The author is really good at writing modern warfare scenes and explaining modern military strategy. He seems very knowledgeable and always seems to want to learn more to improve the story. I really like the /Band of Brothers/ feel I get from some of the scenes that feature minor characters in the war.

That said, this story is very long and very complicated. It's definitely not a light read, but if you think you would enjoy an epic war story featuring a muggle educated, very ambitious Harry Potter, then give it a shot.

*** Perfect response, yep :)

I don't really think he was going for the generally light feel of the HP books; you can definitely feel the AUness practically rolling off of it. The whole way he integrates magic into it sort of makes it into an original fic to be honest.

But the whole war and depiction of the country is quite simply put as /epic/. It'd probably be better to approach this intending to read a really good war story rather than a strictly HP fanfic.

** /Summary:/

/Some men live their whole lives at peace and are content. Others are born with an unquenchable fire and change the world forever. Inspired by the rise of Napoleon, Augustus, Nobunaga, and T'sao T'sao. Very AU./

It's probably one of the best AUs I've ever read, and the author has a series - 'Dark Wars' - which follows a war-like line, too. I wanted to see if anyone else had read it because it begins to get very interesting once the civil war (and the following European war) starts!

*** Are the wars concerning the magical community or do they branch out into the muggle world?

**** They branch out, kind of? Well, it'd be safer to say they are primarily set in the Muggle world but wizards are very, very important in the war.

***** Yup, I just read the first paragraph of the prologue and it answered my question. Thanks for the link. :)
