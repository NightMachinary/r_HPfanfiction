Now: Severus can have destroyed the Horcrux, and then been killed (By Voldemort, Death Eaters, Inferi, etc) or he gets there, and isn't able to, before he's killed.

Also note: What if instead of Severus, it was Regulus who had overheard part of the prophecy? What kind of dynamic would it have caused between Regulus and Sirius if Sirius had found out.

Speaking of which: Sirius. Would Sirius still have gone in Azkaban? With a brother who changed sides, he might not be as reckless when he finds James and Lily dead, and he might not go after Peter.

So many different ways this could potentially go. Even if you do things differently then I said.


** Hm, Snape asked Voldemort to spare Lily, what if Regulus asked him to spare James? I mean, there's nothing in canon that would suggest they liked each other, but Regulus had to know how much James meant for Sirius. If James died and Sirius found out it was because of Regulus, he would have never forgiven him, so this could be something he asked for Sirius.

*** I like this interpretation a lot. It'd be cool to see what changes (if any) come from a protection born of a father's love rather than a mother's.

Would probably mean more pureblood tension around the events of that night though, since the one to make the sacrifice was a Pureblood. Might come out as a propaganda point against Muggleborns

**** What I find interesting in this scenario is that James would have died to protect both Harry *and Lily*. Would it mean that Voldemort couldn't kill Lily on that night? Would she become the Woman who Lived? And in canon, Harry has to stay with Dursleys because of the protection, but James didn't have any family left, so what would happen to the protection of James' sacrifice over the years?

** ...Huh.

I imagined that Regulus doesn't care about the Potters so much as he “knows” Sirius will be the Secret Keeper, and doesn't want Sirius to be tortured and/or murdered, so he switches sides to save /Sirius/.

Sirius wasn't going to be the Secret Keeper anyway, but Regulus doesn't know that. Sirius will probably go off after Pettigrew and get locked up, but Regulus, at least, will probably push to get him a trial. [[https://archiveofourown.org/works/23655241/chapters/56780728][Ozymandias]] portrays the ensuing legal battle rather well, if you wanted to crib from that.

The biggest problem is Harry---if Voldemort isn't asked to spare Lily, then he doesn't give her a chance, so she doesn't actually make a sacrifice, so Harry isn't protected and he just dies. You'd have to either come up with a different reason for Voldemort to make that offer or say that Harry was protected by some other means (or just kill Harry and persist in the doomed world you have created).

** Without Snape around to ask Voldemort to spare Lily's life, she wouldn't have been able to sacrifice it to save Harry. So Harry dies and Voldemort wins, or someone else ends up fulfilling the prophecy. Either way, nothing looks anything like canon.

Maybe Regulus could beg Voldemort to let Sirius live if he happens to be there, and he could be the one to give Harry the sacrificial protection. That doesn't really change much though, except that Harry's third year is quiet and he doesn't get depressed at the end of OotP. Unless his parents weren't home when Voldemort came so they survive.

*** If we assume the prophecy manipulates reality to fit itself, voldemort wouldn't be able to kill harry when he's 1 because it wouldn't fulfill the part where voldemort marks harry as his equal.

#+begin_quote
  Regulus agrees to be a spy for the Order of the Phoenix shortly before Voldemort's downfall. Thirteen years later, he's a reluctant potions master under the watchful eye of Albus Dumbledore, just trying to get through his days without cursing the meddling Headmaster. Now Regulus's estranged brother has escaped from Azkaban, and Dumbledore has had the grand idea to invite Sirius's pet werewolf to teach at the school.

** This is a fascinating thought. Would Sirius have trusted his brother when he said he changed sides? Or would he just have thrown him to the side since he was a reminder of the family he hated? How far would Regulus go to make Sirius believe him? I have so many questions!!!! If I thought I could actually make a decent fic I would think of factoring this in somehow.
