I know like technically muggles don't know of wizards and witches cos it's supposed to be kept a secret from them and anyone who knows other than a witch/wizard family will be obliviated. But maybe somehow muggles find out and get scared of them? I just wanna know if there any such fics exist and if they do pls can you provide the link thanks :D


** The second half of this fic deals with the conflict and then war between wizards and muggles

  An intelligent, well-trained Boy Who Lived comes to Hogwarts and Albus Dumbledore is thrown for a loop. Watch as Harry figures out his destiny as a large threat looms over the horizon, unknown to the unsuspecting magical population. Would Harry Potter be willing to take on his role as the Saviour of Magic or would the world burn in his absence? Harry/Daphne. COMPLETE!

** Linkao3(Harry Potter and the Super Bowl Breach)

The world is shocked when the wizarding world is forced to reveal itself. Then chaos ensues. NASA experiments with a Portkey Drive to Mars. The DeLorean corporation somehow gets a supply of time turners. Extremist Christians from the Bible Belt and Al-Qaida Islamists finally agree on something: Death to wizards! Oh, and Voldemort gets his hands on nuclear weapons after taking over North Korea. Not halfway in there are missiles being launched and cities being turned into smoldering craters all over the place.

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter's escape from the dementors at the beginning of Book 5 is recorded on video without the wizards realizing it. The footage spreads beyond the Oblivators' control thanks to the fledgling Internet and TV, and the wizards have no choice but to reveal themselves to the world in the wake of the 1996 Super Bowl. This work is gritty, dark, and realistic, with NO PLOT ARMOR. Think of it as a historical documentary with a lot of scientific backing, not a fanfic. Major characters die, and the reader is introduced to Wizarding communities throughout the world along with the international Wizarding capital of Atlantis. The islands mentioned in Gulliver's Travels are outed as magical safe havens hidden from Muggles, religion is upended when a major Biblical character returns as a ghost, lunar missions and nuclear weapons are delivered by Portkey, a time-traveling DeLorean is created, and werewolves run amok on cruise ships. Is the human race mature enough to be able to wield the power of both magic and technology on a large scale? Or will civilization destroy itself in a ruthless bid for power? Will Voldemort go international, and can Atlantis stop him?

** If you don't mind Methods of Rationality, it has an alternate/spin-off where the Statute of Secrecy breaks down and war ensues, linkffn(Following the Phoenix). But you really need to be familiar with MoR first, which... Some love it, some hate it. It's complex, funny, long, and complete, but Harry is a very different person (for a mixture of in-story reasons) and really rubs a lot of people the wrong way. (Most people agree that the antagonist is excellent, though.)

*** Thanks for the rec! Yeah I've heard how polarizing MoR is and that's what made me hesitant on reading it and I still have not read it. Somehow you mentioning the antagonist is great now has my curiosity piqued (I love a good villain) I'll definitely read it but I don't know when, my fanfic queue seems to be never ending lmaoo

**** Well, I usually recommend the expanded/alternate introduction, which is only four chapters. That's probably enough to judge whether you'll like the whole thing. linkffn(Daystar's Remix of HPMoR).

Pros:

- Complete
- Funny
- Thought-provoking
- Very few typos
- Intelligent protagonist and antagonist
- Mistakes have consequences
- Whenever you see people debate it, which keeps happening, you'll know your own opinion.

Cons:

- Harry is arrogant and condescending to people he doesn't respect (which is most people).
- Several passages are basically author tracts; your mileage may vary depending on whether you find the subject matter interesting.
- Pacing can sometimes be off, better suited to the original serial release than to a complete book.

  "I am not sure there has ever been a time in the whole history of this school when things have become so, so... I don't have a word for this, Harry, because things have never become like this before, and so no one has ever needed to invent a word for it."

  Harry would have tried to invent words to express how deeply complimented he felt, if he hadn't been snerkling too hard to speak.

  Fan edit of the first few chapters of LessWrong's Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality to smooth out tone/characterization, and make it more accessible to those not familiar with Harry Potter canon.

#+begin_quote
  A single-/dual-point-of-departure spinoff from Less Wrong's brilliant story "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", branching away in Chapter 81. Hermione is sent to Azkaban, but Harry is not about to give up. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like his enemy is about to leave things alone either.
