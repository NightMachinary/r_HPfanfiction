so lets say you are writing a fic where a group of Death Eaters or Voldermort fanatics are trying to bring him back after his final defeat

​

how would you do it?

​

Ive been reading fanfic since 2006 and Ive sort of realized i have never read a story where someone is trying to bring him back again. The post Voldermort stories usually use a new villain

​

but you would think he would still have true beleivers who would be awaiting or trying to bring about a third coming.


** I once read a dark!harry/voldemort fic in which voldemort left a vial of his blood at an impuriused muggle's house, there was no connection between them and the muggle was a complete outcast. In this fic Harry had kept the resurrection stone and regularly talked to voldemort and decides to resurrect him (after a lot of things happened). And I do think that voldemort would be the type to have safety nets like that but not necessarily inform anyone about them, leaving them probably useless. He wouldn't want to rely on his death eaters and even though he praises some of them, they will always be inferior to him in any way. Even in goblet of fire, one of the death eaters that is vital to his return, wormtail, is treated with the most scorn of them all. He gives his horcruxes to his followers but he does not tell them anything about them. So yeah Voldemort probably had vials of blood and backup dark rituals laying around but he wouldn't entrust them to anyone.

*** I think thats a good point would someone absolutley petrified of Death not have contingency plans inside of contingency plans

​

I suppose in his head it was

​

"i am the greatest wizard the world has ever seen and I have seven Horcruxes.......what are the odds someone could find and destroy them all? Even if they did find some they wouldnt be able to destroy them all before I can react and move to save the others"

​

but it all spiralled away from him I guess

  After the war, Harry learns there's no such thing as a normal life. At least not for him.

** 1. Maybe voldy left behind a piece of his essense (thats bullshit ik but something like that u get me, not in a TMR diary type of way but just literally a vial of a part of him that can be used to recreate him??) But anyway Im pretty sure all the deatheater were either dead or caught after the final battle right? (Not that it was said but im assuming thats what happened) but ofc groups like that are never truly gone, and sympathizers will exist. Thus id either make it so a sympathizer finds the vial and jumps at the chance to bring him back OR maybe for the beginning of the story, follow a deatheater who was able to escape the final battle without his identity being known and then he ressurects voldy bc he knows ab the vial.
2. Either that^{^} or just go all out and send a death eater back in time to maybe just before the final battle and somehow bring voldy back to present time. This way hed still be in a powerful state unlike the body in GOF, and hed still have basically all memories up until the battle which the death eater could just show his memories of.

**** it wouldnt have to be a group just some loine nutcase

​

I wouldnt count time travel because its not a true return because the Voldermort who is brought through is still alive Im talking reviving him after his death so no time travel just bringing him back from the grave

*** If I did it I would do it like Frankenstein

Crazed lunatic is killing off reformed death eaters as punishment for abandoning the true lord and then using the parts to construct a body out of his betrayers

Then on Halloween when the barrier between life and death is at its weakest perform a spell to punch a hole into limbo and retrieve the withered remant of his soul and place into the new body

** Find and use the Ressurection Stone to be visited by the spirit of Tom Riddle.

Have that spirit murder someone while a follower performs a horcrux ritual.

It would be a challenge for a spectre to murder, but two reasonable ideas are sustained psychological torture, or a voice-activated gun. I'm sure more exist, especially with magic... Sonerus the phantom and have it shout someone to death.

That depends on if the Resurrection Stone actually calls the souls of the departed to it's wielder, rather than just conjuring up ghostly illusions of said departed based on the wielder's memories of them.

**** Yeah, theres a lot in my answer that is speculative at best.

How about: brother wand lock prior incantation on V's wand, so his spirit comes out like the ones from Book4? Unless those were using V's memories... but it's at least an effect some Death Eaters have witnessed.

** Would you actually need Voldemort to be alive? The wizarding world couldn't tell whether he was back for an entire year. Just get all the remaining death eaters together and convince them that Voldemort had another immortality method, you're working on bringing him back but that could take a few years, until then you should continue the reign of terror with a double making public appearances as Voldemort. That way the war continues, the country thinks Voldemort is still alive, the top level death eaters know he's currently not available but think that he'll be back, and you're the only one who knows the truth and you get to rule the country in his place. Bonus: No frequent cruciatus.
