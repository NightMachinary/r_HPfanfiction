80k+ words, preferably no Hermione or Ron. Would be great if it is set after the war where Voldemort won and it's Harry's life or if it's after the war and Harry plays Quidditch professionally etc.

Thanks

  After the war, things didn't go as planned for Harry. He tried to be an Auror, but it wasn't for him. Instead, he turned to Quidditch. Now, at the 2002 World Cup, he looks back on what went wrong and discovers what he always wanted.
