I'm looking for stories where older students (that aren't Fred and George) take a first year Harry under their wing and provide him assistance in getting acclimated to the Wizarding world, preferably older Slytherins that do so to take advantage of his fame/money/poltical power.


** linkao3(no place like home) is similar to what you're looking for. It has Fred and George, but before them it has a few Slytherins and other houses. It's mostly set at Hogwarts so there isn't much taking advantage of fame/money/power. But it was a good read.

  When Petunia Dursley refused to take Harry in she forfeited his birthright protection, so Dumbledore took the baby to the safest place he knew: Hogwarts.The applicable staff (mostly just... not Snape) took Harry in on a rotating schedule as he grew from baby to toddler to child. They traded extra credit for babysitting among the older students, and Harry grew up knowing a few dozen different laps that were safe and warm to nap in.This was a Harry who grew up among books, among old transient walls and learned professors. They gave Binns night duty sometimes, and let him talk young Harry to sleep. This was a Harry whose world changed, on principle, daily. The stairs moved. The walls became doors. You had to keep your eyes open--you had to pay attention. So he did.He grew up in a school. Knowledge was power, but knowledge was also joy. This was his sanctuary. There was magic in his world from birth.

  The Potters had a plan for when the Dark Lord struck on Halloween. It was risky, but it worked. Lily and James Potter both survived the encounter, and their son was now the marked boy who lived. Eleven years later he sets off to Hogwarts with training to change the world. Little does he realize the Dark Lord he thought was gone, would return sooner rather than later. HannahXHarry

  In the books, Harry's been betrayed by his house so many times it's never a surprise. But what if the Gryffindors got their act together after Harry's first year and start acting like a family again? The result is Lion Unity, where wizards and witches all over the world learn not to mess with Harry and his huge family.
