:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
So I read this fic a couple of years back. I remember Harry already won the war against V and he is a powerful person who is Dark. He then decides to either time travel or Dimension travel whereby his body and the body of someone else merges into one. He merges with a Black who is Regulus Black's son? Who studies at Beauxbatons. Then Harry decides to go to Hogwarts where he and TMR are attracted to each other. I think Harry is also something called a Shadow Lord and can control the shadows? It's been a while since I've read the fic so please help!!


** Sounds like /Hollow Thunder, Vital Lightning/, by Aariya07. Looks like it's only on Wattpad now (copied there by a fan, not the author). [[https://www.wattpad.com/743469890-hollow-thunder-vital-lightning-vital-lightning]]
