I think Ask Jily is a wonderful piece of fanfiction. It's mostly art, but it does have some interesting premises and quite funny interactions between the 1978 Hogwart's year.

I was always a fan of it, but what do you guys think? Is it really fanfiction, despite being a fairly limited, let's not kid ourselves, comic?

I think it is. It's as much of a fanfiction as any story set in the late 1970s out there. Funnier too.


** Well... if writing is fanfiction and drawing is fanart...

I think that makes comics fanfart.

** YES! So damn cute! I'm a huge fan of jily in general tbh. I can't get enough of the marauder era fics honestly, but lately it's been so hard to find decent ones I haven't read. Do u have any fave fics?
