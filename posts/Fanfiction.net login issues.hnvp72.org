I wasn't sure where to post this and it might seem off butttt...

I'm a long time lurker of stories on fanfiction.net, specifically HP fanfiction but I never got around to making an account. I wanted to create one so I could favorite all the really good stories I've read recently so I did so tonight. I followed the activation email and it told me to log in but seems to be stuck on the page load. I'm on mobile.

Is anyone else experiencing this issue ? Could it be related to my use of mobile or a new account ? Is it random ? Send help.

Edit : Refreshing the empty white page after logging in and telling recaptcha that I'm pretty sure I'm not a robot seems to tell me it didn't register my recaptcha.


** Yep it's happening with me too.

** It's probably an internet issue on your end, but it's not unknown for ffn to glitch out occasionally. Try logging in again in a few hours/days or on a different device, it'll probably work
