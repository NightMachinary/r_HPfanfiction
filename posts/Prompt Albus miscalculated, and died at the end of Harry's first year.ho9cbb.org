For Reasons (tm), the end of Harry's first year also resulted in the end of Albus Dumbledore's life. By losing him, Hogwarts lost another, special protection which had been preventing the death of students since he had assumed the Headmastery. Myrtle was the last student to lose their life on the grounds of Hogwarts... until Colin Creevey disappeared (was eaten) on 8th November, 1992.

Albus' portrait awoke just in time to inform Headmistress McGonagall of the threat that had already been exploited. He also bemoaned the inevitable loss of Severus Snape as an ally, since he had taken the post of Defence professor.

Of course, Lucius Malfoy was more than happy to keep the school open with only a muggleborn having died.


** But how would he die?

*** Maybe he was allergic to garlic, and Voldemort knowingly defeated him with Quirrels antics

*** Perhaps Quirrelmort was better prepared to face the Headmaster, used Harry as a shield, or poisoned him with a bit of Basilisk venom retrieved from the Chamber. Quirrelmort would be just as capable of accessing the Chamber as a possessed Ginny. There's all sorts of ways the end of the first book could go very badly, and as far as Prophecy is concerned, Albus would save Harry over himself.

** November 1992 is second year so Quirrellmort was most likely defeated (though managed to kill Dumbledore). Colin was therefore most likely eaten by the basilisk (which must be able to adjust its eyes for prey otherwise why didn't it eat any of the petrified children in canon?).

The question is did fawkes remain at the school or did he depart when Dumbledore died. If he departed then how would Harry defeat the Basilisk later on? And would the other professors go around Lucius to the DMLE to inform them of the chambers opening. I would assume so since you had a death and they do not like or respect Lucius.
