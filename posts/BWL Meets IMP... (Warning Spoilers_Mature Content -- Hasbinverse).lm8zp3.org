I've been following this for a while, and while there are a few tropes in there that are just... bad (such as the Dursley Abuse (tm), it's a pretty fun read (if you can ignore the grammar/syntax mistakes). Another cringe-worthy trope is Stolas' attempt of getting Harry to think like using magic = Force, like a Jedi/Sith.

I /love/ the concept, though.

The characters from Helluva Boss are in-character, and Loona becoming an older sibling character to Harry is pretty adorable (especially when they steal from Blitzo's safe to pay for a night of junk food and movies).

Millie and Moxxie's casual approach to giving Harry lethal weapons despite his age is bloody hilarious: "here's a nerf gun so you can get a feel for when we give you a /real/ gun!"

Harry's feigned innocence to troll the adults is quite funny, and Octavia and himself look to be forming a friendship in the background.

It could be better in execution, but the concept/uniqueness of the plot the story-direction is fuckinf hilarious, and they alone merit reasons to check it out.

Anyone else been following it?
