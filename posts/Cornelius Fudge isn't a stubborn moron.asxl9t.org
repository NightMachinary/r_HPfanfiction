Any fics that are 4th book divergent where Cornelius prepares the ministry for Voldemort's return? He doesn't necessarily have to believe that Voldemort is back, but maybe he doesn't subscribe to slandering Dumbledore and Harry in the press. It's just so frustrating to see him act so hard headed( even though that's totally his character) in the face of a possible return to wizard hitler.

It is a short one shot which has exactly what you are looking for.

** I don't know of a story, but I can explain this.

Fudge has to be stupid for the same reason that Disney characters can't have parents. The issues can be simplified very easily. Fudge's uselessness is a plot device to ensure that events would still go to JK's tune without the audience breaking disbelief. Fudge is competent, he prepares for Voldemort's return, he gives the Order of the Pheonix support as they do to the Ministry, previous death eaters are rounded up for questioning or even temporary imprisonment, and Voldemort's final battle is more along the lines of America (Ministry) vs My House (Voldemort) rather than A House (Voldemort) vs a literal school kid.

I won't even go into the injustice proposed by sending people into prison just in case even if the period of time is limited. I can scarcely think of something worse than an innocent man being judged as guilty.

*** Pedantry - It was Fudge's predecessor, Minister Bagnold, who was in charge of the Vold War One trials. Fudge brushed off the mis-trials with an excuse of "the other person was in charge, not my problem bud", but he wasn't personally responsible for it.

**** I have no idea what tangent you're on about. I was in no way talking about before Voldemort's initial demise. Hence why I mentioned Harry Potter who wouldn't have existed in that time period.

Are you saying he wasn't responsible for what happened post-GoF and in OotP? He was the cause for the public denying Voldemort's return even going so far as to start propaganda for the sole purpose of ensuring nobody thought he did.

Fudge was responsible for sending Hagrid to prison "just in case" for the Chamber of Secrets, or needing a scapegoat and using the one person who, by his prior record, was guilty of the same or similar offense. But Fudge wasn't responsible for convicting Sirius Black (the innocent man) and putting him into Azkaban for life after the first war.

****** It's worse than that in Sirius's case, at that. He wasn't even /convicted/, because /he didn't get a trial at all/. Crouch gave the order for him to be sent to Azkaban, and off to Azkaban he went. For twelve years.

******* Imho, I think Fudge could be convinced to let someone like Sirius Black go, if there was reasonable doubt of his guilt, and if there was a chance he'd be offered favors for having pardoned the son of a wealthy and powerful pureblood family. Fudge is a closet supremacist, pocket politician, and cozied up to Lucius Malfoy, a Death Eater who got away with it by claiming Imperius.

It was Crouch Sr, under Bagnold, who put Sirius and a bunch of wealthy purebloods (including his own son) into prison, because he was a hardliner who made no compromises. He was a wealthy pureblood himself and had no reason to share Fudge's materialistic aspirations.

** Linkffn(11946284) While it's not 4th book divergent, it's a story of a competent Fudge who is still self-serving. It's kind of a fix-it fic, but the process of how a Minister of Magic would go about effecting change sounds like what you were hoping to read about, which this fic has aplenty!

** linkffn(13042388)

Third year divergent. Sirius approaches Harry in Surrey and they take his lack of trial to the DMLE. Amelia Bones starts an investigation. Fudge eventually sees pensieve memories of Quirrelmort and the incident in the Chamber of Secrets and has to admit that Voldemort is out there, somewhere.

  What if Sirius Black had been more cautious approaching Harry before 3rd year? How might Harry's life have changed for that one simple divergence in his path? A reimagining of A Witch, A Wizard And A Mechanic. Starts out fairly different but expect similarities. Rated T to start. Additional warnings in first author's note.
