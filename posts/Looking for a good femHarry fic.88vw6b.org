It needs to be written well not too long but not too short and has to have harry going through stuff that girls go through growing up like heartbreak, puberty, ect.

  When Harry wakes up one morning to find himself suddenly transformed into a beautiful girl, all hell breaks loose in Hogwarts. At least Ginny doesn't seem to mind. Harry x Ginny, fem!Harry x Ginny, femslash, gender bender, and much lesbian fun! Hermione x Luna (Moon Sage) established!

  Harry Potter stepped back in time with enough plans to deal with just about everything fate could throw at him. He forgot one problem: He's fate's chewtoy. Mentions of rape, sex, unholy vengeance, and venomous squirrels. Reposted after takedown!

** Girl at War is my fav femHarry. It's quite witty and actually deals with changes in how people would perceive/treat Harry if he were actually a girl. But unfortunately it hasn't been updated in a while. Linkffn(7793520)

  What if Harry Potter had been born Harriet Potter. What if her family knew the future and made plans before their death. How would the story unfold. Warning FemHarry/Ginny FemSlash! Rated M for Scenes of a Sexual Nature.

** Linkffn(the never-ending road) As she grows up harry starts swearing like a rebel teen and reading ridiculous romance novels, has a crush on a teacher(she is horrified). Her friendship with Hermione is written extremely well in my opinion. I think she is the best fem!harry currently on the market, because she is very much like a canon harry, but still undeniably a girl.

I hope another fan of this fic comes along and gives a better review of it, since mine doesn't do it justice.

Edit: sorry, didn't notice that you wanted a shorter fic. I'll leave it here, just in case..

  AU. When Lily died, Snape removed his heart and replaced it with a steel trap. But rescuing her daughter from the Dursleys in the summer of '92 is the first step on a long road to discovering this is less true than he'd thought. A girl!Harry story, covering CoS - GoF. Future Snape/Harriet. Sequel "No Journey's End" (Ootp - DH) is now posting.

** Doesn't really count but Harry Potter and the Mysterious Case of the Girl Who Lived is close. The premise is that while Harry is a boy, he has a curse placed on him that makes magical people perceive him as a girl. It's interesting to see how characters react to him, and the double standard of how he is treated as a girl
