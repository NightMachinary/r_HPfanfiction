I suppose I could split this into two posts, but I doubt I'm going to get enough relevant recs to make that necessary. (famous last words, eh?)

In canon, all we know about either Crabbe or Goyle is that they are Draco's henchmen (with the exception of that one scene in DH). I'd love to see a story that fleshes them out a bit more as characters. Like maybe a story about how they came to join up with Malfoy or a bit more on Crabbe realizing that he could get out from under Malfoy's thumb, etc.

I'd also love to see a Smart! Crabbe or Goyle. Perhaps Smart!Goyle swaps dimensions with Canon!Goyle or through some magical accident, Crabbe becomes really intelligent and realizes he's just a pawn of Malfoy's.

Thanks in advance!


** Yep. linkffn(Harry Potter and the Garden of Intrigue). Which is also a great read.

  In which Harry understands Victorian flower language at age 11. Events grow gradually further and further from the original. Features CharacterDevelopment!Crabbe and Goyle, and many other not-quite-expected variations. This story has reached its conclusion; enjoy. Watch out for the April Fools' chapter.

  Harry Potter was Sorted into Slytherin after a crappy childhood. His brother Jim is believed to be the BWL. Think you know this story? Think again. Year Three (Harry Potter and the Death Eater Menace) starts on 9/1/16. NO romantic pairings prior to Fourth Year. Basically good Dumbledore and Weasleys. Limited bashing (mainly of James).

**** At the end of Philosopher's Stone it's noted Neville scrapes by, and that Goyle, surprisingly, passed too. From this I like to imagine that while not bright Crabbe and Goyle might put in some work behind the scenes (if only to not be a disgrace, and/or due to Snape/fathers pressure).

Of course in canon iirc they fail later, but I think anytime a bit of depth can be added to a character it enriches the story. (big dumb mean Dudley, his gang all "big and stupid", Millicent is a hag, Slytherins look like trolls, big dumb mean Crabbe and Goyle... )

** I read something once that may have been part of a collection of one shots where Crabbe and Goyle spoke really differently when Draco wasn't around. Can't remember where I found it though.

There's also one drabble I remember where Goyle seems to have been frequently beat up by his dad as a kid in coz his dad was jealous that Goyle was smart. Fast forward a few years where Goyle had a kid named Gillian who got into Ravenclaw. Will try to find that collection of dabbles.

Edit: I seem to have mixed stories up in my head. I did find a story that did have a Gillian Goyle in it here, though it's different from the one I had in mind:
