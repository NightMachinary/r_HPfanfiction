** If muggles are the minority, there is no masquerade. Without the wizarding world being a small insular community, the muggles would have been genocided/absorbed/out-bred in antiquity. Squibs, presumably, would still be born sometimes, and might band together for support.

Batshit theory:

This has already happened. The small population of magicals is the remnant of a globe-spanning wizarding civilization which, many millennia ago, encountered the demographic transition. Whatever your preferred theory for the cause of the transition (luxury/decadence/birth control/etc.), it can be implemented with magic just as it can with muggle technology. Without the benefit of magic, the squib enclaves grew to greatly outnumber the sub-replacement-fertility magicals. Their history shrouded in myth, and their memory of it intentionally sabotaged around the time of the adoption of the statute of secrecy, the squibs forgot their origins and became muggles.

Evidence for: The socially-conscious Malfoys, who have one child, sneer at the Weasleys for having 7.

Evidence against: The timescale involved is long enough that magicals would have to be suppressing their fertility for an evolutionarily significant number of generations.

** You'd get My Hero Academia, basically. A society dominated and run by magicals with those few without them viewed as being "disabled."

** I have a little AU where magic isn't so much hidden by the masquerade, but rather "The Muggle World" is a sort preserve for non-magical creatures that wizards have almost complete control over.

I often pair it with some sort of high magic/magi-tech/wakanda wizarding world where magic is used for more than being quaint. Moon bases at the least, because why wouldn't werewolves want to experiment with moon rocks.

*** You got it wrong, I was saying that if everything had started in the Middle Ages, where the Wizards and the Witches were hunted by the Muggles / No-Maj, they would kill only to live, because at that time they were burning them alive.

If a rebellion of wizards had arisen after every human they saw, they could reach modern society as the rulers of the world. They would outnumber the Muggles / No-Maj since guns were not a thing back then, and the quest for non-magical blood would continue to the point where the Muggles / No-Maj would not advance at all in Society as the majority.

The first documented use of guns in Britain is in the 1340s. So definitely in the middle ages.

I agree with your point though, not so much that Muggles stood no chance in an open battle, but it would be ridiculously easy to overthrow a kingdom with a few well-placed imperius curses.

***** True, as the Middle Ages lasted from the 5th century to the 15th century, let's use the date when there are no weapons yet so there will be no problems in the war event.
