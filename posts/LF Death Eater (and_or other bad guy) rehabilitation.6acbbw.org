I'm getting bored of trial scenes where Death Eaters are sent to Azkaban for life or straight to the Veil or whatnot.

Does anyone know any stories where such trials end in 'blah blah blah, life in Azkaban but potential parole after 10, I will recommend the deradicalization program, etc'?


** That should only apply to Death Eaters who hadn't committed murder or torture (at least not willingly).

[[https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6432055/1/Exile][Exile]], linkffn(6432055): As part of his punishment, Draco was not allowed to use a wand for 5 years. When his mother tried to force him to marry an ugly Bulstrode woman, he fled to the Muggle world. I have to say this Draco is very much in character.

  After the war, Draco is saved by his late grandfather's foresight. With his unanswered questions outnumbering the stars in the sky, he struggles to come to terms with reality. Will he fail yet again? Canon compliant. Prequel to my next-generation-series.
