Where Dumbledore gets it in his head to force the power he knows not through playing matchmaker for potential love interests? xD


** I think this prompt would make a fun (crack) fic. I would like it without Manipulative!Dumbledore (no love potions or marriage contracts), but more him rearranging class schedules, group projects, prefect pairings and detentions so that people he thinks would do well together end up in the same circles. I can see him changing the staircases so that people end up together as well. All from a good-natured romantic view, where Dumbledore is just content seeing young love unfold.

** There's an excellent, abandoned story whose name I forget where Dumbledore had spiked baby Harry's bottle milk with love potion to make sure he was brimming with The Power Of Love. The ensuing insane Harry for some reason imprinted on Hermione as his supposedly-ideal love interest and spent the rest of the story being more demented and rose-tinted-glases-y about his fated relationship with Hermione than the very worst of real-life Harmony shippers. The result was not unlike if /Seventh Horcrux/'s Harry fell madly in love.

  In order to increase 'the power the Dark Lord knows not,' Dumbledore gives baby Harry a powerful love potion. This bold move results in...unusual consequences. Witness Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, Boy-Who-Caught-the-Snitch-Two-Times, and Boy-Who-Conquered-Voldemort-But-Did-Not-Kill-Him at his very best...which is considerably less impressive than everyone expects. AU.

** It's a oneshot but he does kinda play matchmaker in *A Fine Spring Day by DarthMittens* linkffn(12583361). Harry takes a walk and learns about love from different people and a conversation with Dumbledore leads to his epiphany.

  On a spring day in his 6th year, Harry watches couples in love stroll around the lake at Hogwarts. Harry wants what they have, so he takes a swig of felix felicis so he can claim Ginny as his own. Felix has something else in store for him, though. One-Shot. H/Hr. Pure fluff.

  Harry discovers a conspiracy at the end of his sixth year. He won't take what he found out lying down. And especially he won't allow for anybody to get his girl and finally make a move. Ideas and manipulations of an old man be damned. Oh, and Voldy also had to go. HP / HG pairing
