I'd like one that has them still in Hogwarts, 8th year included. Something not gimmicky, where they don't just fall in love right away, but it's ok if they have had long hidden feelings.

I've never requested a fic before so I hope that I'm not being to picky. Thanks for the help.


** There might be some 8th Year fics in here, I'm not sure: [[https://www.reddit.com/r/HPSlashFic/comments/c8huop/whats_some_of_the_bestwritten_drarry/]]
