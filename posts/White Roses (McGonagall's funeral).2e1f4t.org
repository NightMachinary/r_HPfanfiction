This is McGonagall's funeral, from Hermione's perspective. Post book 7.

It was strange, being back on the Hogwarts Express after all these years. The chatter of happy school children was gone, replaced with quiet voices and the occasional sob. The train sped on towards Hogwarts, but with a cargo of mourners, instead of students. I shared a compartment with Harry and Ron, and Ginny. The golden trio, coming together one last time, to honour one of the finest fighters in the Second war, and one of the best teachers Hogwarts has ever seen. Minerva McGonagall, who would never give the Start of Term speech again. I wondered what the recent students, the 20 and 30 year olds on the train, thought of her. She was a different woman after the Final Battle. She never let herself get close to anyone. She'd lost her last family that night, and she never wanted a new one. She died young, only 110. A member of the ill-fated attempt to erect a memorial statue to the involuntarily recruited Death Eaters, the ones under the imperius curse, or blackmailed into fighting, she was hit by the curses of a rioting crowd. They didn't kill her, initially, but some of the curses were powerful ones, and she knew she wouldn't live long after. Very few witches would have survived the initial onslaught, but she was no ordinary witch. Everyone knew that. This was no ordinary funeral, either. I thought about what we gave up to be here, to mourn Professor McGonagall with generations of other Hogwarts students. Ginny was supposed to be playing Scotland tonight, the former England team reunited to play Scotland one last time. The game had been cancelled, as almost all of the players had been personally taught by McGonagall. The Ministry continued as usual, but without many of its workers, or its minister. He was supposed to give a speech today, and was probably somewhere on this train. Harry and Ron and I, the Golden Trio, we're supposed to give a speech, to. We had spent hours trying to come up with one, but decided we had a much more fitting last tribute, instead. Ron shifted in his seat, and one of the bundles of roses at our feet leaned into my leg. I had spent last night transfiguring three bouquets of white roses from some sticks in Ginny's garden, and charming them so that when we finished our tribute, they would send a shower of silver sparks above the tomb. The boys had promised to help me, but there I was, doing their homework again. I almost laughed out loud at that. They weren't boys, anymore. I was 64, and they were, too, but they were always the boys. Some things never change.

The train pulled into the station, and we began to exit. I almost expected to hear Hagrids bellow of “First Years! First Years over here!” and see the carriages lined up for us, pulled by the invisible thestrals. I could see them now, I realised. Looking around, I didn't see a single familiar face that couldn't. Everyone had seen some kind of death during the second War. McGonagall had lost more than many of us, fifteen of her fellow Order members, who knows how many current and former students, and Dumbledore. Her last family, in a way. I started to cry. Ron drew me in closer, and held me tight. the Carriages had appeared, and we got in, drawn by magic toward the castle. We arrive, and dismount. Harry, Ron, and I make our way to the front, and Ginny goes to find her seat. Just like Dumbledore's funeral, lots of meaningless words, and long, long, speeches, not one of them touching on what she meant to us. Finally, its our turn. We stand up, and I begin to speak.

“McGonagall taught thousands of young witches and wizards. she fought bravely to defend their home, and hers. She lost more than many of us, in the War, but she never gave up. She knew she was dying for years.” More sobs from the crowd. “But the only one who she ever told is standing here. Or rather, lying. His grave is behind us. They were family, and without them, we could never have defeated Voldemort.”

I raise my wand, send a shower of silver sparks into the air. The boys mirror me, and the crowd joins us. Then my sparks fall back to earth, and form a silver shroud, covering her coffin. Harry turns, and adds a last touch. A tartan cloth drapes the ground around it, and the entire table transfigures into a tall willow, watching over Hogwarts and Dumbledore.

Later that night, we return to her grave, where a thick carpet of snow has formed, and I perform one last piece of transfiguration homework. A wreath of white roses interwoven with tartan ribbon forms, and I place it at the base of her tree. “Goodbye, Professor” I whisper, and turn around before I start crying. Wiping the snow off of my face, I hold tightly onto the boys, and we apparate back to the edge of the grounds, and begin the cold walk back to the great hall.

  and we apparate back to the castle. Not to nitpick, but there's no apparition on school grounds. As this is told by Hermione, she would know, as she nitpicks about it throughout the whole series.

** Since Ginny is still playing Quidditch, are we to believe that McGonagall died <10 years post-DH, in her 70s? That's way lower than her expected lifespan. How did she die?

*** I think I fixed that, now. Thanks for the reminder. The different life spans throw me off sometimes. (:

** This made me feel. I had to break a window after crying. To regain my manliness of course.

** Making white roses shoot sparks would be a charm, not a transfiguration, but that's just a nitpick. To correct it, I would suggest saying she conjured the flowers (and then mention charming them)

Otherwise, this is a great story, I really did enjoy it.
