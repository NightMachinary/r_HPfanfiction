Title says it all, I guess.

I'm really more interested in the dynamic between Harry and Ron than whom they're trying to woo. I'd assume that if an author wrote something like this it will be Hermione, but personally, I don't care.

Given how awful both Harry and Ron were at the whole emotions and feelings thing, I have some fun scenarios in my head. But I A) don't have the time to write it and B) suck at romance - big time.


** Starfox5's linkffn(Divided and Entwined) does that very well.

*** Thanks, I've seen this quite a bit around but never read it. I'll give it a go.

My brain also reminded me of the fact that I seldom like this tag:

#+begin_quote
  <Ron W., Hermione G.>
#+end_quote

But I guess it can't be avoided :D

Anyway, thanks for the rec.

  AU. Fudge doesn't try to ignore Voldemort's return at the end of the 4th Year. Instead, influenced by Malfoy, he tries to appease the Dark Lord. Many think that the rights of the muggleborns are a small price to pay to avoid a bloody war. Hermione Granger and the other muggleborns disagree. Vehemently.
