:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
I'm looking for a scorbus fic I read a long time ago, it was on fanfiction.net It was a while again so I don't remember too much but the general plot was that Albus was popular and scorpius bullied. They slowly become friends but Scorpius diary is read out at the Yule ball, rescaling his crush and causing tension. I also remember Albus gave scorpius a silver chain as a gift later on in the story. I think when the two became a couple they were bullied for it but then things got better. There are a few chapters where they are at the potter house and sharing a room and Harry walks in at the worst times. There is also and explicit scene near the end. I think there both near their final year during this fic, and Albus gets an offer to play for a professional quidditch team. There is a scene we're Albus teaches scorpius how to fly. They also have a hogsMeade encounter in the snow. Sorry this is very vague and ramble-y but any help would be greatly appreciated!!
