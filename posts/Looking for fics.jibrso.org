:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
1) Harry goes through the veil where he ends up in some office in ministry of death but because of a sudden earthquake he gets chucked into another universe with a female Harriet he finds getting abused. He decides to change things by playing as a long forgotten uncle who got sent to the colonies by Harriet's grandparents and only recently learning of his responsibilities. Oh also Vernon gets his balls exploding , there's a bit of Dumbledore and ministry bashing for putting Harriet with the Dursley's but also arresting her for assaulting her uncle.

2) Harry finds Harriet crying in the forest after her name comes out in the goblet of fire. He trains her and also teaches her how to consume souls(mostly Voldemort's) .

3) Auror Harry awakens as a baby again. He removes various hate based charms in the Dursley household placed there by Dumbledore to keep Harry humbled. He goes to ravenclaw and has a relationship with Hermione and tonks(whose age has been made to match theirs) . He also starts a made up organization called GNIC using the Potter house elves and illusions and goes about doing shenanigans like fighting Greyback in the forbidden forest or using the philosophers stone to make gold to use to buy research materials. I'm uncertain if it was completed or not but towards the end where I read Harry becomes a sea snake animagus.


** The Story with GNICC is called Harry Potter and the Children of Change by T.E. Tanglebrooke.
