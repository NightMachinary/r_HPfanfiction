So, I've been reading Harry Potter FanFiction for a while and have decided to finally have a go at it after some... dissatisfaction. I've written for other fandoms before, but didn't have a proofer for it. I'll never forget the day I put 'pooping' instead of 'popping'.

Please, help make sure mistakes like that never see the internet again. I'll post the first 1000 words here so you can get an idea of what my writing style is and general premise for the story. Yeah, I know that's longer than some completed works, so buckle in for the long haul. My main focus is on grammar and spelling, but I'll take constructive criticism too! Thanks in advance!

The gray clouds that covered London and the light rain that came down upon it's streets as uncle Vernon Dursley drove towards their home in Little Whinging seemed to be a reflection of Harry's inner self at the moment. He kept his lethargic stare fixed on the outside world as it slowly passed by, the London traffic not helped by the weather. His uncle, thinking Harry might enjoy some background noise from the car radio, purposefully kept it off; the only sound in the car coming from the pitter-patter of rain, other vehicles driving by, and the occasional yell or honk of an irate person whose mood was no doubt helped along by the miserable weather. Harry wasn't sure if his uncle wasn't speaking to him simply because he hated doing so, or because he had noticed his solemn mood, but was glad that uncle Vernon was ignoring him so diligently.

Harry normally tried to get some sleep on these trips home from King's Cross, but remained awake for the same reason he'd refused to sleep for the past couple of weeks since coming back from the graveyard in Little Hangleton. The dreams he slipped into for the brief moments he lost his vigilance against his tiredness were so vivid that he'd almost convinced himself they were visions and not some product of his own mind. Professor Trelawney would be proud indeed, both of his newfound ability and the disturbing images he always gleaned from it. Harry glanced enviously over at his snowy owl, Hedwig, who didn't seem to be having any issues falling asleep or staying that way, if her tucked head was any indication. After a moment, however, his scowl of jealousy morphed into the closest thing to a smile his face had managed in a week. Harry couldn't stay mad at the one entity that remained with him through thick and thin since coming into the magical world.

Ron and Hermione were great. In fact, Harry could unequivocally call them the best friends he'd ever had. But this year highlighted the fact that they were virtually the only best friends he had. Neville, a boy Harry hadn't though very much of in the past had proved to him how help could come from unexpected places when he'd come through with a solution for the second task the night before it had taken place. What could Harry have done if he was as close a friend to him as Ron and Hermione? Harry suddenly felt uneasy. Thinking of his friends in terms of how useful they were to him... was that something he'd thought of, or was it the influence of the newly reincarnated Voldemort?

He hadn't said anything to any of his professors or the headmaster, their somber attitudes and pitying looks had made Harry wary of approaching them with more possible issues, but ever since his encounter with Voldemort, Harry had felt that his mind wasn't completely his own anymore. When he was the most tired, when his eyelids felt heavier than the foundations of Hogwarts looked, Harry heard whispers. Nothing coherent enough to understand, but they were insistent and constant, following him until he suddenly awoke from one of his nightmarish visions.

Harry shook himself, realizing he'd been slowly drifting off towards sleep again. Hedwig seemed to be alert enough to open her eyes at Harry's sudden spasm, even uncle Vernon noticed the movement enough to glance in his rear view mirror at Harry with critical, squinted eyes.

“What's wrong with you, boy?” his uncle asked, his long mustache shaking with each word spoken like the overgrown tail of some woodland creature. “Pick up the mange at that freak school?”

“No,” Harry said moodily, taking to staring back out the car's backseat window.

“What did you say, boy?!” his uncle demanded, perceiving Harry's current attitude as a slight against him.

Putting up with his aunt, uncle and their whale of son was a full time job for Harry. Literally. He cooked for them, cleaned for them, did their laundry, made sure their garden was the envy of Privet drive. And all he'd been given for his efforts had been a cupboard under their stairs. He now resided in what until a few years prior had been a storage room for Dudley, but was still expected to ‘pull his weight' and do everything he'd been doing since he'd been dropped off on their doorstep like a delivery from the milkman. Harry wasn't sure if it was again the influence of the recently revived Dark Lord or his own personal grievance with his uncle, but suddenly found himself speaking regardless.

“I said drop me off here.” There was a long stretch of silence in the car as the rain outside continued to ping off the car's exterior. Traffic had long ago gotten so bad that there hadn't been any movement for the last minute, and the clouds outside were only getting thicker, darkening the sky so much that street lights were beginning to flicker on despite it only being a few hours past noon.

“What,” Uncle Vernon was so lost in what Harry had just said; he couldn't even manage to make his statement sound like a question. The brat had stopped talking back so long ago that Vernon Dursley had begun to think the freak didn't even remember how. Harry, for his part, was just as surprised as his uncle, but repeated his request, this time with tacked on pleasantries.

“Drop me off here, please, uncle Vernon.” Harry wasn't sure if what he was doing would work. Right now, he was feeling more alive than he'd felt this entire month. In fact, it was beginning to rival his exchange with Voldemort in some ways. His heart was beating erratically, his palms were feeling cold and clammy, and despite his seemingly calm countenance, he was scared that at any moment, his uncle would snap out of his sudden surprised daze and turn around with a sharp smack to remind Harry just how freaky he was. But none of that happened. Almost surreally, uncle Vernon reached down to the trunk release of the car and with a dull click, the back of the car opened.

** Piece of advice number one: more line breaks. You're not /too/ bad compared to some people I've seen, but you could still stand to break some of those paragraphs apart. For one thing, it would instantly make everything less crowded if you followed the simple policy of /always/ having a line break before and after dialogue.

*** So, I should do a new line regardless of whether it was spoken by the same person or not? My current understanding for dialogue in the story is that each new character gets a new line for when they speak which is what I've done so far. Is it supposed to be instead that they get a new line every time they deliver a new sentence that isn't part of the same 'quote'? For example, later on in the story, I've got the following line.

​

“Of course I'm still alive,” Harry shot back. “Why wouldn't I be?”

​

Do I need to write it as:

​

"Of course I'm still alive," Harry shot back.

​

"Why wouldn't I be?"

​

I feel like if I had to write it the second way, there might be some confusion as to who said the line, especially if there are a lot of people talking. I don't want to have to put out of dialogue indicators like, 'Harry said' and such, as I feel that would get repetitive no matter how many synonyms I find for said. But if it's the correct way... well, I guess my comfort comes second to rules of grammar.

**** Oh, no, certainly not. You're quite right /there/. But, for example, you write:

#+begin_quote
  “I said drop me off here.” There was a long stretch of silence in the car as the rain outside continued to ping off the car's exterior. Traffic had long ago gotten so bad that there hadn't been any movement for the last minute, and the clouds outside were only getting thicker, darkening the sky so much that street lights were beginning to flicker on despite it only being a few hours past noon.
#+end_quote

When you really should write:

#+begin_quote
  “I said drop me off there.”

***** Oh, got'cha. Thanks for clearing that up, I'll be sure to go back and put in those breaks then!
