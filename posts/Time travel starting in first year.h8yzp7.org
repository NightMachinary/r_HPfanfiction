So I'm looking for any fic that has hermione (alone or with someone else) traveling back in time to the mauraders era. I really like this ones where there's some sort of ritual or she takes a de aging potion so she starts back in first year. Thanks!

  They thought after Voldemort's fall that the world would get better. But they were wrong. The Death Eaters are still ruling, using politics instead of hexes. With the dwindling Wizarding population and no one left to fight, they must go back in time to before Voldemort rose to power to fix what broke in the past. Nominated for Best James and Best Peter in the 2018 Marauder Medals!

  Hermione Granger decided being propelled through time and space was a lot like being tortured by Bellatrix. She wanted nothing to do with either scenario.Hermione Black knows where her loyalties lie; her timeline may have forgotten her, but she's not yet forgotten it. She's going to change everything.

  James Potter went five years at Hogwarts without realizing Lily had a little sister. Hermione would have preferred if he never realized she existed. Now she's stuck, in Potter's circle of awareness, and maintaining the timeline. Not like he makes it easy, or something.

***** Yesterday is tomorrow. I honestly love those types of stories, where hermione is family with someone from that time period. Like I've read some where she's sisters with lily. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the ones where she's James' sister. I also read a few where she was Sirius' twin and I thought those were great! I'm actually writing one where Hermione does a ritual to go back as James' twin, I'm probably not going to post it but oh well.

Oh wow I just rambled. Sorry...

****** Please post it! We need more fics like that! I like the ones where she's Lily's sister, but usually she's in the background or ignored. I love the dynamic between James and Hermione when they are related. There's one where they're twins and have a great relationship, but I can't remember what fic it is.

Here's a few fics I found that have Hermione integrated into a family.

There's linkffn(Six Pomegranate Seeds) where she is reincarnated as a pureblood orphan and relives her Hogwarts years.

She's a (kind of) a Malfoy in Linkffn(12780890)

She takes a halfblood's place when she travels back in time and becomes a exchange student living with the Malfoys in linkffn(11758961), the end relationship is LMHG

Linkffn(8311387) might be the one where Hermione and James are twins and have a great relationship. I think I read a newer fic with the same dynamic.

You've likely read linkffn(8233539) where Hermione is taken back in time and is adopted by the Blacks.

Edit: added more fics

  Hermione Malfoy is the cherished and sheltered only daughter of Lord Abraxas Malfoy, and lives a peaceful life at the center of her brother Lucius's world. But when, at age six, strange dreams and visions of another life begin to plague the young lady Malfoy, it becomes clear that she is not what she seems-and neither is the world in which she lives.
