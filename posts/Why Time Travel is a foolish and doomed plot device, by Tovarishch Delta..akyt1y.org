  Time Travel can be abused in a way where it becomes a piece of dramatic and overpowered plot armor. The character loses a battle? Time Travel! and boom, the character travels back rectifies it somehow. A problem arises, now. All confrontations now lose meaning, as you can now go back and rectify any issue. This is a very bad thing. Stories are fundamentally made up by confrontations and issues. A story that has no problems to preside against proceeds to become boring very fast, and will be dropped by both reader and writer alike.
#+end_quote

Most half-way decent Time Travel stories feature a one-off time travel exactly for that reason, so this argument doesn't apply. Most other time travel fics, where the time travel is repeated a lot, make the time traveling either involuntary or are not typical Drama fics (more akin to "Back to the Future!" which is a comedy).

#+begin_quote
  A character was pre-destined to use a Time Turner to turn back time, as that's how events had already unfolded.
#+end_quote

It's very common to use a different time travel device in order to allow changes to the past.

#+begin_quote
  "What would've happened if they hadn't used the time turner? how would've events went on?" These questions are not answered by the story.
#+end_quote

Canon time travel as I understand it relies on some type of determinism (feel free to argue what that means about free will at another time). This means Harry and Hermione couldn't have decided against using the time turner, because they already used it and freed Buckbeak and saved Sirius. This is set in stone. You can't not use the time turner if you already used the time turner. I imagine that you either die a horrible death if you try to defy the universe or the universe just implodes.

#+begin_quote
  Gosh, just look at the original works. Can everybody here say that the PoA Time Turner scene was the best writing? It came in very late, as a saving light to rescue Sirius and all that jazz. Fixed everything, yeah? Sounds very plot device-y.
#+end_quote

Can't agree. I really like how the time travel mechanics played out. For many Prisoner of Azkaban was their favorite book and there's a reason why so many time travel stories exist in HP. Clearly yours isn't the popular opinion.

#+begin_quote
  Their paradoxical use is a bunch of fuckery that YOU, as a successful writer, shouldn't touch. Okay that's one down.
#+end_quote

It's actually one of the least paradoxical ways to write time travel.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novikov_self-consistency_principle]]

#+begin_quote
  Time Travel alters timelines both subtly and drastically. It's called the Butterfly Effect, lads, and it's there to FUCK your character UP!
#+end_quote

While interesting, this introduces a billion Paradoxes and is only really workable if you subscribe to some kind of multiverse / parallel universes theory.

#+begin_quote
  Try not to make Time Travel a main theme, as you'll quickly find yourself in a deepening hole.
#+end_quote

I disagree. If your story has time travel you better make it your main theme. Time travel is much too fundamental and reality breaking to just have it as a casual add-on (unless you're doing the one-off time travel thing as a setup, but then, who cares about the mechanics anyway? It's just a plot device)

#+begin_quote
  IF you want good story, a fundamental rule is to bring about NEW IDEAS, this is very important for Fanfiction, I'm sure you can see why.
#+end_quote

That I can agree with. Using time travel as an excuse to rehash canon is a bad idea.

*** *Novikov self-consistency principle*

The Novikov self-consistency principle, also known as the Novikov self-consistency conjecture and Larry Niven's law of conservation of history, is a principle developed by Russian physicist Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov in the mid-1980s. Novikov intended it to solve the problem of paradoxes in time travel, which is theoretically permitted in certain solutions of general relativity that contain what are known as closed timelike curves. The principle asserts that if an event exists that would cause a paradox or any "change" to the past whatsoever, then the probability of that event is zero. It would thus be impossible to create time paradoxes.

*** I mean I enjoy PoA very much as a book and movie. It's just I never really enjoyed the time travel part and how it was implemented. As a saving device, at the last minute. You could remove Time Turners from PoA, and I feel the story wouldn't shift much. They'd find a way to save Sirius, for sure (It's J K R after all) and Hermione could just drop a couple classes. It's why i feel time turners are just really shitty. Oh boy, don't even get my started on Cursed Child, lol.

** I agree that Time Turners are used a convenient plot device, but I hardly see any fics use it for Fix-It plots, or in such a way where it destabilises the universe and removes all dramatic tension from a story... probably because most authors don't focus on the paradoxical, existential, or closed time loop aspects of it. Even the fics like linkffn(6728900) where there is A LOT of time travel involved, don't go into the "you time traveled here so must set up the time travel in the future".

I see it as a contrived way to explore certain scenarios that /wouldn't/ be possible without time travel, and not a story-breaking plot device. In most fics where, for instance, Regulus tries to go back and save the Black Family from dying out, time travel is only used to set the premise up, and doesn't interfere or appear as a major aspect of the actual plot. But the main point is that any trope or tool used with care and deliberation can be pulled off in a serious story. And anything goes for comedic/crack fics.

** Your take on time travel is so basic it's ridiculous.

#+begin_quote
  "Hey guys! Heeeey!"

  "What."

  "Did you know that time travel, unless used properly, can dramatically lower the stakes in a conflict?"

  "Yes. We are writers of fiction, of course we knew that."

  "Hey. Heeeey."

  "What."

  "Did you know Time Turners can cause temporal paradoxes?"

  "Yes."

  "Ah, but have you heard of the Butterfly effect? You're not even professional writers! You're, in fact, shit at writing! So how can you write good time travel if you don't know about the Butterfly effect and you're shit at writing?"

  "We know about it. Everyone over the age of 8 does. We aren't shit at writing, now kindly stop with the insults."

  "No no no, you clearly are. I've watched some anime, I should know better. Now let me, a person who can't string together a coherent Reddit post, teach you all about writing!"
#+end_quote

So you've read a couple pages on Wikipedia and decided to unload your newfound wisdom onto us, packaging it as though it is some kind of arcane knowledge (and not the most basic, barely-informed take on the topic), interspersing it with insults to this entire community, its ability to write, and massively illiterate bits of Russian profanity.

** I'd argue that a completely one-sided fix-it is highly enjoyable to read. What a lot of writers faol to understand that creating additional hurdles often drags that kind of story down. We are here to watch Harry kick arse and crew bubblegum. He has just been through a war, he knows exactly how to resolve everything and no one knows.

Like, Harry gets dropped back to the day his name comes out of the Goblet of fire. The tasks will not be a challenge. The bit of teenage drama around the Yule Ball will feel rather irrelevant since he has a few more years of experience to lean on. And if nothing else, he can either go with Hermione as friends or take Parvati again without pining after Cho, dance for a few hours and call it a day. Track down the Horcruxes. Tonks can be drafted into getting Bellatrix one or use the infallible invisibility cloak and the imperius. Let the Graveyard plot play out as it did in canon and use it to get hold of Voldemort, Nagini and Pettigrew. Bam, the whole series resolved in 30k words or less. End it with Fleur riding (with) Harry into the sunset or something like that.

*** Sorry, but I disagree completely. A fic where everything goes the main character's way, the main character is always right, and the main characters makes everything better for everyone (except the characters the author doesn't like) with no problems whatsoever is BORING AS FUCK to read. You'd need to be an INSANELY GOOD writer to make this even remotely interesting. And, let's be clear: Most fanfic writers aren't insanely good.

There's nothing wrong with the main character being competent and clever, but if he breezes through everything, and nobody ever manages to do anything to challenge him, then that's just a blatant power fantasy. Maybe it's just cause I've never been a teenage boy, but teenage boy power fantasies bore me immensely. ^{_^}

Even Torture porn can be very entertaining to read. Just look at Snape's treatment in Larceny, Lechery and Luna Lovegood. He gets utterly abused and yet it is highly humorous and entertaining to read about him getting a hot sauce enema or electric shock therapy. Or how Ron uses a family spell to have an entire Death Eater Squad buggered by the dragon they were trying to harvest into potion ingridients. The point is that you don't take that such stories too seriously. You read them to be entertained, not to find canon 2.0 or even just worthwile additions to it.
