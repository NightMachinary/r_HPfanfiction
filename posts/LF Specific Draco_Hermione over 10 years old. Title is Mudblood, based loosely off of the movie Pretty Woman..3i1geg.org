I cannot find it anywhere! I've internet searched, checked LJ... ugh. I'm positive it exists, I read it many years ago on a .doc file that I downloaded from who knows where. It was VERY popular at one time. The title was M U D B L O O D, all caps, spaced out like that.

I'm pretty sure the writing was rough, it wasn't even that great of a story... but I want to reread it anyways. Hopefully someone can help me out! x


** Ah!!! I found it myself. If anyone is interested it was actually called PUREBLOOD by w e v v l e s. I found a download link on some 10 year old site.

Anywhos, I don't know how to mark as 'complete', if that's even a thing here.

Edit: Its [[http://dhr.avada-kedavra.net/][here]]. Ctrl+F 'pureblood'. It will download a zip file when you click the author's name, just fyi.
