  The escape of Peter Pettigrew and Harry's inherent nobility leave a deeper mark on his character than anyone expected, then comes the Goblet of Fire and the chance of a quiet year to improve himself, but Harry Potter and the Quiet Revision Year was never going to last long. A more mature Harry bearing more effects of 11 years of virtual solitude. GoF AU. There will be romance...

** There are loads. Some of my favourites are:

linkffn(Control by Anonymous58) (This is unfinished, but still good. linkffn(The Denarian Renegade) linkffn(Too Young to Die by thebombhasbeenplanted) linkffn(Enveloped in the Darkness) linkffn(Hit The Ground Running) linkffn(The Birth of Evil)

None of them are your specified pairings, but I don't really care for romance.

  I'm sick of the manipulation, the lies and the deceit; sick of jumping to the tune of dark lords and old puppeteers. I'm cutting the strings. Innocents will pay in blood for my defiance, but I no longer care. I lost my innocence long ago. Dark!Harry

#+begin_quote
  Harry Potter knew quite a deal about fairness and unfairness, or so he had thought after living locked up all his life in the Potter household, ignored by his parents to the benefit of his brother - the boy who lived. But unfairness took a whole different dimension when his sister Natasha Potter died. That simply wouldn't do.
