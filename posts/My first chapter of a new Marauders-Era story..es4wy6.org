** Okay, got to it this morning and here are my overall thoughts:

- The way you showed all of the major characters getting their letters and the different experiences they had is really effective. I was disappointed that Peter was glossed over so much as I personally find him to be a very interesting character and likely to have one of the more interesting journeys through school.
- I have personal disagreements about how some of the characters are portrayed but to each their own, we all see them differently. They are different enough, for me, that I probably wouldn't continue past a handful of chapters unless I saw change or growth in them quickly, though.
- Make sure your locations and times of day are consistent through each character's little section of the story; there were (potential) continuity problems for me with how ashy and gross Spinner's End was in comparison to Lily's street and in comparison to canon; and also there is an apparent error in timeline in Remus's section.

I'll DM you more specifics so it doesn't spoil the chapter for others who might read and comment.

Overall I thought it was an interesting start and would give chapter 2 a shot.

** Since you asked for criticism, here's mine. It seemed like a lot of words in which not much of interest happened. We already know that these characters got their letters pretty much like this. The only real surprise is Remus. I'd cut everything except Remus's section, in order to more quickly get to whatever plot you're planning.

*** I get your point, but like, you could say that to the extent of anything: "We already know how it will end and that Lily and James die so theres no point to write it", and at least for me and this fic, the starting chapter is meant to set up what the situations the characters are in, etc.

**** I'm not opposed to canon-compliant fics, but I like them to fill in the interesting details, not the obvious ones. We know the Marauders were pranksters, but what pranks did they pull, exactly? There's lots of room for creativity there, with different writers coming up with all sorts of different pranks. There's basically only one canon-compliant way for these characters to get their letters, though.

***** True, I guess it really comes down to the details that get set up, the sorts of details that woul vary from story like where the characters are at in their headspace/relationships sort of thing. (Which Im not claiming I did perfectly, this what I sent in is only my second re-draft, that's why I'm asking for advice on it.)

** I enjoyed it & would read along as you write it as marauder era is my favourite.

My first constructive criticism comes as a Brit - there are a lot of americanisms that are quite jarring and break the immersion for me.

Also my view on how the blacks would respond is different to yours; I doubt they'd acknowledge it at all, I don't think they would assume for one second Sirius would ever not be accepted as the heir to the house. Pride and arrogance being their defining characteristics.

What are your plans for Peters character arc? I've seen a lot of good fics treat his journey poorly because of his ending. Can see it starting here, every other character gets 2-3 paragraphs of back story and world building, he barely gets a mention. I would expand on him & try and treat him fairly.

Keep going!

*** For the Americanism, that wasn't something I could do much about, I learned English in the US and so a lot of the British language in the writing would be lost on me. I'd gladly go through it to britinize if though.

Could you just expand on this point a bit? ‚ÄúThe Blacks would respond‚Äù to the letter? Or the comic book thing?

As for Peter, I actually agree with you on the fact that most writers don't treat him well, and it annoys me to no extent when a fanfic starts off with ‚Äúpettigrew was on vacation and nobody gave a damn‚Äù. I guess my idea of making his part short was meant to show how dull his life was or how nothing happened to him that would seem for him important, Not out of dislike for his character. I totally see your point on this, however, and definitely will add more to his part.

Thank you for reading, and for the advice.

**** Not a problem :) britpicking is only a minor detail. Mum instead of Mom, we wouldn't eat waffles for breakfast etc. The writing structure itself is great.

With the Blacks - I meant the Hogwarts letter, I can see the comic part happening. I can't see walburga smiling and doing a special dinner for the occasion; they believe they are perfect and the elite, and Sirius getting into Hogwarts would be the minimum requirement, it's almost a given that the he would be going. Hes the pureblood Scion of the house of Black, not a squib, Muggleborn etc. I think the pettigrew/black response to the letter could be switched and work here if that makes sense?

***** I can see the point about the Blacks, but on the other hand of that argument, the pride and arrogance you mentioned could work the other way around, how I saw it. To them, Sirius is the heir of their great pureblood family, all that jazz. Maybe they wouldn't have a warm family dinner, but I feel like the Blacks would still do something for the fact that it's their firstborn son's acceptance to Hogwarts, even if it obviously wouldn't be the surprise or happiness that a muggleborn would get. Also a point for my story is showing how Sirius's relationship with his family degraded over time, so it would need to start out with relations being good (as good as it can be for that family, obviously.) as opposed to him being cruciatused every day from the age of 8 as some stories seem to see it.

**** For getting your idea across, if you have him do dull things and use dull descriptions compared to the rest of the cast, most readers will notice and see what you're doing. If you don't write anything then the reader has no way of knowing if there isn't much going on in Peter's life or if there's not much going on in the writer's head about Peter.
