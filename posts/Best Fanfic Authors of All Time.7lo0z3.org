** Steelbadger, Shezza, nonjon, Brennus, TheEndless7, DobbyElfLord, Jeconais and The Santi. They have all written more than a few stories that I found greatly enjoyable. I'd also hesitantly include Newcomb and Marquis Black, despite them not having many great stories to their name. What You Leave Behind and Emperor are some of my favorite fanfictions.

*** The Santi? By what metric? He's got one unfinished vampire!Harry fic that went nowhere, a dark lord!Harry fic that's quite bad, and a twin fic that is a thinly veiled powerwank/training montage where the author wrote himself into a corner at the beginning of year 4 and couldn't get himself out of when he tried to be too fancy. The last part is the amazing part, since the dude had like 6 betas helping him. But it's got an interesting OC, right?

**** I'll be honest I only included him for the obvious fic. Not claiming it's perfect by any means, but it's one of the few stories that captivated me from beginning to abandoned. The world building surrounding Durmstrang was particularly enjoyable. I admit it was one of the first fics I read, so my opinion on the story may be a tad immature. I should probably give it another read at some point.

You're right though - according to the OP he shouldn't be listed as he only had one noteworthy story.

**** Well I guess that's a little subjective. Been around since 2009 in any case. I don't see where you get your doesn't-do-enough Harry from DobbyElfLord. He did lots of ruthless stuff in Altered Destinies' war. I read Santi's fic a year or two after I got into fanfictions, still young and hadn't really looked at a whole lot of fics yet. Haven't read it since, so I guess the magic sortof stuck with me.

****** Sort of like me then. I don't really remember much of it honestly. I just recall the happy feeling that it brought me at the time, which is what I looked for in fics when I was younger. It was my escape, like I imagine it was for quite a few others around these parts.

*** My own list would include several fellow AFC writers and some fanficauthors.net writers (though the bobmins blocked my membership back in the day) and will no doubt offend several friends:

Jbern and nonjon, for sure; also, BajaB for the short fic brilliance. Jeconais and S'TarKan. joe6991. Deadwoodpecker was awesome when she still wrote. Taure and DobbyElfLord are both great in their own way. To round out my list of ten, Inverarity.

Honorable mention to Arsinoe de Blassenville, enembee, the late Larry Huss, Voice of the Nephillim, and TheEndless7. I'm missing a billion, no doubt, but this is my top-of-mind.
