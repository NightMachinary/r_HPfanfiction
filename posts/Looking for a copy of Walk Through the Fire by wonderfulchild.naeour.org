:FlairText: What's That Fic?
:END:
As the title says I am looking for a copy of Walk Through the Fire by wonderfulchild. The author also went by wonderfulwrites. It looks like it was deleted from Ashwinder/sycophanthex and the On-line Wizard Library no longer exists. The story was written and eventually abandoned in 2008. Any help would be great appreciated.


** Try Enchanting the Bookworm or Room of Lost Fanfics. They're both groups on FB, and amazing at finding lost stories. EtB is for any Hermione-centric story, and RoLF is any HP fic.
